      <title>Full extremal process in four-dimensional membrane model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the extremal process of four-dimensional membrane models as the size of the lattice $N$ tends to infinity. We prove the cluster-like geometry of the extreme points and the existence as well as the uniqueness of the extremal process. The extremal process is characterized by a distributional invariance property and a Poisson structure with explicit formulas. Our approach follows the same philosophy as the two-dimensional Gaussian free field (2D GFF) via the comparison with the modified branching random walk. The proofs leverage the ``Dysonization'' technique and a careful treatment of the correlation structure, which is more intricate than the 2D GFF case. As a by-product, we also obtain a simpler proof of a crucial sprinkling lemma.</description>

      <title>Population dynamics under random switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Populations interact non-linearly and are influenced by environmental fluctuations. In order to have realistic mathematical models, one needs to take into account that the environmental fluctuations are inherently stochastic. Often, environmental stochasticity is modeled by systems of stochastic differential equations. However, this type of stochasticity is not always the best suited for ecological modeling. Instead, biological systems can be modeled using piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMP). For a PDMP the process follows the flow of a system of ordinary differential equations for a random time, after which the environment switches to a different state, where the dynamics is given by a different system of differential equations. Then this is repeated. The current paper is devoted to the study of the dynamics of $n$ populations described by $n$-dimensional Kolmogorov PDMP. We provide sharp conditions for persistence and extinction, based on the invasion rates (Lyapunov exponents) of the ergodic probability measures supported on the boundary of the positive orthant. In order to showcase the applicability of our results, we apply the theory in some interesting ecological examples.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of Non-Mean-Field Random Matrices in Dimensions $d\ge 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider an $N \times N$ random band matrix $H = \left(H_{xy}\right)$ with mean-zero complex Gaussian entries, where $x, y$ lie on the discrete torus $(\mathbb{Z} / \sqrt[d]{N} \mathbb{Z})^d$ in dimensions $d \ge 3$. The variance profile $\mathbb{E}\left|H_{xy}\right|^2 = S_{xy}$ vanishes when the distance between $x$ and $y$ exceeds a given bandwidth parameter $W$. We prove that if the bandwidth satisfies $W \geq N^{\mathfrak{c}}$ for some constant $\mathfrak{c} &gt; 0$, then in the large $N$ limit, both the delocalization of bulk eigenvectors and a local semicircle law down to optimal spectral scales $\eta \ge N^{-1+\varepsilon}$ hold with high probability. Our proof is based on the primitive approximation of the loop hierarchy (arXiv:2501.01718), and builds upon methods which were developed in this series since 2021 (arXiv:1807.02447, arXiv:2104.12048, arXiv:2107.05795, arXiv:2412.15207, arXiv:2501.01718, arXiv:2503.07606).</description>

      <title>Non-existence of several random fractals in the Brownian motion and the Brownian loop soup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified approach to establish the non-existence of three types of random fractals: (1) the pioneer triple points of the planar Brownian motion, answering an open question in [7], (2) the pioneer double cut points of the planar and three-dimensional Brownian motions, and (3) the double points on the boundaries of the clusters of the planar Brownian loop soup at the critical intensity, answering an open question in [39]. These fractals have the common feature that they are associated with an intersection or disconnection exponent which yields a Hausdorff dimension ``exactly zero''.</description>

      <title>A Theory of $\theta$-Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical theory of stochastic calculus under ambiguity, founded on sub-additivity, is insensitive to non-convex uncertainty structures, leading to an identifiability impasse. This paper develops a mathematical framework for an identifiable calculus sensitive to non-convex geometry. We introduce the $\theta$-BSDE, a class of backward stochastic differential equations where the driver is determined by a pointwise maximization over a primitive, possibly non-convex, uncertainty set. The system's tractability is predicated not on convexity, but on a global analytic hypothesis: the existence of a unique and globally Lipschitz maximizer map for the driver function. Under this hypothesis, which carves out a tractable class of models, we establish well-posedness via a fixed-point argument. For a distinct, geometrically regular class of models, we prove a result of independent interest: under non-degeneracy conditions from Malliavin calculus, the maximizer is unique along any solution path, ensuring the model's internal consistency. We clarify the fundamental logical gap between this pathwise property and the global regularity required by our existence proof. The resulting valuation operator defines a dynamically consistent expectation, and we establish its connection to fully nonlinear PDEs via a Feynman-Kac formula.</description>

      <title>Quantitative gap universality for Wigner matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the explicit rate of convergence $N^{-1/2 + \epsilon}$ for the gaps of generalized Wigner matrices in the bulk of the spectrum, for distributions of matrix entries possibly atomic and supported on enough points. The proof proceeds by a Green function comparison, coupled with the relaxation estimate from [5]. In particular, we extend the 4 moment matching method [33] to arbitrary moments, allowing to compare resolvents down to the submicroscopic scale $N^{-3/2 + \epsilon}$. This method also gives universality of the smallest gaps between eigenvalues for the Hermitian symmetry class, providing a universal, optimal separation of eigenvalues for discrete random matrices with entries supported on $\Omega(1)$ points.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for the Swendsen-Wang dynamics on the complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the speed of convergence of the Swendsen-Wang (SW) dynamics for the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model on the $n$-vertex complete graph, known as the mean-field model. The SW dynamics was introduced as an attractive alternative to the local Glauber dynamics, often offering faster convergence rates to stationarity in a variety of settings. A series of works have characterized the asymptotic behavior of the speed of convergence of the mean-field SW dynamics for all $q \ge 2$ and all values of the inverse temperature parameter $\beta &gt; 0$. In particular, it is known that when $\beta &gt; q$ the mixing time of the SW dynamics is $\Theta(\log n)$. We strengthen this result by showing that for all $\beta &gt; q$, there exists a constant $c(\beta,q) &gt; 0$ such that the mixing time of the SW dynamics is $c(\beta,q) \log n + \Theta(1)$. This implies that the mean-field SW dynamics exhibits the cutoff phenomenon in this temperature regime, demonstrating that this Markov chain undergoes a sharp transition from ''far from stationarity'' to ''well-mixed'' within a narrow $\Theta(1)$ time window. The presence of cutoff is algorithmically significant, as simulating the chain for fewer steps than its mixing time could lead to highly biased samples.</description>

      <title>On the multipoint distribution formulas of the parabolic Airy process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parabolic Airy process is the Airy$_2$ process minus a parabola, initially defined by its finite-dimensional distributions, which are given by a Fredholm determinant formula with the extended Airy kernel. This process is also the one-time spatial marginal of the KPZ fixed point with the narrow wedge initial condition. There are two formulas for the space-time multipoint distribution of the KPZ fixed point with the narrow wedge initial condition obtained by arXiv:1906.01053 and arXiv:1907.09876. Especially, the equal-time case of arXiv:1907.09876 gives a different formula of the multipoint distribution of the parabolic Airy process. In this paper, we present a direct proof that this formula matches the one with the extended Airy kernel. Some byproducts in the proof include several new formulas for the parabolic Airy process, and a generalization of the Andreief's identity.</description>

      <title>Additive subordination of multiparameter Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider, in a general setting, multiparameter multidimensional Markov processes that are time-changed by an independent additive subordinator. By extending Phillips theorem, we show that the resulting process is a Feller evolution and we characterize its generator. We further derive its pseudo-differential representation and show that its symbol admits a L\'evy-Khintchine representation. In the specific case of multiparameter Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, we obtain explicit expression of the symbol, along with the associated characteristic L\'evy triplet. As an application, we consider a factor-based specification for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process subordinated by a Sato process. The constructive nature of this process is inspired by applications in finance.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a dimension-free Bernstein-type tail inequality for self-normalised martingales normalised by their predictable quadratic variation. As applications of our result, we propose solutions to the recent open problems posed by Mussi et al. (2024), providing computationally efficient confidence sequences for logistic regression with adaptively chosen RKHS-valued covariates, and establishing instance-adaptive regret bounds in the corresponding kernelised bandit setting.</description>

      <title>Distributions of consecutive level spacings of circular unitary ensemble and their ratio: finite-size corrections and Riemann $\zeta$ zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the joint distribution of two consecutive eigenphase spacings and their ratio for Haar-distributed $\mathrm{U}(N)$ matrices (the circular unitary ensemble) using our framework for J\'{a}nossy densities in random matrix theory, formulated via the Tracy-Widom system of nonlinear PDEs. Our result shows that the leading finite-$N$ correction in the gap-ratio distribution relative to the universal sine-kernel limit is of $\mathcal{O}(N^{-4})$, reflecting a nontrivial cancellation of the $\mathcal{O}(N^{-2})$ part present in the joint distributions of consecutive spacings. This finding suggests the potential to extract subtle finite-size corrections from the energy spectra of quantum-chaotic systems and explains why the deviation of the gap-ratio distribution of the Riemann zeta zeros $\{1/2+i\gamma_n\}, \gamma_n\approx T\gg1$ from the sine-kernel prediction scales as $\left(\log(T/2\pi)\right)^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Posterior bounds on divergence time of two sequences under dependent-site evolutionary models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let x and y be two length n DNA sequences, and suppose we would like to estimate the divergence time T. A well known simple but crude estimate of T is p := d(x,y)/n, the fraction of mutated sites (the p-distance). We establish a posterior concentration bound on T, showing that the posterior distribution of T concentrates within a logarithmic factor of p when d(x,y)log(n)/n = o(1). Our bounds hold under a large class of evolutionary models, including many standard models that incorporate site dependence. As a special case, we show that T exceeds p with vanishingly small posterior probability as n increases under models with constant mutation rates, complementing the result of Mihaescu and Steel (Appl Math Lett 23(9):975--979, 2010). Our approach is based on bounding sequence transition probabilities in various convergence regimes of the underlying evolutionary process. Our result may be useful for improving the efficiency of iterative optimization and sampling schemes for estimating divergence times in phylogenetic inference.</description>

      <title>Optimal mean-variance portfolio selection under regime-switching-induced stock price shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate mean-variance (MV) portfolio selection problems with jumps in a regime-switching financial model. The novelty of our approach lies in allowing not only the market parameters -- such as the interest rate, appreciation rate, volatility, and jump intensity -- to depend on the market regime, but also in permitting stock prices to experience jumps when the market regime switches, in addition to the usual micro-level jumps. This modeling choice is motivated by empirical observations that stock prices often exhibit sharp declines when the market shifts from a ``bullish'' to a ``bearish'' regime, and vice versa. By employing the completion-of-squares technique, we derive the optimal portfolio strategy and the efficient frontier, both of which are characterized by three systems of multi-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Among these, two systems are linear, while the first one is an $\ell$-dimensional, fully coupled, and highly nonlinear Riccati equation. In the absence of regime-switching-induced stock price shocks, these systems reduce to simple linear ODEs. Thus, the introduction of regime-switching-induced stock price shocks adds significant complexity and challenges to our model. Additionally, we explore the MV problem under a no-shorting constraint. In this case, the corresponding Riccati equation becomes a $2\ell$-dimensional, fully coupled, nonlinear ODE, for which we establish solvability. The solution is then used to explicitly express the optimal portfolio and the efficient frontier.</description>

      <title>Sparse Regression Codes for Secret Key Agreement: Achieving Strong Secrecy and Near-Optimal Rates for Gaussian Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Secret key agreement from correlated physical layer observations is a cornerstone of information-theoretic security. This paper proposes and rigorously analyzes a complete, constructive protocol for secret key agreement from Gaussian sources using Sparse Regression Codes (SPARCs). Our protocol systematically leverages the known optimality of SPARCs for both rate-distortion and Wyner-Ziv (WZ) coding, facilitated by their inherent nested structure. The primary contribution of this work is a comprehensive end-to-end analysis demonstrating that the proposed scheme achieves near-optimal secret key rates with strong secrecy guarantees, as quantified by a vanishing variational distance. We explicitly characterize the gap to the optimal rate, revealing a fundamental trade-off between the key rate and the required public communication overhead, which is governed by a tunable quantization parameter. Furthermore, we uncover a non-trivial constrained optimization for this parameter, showing that practical constraints on the SPARC code parameters induce a peak in the achievable secret key rate. This work establishes SPARCs as a viable and theoretically sound framework for secure key generation, providing a compelling low-complexity alternative to existing schemes and offering new insights into the practical design of such protocols.</description>

      <title>On Certificates for Almost Sure Reachability in Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Almost sure reachability refers to the property of a stochastic system whereby, from any initial condition, the system state reaches a given target set with probability one. In this paper, we study the problem of certifying almost sure reachability in discrete-time stochastic systems using drift and variant conditions. While these conditions are both necessary and sufficient in theory, computational approaches often rely on restricting the search to fixed templates, such as polynomial or quadratic functions. We show that this restriction compromises completeness: there exists a polynomial system for which a given target set is almost surely reachable but admits no polynomial certificate, and a linear system for which a neighborhood of the origin is almost surely reachable but admits no quadratic certificate. We then provide a complete characterization of reachability certificates for linear systems with additive noise. Our analysis yields conditions on the system matrices under which valid certificates exist, and shows how the structure and dimension of the system determine the need for non-quadratic templates. Our results generalize the classical random walk behavior to a broader class of stochastic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Random measurements are almost maximally incompatible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the incompatibility of random quantum measurements. Most previous work has focused on characterizing the maximal amount of white noise that any fixed number of incompatible measurements with a fixed number of outcomes in a fixed dimension can tolerate before becoming compatible. This can be used to quantify the maximal amount of incompatibility available in such systems. The present article investigates the incompatibility of several classes of random measurements, i.e., the generic amount of incompatibility available. In particular, we show that for an appropriate choice of parameters, both random dichotomic projective measurements and random basis measurements are close to being maximally incompatible. We use the technique of incompatibility witnesses to certify incompatibility and combine it with tools from random matrices and free probability.</description>

      <title>Potential Theory and the Boundary of Combinatorial Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a finite, connected graph. We investigate a notion of boundary $\partial G \subseteq V$ and argue that it is well behaved from the point of view of potential theory. This is done by proving a number of discrete analogous of classical results for compact domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. These include (1) an analogue of P\'olya's result that a random walk in $\Omega$ typically hits the boundary $\partial \Omega$ within $\lesssim \mbox{diam}(\Omega)^2$ units of time, (2) an analogue of the Faber-Krahn inequality, (3) an analogue of the Hardy inequality, (4) an analogue of the Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci estimate, (5) a stability estimate for hot spots and (6) a Theorem of Bj\"orck stating that probability measures $\mu$ that maximize $\int_{\Omega \times \Omega} \|x-y\|^{\alpha} d\mu(x) d\mu(y)$ are fully supported in the boundary.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Langevin Diffusions with Density-dependent Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of non-convex optimization, we let the temperature of a Langevin diffusion to depend on the diffusion's own density function. The rationale is that the induced density reveals to some extent the landscape imposed by the non-convex function to be minimized, such that a density-dependent temperature can provide location-wise random perturbation that may better react to, for instance, the location and depth of local minimizers. As the Langevin dynamics is now self-regulated by its own density, it forms a mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the Nemytskii type, distinct from the standard McKean-Vlasov equations. Relying on Wasserstein subdifferential calculus, we first show that the corresponding (nonlinear) Fokker-Planck equation has a unique solution. Next, a weak solution to the SDE is constructed from the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation, by Trevisan's superposition principle. As time goes to infinity, we further show that the density induced by the SDE converges to an invariant distribution, which admits an explicit formula in terms of the Lambert $W$ function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first obtain explicit upper bounds for the proportion of elements in a finite classical group G with a given characteristic polynomial. We use this to complete the proof that the proportion of elements of a finite classical group G which lie in a proper irreducible subgroup tends to 0 as the dimension of the natural module goes to infinity. This result is analogous to the result of Luczak and Pyber [15] that the proportion of elements of the symmetric group S_n which are contained in a proper transitive subgroup other than the alternating group goes to 0 as n goes to infinity. We also show that the probability that 3 random elements of SL(n,q) invariably generate goes to 0 as n goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal transport in Banach Spaces for regularized estimation of multivariate quantiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new stochastic algorithm for solving entropic optimal transport (EOT) between two absolutely continuous probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$. Our work is motivated by the specific setting of Monge-Kantorovich quantiles where the source measure $\mu$ is either the uniform distribution on the unit hypercube or the spherical uniform distribution. Using the knowledge of the source measure, we propose to parametrize a Kantorovich dual potential by its Fourier coefficients. In this way, each iteration of our stochastic algorithm reduces to two Fourier transforms that enables us to make use of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in order to implement a fast numerical method to solve EOT. We study the almost sure convergence of our stochastic algorithm that takes its values in an infinite-dimensional Banach space. Then, using numerical experiments, we illustrate the performances of our approach on the computation of regularized Monge-Kantorovich quantiles. In particular, we investigate the potential benefits of entropic regularization for the smooth estimation of multivariate quantiles using data sampled from the target measure $\nu$.</description>

      <title>An upper bound on geodesic length in 2D critical first-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider i.i.d. first-passage percolation (FPP) on the two-dimensional square lattice, in the critical case where edge-weights take the value zero with probability $\tfrac{1}{2}$. Critical FPP is unique in that the Euclidean lengths of geodesics are superlinear -- rather than linear -- in the distance between their endpoints. This fact was speculated by Kesten in 1986 but not confirmed until 2019 by Damron and Tang, who showed a lower bound on geodesic length that is polynomial with degree strictly greater than $1$. In this paper, we establish the first nontrivial upper bound. Namely, we prove that for a large class of critical edge-weight distributions, the shortest geodesic from the origin to a box of radius $R$ uses at most $R^{2+\epsilon}\pi_3(R)$ edges with high probability, for any $\epsilon&gt; 0$. Here $\pi_3(R)$ is the polychromatic 3-arm probability from classical Bernoulli percolation; upon inserting its conjectural asymptotic, our bound converts to $R^{4/3 + \epsilon}$. In any case, it is known that $\pi_3(R) \lesssim R^{-\delta}$ for some $\delta &gt; 0$, so our bound gives an exponent strictly less than $2$. In the special case of Bernoulli($\tfrac{1}{2}$) edge-weights, we replace the additional factor of $R^\epsilon$ with a constant and give an expectation bound.</description>

      <title>Markov chain entropy games and the geometry of their Nash equilibria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a two-player zero-sum game between a probabilist and Nature defined by a convex function $f$, a finite collection $\mathcal{B}$ of Markov generators (or its convex hull), and a target distribution $\pi$. The probabilist selects a mixed strategy $\mu \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{B})$, the set of probability measures on $\mathcal{B}$, while Nature adopts a pure strategy and selects a $\pi$-reversible Markov generator $M$. The probabilist receives a payoff equal to the $f$-divergence $D_f(M \| L)$, where $L$ is drawn according to $\mu$. We prove that this game always admits a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium and satisfies a minimax identity. In contrast, a pure strategy equilibrium may fail to exist. We develop a projected subgradient method to compute approximate mixed strategy equilibria with provable convergence guarantees. Connections to information centroids, Chebyshev centers, and Bayes risk are discussed. This paper extends earlier minimax results on $f$-divergences to the context of Markov generators.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider a dynamic version of the Chung-Lu random graph in which the edges alternate between being present and absent. The main contribution concerns a technique by which one can estimate the underlying dynamics from partial information, in particular from snapshots of the total number of edges present. The efficacy of our inference method is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: Arbitrary matrices $M \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, randomly perturbed in an additive manner using a random matrix $R \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, are shown to asymptotically almost surely satisfy the so-called {\sl robust null space property}. Whilst insisting on an asymptotically optimal order of magnitude for $m$ required to attain {\sl unique reconstruction} via $\ell_1$-minimisation algorithms, our results track the level of arbitrariness allowed for the fixed seed matrix $M$ as well as the degree of distributional irregularity allowed for the entries of the perturbing matrix $R$. Starting with sub-gaussian entries for $R$, our results culminate with these allowed to have substantially heavier tails than sub-exponential ones. Throughout this trajectory, two measures control the arbitrariness allowed for $M$; the first is $\|M\|_\infty$ and the second is a localised notion of the Frobenius norm of $M$ (which depends on the sparsity of the signal being reconstructed). A key tool driving our proofs is {\sl Mendelson's small-ball method} ({\em Learning without concentration}, J. ACM, Vol. $62$, $2015$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the parabolic scaling limit of a damped stochastic wave map from the real line into the two-dimensional sphere, perturbed by multiplicative Gaussian noise of co-normal type. We prove that under this rescaling, the solutions converge to those of the deterministic heat flow for harmonic maps, revealing a transition from stochastic hyperbolic to deterministic parabolic dynamics. We further analyze the fluctuations around this limit, proving a weak central limit theorem and identifying the limiting process as the solution to a linear stochastic partial differential equation. The study combines tools from geometric analysis, stochastic calculus, and functional analysis, offering insights into the interplay between geometry, noise, and scaling in nonlinear stochastic systems.</description>

Abstract: We consider a preferential attachment random graph with self-reinforcement. Each time a new vertex comes in, it attaches itself to an old vertex with a probability that is proportional to the sum of the degrees of that old vertex at all prior times. The resulting growing graph is a random tree whose vertices have degrees that grow polynomially fast in time. We compute the growth exponent, show that it is strictly larger than the growth exponent in the absence of self-reinforcement, and develop insight into how the self-reinforcement affects the growth. Proofs are based on a stochastic approximation scheme.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Self Selection of Service Type in a Queueing System where Long Service Postpones the Need for the Next Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a make-to-order system with a finite set of customers. Production is stochastic with a nonlinear dependence between the ordered quantity and the production rate. Customers may have to queue until their turn arrives, and therefore their order decisions interact. Specifically, while being served, customers are aware of the queue length and choose one of two order quantities (or service types). The time to the next replenishment (their activity time) is stochastic and depends on the order quantities. A customer is inactive during service and while waiting in the queue. We refer to the type of service with a greater ratio of expected activity to service time as ``more efficient''. In the centralized case, the system is interested in maximizing the steady-state average number of active customers, which is referred to as the efficiency of the system. We show that choosing the more efficient service is not always optimal, but the optimal strategy can be approximated well by selecting one of three threshold strategies which depend on the number of inactive customers. In the decentralized case, each customer acts to maximize the fraction of time she is active. We observe that individuals and the manager have opposite incentives: When the queue is long, individuals tend to choose the long service, while the manager prefers the short service in this case. This makes the system difficult to regulate. However, we show that simply removing the less efficient service significantly increases efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03781v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world systems exhibit ``noisy'' evolution in time; interpreting their finitely-sampled behavior as arising from continuous-time processes (in the It\^o or Stratonovich sense) has led to significant success in modeling and analysis in a wide variety of fields. Yet such interpretation hinges on a fundamental linear separation of randomness from determinism in the underlying dynamics. Here we propose some theoretical systems which resist easy and self-consistent interpretation into this well-defined class of equations, requiring an expansion of the interpretive framework. We argue that a wider class of stochastic differential equations, where evolution depends nonlinearly on a random or effectively-random quantity, may be consistently interpreted and in fact exhibit finite-time stochastic behavior in line with an equivalent It\^o process, at which point many existing numerical and analytical techniques may be used. We put forward a method for this conversion, and demonstrate its use on both a toy system and on a system of direct physical relevance: the velocity of a meso-scale particle suspended in a turbulent fluid. This work enables the theoretical and numerical examination of a wide class of mathematical models which might otherwise be oversimplified due to a lack of appropriate tools.</description>

Abstract: An open stochastic system \`a la Jan Willems is a system affected by two qualitatively different kinds of uncertainty: one is probabilistic fluctuation, and the other one is nondeterminism caused by a fundamental lack of information. We present a formalization of open stochastic systems in the language of category theory. Central to this is the notion of copartiality which models how the lack of information propagates through a system (corresponding to the coarseness of sigma-algebras in Willems' work). As a concrete example, we study extended Gaussian distributions, which combine Gaussian probability with nondeterminism and correspond precisely to Willems' notion of Gaussian linear systems. We describe them both as measure-theoretic and abstract categorical entities, which enables us to rigorously describe a variety of phenomena like noisy physical laws and uninformative priors in Bayesian statistics. The category of extended Gaussian maps can be seen as a mutual generalization of Gaussian probability and linear relations, which connects the literature on categorical probability with ideas from control theory like signal-flow diagrams.</description>

Abstract: Max-stability is the property that taking a maximum between two inputs results in a maximum between two outputs. We study max-stability with respect to first-order stochastic dominance, the most fundamental notion of stochastic dominance in decision theory. Under two additional standard axioms of nondegeneracy and lower semicontinuity, we establish a representation theorem for functionals satisfying max-stability, which turns out to be represented by the supremum of a bivariate function. A parallel characterization result for min-stability, that is, with the maximum replaced by the minimum in max-stability, is also established. By combining both max-stability and min-stability, we obtain a new characterization for a class of functionals, called the Lambda-quantiles, that appear in finance and political science.</description>

      <title>Dimension-free Relaxation Times of Informed MCMC Samplers on Discrete Spaces</title>

Abstract: Convergence analysis of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in high-dimensional statistical applications is increasingly recognized. In this paper, we develop general mixing time bounds for Metropolis-Hastings algorithms on discrete spaces by building upon and refining some recent theoretical advancements in Bayesian model selection problems. We establish sufficient conditions for a class of informed Metropolis-Hastings algorithms to attain relaxation times that are independent of the problem dimension. These conditions are grounded in the high-dimensional statistical theory and allow for possibly multimodal posterior distributions. We obtain our results through two independent techniques: the multicommodity flow method and single-element drift condition analysis; we find that the latter yields a slightly tighter mixing time bound. Our results are readily applicable to a broad spectrum of statistical problems with discrete parameter spaces, as we demonstrate using both theoretical and numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Localization and unique continuation for non-stationary Schr\"odinger operators on the 2D lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend methods of Ding and Smart from their breakthrough paper in 2020 which showed Anderson localization for certain random Schr\"odinger operators on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}^2)$ via a quantitative unique continuation principle and Wegner estimate. We replace the requirement of identical distribution with the requirement of a uniform bound on the essential range of potential and a uniform positive lower bound on the variance of the variables giving the potential. Under those assumptions, we recover the unique continuation and Wegner lemma results, using Bernoulli decompositions and modifications of the arguments therein. This leads to a localization result at the bottom of the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Extended mean-field control problems with Poissonian common noise: Stochastic maximum principle and Hamiltonian-Jacobi-Bellman equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05356v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies mean-field control problems with state-control joint law dependence and Poissonian common noise. We develop the stochastic maximum principle (SMP) and establish its connection to the Hamiltonian-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation on the Wasserstein space. The presence of the conditional joint law in the McKean-Vlasov dynamics and its discontinuity caused by the Poissonian common noise bring new technical challenges. To develop the SMP when the control domain is not necessarily convex, we first consider a strong relaxed control formulation that allows us to perform the first-order variation. We propose the technique of extension transformation to overcome the compatibility issues arising from the joint law in the relaxed control formulation. By further establishing the equivalence between the relaxed control and the strict control formulations, we obtain the SMP for the original problem with strict controls. In the part to investigate the HJB equation, we formulate an auxiliary control problem subjecting to a controlled measure-valued dynamics with Poisson jumps, which allows us to derive the HJB equation of the original problem under the open-loop strict control by some newly established equivalence formulations. We also establish the connection between the SMP and the HJB equation.</description>

      <title>Non-convex matrix sensing: Breaking the quadratic rank barrier in the sample complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13276v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the problem of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements, two classes of algorithms have been widely studied in the literature: convex approaches based on nuclear norm minimization, and non-convex approaches that use factorized gradient descent. Under certain statistical model assumptions, it is known that nuclear norm minimization recovers the ground truth as soon as the number of samples scales linearly with the number of degrees of freedom of the ground-truth. In contrast, while non-convex approaches are computationally less expensive, existing recovery guarantees assume that the number of samples scales at least quadratically with the rank $r$ of the ground-truth matrix. In this paper, we close this gap by showing that the non-convex approaches can be as efficient as nuclear norm minimization in terms of sample complexity. Namely, we consider the problem of reconstructing a positive semidefinite matrix from a few Gaussian measurements. We show that factorized gradient descent with spectral initialization converges to the ground truth at a linear rate as soon as the number of samples scales with $ \Omega (rd\kappa^2)$, where $d$ is the dimension, and $\kappa$ is the condition number of the ground truth matrix. This improves the previous rank-dependence in the sample complexity of non-convex matrix factorization from quadratic to linear. Furthermore, we extend our theory to the noisy setting, where we show that with noisy measurements, factorized gradient descent with spectral initialization converges to the minimax optimal error up to a factor linear in $\kappa$. Our proof relies on a probabilistic decoupling argument, where we show that the gradient descent iterates are only weakly dependent on the individual entries of the measurement matrices. We expect that our proof technique is of independent interest for other non-convex problems.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness for Dean-Kawasaki Models of Vlasov-Fokker-Planck Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider systems of interacting particles which are described by a second order Langevin equation. The class of equations considered includes the situation where the particle evolution is governed by Hamiltonian dynamics with additional damping and noise satisfying a fluctuation-dissipation relation. Also covered are systems of two equations describing an evolution of interacting agents, as arising in several descriptions of active matter, including models for flocking and swarming. We first show that such particle systems can be represented exactly by so-called equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics, which in this case are stochastic versions of a Vlasov-Fokker-Planck type equation. While the derivation given here is simple, it is a blueprint for the rigorous derivation of equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics. We then show a dichotomy previously known for purely diffusive (first order) systems carries over to the second order setting considered here: Solutions exist for suitable atomic initial data, in which case the solution is, properly scaled, the empirical density describing the particle system. For smooth initial data, however, we prove that no solution exists.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Perceptrons, Number Partitioning and Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The symmetric binary perceptron ($\mathrm{SBP}_{\kappa}$) problem with parameter $\kappa : \mathbb{R}_{\geq1} \to [0,1]$ is an average-case search problem defined as follows: given a random Gaussian matrix $\mathbf{A} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)^{n \times m}$ as input where $m \geq n$, output a vector $\mathbf{x} \in \{-1,1\}^m$ such that $$|| \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} ||_{\infty} \leq \kappa(m/n) \cdot \sqrt{m}~.$$ The number partitioning problem ($\mathrm{NPP}_{\kappa}$) corresponds to the special case of setting $n=1$. There is considerable evidence that both problems exhibit large computational-statistical gaps.
  In this work, we show (nearly) tight average-case hardness for these problems, assuming the worst-case hardness of standard approximate shortest vector problems on lattices.
  For $\mathrm{SBP}$, for large $n$, the best that efficient algorithms have been able to achieve is $\kappa(x) = \Theta(1/\sqrt{x})$ (Bansal and Spencer, Random Structures and Algorithms 2020), which is a far cry from the statistical bound. The problem has been extensively studied in the TCS and statistics communities, and Gamarnik, Kizildag, Perkins and Xu (FOCS 2022) conjecture that Bansal-Spencer is tight: namely, $\kappa(x) = \widetilde{\Theta}(1/\sqrt{x})$ is the optimal value achieved by computationally efficient algorithms. We prove their conjecture assuming the worst-case hardness of approximating the shortest vector problem on lattices.
  For $\mathrm{NPP}$, Karmarkar and Karp's classical differencing algorithm achieves $\kappa(m) = 2^{-O(\log^2 m)}~.$ We prove that Karmarkar-Karp is nearly tight: namely, no polynomial-time algorithm can achieve $\kappa(m) = 2^{-\Omega(\log^3 m)}$, once again assuming the worst-case subexponential hardness of approximating the shortest vector problem on lattices to within a subexponential factor.</description>

      <title>Negative Dependence as a toolbox for machine learning : review and new developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Negative dependence is becoming a key driver in advancing learning capabilities beyond the limits of traditional independence. Recent developments have evidenced support towards negatively dependent systems as a learning paradigm in a broad range of fundamental machine learning challenges including optimization, sampling, dimensionality reduction and sparse signal recovery, often surpassing the performance of current methods based on statistical independence. The most popular negatively dependent model has been that of determinantal point processes (DPPs), which have their origins in quantum theory. However, other models, such as perturbed lattice models, strongly Rayleigh measures, zeros of random functions have gained salience in various learning applications. In this article, we review this burgeoning field of research, as it has developed over the past two decades or so. We also present new results on applications of DPPs to the parsimonious representation of neural networks. In the limited scope of the article, we mostly focus on aspects of this area to which the authors contributed over the recent years, including applications to Monte Carlo methods, coresets and stochastic gradient descent, stochastic networks, signal processing and connections to quantum computation. However, starting from basics of negative dependence for the uninitiated reader, extensive references are provided to a broad swath of related developments which could not be covered within our limited scope. While existing works and reviews generally focus on specific negatively dependent models (e.g. DPPs), a notable feature of this article is that it addresses negative dependence as a machine learning methodology as a whole. In this vein, it covers within its span an array of negatively dependent models and their applications well beyond DPPs, thereby putting forward a very general and rather unique perspective.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Control with Poissonian Common Noise: A Pathwise Compactification Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper contributes to the compactification approach to tackle mean-field control (MFC) problems with Poissonian common noise. To overcome the lack of compactness and continuity issues due to common noise, we exploit the point process representation of the Poisson random measure with finite intensity and propose a pathwise formulation by freezing a sample path of the common noise. We first study a pathwise relaxed control problem in an auxiliary setup without common noise but with finite deterministic jumping times over the finite horizon. By employing the compactification argument for the pathwise relaxed control problem with Skorokhod topology, we establish the existence of optimal controls in the pathwise formulation. To address the original problem, the main challenge is to close the gap between the problem in the original model with common noise and the pathwise formulation. With the help of concatenation techniques over the sequence of deterministic jumping times, we develop a new tool, also interpreted as the superposition principle in the pathwise formulation, to draw a relationship between the pathwise relaxed control problem and the pathwise measure-valued control problem associated to Fokker-Planck equation. As a result, we can bridge the desired equivalence among different problem formulations. We also extend the methodology to solve mean-field games with Poissonian common noise, confirming the existence of a strong mean field equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Analysis and conditional optimization of projection estimates for distribution of random variable using Legendre polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithms for jointly obtaining projection estimates of the density and distribution function of a random variable using Legendre polynomials are proposed. For these algorithms, a problem of the conditional optimization is solved. Such optimization allows one to increase the approximation accuracy with minimum computational costs. The proposed algorithms are tested on examples with different degrees of smoothness of the density. A projection estimate of the density is compared to a histogram that is often used in applications to estimate distributions.</description>

      <title>The Logarithmic Laplacian on General Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish, for the first time, a Bochner-type integral representation for the logarithmic Laplacian on weighted graphs. Assuming stochastic completeness of the underlying graph, we further derive an explicit pointwise formula for this operator:
  \[
  \log(-\Delta)\:u(x)
  =\frac{1}{\mu(x)}\sum_{y\neq x}W_{\log}(x,y)\,(u(x)-u(y))
  -\frac{1}{\mu(x)}\sum_{y}W(x,y)\,u(y)
  +\Gamma'(1)\,u(x).
  \] In the case of weighted lattice graphs with uniformly positive vertex measures, we obtain sharp two-sided bounds for the associated logarithmic kernel. Additionally, we prove that the logarithmic Laplacian is unbounded on $\ell^{2}$, and we present an alternative derivation of its pointwise form. Moreover, for every $1 &lt; p \leq \infty$ and all $u \in C_c(\mathbb{Z}^{d})$, we establish a strong convergence in $\ell^{p}$: \[\frac{(-\Delta)^{s} u - u}{s} \longrightarrow \log(-\Delta) \:u \quad \text{as } s \to 0^{+}.\]Finally, on the standard lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, we compute the Fourier multipliers corresponding to both the fractional Laplacian and the logarithmic Laplacian, and derive exact large-time behavior and off-diagonal asymptotics of the associated diffusion kernels, including all sharp asymptotic constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We assess advantages of expressing tree-structured Ising models via their mean parameterization rather than their commonly chosen canonical parameterization. This includes fixedness of marginal distributions, often convenient for dependence modeling, and the dispelling of the intractable normalizing constant otherwise hindering Ising models. We derive an analytic expression for the joint probability generating function of mean-parameterized tree-structured Ising models, conferring efficient computation methods for the distribution of the sum of its constituent random variables. The mean parameterization also allows for a stochastic representation of Ising models, providing straightforward sampling methods. We furthermore show that Markov random fields with fixed Poisson marginal distributions may act as an efficient and accurate approximation for tree-structured Ising models, in the spirit of Poisson approximation.</description>
