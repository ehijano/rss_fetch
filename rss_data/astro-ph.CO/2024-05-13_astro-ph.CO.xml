      <title>New measurements of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest continuum and effective optical depth with LyCAN and DESI Y1 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Lyman-$\alpha$ Continuum Analysis Network (LyCAN), a Convolutional Neural Network that predicts the unabsorbed quasar continuum within the rest-frame wavelength range of $1040-1600$ Angstroms based on the red side of the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission line ($1216-1600$ Angstroms). We developed synthetic spectra based on a Gaussian Mixture Model representation of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) coefficients. These coefficients were derived from high-resolution, low-redshift ($z&lt;0.2$) Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph quasar spectra. We supplemented this COS-based synthetic sample with an equal number of DESI Year 5 mock spectra. LyCAN performs extremely well on testing sets, achieving a median error in the forest region of 1.5% on the DESI mock sample, 2.0% on the COS-based synthetic sample, and 4.1% on the original COS spectra. LyCAN outperforms Principal Component Analysis (PCA)- and NMF-based prediction methods using the same training set by a factor of two or more. We predict the intrinsic continua of 83,635 DESI Year 1 spectra in the redshift range of $2.1 \leq z \leq 4.2$ and perform an absolute measurement of the evolution of the effective optical depth. This is the largest sample employed to measure the optical depth evolution to date. We fit a power-law of the form $\tau(z) = \tau_0 (1+z)^\gamma$ to our measurements and find $\tau_0 = (2.46 \pm 0.14)\times10^{-3}$ and $\gamma = 3.62 \pm 0.04$. Our results show particular agreement with high-resolution, ground-based observations around $z = 2$, indicating that LyCAN is able to predict the quasar continuum in the forest region with only spectral information outside the forest.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Dominated Cosmology with Woods-Saxon Like Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark energy can be characterized by a canonical scalar field, known as quintessence. Quintessence allows for a dynamical equation of state $-1 \le \omega \le -\frac{1}{3}$. In this work, we consider a quintessence model with a specific potential of the Woods-Saxon form. The model is studied at late phase assuming flat cosmology, and the model parameters are constrained using Type Ia supernova data and Observational Hubble data. In particular we employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for the Bayesian inference of these parameters. We obtain the value of the Hubble constant $H_0 = 68.10 \pm 0.74\,km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$ and the matter energy density parameter $\Omega_{m_0} = 0.31 \pm 0.01 $, which are consistent with the values obtained using base $\Lambda$CDM using the same dataset. Computation of the $\chi^2_{min}$, AIC and BIC reveal that this model is preffered according to AIC and $\chi^2_{min}$ criteria, while the $\Lambda$CDM is preferred according to BIC. We also show that this model can explain late-time accelerated expansion. Statefinder analysis reveals a Chaplygin gas behaviour in the past, in addition to the quintessence behaviour of the field.</description>

      <title>CMB-PAInT: An inpainting tool for the cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of astrophysical emissions in microwave observations forces us to perform component separation to extract the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) signal. However, even in the most optimistic cases, there are still strongly contaminated regions, such as the Galactic plane or those with emission from extragalactic point sources, which require the use of a mask. Since many CMB analyses, especially the ones working in harmonic space, need the whole sky map, it is crucial to develop a reliable inpainting algorithm that replaces the values of the excluded pixels by others statistically compatible with the rest of the sky. This is especially important when working with $Q$ and $U$ sky maps in order to obtain $E$- and $B$-mode maps which are free from $E$-to-$B$ leakage. In this work we study a method based on Gaussian Constrained Realizations (GCR), that can deal with both intensity and polarization. Several tests have been performed to asses the validation of the method, including the study of the one-dimensional probability distribution function (1-PDF), E- and B-mode map reconstruction, and power spectra estimation. We have considered two scenarios for the input simulation: one case with only CMB signal and a second one including also Planck PR4 semi-realistic noise. Even if we are limited to low resolution maps, $N_{\mathrm{side}} = $ 64 if $T$, $Q$ and $U$ are considered, we believe that this is a useful approach to be applied to future missions such as LiteBIRD, where the target are the largest scales.</description>

      <title>Regularized-Renormalized-Resummed loop corrected power spectrum of non-singular bounce with Primordial Black Hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete and consistent exposition of the regularization, renormalization, and resummation procedures in the setup of having a contraction and then non-singular bounce followed by inflation with a sharp transition from slow-roll (SR) to ultra-slow roll (USR) phase for generating primordial black holes (PBHs). We consider following an effective field theory (EFT) approach and study the quantum loop corrections to the power spectrum from each phase. We demonstrate the complete removal of quadratic UV divergences after renormalization and softened logarithmic IR divergences after resummation and illustrate the scheme-independent nature of our renormalization approach. We further show that the addition of a contracting and bouncing phase allows us to successfully generate PBHs of solar-mass order, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(M_{\odot})$, by achieving the minimum e-folds during inflation to be $\Delta N_{\rm Total}\sim {\cal O}(60)$ and in this process successfully evading the strict no-go theorem. We notice that varying the effective sound speed between $0.88\leq c_{s}\leq 1$, allows the peak spectrum amplitude to lie within $10^{-3}\leq A \leq 10^{-2}$, indicating that causality and unitarity remain protected in the theory. We analyse PBHs in the extremely small, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-33}-10^{-27})M_{\odot}$, and the large, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6}-10^{-1})M_{\odot}$, mass limits and confront the PBH abundance results with the latest microlensing constraints. We also study the cosmological beta functions across all phases and find their interpretation consistent in the context of bouncing and inflationary scenarios while satisfying the pivot scale normalization requirement. Further, we estimate the spectral distortion effects and shed light on controlling PBH overproduction.</description>

      <title>Hubble tension tomography: BAO vs SnIa distance tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the redshift dependence of the Hubble tension by comparing the luminosity distances obtained using an up-to-date BAO dataset (including the latest DESI data) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon+ SnIa distances calibrated with Cepheids. Using a redshift tomography method, we find: 1) The BAO-inferred distances are discrepant with the Pantheon+ SnIa distances across all redshift bins considered, with the discrepancy level varying with redshift. 2) The distance discrepancy is more pronounced at lower redshifts ($z \in [0.1,0.8]$) compared to higher redshifts ($z\in [0.8,2.3]$). The consistency of \lcdm best fit parameters obtained in high and low redshift bins of both BAO and SnIa samples is investigated and we confirm that the tension reduces at high redshifts. Also a mild tension between the redshift bins is identified at higher redshifts for both the BAO and Pantheon+ data with respect to the best fit value of $H_0$ in agreement with previous studies which find hints for an 'evolution' of $H_0$ in the context of $\Lambda$CDM. These results confirm that the low redshift BAO and SnIa distances can only become consistent through a re-evaluation of the distance calibration methods. An $H(z)$ expansion rate deformation alone is insufficient to resolve the tension. Our findings also hint at a possible deviation of the expansion rate from the Planck18/$\Lambda$CDM model at high redshifts $z\gtrsim 2$. We show that such a deformation is well described by a high redshift transition of $H(z)$ like the one expressed by $\Lambda_s$CDM even though this alone cannot fully resolve the Hubble tension due to its tension with intermediate/low $z$ BAO data.</description>

      <title>Constrain the linear scalar perturbation theory of Cotton gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a cosmological test of Cotton gravity, which describes gravity by cotton tensor. The model we consider allows for the same background evolution as the $\Lambda$CDM model. We derive the cosmological perturbation theory of the scalar mode at the linear level, where the difference from the $\Lambda$CDM model is characterized by the parameter $\beta$. We incorporate Cotton gravity with a neutrino model and perform a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis using data from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The analysis constrains parameter $\beta=-0.00008^{+0.00080}_{-0.00104}$ at the 1-$\sigma$ confidence level. We conclude that currently, there is no obvious deviation between Cotton gravity and the $\Lambda$CDM model in the linear cosmological perturbation level for observations.</description>

      <title>Testing Cotton gravity as dark matter substitute with weak lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harada proposed a modified theory of gravity called Cotton gravity, and argued that it successfully explains the rotation curves of $84$ galaxies without the need of dark matter. In this work we use galaxy-galaxy lensing technique to test whether the modification effect of Cotton gravity can indeed be a viable substitute for dark matter. Using the spherically symmetric solution of Cotton gravity, we obtain the deflection angle via Gauss-Bonnet theorem and the weak lensing shear. We use five galaxy catalogs divided in 5 stellar mass bins from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7), each of which is further divided into blue star forming galaxy and red passive galaxy sub-catalogs. We find that Cotton gravity on its own has significant deviation from the measured galaxy-galaxy lensing signals, thus it cannot replace the role of dark matter. If we consider the combination of dark matter and Cotton gravity, the modification is tightly constrained. Our analysis also applies to other modified gravity theories whose an additional linear term appears in the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <title>Constraints on bulk viscosity in $f(Q,T)$ gravity from H(z)/Pantheon+ data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the role of bulk viscosity in $f(Q,T)$ gravity in explaining late-time cosmic acceleration. This model, an extension of symmetric teleparallel gravity, introduces viscosity into cosmic matter dynamics for a more realistic representation. Specifically, we consider the linear form of $f (Q, T) =\alpha Q + \beta T$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are free model parameters. To assess the model, we derive its exact solution and use Hubble parameter $H(z)$ data and Pantheon + SNe Ia data for parameter estimation. We employ the $\chi^2$ minimization technique alongside the MCMC random sampling method to determine the best-fit parameters. Then, we analyze the behavior of key cosmological parameters, including the deceleration parameter, bulk viscous matter-dominated universe density, effective pressure, and the effective EoS parameter, accounting for the viscous type fluid. We observe a transition in the deceleration parameter from a positive (decelerating) to a negative (accelerating) phase at transition redshift $z_t$. The matter density shows the expected positive behavior, while the pressure, influenced by viscosity, exhibits negative behavior, indicative of accelerating expansion. Furthermore, we investigate the energy conditions and find that while the NEC and DEC meet positivity criteria, the SEC is violated in the present and future epochs. The $Om(z)$ diagnostic suggests that our model aligns with quintessence behavior. Finally, our $f(Q,T)$ cosmological model, incorporating bulk viscosity effects, provides a compelling explanation for late-time cosmic behavior, consistent with observational data.</description>

      <title>Exploring late-time cosmic acceleration: A study of a linear $f(T)$ cosmological model using observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of dark energy poses a significant challenge in modern cosmology, as it is responsible for the universe's accelerated expansion. In this study, we focus on a specific $f(T)$ cosmological model and analyze its behavior using observational data, including 31 data points from the CC dataset, 1048 points from the Pantheon SNe Ia samples, and 6 points from the BAO dataset. By considering a linear $f(T)$ model with an additional constant term, we derive the expression for the Hubble parameter as a function of cosmic redshift for non-relativistic pressureless matter. We obtain the best-fit values for the Hubble constant, $H_0$, and the model parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, indicating a stable model capable of explaining late-time cosmic acceleration without invoking a dark energy component. This is achieved through modifying field equations to account for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe.</description>

      <title>Optimal bolometer transfer function deconvolution for CMB experiments through maximum likelihood mapmaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the impact of finite time responses of bolometric detectors used for deep observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Until now, bolometer transfer functions have been accounted for through a two-step procedure by first deconvolving an estimate of their Fourier-space representation from the raw time-ordered data (TOD), and then averaging the deconvolved TOD into pixelized maps. However, for many experiments, including the Planck High Frequency Instrument (HFI), it is necessary to apply an additional low-pass filter to avoid an excessive noise boost, which leads to an asymmetric effective beam. In this paper we demonstrate that this effect can be avoided if the transfer function deconvolution and pixelization operations are performed simultaneously through integrated maximum likelihood mapmaking. The resulting algorithm is structurally identical to the artDeco algorithm introduced by Keih\"anen &amp; Reinecke (2012) for beam deconvolution. We illustrate the relevance of this method with simulated Planck HFI 143 GHz data, and find that the resulting effective beam is both more symmetric than with the two-step procedure, resulting in a sky-averaged ellipticity that is 64 % lower, and an effective beam full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) that is 2.3 % smaller. Similar improvements are expected for any other bolometer-based CMB experiments with long time constants.</description>

      <title>Pulsar timing array constraints on the cosmological magnetic field from quark confinement epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent evidence for the stochastic gravitational wave backgorund reported by the pulsar timing arrays (PTA) can be interpreted as a signal from the cosmological phase transition. We use up-to-date models of the gravitational wave power spectra to compare constraints on the parameters of the phase transition for the three different available PTA measurements and to work out a refined estimate of the cosmological magnetic field that should result from this transition. We find that the PTA data, combined with a constraint from the abundance of primordial black holes, are consistent with a possibility of a moderate strength first-order phase transition during quark confinement and yield a rather precise prediction for the initial parameters of the magnetic field, with the magnetic field energy density in near equipartition with photon energy density and correlation length close to one co-moving parsec.</description>

      <title>A complete framework for cosmological emulation and inference with CosmoPower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a coherent, re-usable python framework which further builds on the cosmological emulator code CosmoPower. In the current era of high-precision cosmology, we require high-accuracy calculations of cosmological observables with Einstein-Boltzmann codes. For detailed statistical analyses, such codes often incur high costs in terms of computing power, making parameter space exploration costly, especially for beyond-$\Lambda$CDM analyses. Machine learning-enabled emulators of Einstein-Boltzmann codes have emerged as a solution to this problem and have become a common way to perform fast cosmological analyses. To enable generation, sharing and use of emulators for inference, we define standards for robustly describing, packaging and distributing them, and present software for easily performing these tasks in an automated and replicable manner. We provide examples and guidelines for generating your own sufficiently accurate emulators and wrappers for using them in popular cosmological inference codes. We demonstrate our framework by presenting a suite of high-accuracy emulators for the CAMB code's calculations of CMB $C_\ell$, $P(k)$, background evolution, and derived parameter quantities. We show that these emulators are accurate enough for both $\Lambda$CDM analysis and a set of single- and two-parameter extension models (including $N_{\rm eff}$, $\sum m_{\nu}$ and $w_0 w_a$ cosmologies) with stage-IV observatories, recovering the original high-accuracy Einstein-Boltzmann spectra to tolerances well within the cosmic variance uncertainties across the full range of parameters considered. We also use our emulators to recover cosmological parameters in a simulated cosmic-variance limited experiment, finding results well within $0.1 \sigma$ of the input cosmology, while requiring typically $\lesssim1/50$ of the evaluation time than for the full Einstein-Boltzmann computation.</description>

      <title>Investigating the impact of galaxies' compact binary hosting probability for gravitational-wave cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of future-generation interferometers a huge number of Gravitational Wave (GW) signals is expected to be measured without an electromagnetic counterpart. Although these signals do not allow a simultaneous measurement of the redshift and the luminosity distance, it is still possible to infer cosmological parameters. In this paper, we focus on the systematic biases that could arise from mismodeling the GW host probability when inferring the Hubble constant ($H_0$) with GW dark sirens jointly with galaxy catalogues. We discuss the case in which the GW host probability is a function of galaxies' luminosity and redshift as it has been predicted by state-of-the-art compact binary coalescences (CBCs) synthetic catalogues. We show that, in the limiting case in which the analysis is done with a complete galaxy catalog covering a footprint of $\sim 10~\rm {deg}^2$, mismatching the host probability in terms of galaxy's luminosity will introduce a bias on $H_0$. In this case, the magnitude of the bias will depend on the distribution of the Large-Scale Structure over the line-of-sight. Instead, in the limit of a complete wide-field of view galaxy catalog and GW events localized at O$({\rm Gpc})$ distance, mismatching the redshift dependence of the GW hosting probability is more likely to introduce a systematic bias.</description>

      <title>Searching for Synchrotron Emission from the Geminga TeV Halo using the Planck Satellite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsars convert a significant fraction of their total spin-down power into very high-energy electrons, leading to the formation of TeV halos. It is not yet known, however, whether these sources also efficiently accelerate electrons at lower energies and, if so, how those particles propagate through the surrounding environment. If pulsars produce $\sim 50-300 \, {\rm GeV}$ electrons, these particles would produce a spatially extended halo of synchrotron emission in the frequency range measured by Planck. Such emission could be used to constrain the low-energy diffusion coefficient in the regions surrounding these pulsars, as well as the spectrum and intensity of the electrons that are accelerated in this energy range. In this study, we attempt to use Planck data to constrain the nature of the Geminga pulsar's TeV halo. We find no conclusive evidence of this emission in Planck's frequency range, however, and calculate that the synchrotron flux from Geminga should be well below the total flux measured by Planck, even for models with favorable diffusion parameters or soft injection spectra. At this time, these measurements are not capable of significantly constraining the values of these parameters.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves as Probe of Dark Matter in Interferometer Missions: Fisher Forecast and MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose novel inflationary primordial gravitational wave (GW) spectral shapes at interferometer-based current and future GW missions to test dark matter (DM) production and baryogenesis via gravity-portal. We consider three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), the lightest among them is DM candidate while the others participate in baryogenesis via leptogenesis. We find that future GW detectors BBO, DECIGO, ET, for instance, are able to probe DM mass for $5\times 10^6\, {\rm GeV}&lt;M_{\rm DM}&lt;1.6\times 10^7$ GeV with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;10$, along with the observed amount of baryon asymmetry due to gravitational leptogenesis for heavy RHN mass $M_{\cal{N}}$ to be around $8\times 10^{12}$ GeV. Employing Fisher matrix forecast analysis, we identify the parameter space involving non-minimal coupling to gravity $\xi$, reheating temperature of the Universe $T_{\rm rh}$ and DM mass $M_{\rm DM}$ where the GW detector-sensitivities will be the maximum with the least error, along with SNR $&gt;10$. Finally, utilizing mock data for each GW detector, we perform MCMC analysis to find out the combined constraints on the various microphysics parameters. We also explore production of other cosmological relics such as QCD axion relic as DM candidate, produced via gravity-portal in early universe. We find that ET, for instance, can probe the decay constant of such DM candidates ($f_a$) as $10^9\,{\rm GeV}\lesssim f_a\lesssim 10^{14}\,{\rm GeV}$ for misalignment angle $\theta_i\in[0.1,\pi/\sqrt{3}]$ and $\xi=1$ with SNR $&gt;10$, whereas this range decreases with the increase of non-minimal coupling. Thus the upcoming GW missions will be able to test such non-thermal DM and baryogenesis scenarios involving very high energy scales, which is otherwise impossible to reach in particle physics experiments in laboratories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mimetic gravity theory is one of the interesting modified gravity theories, which aims to unify the matter component of our universe within the power of gravity. The mimetic-like theory can also be responsible for primordial perturbations production, e.g., when the mimetic field is set to be like a curvaton field, and the adiabatic perturbation can thus be generated from the isocurvature perturbation via usual curvaton mechanism [1]. In the original mimetic curvaton model, the parameter $\lambda$ was purely an algebraic multiplier, lack of any perturbed dynamics. In the current paper, we treat $\lambda$ as an auxiliary field, with its perturbation $\delta\lambda$ evolving alongside. We show that, with such a consideration, the adiabatic perturbation can still be generated from the curvaton mechanism, and becomes scale invariant with different field space configurations.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Leptogenesis with sub-GeV Axion Like Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A derivative coupling of an axion like particle (ALP) with a B-L current may lead to the baryon asymmetry of the universe via spontaneous leptogenesis provided a lepton number breaking interaction prevails in thermal equilibrium. Conventionally, such scenario works only for heavy ALPs and high reheating temperature due to the fact that the same lepton number breaking contribution is tied up with neutrino mass generation also. In this work, we propose inert Higgs doublet assisted lepton number violating operator to relieve such tension so as to generate lepton asymmetry (of freeze-in/out type) with a much lower reheating temperature that can accommodate light (sub-GeV) ALPs sensitive to current and future ALP searches.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Bell Tests with Decoherence Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inflationary universe creates particle pairs, which are entangled in their momenta due to momentum conservation. Operators involving the momenta of the fluctuations can be rewritten into pseudo-spin operators, such as the Gour-Khanna-Mann-Revzen (GKMR) pseudo-spin. Making use of these pseudo-spin operators, cosmological Bell inequalities can be formulated. The violation of these Bell inequalities indicates the quantum nature of primordial fluctuations.
  In this work, we focus on primordial curvature perturbations. Since curvature perturbations arise from gravity, their action includes the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. We clarify the role of the boundary term in selecting suitable initial conditions for linear perturbations.
  After that, we proceed to the interactions of cosmological perturbations, including the bulk and boundary interaction terms, which introduce decoherence effects. These decoherence effects change the expectation value of the Bell operator, and gradually restore the Bell inequality. We describe this process by a ``Bell test curve'', which offers a window for testing the quantum origin of cosmological perturbations. We also explore the possibility of extracting the information of the decoherence rate and the structure of primordial interactions from the Bell test curve.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detection of the pair-echo emission from TeV gamma-ray bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) present in the voids of large-scale structures is considered to be the weakest magnetic field in the Universe. Gamma-ray observations of blazars in the GeV-TeV domain have led to lower limits on the IGMF strength based on the search for delayed/extended emission. Nevertheless these results are obtained with strong assumptions on the unknown source properties. The recent discovery of TeV radiation from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) has paved the way for IGMF studies with these bright transients. Among the current TeV-detected GRBs, GRB 190114C, located at redshift $z = 0.42$, is the best sampled and therefore representative of the properties of GRBs in the VHE domain while GRB 221009A ($z = 0.151$) is the brightest event ever detected. We present a phenomenological model based on the intrinsic properties of GRB 190114C and GRB 221009A to predict the delayed emission component (pair-echo) in the GeV-TeV band. We investigate the detectability of this component from low-redshift ($z \leq 1$) GRBs for three values of IGMF strength ($10^{-19}$ G, $10^{-18}$ G and $10^{-17}$ G), different observational times ($3$ hrs, $6$ hrs and $9$ hrs) and source intrinsic properties. We find that, for current and future generation $\gamma$-ray instruments, extending the observation for at least 3 hours after the GRB detection is a viable strategy to probe IGMF. We also confirm that GeV-TeV observations of GRBs can probe IGMF strengths at the order of $10^{-17} -10^{-19}$ G representing a competitive alternative to the current studies performed with AGNs.</description>

      <title>JWST's PEARLS: resolved study of the stellar and dust components in starburst galaxies at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) contribute significantly to the stellar buildup at cosmic noon. Major mergers and gas accretion are often invoked to explain DSFGs' prodigious star-formation rates (SFRs) and large stellar masses. We conducted a spatially-resolved morphological analysis of the rest-frame UV/NIR emission in three DSFGs at z~2.5. Initially discovered as CO emitters by NOEMA observations of a bright Herschel source, we observed them with the JWST/NIRCam as part of the PEARLS program. The NIRCam data reveal the galaxies' stellar population and dust distribution on scales of 250 pc. Spatial variations in stellar mass, SFR, and dust extinction are determined in resolved maps obtained through pixel-based SED fitting. The CO emitters are massive, dusty starburst galaxies with SFRs ranging from 340 to 2500 Msun/yr, positioning them among the most active SFGs at 2&lt;z&lt;3. Notably, they belong to the ~1.5% of the entire JWST population with extremely red colors. Their morphologies are disk-like, with effective radii of 2.0-4.4 kpc, and exhibit sub-structures such as clumps and spiral arms. The galaxies have dust extinctions up to Av=5-7 mag with asymmetric distributions extending over several kpc and including off-center regions resembling bent spiral arms and clumps. The NIR dust-attenuation curve in these sources deviates from standard laws, implying different dust grain properties than commonly assumed in starburst galaxies. The proximity of galaxies with consistent redshifts, strong color gradients, overall disturbed appearance, asymmetric dust obscuration, and wide-spread star formation favor interactions (minor mergers and flybys) as the mechanism driving the CO galaxies' exceptional SFRs. Their large masses and rich environment hint at membership in two proto-structures, as initially inferred from their association with a Planck-selected high-z source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations indicate a $4.9\sigma$ tension between the CMB and quasar dipoles. This tension challenges the cosmological principle. We propose that if we live in a gigaparsec scale void, the CMB and quasar dipolar tension can be reconciled. This is because we are unlikely to live at the center of the void. And a 19% offset from the center will impact the quasars and CMB differently in their dipolar anisotropies. As we consider a large and thick void, our setup can also ease the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Probing wave-optics effects and low-mass dark matter halos with lensing of gravitational waves from massive black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) in the low-frequency ($\sim$mHz) band. Low-mass lenses, such as low-mass dark matter halos or subhalos, have sizes comparable to the wavelength of these GWs. Encounters with these lenses produce wave-optics (WO) effects that alter waveform phase and amplitude. Thus, a single event with observable WO effects can be used to probe the lens properties. In this paper, we first compute the probability of observing WO effects in a model-agnostic way. We perform information-matrix analyses over approximately 1000 MBHBs with total mass, mass ratio, and redshift spanning the ranges relevant to LISA. We then calculate lensing rates using three semi-analytical models of MBHB populations. In both cases, we use a waveform model that includes merger, ringdown, and higher-order modes. We use two lens population models: the theory-based Press-Schechter halo mass function and an observation-based model derived from Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that the probability of detecting WO effects can be as large as $\sim 3\%$, $\sim1.5\%$, and $\sim 1 \%$ at $1\sigma$, $3\sigma$, and $5\sigma$ confidence levels, respectively. The most optimistic MBHB population model yields $\sim 8$, $\sim 4$, and $\sim 3$ events with detectable WO effects at the same confidence levels, while the rates drop to $\sim 0.01$ in the more pessimistic scenarios. The most likely lens masses probed by LISA are in the range $(10^3, 10^8)\, M_{\odot}$, and the most probable redshifts are in the range $(0.3, 1.7)$. Therefore, LISA observations of WO effects can probe low-mass DM halos, complementing strong lensing and other observations.</description>

Abstract: This work compares cosmological matching conditions used in approximating generic pre-inflationary phases of the universe. We show that the joining conditions for primordial scalar perturbations assumed by Contaldi et al. are inconsistent with the physically motivated Israel junction conditions, however; performing general relativistic matching with the aforementioned constraints results in unrealistic primordial power spectra. Eliminating the need for ambiguous matching, we look at an alternative semi-analytic model for producing the primordial power spectrum allowing for finite duration cosmological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Recovering 21cm Monopole Signals Without Smoothness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We expect the monopole signal at the lowest frequencies below $100\,$MHz to be composed to two components: the deep Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cosmic microwave background and two distinct features: the dark ages trough at $\sim 17\,$MHz and the cosmic dawn trough at $\sim 75\,$Mhz. These are hidden under orders of magnitude brighter foregrounds whose emission is approximately a power-law with a spectral index $\approx -2.5$. It is usually assumed that monopole signals of interest are separable from foregrounds on the basis of spectral smoothness. We argue that this is a difficult approach and likely impossible for the Dark Ages trough. Instead, we suggest that the fluctuations in the foreground emission around the sky should be used to build a model distribution of possible shapes of foregrounds, which can be used to constrain presence of a monopole signal. We implement this idea using normalizing flows and show that this technique allows for efficient unsupervised detection of the amplitude, width and center of the Dark Ages trough as well as Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cosmic microwave background for a sufficiently sensitive experiment. We discuss the limitations of the inherent assumptions in this method and the impact on the design of future low-frequency experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a cosmological model in which a fraction of the dark matter is atomic dark matter (ADM). This ADM consists of dark versions of the electron and of the proton, interacting with each other and with dark photons just as their light sector versions do, but interacting with everything else only gravitationally. We find constraints given current cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, with and without an $H_0$ prior, and with and without enforcing a big bang nucleosynthesis consistent helium abundance. We find that, at low dark photon temperature, one can have consistency with BAO and CMB data, with a fraction of dark matter that is ADM ($f_{\rm adm}$) as large as $\sim 0.1$. Such a large $f_{\rm adm}$ leads to a suppression of density fluctuations today on scales below about 60 Mpc that may be of relevance to the $\sigma_8$ tension. Our work motivates calculation of nonlinear corrections to matter power spectrum predictions in the ADM model. We forecast parameter constraints to come from future ground-based CMB surveys, and find that if ADM is indeed the cause of the $\sigma_8$ tension, the influence of the ADM, primarily on CMB lensing, will likely be detectable at high significance.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on the Dark Energy with a Quadratic Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel late-time effective dark energy model characterized by a quadratic equation of state (EoS) and rigorously examine its observational constraints. Initially, we delve into the background dynamics of this model, tracing the evolution of fluctuations in linear order. Our approach involves substituting the conventional cosmological constant with a dynamically effective dark energy fluid. Leveraging a diverse array of observational datasets encompassing the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Type Ia Supernovae (SNe), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and a prior on the Hubble constant $H_0$ (R21), we constrain the model parameters. We establish the model's consistency by comparing the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift against observational Hubble data (OHD), benchmarking its performance against the Standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Additionally, our investigation delves into studies of the model's dynamical behavior by computing cosmological parameters such as the deceleration parameter, relative Hubble parameter, and the evolution of the Hubble rate. Furthermore, employing Bayesian analysis, we determine the Bayesian Evidence for our proposed model compared to the reference $\Lambda$CDM model. While our analysis unveils the favorable behavior of the model in various observational tests, the well-known cosmological tensions persist when the full dataset combination is explored.</description>

Abstract: Recently, much attention has been focused on the false vacuum islands that are flooded by an expanding ocean of true-vacuum bubbles slightly later than most of the other parts of the world. These delayed decay regions will accumulate locally larger vacuum energy density by staying in the false vacuum longer than those already transited into the true vacuum. A false vacuum island with thus acquired density contrast of a super-horizon size will evolve locally from radiation dominance to vacuum dominance, creating a local baby Universe that can be regarded effectively as a local closed Universe. If such density contrasts of super-horizon sizes can ever grow large enough to exceed the threshold of gravitational collapse, primordial black holes will form similar to those collapsing curvature perturbations on super-horizon scales induced by small-scale enhancements during inflation. If not, such density contrasts can still induce curvature perturbations potentially observable today. In this paper, we revisit and elaborate on the generations of primordial black holes and curvature perturbations from delayed-decayed false vacuum islands during asynchronous first-order phase transitions with fitting formulas convenient for future model-independent studies.</description>

      <title>The galaxy-galaxy strong lensing cross section and the internal distribution of matter in {\Lambda}CDM substructure</title>

Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe of the detailed distribution of matter in lenses, while magnifying and bringing faint background sources into view. Observed strong lensing by massive galaxy clusters, which are often in complex dynamical states, has also been used to map their dark matter substructures on smaller scales. Deep high resolution imaging has revealed the presence of strong lensing events associated with these substructures, namely galaxy-scale sub-halos. However, an inventory of these observed galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) events is noted to be discrepant with state-of-the-art {\Lambda}CDM simulations. Cluster sub-halos appear to be over-concentrated compared to their simulated counterparts yielding an order of magnitude higher value of GGSL. In this paper, we explore the possibility of resolving this observed discrepancy by redistributing the mass within observed cluster sub-halos in ways that are consistent within the {\Lambda}CDM paradigm of structure formation. Lensing mass reconstructions from data provide constraints on the mass enclosed within apertures and are agnostic to the detailed mass profile within them. Therefore, as the detailed density profile within cluster sub-halos currently remains unconstrained by data, we are afforded the freedom to redistribute the enclosed mass. We investigate if rearranging the mass to a more centrally concentrated density profile helps alleviate the GGSL discrepancy. We report that refitting cluster sub-halos to the ubiquitous {\Lambda}CDM-motivated Navarro-Frenk-White profile, and further modifying them to include significant baryonic components, does not resolve this tension. A resolution to this persisting GGSL discrepancy may require more careful exploration of alternative dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detection of ultra high frequency gravitational waves from compact binary coalescenses with resonant cavities</title>

Abstract: This article aims at clarifying the situation about astrophysical sources that might be observed with haloscope experiments sensitive to gravitational waves in the 1-10 GHz band. The GrAHal setup is taken as a benchmark. We follow a very pedagogical path so that the full analysis can easily be used by the entire community who might not be familiar with the theoretical framework. Different relevant physical regimes are considered in details and some formulas encountered in the literature are revised. In particular, we carefully take into account the fast drift of the gravitational wave frequency and the relevant experimental timescales. We also relax the usual assumption that only the merging phase should be considered. The distances that can be probed and expected event rates are carefully evaluated, taking into account degeneracies between physical parameters. We show where experimental efforts should be focused to improve the sensitivity and we conclude that any detection in the near future is extremely unlikely.</description>

      <title>General bubble expansion at strong coupling</title>

Abstract: The strongly coupled system like the quark-hadron transition (if it is of first order) is becoming an active play yard for the physics of cosmological first-order phase transitions. However, the traditional field theoretic approach to strongly coupled first-order phase transitions is of great challenge, driving recent efforts from holographic dual theories with explicit numerical simulations. These holographic numerical simulations have revealed an intriguing linear correlation between the phase pressure difference (pressure difference away from the wall) to the nonrelativistic terminal velocity of an expanding planar wall, which has been reproduced analytically alongside both cylindrical and spherical walls from perfect-fluid hydrodynamics in our previous study but only for a bag equation of state. We also found, in our previous study, a universal quadratic correlation between the wall pressure difference (pressure difference near the bubble wall) to the nonrelativistic terminal wall velocity regardless of wall geometries. In this paper, we will generalize these analytic relations between the phase/wall pressure difference and terminal wall velocity into a more realistic equation of state beyond the simple bag model, providing the most general predictions so far for future tests from holographic numerical simulations of strongly coupled first-order phase transitions</description>

      <title>An emergent cosmological model from running Newton constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an emergent cosmological model rooted in the Asymptotically Safe antiscreening behavior of the Newton constant at Planckian energies. Distinguishing itself from prior approaches, our model encapsulates the variable nature of $G$ through a multiplicative coupling within the matter Lagrangian, characterized by a conserved energy-momentum tensor. The universe emerges from a quasi-de Sitter phase, transitioning to standard cosmological evolution post-Planck Era. Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of constraining the transition scale to nearly classical cosmology using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and the potential to empirically probe the antiscreening trait of Newton's constant, as predicted by Asymptotic Safety.</description>
