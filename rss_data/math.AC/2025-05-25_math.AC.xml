      <title>Ordinary and symbolic powers of matroids via polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a uniform approach to tackle problems about squarefree monomial ideals whose powers have good properties. We employ this approach to achieve a twofold goal: (i) recover and extend several well--known results in the literature, especially regarding Stanley--Reisner ideals of matroids, and (ii) provide short, elementary proofs for these results. Among them, we provide simple proofs of two celebrated results of Minh and Trung, Varbaro, and Terai and Trung elegantly characterizing the Cohen-Macaulay property, or even Serre's condition $(S_2)$, of symbolic and ordinary powers of squarefree monomial ideals in terms of their combinatorial (matroidal) structure. Our work relies on the interplay of several combinatorial and algebraic concepts, including dualities, polarizations, Serre's conditions, matroids, Hochster-Huneke graphs, vertex decomposability, and careful choices of monomial orders.</description>

      <title>On a Relation between Euler characteristics of \MakeLowercase{de} Rham cohomology and Koszul cohomology of graded local cohomology modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero. Let $R = K[X_0, X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ be standard graded. Let $A_{n+1}(K)$ be the $(n + 1)^{th}$ Weyl algebra over $K$. Let $I$ be a homogeneous ideal of $R$ and let $M = H^i_I(R)$ for some $i \geq 0$.
  By a result of Lyubeznik, $M$ is a graded holonomic $A_{n +1}(K)$-module for each $i \geq 0$. Let $\chi^c(\mathbf{\partial}, M)$ ($\chi^c(\mathbf{X}, M)$) be the Euler characteristics of de Rham cohomology (resp. Koszul cohomology) of $M$. We prove $\chi^c(\mathbf{\partial}, M) = (-1)^{n+1}\chi^c(\mathbf{X}, M)$.</description>

      <title>Endomorphism algebras over commutative rings and torsion in self tensor products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative Noetherian local ring. We study tensor products involving a finitely generated $R$-module $M$ through the natural action of its endomorphism ring. In particular, we study torsion properties of self tensor products in the case where $\operatorname{End}_R(M)$ has an $R^*$-algebra structure, and prove that if $M$ is indecomposable, then $M \otimes_{\operatorname{End}_R(M)} M$ must always have torsion in this case under mild hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Sifted degrees of the equations of the Rees module and their connection with the Artin-Rees numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a noetherian ring, $I$ an ideal of $A$ and $N\subset M$ finitely generated $A$-modules. The relation type of $I$ with respect to $M$, denoted by ${\bf rt}\,(I;M)$, is the maximal degree in a minimal generating set of relations of the Rees module ${\bf R}(I;M)=\oplus_{n\geq 0}I^nM$. It is a well-known invariant that gives a first measure of the complexity of ${\bf R}(I;M)$. To help to measure this complexity, we introduce the sifted type of ${\bf R}(I;M)$, denoted by ${\bf st}\,(I;M)$, a new invariant which counts the non-zero degrees appearing in a minimal generating set of relations of ${\bf R}(I;M)$. Just as the relation type ${\bf rt}\,(I;M/N)$ is closely related to the strong Artin-Rees number ${\bf s}\,(N,M;I)$, it turns out that the sifted type ${\bf st}\,(I;M/N)$ is closely related to the medium Artin-Rees number ${\bf m}\,(N,M;I)$, a new invariant which lies in between the weak and the strong Artin-Rees numbers of $(N,M;I)$. We illustrate the meaning, interest and mutual connection of ${\bf m}\,(N,M;I)$ and ${\bf st}\,(I;M)$ with some examples.</description>

      <title>Reading Rational Univariate Representations on lexicographic Groebner bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we consider a zero-dimensional polynomial system in $n$ variables defined over a field $\mathbb{K}$. In the context of computing a Rational Univariate Representation (RUR) of its solutions, we address the problem of certifying a separating linear form and, once certified, calculating the RUR that comes from it, without any condition on the ideal else than being zero-dimensional. Our key result is that the RUR can be read (closed formula) from lexicographic Groebner bases of bivariate elimination ideals, even in the case where the original ideal that is not in shape position, so that one can use the same core as the well known FGLM method to propose a simple algorithm. Our first experiments, either with a very short code (300 lines) written in Maple or with a Julia code using straightforward implementations performing only classical Gaussian reductions in addition to Groebner bases for the degree reverse lexicographic ordering, show that this new method is already competitive with sophisticated state of the art implementations which do not certify the parameterizations.</description>
