      <title>Future measurements of TCS at JLab Hall C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized parton Distributions (GPDs) are important functions to understand the three dimensional structure of the nucleon. Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering is one of the reaction accessing GPDs, and has been measured for the past $\sim$20 years. However, to move forward, we need to look for other reactions, such as Timelike Compton Scattering (TCS), its "time-reversal" equivalent. Indeed, accessing GPDs from both DVCS and TCS independently will allow us, for instance, to study their universality. Any assesment on GPD's universality would be a milestone in our field. In this article we discuss our preliminary studies on the feasibility of measuring unpolarized and beam polarized cross sections and beam spin asymmetry for TCS in the dilepton photoproduction reaction. For that purpose, we use a polarized photon beam and an unpolarized target at JLab Hall C. We will discuss our Geant4 simulations, with a dedicated detector setup along with the use of the SBS magnet for separating outgoing $e^{+}$, $e^{-}$ pairs.</description>

      <title>Double Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering at Jefferson Lab Hall A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents our project and perspectives to measure for the first time beam spin asymmetries from Double Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering in the $eP\to e'P' \mu^+\mu^-$ reaction at Jefferson Lab. Our goal is to constrain the so-called Generalized Parton Distribution (GPDs) in a kinematic region that isn't accessible from other reactions, such as Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering, to allow for their extrapolation to "zero skewness", i.e. at a specific kinematic point enabling for tomographic interpretations of the nucleon's partonic structure. We are discussing DDVCS phenomenology and our approach, as well as our experimental project aimed at complementing the SoLID experiment at JLab Hall A with a new muon detector.</description>

      <title>Study of forbidden $\beta$ decays within the realistic shell model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, half-lives and energy spectra of forbidden $\beta$ decays are calculated within the realistic shell model. Namely, we approach this issue starting from a realistic nucleon-nucleon potential and deriving effective Hamiltonians and decay operators. Our goal is to explore the sensitivity of the shape of calculated energy spectra to the renormalization of forbidden $\beta$ -decay operators, an operation that allows to take into account those configurations that are not explicitly included in the chosen model space. The region that has been considered for this investigation are nuclei outside the $^{78}$Ni core, more precisely we have studied the second-forbidden $\beta$ decays of $^{94}$Nb and $^{99}$Tc, and fourth-forbidden $\beta$ decays of $^{113}$Cd and $^{115}$In, that are currently of a renewed experimental interest in terms of novel spectroscopic techniques. Our results evidence that the introduction of a renormalized $\beta$-decay operator leads to a marked improvement of the reproduction of experimental half-lives. As regards the spectra of both second-forbidden and fourth-forbidden decays, we have found that their calculated shapes are in good agreement with the observed ones, even if scarcely responsive to the renormalization of the decay operator. We carry out also a detailed inspection of the different components of the calculated spectra for a deeper insight about their role in reproducing the experimental shapes.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay: long range quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of ``macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay" (MDBD) for Majorana neutrinos. In this process an antineutrino produced by a nucleus undergoing beta decay, $X \to Y + e^- + \bar \nu_e$, is absorbed as a neutrino by another identical $X$ nucleus via the inverse beta decay reaction, $\nu_e + X \to e^-+Y$. The distinct signature of MDBD is that the total kinetic energy of the two electrons equals twice the endpoint energy of single beta decay. The amplitude for MDBD, a coherent sum over the contribution of different mass states of the intermediate neutrinos, reflects quantum coherence over macroscopic distances, and is a new macroscopic quantum effect. We evaluate the rate of MDBD for a macroscopic sample of ``$X$" material, e.g., tritium, acting both as the source and the target. The accidental background for MDBD originating from two separate single beta decays, which contains two final state neutrinos, can be readily rejected by measuring the energy of the detected two electrons. We discuss the similarities and differences between the MDBD and conventional neutrinoless double beta decay.</description>

      <title>What Can We Learn from Directed Flow at STAR-FTX Energies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results of simulations of directed flow of various hadrons in Au+Au collisions at collision energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3 and 4.5 GeV. Simulations are performed within the model three-fluid dynamics (3FD) and the event simulator based on it (THESEUS). The results are compared with recent STAR data. The directed flows of various particles provide information on dynamics in various parts and at various stages of the colliding system depending on the particle. However, the information on the equation of state is not always directly accessible because of strong influence of the afterburner stage or insufficient equilibration of the matter. It is found that the crossover scenario gives the best overall description of the data. This crossover EoS is soft in the hadronic phase. The transition into QGP in Au+Au collisions occurs at collision energies between 3 and 4.5 GeV, at baryon densities $n_B \geq 4 n_0$ and temperatures $\approx 150$ MeV. In-medium effects in the directed flow of (anti)kaons are discussed.</description>

      <title>Translationally invariant shell model calculation of the quasielastic $(p,2p)$ process at intermediate relativistic energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic beams of heavy ions interacting with various nuclear targets allow to study a broad range of problems starting from nuclear equation of state to the traditional nuclear structure. Some questions which were impossible to answer heretofore -- can be addressed nowadays by using inverse kinematics. These includes the structure of short-lived nuclei and the precision study of exclusive channels with production of residual nuclei in certain quantum states. Theoretical understanding such processes is so far based on factorization models which combine the single-step amplitude of the reaction on a bound nucleon or nuclear cluster with a certain wave function of its relative motion with respect to the residual nucleus. The nuclear structure information is encoded in the spectroscopic amplitude, calculable within nuclear many-body theories. In this work, we use for this purpose the translationally-invariant shell model with configuration mixing and demonstrate that it successfully reproduces the single-differential and integrated cross sections of the quasielastic proton knockout, $^{12}\mbox{C}(p,2p)^{11}\mbox{B}$, with outgoing $^{11}$B in the ground state and low-lying excited states measured at GSI at 400 MeV/nucleon.</description>

      <title>Causal hydrodynamic fluctuations in a one-dimensional expanding system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive equations of motion of hydrodynamic fluctuations performing perturbative expansion of the energy-momentum conservation equations around the boost invariant solution in one-dimensional expanding system. In the course of derivation, we do not assume any specific forms of constitutive equations for shear stress tensor $\pi^{\mu \nu}$ and bulk pressure $\Pi$. Therefore, the framework enables us to employ any constitutive equations beyond the Navier-Stokes theory which satisfy the causality. Employing Israel-Stewart equations as examples of the constitutive equations, we demonstrate the dynamics of causal hydrodynamic fluctuations in (1+1)-dimensional Milne coordinates. We observe that structure of energy density fluctuations is almost frozen in the early stage of the expansion. Two-point correlations of energy density fluctuations turn out to be closely related with the properties of the medium such as sound velocity, viscosity, and relaxation time. Furthermore, we show that two-particle correlation functions of final hadrons after freezeout inherit correlations of thermodynamic variables and flow rapidity. This opens a new door for an analysis of transport properties of the medium produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Light Hypernuclei Production in Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3 GeV within Thermodynamic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulations of the $\Lambda$-hyperon and light-hypernuclei production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3 GeV were performed within updated Three-fluid Hydrodynamics-based Event Simulator Extended by UrQMD (Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics) final State interactions (THESEUS). The light (hyper)nuclei are treated thermodynamically, i.e. they are considered on the equal basis with hadrons. The only additional parameter is related to the late freeze-out that imitates the afterburner stage for the light (hyper)nuclei because the UrQMD is not able to dynamically treat them. The calculation of hypernuclei production is completely similar to that of light nuclei. The hypernuclei results are compared with recent STAR data. It is found that the calculated midrapidity $_\Lambda^3$H/$\Lambda$ ratio falls within the error bars of the experimental point. It is remarkable that large difference between the $t/p$ and $_\Lambda^3$H/$\Lambda$ ratios is reproduced without any additional parameters. Rapidity distributions of $_\Lambda^3$H/$\Lambda$ and $_\Lambda^4$He/$\Lambda$ ratios are predicted. Midrapidity mean transverse momenta of protons, $\Lambda$s and light (hyper)nuclei in central collisions well agree with the data. The calculated directed flow also reasonably well reproduces of the data.</description>

      <title>Quantum-number projected generator coordinate method for $^{21}$Ne with a chiral two-nucleon-plus-three-nucleon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a study of the low-lying states of deformed $^{21}$Ne within the framework of quantum-number projected generator coordinate method (PGCM), starting from a chiral two-nucleon-plus-three-nucleon (NN+3N) interaction. The wave functions of states are constructed as a linear combination of a set of axially-deformed Hartree-Fock-Bogliubov (HFB) wave functions with different quadrupole deformations. These HFB wave functions are projected onto different angular momenta and the correct neutron and proton numbers for $^{21}$Ne. The results of calculations based on the effective Hamiltonians derived by normal-ordering the 3N interaction with respect to three different reference states, including the quantum-number projected HFB wave functions for $^{20}$Ne, $^{22}$Ne, and an ensemble of them with equal weights, are compared. This study serves as a key step towards ab initio calculations of odd-mass deformed nuclei with the in-medium GCM.</description>
