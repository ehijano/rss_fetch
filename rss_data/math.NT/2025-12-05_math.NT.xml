      <title>A Perfect Number Generalization and Some Euclid-Euler Type Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new generalization of the perfect numbers, called $\mathcal{S}$-perfect numbers. Briefly stated, an $\mathcal{S}$-perfect number is an integer equal to a weighted sum of its proper divisors, where the weights are drawn from some fixed set $\mathcal{S}$ of integers. After a short exposition of the definitions and some basic results, we present our preliminary investigations into the $\mathcal{S}$-perfect numbers for various special sets $\mathcal{S}$ of small cardinality. In particular, we show that there are infinitely many $\{0, m\}$-perfect numbers and $\{-1,m\}$-perfect numbers for every $m \geq 1$. We also provide a characterization of the $\{-1,m\}$-perfect numbers of the form $2^kp$ ($k \geq 1$, $p$ an odd prime), as well as a characterization of all even $\{-1, 1\}$-perfect numbers.</description>

      <title>On special values of meromorphic Drinfeld modular forms of arbitrary rank at CM points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we introduce meromorphic Drinfeld modular forms of arbitrary rank equipped with a particular arithmeticity property. We also study their special values at CM points and show the algebraic independence of these values under some conditions. Our results may be seen as a generalization of Chang's results on the special values of arithmetic Drinfeld modular forms in the rank two setting.</description>

      <title>Generalized discrete Markov spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the special subset of the Markov-Lagrange spectrum (and the Markov spectrum) called the discrete Markov spectrum. The discrete Markov spectrum is defined in terms of the Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz.$ Using the tool called snake graphs, originating from cluster algebra theory, we first reconstruct proofs of its properties in a combinatorial framework and then extend it to the generalized setting. We then introduce the generalized discrete Markov spectrum, defined analogously via the generalized Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k_1 yz + k_2 zx + k_3 xy = (3 + k_1 + k_2 + k_3) xyz.$ We prove that this generalized spectrum is contained in the Markov-Lagrange spectrum and thus the Markov spectrum.</description>

      <title>On the classicality theorem and its applications to the automorphy lifting theorem and the Breuil-M$\mathrm{\acute{e}}$zard conjecture in some $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_{p^2})$ cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study locally analytic vectors in the "partially" completed cohomology of Shimura varieties associated with some rank $2$ unitary groups over a totally real field $F^+$ such that $F^+_v = \mathbb{Q}_{p^2}$ for some $p$-adic places $v$ and prove a certain classicality theorem. This is a partial generalization and modification of Lue Pan's work in the modular curve case by using the works of Caraiani-Scholze, Koshikawa and Zou on mod $l$ cohomology of Shimura varieties. As applications, we prove the automorphy lifting theorem and the Breuil-M$\mathrm{\acute{e}}$zard conjecture in some $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_{p^2})$ cases. We will assume a technical regularity condition on Serre weights of residual representations, but we don't assume any technical condition on the properties of liftings of residual representations at $p$-adic places except Hodge-Tate regularity. It should be noted that previously, such results were known only when we assumed that $F^+_v$ is equal to $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for any $p$-adic place $v$ of $F^+$ so that we can use the $p$-adic Langlands correspondence of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. Moreover, we propose a conjectural strategy to prove such results in some $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_{p^f})$ cases.</description>

      <title>Potential Automorphy of K3 Surfaces with Large Picard Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first part of this paper studied $\mathrm{GSp}_4$-type abelian varieties and the corresponding compatible systems of $\mathrm{GSp}_4$ representations. Techniques in \cite{BCGP} are applied to show that one can prove the potential modularity of these abelian varieties and compatible systems under some conditions that guarantee a sufficient amount of good primes. Then, in the second part, we use the potential modularity theorems to prove that K3 surfaces over totally real field $F$ with Picard rank $\ge 17$ are potentially modular.</description>

      <title>Existentially defining valuations in function fields over large fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a large field such that $K[\sqrt{-1}]$ is not algebraically closed and $F/K$ a function field in one variable. Extending techniques and results from earlier work with Becher and Dittmann, we show that every valuation ring on $F$ containing $K$ is existentially definable in the language of rings with parameters from $F$. As a consequence, using a known reduction technique, we obtain the undecidability of the existential theory of $F$ in the language of rings with appropriately chosen parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the famous proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles using the modularity of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$, significant developments have been made in the study of Diophantine equations using the modularity method. This article presents a survey of numerous results on the solutions of the generalized Fermat equation of signatures $(p,p,p)$, $(p,p,2)$, $(p,p,3)$, and $(r,r,p)$ over totally real number fields using the modularity method.</description>

      <title>On the Outer Automorphism Groups of the Absolute Galois Groups of 2-adic local Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of 2-adic local fields from the point of view of anabelian geometry. Let us recall that it is well-known that the natural homomorphism from the automorphism group of a mixed-characteristic local field to the outer automorphism group of the absolute Galois group of the given mixed-characteristic local field is injective. Moreover, Hoshi and the author of the present paper proved that, for absolutely abelian mixed-characteristic local fields with odd residue characteristic $p$ and even extension degree over ${\mathbb Q}_p$, this subgroup arising from field automorphisms is not normal in the outer automorphism group and has infinitely many distinct conjugates. As a result in this direction, one of the main results of the present paper is the assertion that if a 2-adic local field satisfies certain conditions, then the set of conjugates of the subgroup arising from field automorhisms in the outer automorphism group is infinite, which thus implies that this subgroup is not normal in the outer automorphism group. On the other hand, for an odd prime number $p$, Hoshi proved the existence of an irreducible Hodge-Tate $p$-adic representation of dimension two of the absolute Galois group of a $p$-adic local field and an automorphism of the absolute Galois group such that the $p$-adic Galois representation obtained by pulling back the given $p$-adic Galois representation by the given automorphism is not Hodge-Tate. As a result in a direction that is different from the above direction, another main result of the present paper is the existence of a pair of a representation and an automorphism that is
  similar to the above pair in the case where $p=2$.</description>

      <title>Marton's Conjecture in Finite Fields of Odd Characteristic via a Polynomial Stability Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study small-doubling subsets of finite-dimensional vector spaces over finite fields of odd characteristic. Let $A \subset \mathbb{F}_p^n$ be non-empty with $|A+A| \le K|A|$. We prove that $A$ can be covered by at most $K^{O(1)}$ cosets of a subspace $H \le \mathbb{F}_p^n$ with $|H| \le K^{O(1)}|A|$, giving a polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa (PFR/Marton) theorem in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ for odd primes $p$. The key input is a polynomial stability lemma which yields a dichotomy: either the $L^4$ Fourier mass of $1_A$ concentrates on a span of dimension $\operatorname{poly}(K)$, or in a quotient of codimension $\operatorname{poly}(K)$ the doubling constant decreases by at least $K^{-C}$. Iterating the latter alternative and combining it with standard covering arguments gives the polynomial-structured conclusion. In conjunction with the characteristic-$2$ results of Green, Gowers, Manners, and Tao, our methods provide an alternative finite-field route to Marton-type Freiman--Ruzsa theorems across all characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known consequence of Schur's theorem is that for $r\in \mathbb{N}$, if $n$ is sufficiently large, then any $r$-colouring of $[n]$ results in monochromatic $a,b,c\in [n]$ such that $ab=c$. In this paper we are interested in the threshold at which the binomial random set $[n]_p$ almost surely inherits this Ramsey-type property. In particular for $r=2$ colours, we show that this threshold lies between $n^{-1/9-o(1)}$ and $n^{-1/11}$. Whilst analogous questions for solutions to (sets of) linear equations are now well understood, our work suggests that both the behaviour of the thresholds and the proof methods needed to determine them differ substantially in the non-linear setting.</description>

      <title>Improvements on dimension growth results and effective Hilbert's irreducibility theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We sharpen and generalize the dimension growth bounds for the number of points of bounded height lying on an irreducible algebraic variety of degree $d$, over any global field. In particular, we focus on the affine hypersurface situation by relaxing the condition on the top degree homogeneous part of the polynomial describing the affine hypersurface, while sharpening the dependence on the degree in the bounds compared to previous results. We formulate a conjecture about plane curves which provides a conjectural approach to the uniform degree $3$ case (the only remaining open case). For induction on dimension, we develop a higher dimensional effective version of Hilbert's irreducibility theorem, which is of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Let $\alpha, \beta$ be two relatively prime algebraic integers in a number field $K$ and $N$ be a positive integer. We show that the number of $n\in\{1,2,\dots,N\}$ such that the $\beta$-adic expansion of $\alpha^n$ omits a given digit is less than $C_1 N^{\sigma(\beta)}$, where $\sigma(\beta):=\frac{\log(|N(\beta)|-1)}{\log|N(\beta)|}$ and $C_1$ is an absolute constant, if all prime ideal factors of $\beta$ are unramified and their norms are integer primes.</description>

      <title>Restrictions of Maass forms on $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ to hyperbolic surfaces and geodesic tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\psi$ be an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass form with a large spectral parameter $\lambda&gt;0$ on a compact arithmetic congruence hyperbolic 3-manifold $X=\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})/\mathrm{SU}(2)$, and let $Y$ be a totally geodesic surface in $X$ with bounded diameter. The local $L^2$-bound for the restriction of $\psi$ to $Y$ is $\|\psi|_Y\|_{L^2(Y)}\ll \lambda^{1/4}$ by Burq, G\'erard, and Tzvetkov. We apply the method of arithmetic amplification developed by Iwaniec and Sarnak to obtain a power saving over the local bound. The new feature in the proof is that we establish two different estimates for the integrals of $\psi|_Y$ against geodesic beams over $Y$ via two amplification arguments. Combining these estimates, we can improve the local bound for generalized Fourier coefficients of $\psi|_Y$ against eigenfunctions on $Y$ with spectral parameters near $\lambda$. We also apply the amplification method to obtain a power saving over the trivial bound $O(1)$ for $L^2$-norms of $\psi$ restricted to $\lambda^{-1/2}$-neighborhoods of unit-length geodesic segments. Consequently, by applying a result of Blair and Sogge, we obtain power savings over the local $L^p$-bounds of $\psi$ by Sogge for $2&lt;p&lt;4$ from our improved bound for the Kakeya-Nikodym norm.</description>

Abstract: Supersingular elliptic curve isogeny graphs underlie isogeny-based cryptography. For isogenies of a single prime degree $\ell$, their structure has been investigated graph-theoretically. We generalise the notion of $\ell$-isogeny graphs to $L$-isogeny graphs (studied in the prime field case by Delfs and Galbraith), where $L$ is a set of small primes dictating the allowed isogeny degrees in the graph. We analyse the graph-theoretic structure of $L$-isogeny graphs. Our approaches may be put into two categories: cycles and graph cuts.
  On the topic of cycles, we provide: a count for the number of cycles in the $L$-isogeny graph with cyclic kernels using traces of Brandt matrices; an efficiently computable estimate based on this approach; and a third ideal-theoretic count for a certain subclass of $L$-isogeny cycles. We provide code to compute each of these three counts.
  On the topic of graph cuts, we compare several algorithms to compute graph cuts which minimise a measure called the edge expansion, outlining a cryptographic motivation for doing so. Our results show that a greedy neighbour algorithm out-performs standard spectral algorithms for computing optimal graph cuts. We provide code and study explicit examples.
  Furthermore, we describe several directions of active and future research.</description>

      <title>Divisibility properties of weighted $k$ regular partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a generalized class of weighted $k$-regular partitions defined by \[ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_{k, r_1, r_2}(n) q^n = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(1 - q^{nk})^{r_1}}{(1 - q^n)^{r_2}}, \] which extends the classical $k$-regular partition function $b_k(n)$. We establish new infinite families of Ramanujan-type congruences, divisibility results, and positive-density prime sets for which $c_{k, r_1, r_2}(n)$ vanishes modulo a given prime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of positive characteristic with no algebraically closed subfield. Let $F$ be a function field over $K$ and $t \in F$ transcendental over $K$. Refining a result of Eisentr{\"a}ger and Shlapentokh, we show that there is no algorithm which, on input a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[t][X_1, \ldots, X_n]$, determines whether $f$ has a zero in $F^n$. To this end, we revisit and partially extend several recent results from the literature on existential definability in function fields.</description>

      <title>Cobham's theorem for the Gaussian integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming the four exponentials conjecture, Hansel and Safer showed that if a subset $S$ of the Gaussian integers is both $\alpha=-m+i $- and $\beta=-n+i$-recognizable, then it is syndetic, and they conjectured that $S$ must be eventually periodic. Without assuming the four exponentials conjecture, we show that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are multiplicatively independent Gaussian integers, and at least one of $\alpha$, $\beta$ is not an $n$-th root of an integer, then any $\alpha$- and $\beta$-automatic configuration is eventually periodic; in particular we prove Hansel and Safer's conjecture. Otherwise, there exist non-eventually periodic configurations which are $\alpha$-automatic for any root of an integer $\alpha$. Our work generalises the Cobham-Semenov theorem to Gaussian numerations.</description>

      <title>An inverse theorem on sets with rich additive structure modulo primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove several results on the structure of maximal sets $S \subseteq [N]$ such that $S$ mod $p$ is contained in a short arithmetic progression, or the union of short progressions, where $p$ ranges over a subset of primes in an interval $[y,2y]$ with $(\log N)^{O(1)} &lt; y \leq N$. We also provide several constructions demonstrating the sharpness of our results. Furthermore, as an application, we provide several improvements on the larger sieve bound for $|S|$ when $S$ mod $p$ has strong additive structure, parallel to the work of Green--Harper and Shao for improvements on the large sieve.</description>

      <title>Weight aspect asymptotic and simultaneous non-vanishing for Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we show simultaneous non-vanishing of two Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions by proving an asymptotic result in weight aspect. The main input of this paper is to remove the $t$-integral dependence from the result of Blomer-Harcos (see \cite{BH2}) and getting a square root exponent for the error term.</description>

      <title>Modular Periodicity of Random Initialized Recurrences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical studies of the Fibonacci sequence focus on its periodicity modulo $m$ (the Pisano periods) with canonical initialization. We investigate instead the complete periodic structure arising from all $m^2$ possible initializations in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. We discover perfect chiral symmetry between the Fibonacci recurrence $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and its parity transform $a_n = - a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and observe fractal self-similarity in the extension from prime to prime power moduli. Additionally, we classify prime moduli based on their quadratic reciprocity and demonstrate that periodic sequences exhibit weight preservation under modular extension. Furthermore, we define a minima distribution $P(n)$ governed by Lucas ratios, which satisfies the symmetric relation $P(n)=P(1-n)$. For cyclotomic recurrences, we propose explicit counting functions for the number of distinct periods with connections to necklace enumeration. These findings imply potential connections to Viswanath's random recurrence, modular forms and L-functions.</description>

      <title>Counting roots of unity on the graphs of Laurent series over non-Archimedean local fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We completely classify Laurent series converging on the unit circle over a non-Archimedean local field (of any characteristic) that map infinitely many roots of unity to roots of unity. For a given Laurent series $f$ over a field of positive characteristic with residue field $\mathbb{F}_q$, we prove effective bounds for the number of possible roots of unity in terms of the number of zeroes of the auxilliary function $f(x^q)-f(x)^q$ on the unit circle. In characteristic $0$ our bound is still effective but also depends on the ramification degree of the base field over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ as well as the size of the coefficients of $f$. This has applications to the Manin-Mumford conjecture in $\mathbb{G}_m^2$. In characteristic $0$, this work builds upon a pigeon-hole based method by Schmidt.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16348v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the power of nearly purely operational techniques in the study of umbral calculus. We present a concise reconstruction of the theory based on a systematic use of linear operators, with particular attention to umbral operators. We also give an in-depth study of the generating functions associated to umbral calculus, and show how these lead to short proofs of several advanced results, including the Lagrange-B\"urmann inversion theorem. Finally, we discuss pseudoinverses for delta operators and illustrate our methods with a variety of examples.</description>

      <title>Convolutive sequences, I: Through the lens of integer partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the convolutive behavior of the counting function for partitions with designated summands in which all parts are odd, we consider coefficient sequences $(a_n)_{n\ge 0}$ of primitive eta-products that satisfy the generic convolutive property
  \begin{align*}
  \sum_{n\ge 0} a_{mn} q^n = \left(\sum_{n\ge 0} a_n q^n\right)^m
  \end{align*}
  for a specific positive integer $m$. Given the results of an exhaustive search of the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences for such sequences for $m$ up to $6$, we first focus on the case where $m=2$ with our attention mainly paid to the combinatorics of two $2$-convolutive sequences, featuring bijective proofs for both. For other $2$-convolutive sequences discovered in the OEIS, we apply generating function manipulations to show their convolutivity. We also give two examples of $3$-convolutive sequences. Finally, we discuss other convolutive series that are not eta-products.</description>
