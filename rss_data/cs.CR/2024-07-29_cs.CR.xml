      <title>Privacy-Preserving Model-Distributed Inference at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on designing a privacy-preserving Machine Learning (ML) inference protocol for a hierarchical setup, where clients own/generate data, model owners (cloud servers) have a pre-trained ML model, and edge servers perform ML inference on clients' data using the cloud server's ML model. Our goal is to speed up ML inference while providing privacy to both data and the ML model. Our approach (i) uses model-distributed inference (model parallelization) at the edge servers and (ii) reduces the amount of communication to/from the cloud server. Our privacy-preserving hierarchical model-distributed inference, privateMDI design uses additive secret sharing and linearly homomorphic encryption to handle linear calculations in the ML inference, and garbled circuit and a novel three-party oblivious transfer are used to handle non-linear functions. privateMDI consists of offline and online phases. We designed these phases in a way that most of the data exchange is done in the offline phase while the communication overhead of the online phase is reduced. In particular, there is no communication to/from the cloud server in the online phase, and the amount of communication between the client and edge servers is minimized. The experimental results demonstrate that privateMDI significantly reduces the ML inference time as compared to the baselines.</description>

      <title>Effect of Data Degradation on Motion Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of virtual and augmented reality devices is increasing, but these sensor-rich devices pose risks to privacy. The ability to track a user's motion and infer the identity or characteristics of the user poses a privacy risk that has received significant attention. Existing deep-network-based defenses against this risk, however, require significant amounts of training data and have not yet been shown to generalize beyond specific applications. In this work, we study the effect of signal degradation on identifiability, specifically through added noise, reduced framerate, reduced precision, and reduced dimensionality of the data. Our experiment shows that state-of-the-art identification attacks still achieve near-perfect accuracy for each of these degradations. This negative result demonstrates the difficulty of anonymizing this motion data and gives some justification to the existing data- and compute-intensive deep-network based methods.</description>

      <title>Effect of Duration and Delay on the Identifiability of VR Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social virtual reality is an emerging medium of communication. In this medium, a user's avatar (virtual representation) is controlled by the tracked motion of the user's headset and hand controllers. This tracked motion is a rich data stream that can leak characteristics of the user or can be effectively matched to previously-identified data to identify a user. To better understand the boundaries of motion data identifiability, we investigate how varying training data duration and train-test delay affects the accuracy at which a machine learning model can correctly classify user motion in a supervised learning task simulating re-identification. The dataset we use has a unique combination of a large number of participants, long duration per session, large number of sessions, and a long time span over which sessions were conducted. We find that training data duration and train-test delay affect identifiability; that minimal train-test delay leads to very high accuracy; and that train-test delay should be controlled in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Capturing the security expert knowledge in feature selection for web application attack detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article puts forward the use of mutual information values to replicate the expertise of security professionals in selecting features for detecting web attacks. The goal is to enhance the effectiveness of web application firewalls (WAFs). Web applications are frequently vulnerable to various security threats, making WAFs essential for their protection. WAFs analyze HTTP traffic using rule-based approaches to identify known attack patterns and to detect and block potential malicious requests. However, a major challenge is the occurrence of false positives, which can lead to blocking legitimate traffic and impact the normal functioning of the application. The problem is addressed as an approach that combines supervised learning for feature selection with a semi-supervised learning scenario for training a One-Class SVM model. The experimental findings show that the model trained with features selected by the proposed algorithm outperformed the expert-based selection approach in terms of performance. Additionally, the results obtained by the traditional rule-based WAF ModSecurity, configured with a vanilla set of OWASP CRS rules, were also improved.</description>

      <title>Homomorphic Encryption-Enabled Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Intrusion Detection in Resource-Constrained IoV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to propose a novel framework to address the data privacy issue for Federated Learning (FL)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) in Internet-of-Vehicles(IoVs) with limited computational resources. In particular, in conventional FL systems, it is usually assumed that the computing nodes have sufficient computational resources to process the training tasks. However, in practical IoV systems, vehicles usually have limited computational resources to process intensive training tasks, compromising the effectiveness of deploying FL in IDSs. While offloading data from vehicles to the cloud can mitigate this issue, it introduces significant privacy concerns for vehicle users (VUs). To resolve this issue, we first propose a highly-effective framework using homomorphic encryption to secure data that requires offloading to a centralized server for processing. Furthermore, we develop an effective training algorithm tailored to handle the challenges of FL-based systems with encrypted data. This algorithm allows the centralized server to directly compute on quantum-secure encrypted ciphertexts without needing decryption. This approach not only safeguards data privacy during the offloading process from VUs to the centralized server but also enhances the efficiency of utilizing FL for IDSs in IoV systems. Our simulation results show that our proposed approach can achieve a performance that is as close to that of the solution without encryption, with a gap of less than 0.8%.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability Detection in Ethereum Smart Contracts via Machine Learning: A Qualitative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart contracts are central to a myriad of critical blockchain applications, from financial transactions to supply chain management. However, their adoption is hindered by security vulnerabilities that can result in significant financial losses. Most vulnerability detection tools and methods available nowadays leverage either static analysis methods or machine learning. Unfortunately, as valuable as they are, both approaches suffer from limitations that make them only partially effective. In this survey, we analyze the state of the art in machine-learning vulnerability detection for Ethereum smart contracts, by categorizing existing tools and methodologies, evaluating them, and highlighting their limitations. Our critical assessment unveils issues such as restricted vulnerability coverage and dataset construction flaws, providing us with new metrics to overcome the difficulties that restrain a sound comparison of existing solutions. Driven by our findings, we discuss best practices to enhance the accuracy, scope, and efficiency of vulnerability detection in smart contracts. Our guidelines address the known flaws while at the same time opening new avenues for research and development. By shedding light on current challenges and offering novel directions for improvement, we contribute to the advancement of secure smart contract development and blockchain technology as a whole.</description>

      <title>VeriCHERI: Exhaustive Formal Security Verification of CHERI at the RTL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting data in memory from attackers continues to be a concern in computing systems. CHERI is a promising approach to achieve such protection, by providing and enforcing fine-grained memory protection directly in the hardware. Creating trust for the entire system stack, however, requires a gap-free verification of CHERI's hardware-based protection mechanisms. Existing verification methods for CHERI target the abstract ISA model rather than the underlying hardware implementation. Fully ensuring the CHERI security guarantees for a concrete RTL implementation is a challenge in previous flows and demands high manual efforts. This paper presents VeriCHERI, a novel approach to security verification. It is conceptionally different from previous works in that it does not require any ISA specification. Instead of checking compliance with a golden ISA model, we check against well-established global security objectives of confidentiality and integrity. Fully covering these objectives, VeriCHERI uses as few as four unbounded properties to exhaustively prove or disprove any vulnerability. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of VeriCHERI on a RISC-V based processor implementing a CHERI variant.</description>

      <title>A Public Dataset For the ZKsync Rollup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite blockchain data being publicly available, practical challenges and high costs often hinder its effective use by researchers, thus limiting data-driven research and exploration in the blockchain space. This is especially true when it comes to Layer~2 (L2) ecosystems, and ZKsync, in particular. To address these issues, we have curated a dataset from 1 year of activity extracted from a ZKsync Era archive node and made it freely available to external parties. In this paper, we provide details on this dataset and how it was created, showcase a few example analyses that can be performed with it, and discuss some future research directions. We also publish and share the code used in our analysis on GitHub to promote reproducibility and to support further research.</description>

      <title>Java-Class-Hijack: Software Supply Chain Attack for Java based on Maven Dependency Resolution and Java Classloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Java-Class-Hijack, a novel software supply chain attack that enables an attacker to inject malicious code by crafting a class that shadows a legitimate class that is in the dependency tree. We describe the attack, provide a proof-of-concept demonstrating its feasibility, and replicate it in the German Corona-Warn-App server application. The proof-of-concept illustrates how a transitive dependency deep within the dependency tree can hijack a class from a direct dependency and entirely alter its behavior, posing a significant security risk to Java applications. The replication on the Corona-Warn-App demonstrates how compromising a small JSON validation library could result in a complete database takeover.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Scalable Detection and Investigation of Cyber Persistence Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks, achieving stealthy persistence within target systems is often crucial for an attacker's success. This persistence allows adversaries to maintain prolonged access, often evading detection mechanisms. Recognizing its pivotal role in the APT lifecycle, this paper introduces Cyber Persistence Detector (CPD), a novel system dedicated to detecting cyber persistence through provenance analytics. CPD is founded on the insight that persistent operations typically manifest in two phases: the "persistence setup" and the subsequent "persistence execution". By causally relating these phases, we enhance our ability to detect persistent threats. First, CPD discerns setups signaling an impending persistent threat and then traces processes linked to remote connections to identify persistence execution activities. A key feature of our system is the introduction of pseudo-dependency edges (pseudo-edges), which effectively connect these disjoint phases using data provenance analysis, and expert-guided edges, which enable faster tracing and reduced log size. These edges empower us to detect persistence threats accurately and efficiently. Moreover, we propose a novel alert triage algorithm that further reduces false positives associated with persistence threats. Evaluations conducted on well-known datasets demonstrate that our system reduces the average false positive rate by 93% compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>HADES: Detecting Active Directory Attacks via Whole Network Provenance Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its crucial role in identity and access management in modern enterprise networks, Active Directory (AD) is a top target of Advanced Persistence Threat (APT) actors. Conventional intrusion detection systems (IDS) excel at identifying malicious behaviors caused by malware, but often fail to detect stealthy attacks launched by APT actors. Recent advance in provenance-based IDS (PIDS) shows promises by exposing malicious system activities in causal attack graphs. However, existing approaches are restricted to intra-machine tracing, and unable to reveal the scope of attackers' traversal inside a network. We propose HADES, the first PIDS capable of performing accurate causality-based cross-machine tracing by leveraging a novel concept called logon session based execution partitioning to overcome several challenges in cross-machine tracing. We design HADES as an efficient on-demand tracing system, which performs whole-network tracing only when it first identifies an authentication anomaly signifying an ongoing AD attack, for which we introduce a novel lightweight authentication anomaly detection model rooted in our extensive analysis of AD attacks. To triage attack alerts, we present a new algorithm integrating two key insights we identified in AD attacks. Our evaluations show that HADES outperforms both popular open source detection systems and a prominent commercial AD attack detector.</description>

      <title>MistralBSM: Leveraging Mistral-7B for Vehicular Networks Misbehavior Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicular networks are exposed to various threats resulting from malicious attacks. These threats compromise the security and reliability of communications among road users, thereby jeopardizing road and traffic safety. One of the main vectors of these attacks within vehicular networks is misbehaving vehicles. To address this challenge, we propose deploying a pretrained Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered Misbehavior Detection System (MDS) within an edge-cloud detection framework. Specifically, we fine-tune Mistral-7B, a state-of-the-art LLM, as the edge component to enable real-time detection, whereas a larger LLM deployed in the cloud can conduct a more comprehensive analysis. Our experiments conducted on the extended VeReMi dataset demonstrate Mistral-7B's superior performance, achieving 98\% accuracy compared to other LLMs such as LLAMA2-7B and RoBERTa. Additionally, we investigate the impact of window size on computational costs to optimize deployment efficiency. Leveraging LLMs in MDS shows interesting results in improving the detection of vehicle misbehavior, consequently strengthening vehicular network security to ensure the safety of road users.</description>

      <title>The Janus Interface: How Fine-Tuning in Large Language Models Amplifies the Privacy Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) have raised public concerns about the privacy leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) within their extensive training datasets. Recent studies have demonstrated that an adversary could extract highly sensitive privacy data from the training data of LLMs with carefully designed prompts. However, these attacks suffer from the model's tendency to hallucinate and catastrophic forgetting (CF) in the pre-training stage, rendering the veracity of divulged PIIs negligible. In our research, we propose a novel attack, Janus, which exploits the fine-tuning interface to recover forgotten PIIs from the pre-training data in LLMs. We formalize the privacy leakage problem in LLMs and explain why forgotten PIIs can be recovered through empirical analysis on open-source language models. Based upon these insights, we evaluate the performance of Janus on both open-source language models and two latest LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo and LLaMA-2-7b. Our experiment results show that Janus amplifies the privacy risks by over 10 times in comparison with the baseline and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art privacy extraction attacks including prefix attacks and in-context learning (ICL). Furthermore, our analysis validates that existing fine-tuning APIs provided by OpenAI and Azure AI Studio are susceptible to our Janus attack, allowing an adversary to conduct such an attack at a low cost.</description>

      <title>The SkipSponge Attack: Sponge Weight Poisoning of Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sponge attacks aim to increase the energy consumption and computation time of neural networks deployed on hardware accelerators. Existing sponge attacks can be performed during inference via sponge examples or during training via Sponge Poisoning. Sponge examples leverage perturbations added to the model's input to increase energy and latency, while Sponge Poisoning alters the objective function of a model to induce inference-time energy effects. In this work, we propose a novel sponge attack called SkipSponge. SkipSponge is the first sponge attack that is performed directly on the parameters of a pre-trained model using only a few data samples. Our experiments show that SkipSponge can successfully increase the energy consumption of image classification models, GANs, and autoencoders with fewer samples required than Sponge Poisoning. We show that poisoning defenses are ineffective if not adjusted specifically for the defense against SkipSponge (i.e., they decrease target layer bias values). Our work shows that SkipSponge is more effective on the GANs and the autoencoders than the state-of-the-art. Additionally, SkipSponge is stealthier than the previous Sponge Poisoning attack as it does not require significant changes in the victim model's weights. Our experiments indicate that the SkipSponge attack can be performed even when an attacker has access to only 1% of the entire dataset and reaches up to 13% energy increase.</description>

      <title>SafeDecoding: Defending against Jailbreak Attacks via Safety-Aware Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08983v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications such as code generation and chatbot assistance, extensive efforts have been made to align LLM behavior with human values, including safety. Jailbreak attacks, aiming to provoke unintended and unsafe behaviors from LLMs, remain a significant/leading LLM safety threat. In this paper, we aim to defend LLMs against jailbreak attacks by introducing SafeDecoding, a safety-aware decoding strategy for LLMs to generate helpful and harmless responses to user queries. Our insight in developing SafeDecoding is based on the observation that, even though probabilities of tokens representing harmful contents outweigh those representing harmless responses, safety disclaimers still appear among the top tokens after sorting tokens by probability in descending order. This allows us to mitigate jailbreak attacks by identifying safety disclaimers and amplifying their token probabilities, while simultaneously attenuating the probabilities of token sequences that are aligned with the objectives of jailbreak attacks. We perform extensive experiments on five LLMs using six state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks and four benchmark datasets. Our results show that SafeDecoding significantly reduces the attack success rate and harmfulness of jailbreak attacks without compromising the helpfulness of responses to benign user queries. SafeDecoding outperforms six defense methods.</description>

      <title>Leveraging AI Planning For Detecting Cloud Security Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud computing services provide scalable and cost-effective solutions for data storage, processing, and collaboration. Alongside their growing popularity, concerns related to their security vulnerabilities leading to data breaches and sophisticated attacks such as ransomware are growing. To address these, first, we propose a generic framework to express relations between different cloud objects such as users, datastores, security roles, to model access control policies in cloud systems. Access control misconfigurations are often the primary driver for cloud attacks. Second, we develop a PDDL model for detecting security vulnerabilities which can for example lead to widespread attacks such as ransomware, sensitive data exfiltration among others. A planner can then generate attacks to identify such vulnerabilities in the cloud. Finally, we test our approach on 14 real Amazon AWS cloud configurations of different commercial organizations. Our system can identify a broad range of security vulnerabilities, which state-of-the-art industry tools cannot detect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As technology advances, the use of Machine Learning (ML) in cybersecurity is becoming increasingly crucial to tackle the growing complexity of cyber threats. While traditional ML models can enhance cybersecurity, their high energy and resource demands limit their applications, leading to the emergence of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) as a more suitable solution for resource-constrained environments. TinyML is widely applied in areas such as smart homes, healthcare, and industrial automation. TinyML focuses on optimizing ML algorithms for small, low-power devices, enabling intelligent data processing directly on edge devices. This paper provides a comprehensive review of common challenges of TinyML techniques, such as power consumption, limited memory, and computational constraints; it also explores potential solutions to these challenges, such as energy harvesting, computational optimization techniques, and transfer learning for privacy preservation. On the other hand, this paper discusses TinyML's applications in advancing cybersecurity for Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructures (EVCIs) as a representative use case. It presents an experimental case study that enhances cybersecurity in EVCI using TinyML, evaluated against traditional ML in terms of reduced delay and memory usage, with a slight trade-off in accuracy. Additionally, the study includes a practical setup using the ESP32 microcontroller in the PlatformIO environment, which provides a hands-on assessment of TinyML's application in cybersecurity for EVCI.</description>

Abstract: With the rise of various online and mobile payment systems, transaction fraud has become a significant threat to financial security. This study explores the application of advanced machine learning models, specifically based on XGBoost and LightGBM, for developing a more accurate and robust Payment Security Protection Model. To enhance data reliability, we meticulously processed the data sources and applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance and improve data representation. By selecting highly correlated features, we aimed to strengthen the training process and boost model performance. We conducted thorough performance evaluations of our proposed models, comparing them against traditional methods including Random Forest, Neural Network, and Logistic Regression. Using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, we rigorously assessed their effectiveness. Our detailed analyses and comparisons reveal that the combination of SMOTE with XGBoost and LightGBM offers a highly efficient and powerful mechanism for payment security protection. Moreover, the integration of XGBoost and LightGBM in a Local Ensemble model further demonstrated outstanding performance. After incorporating SMOTE, the new combined model achieved a significant improvement of nearly 6\% over traditional models and around 5\% over its sub-models, showcasing remarkable results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of quantum cryptography in everyday applications has gained attention in both industrial and academic fields. Due to advancements in quantum electronics, practical quantum devices are already available in the market, and ready for wider use. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a crucial aspect of quantum cryptography, which involves generating and distributing symmetric cryptographic keys between geographically separated users using principles of quantum physics. Many successful QKD networks have been established to test different solutions. The objective of this paper is to delve into the potential of utilizing established routing design techniques in the context of quantum key distribution, a field distinguished by its unique properties rooted in the principles of quantum mechanics. However, the implementation of these techniques poses substantial challenges, including quantum memory decoherence, key rate generation, latency delays, inherent noise in quantum systems, limited communication ranges, and the necessity for highly specialized hardware. This paper conducts an in-depth examination of essential research pertaining to the design methodologies for quantum key distribution. It also explores the fundamental aspects of quantum routing and the associated properties inherent to quantum QKD. This paper elucidates the necessary steps for constructing efficient and resilient QKD networks. In summarizing the techniques relevant to QKD networking and routing, including their underlying principles, protocols, and challenges, this paper sheds light on potential applications and delineates future research directions in this burgeoning field.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of AES, Blowfish, Twofish, Salsa20, and ChaCha20 for Image Encryption</title>

Abstract: Nowadays, cybersecurity has grown into a more significant and difficult scientific issue. The recog-nition of threats and attacks meant for knowledge and safety on the internet is growing harder to detect. Since cybersecurity guarantees the privacy and security of data sent via the Internet, it is essential, while also providing protection against malicious attacks. Encrypt has grown into an an-swer that has become an essential element of information security systems. To ensure the security of shared data, including text, images, or videos, it is essential to employ various methods and strategies. This study delves into the prevalent cryptographic methods and algorithms utilized for prevention and stream encryption, examining their encoding techniques such as advanced encryp-tion standard (AES), Blowfish, Twofish, Salsa20, and ChaCha20. The primary objective of this re-search is to identify the optimal times and throughputs (speeds) for data encryption and decryption processes. The methodology of this study involved selecting five distinct types of images to com-pare the outcomes of the techniques evaluated in this research. The assessment focused on pro-cessing time and speed parameters, examining visual encoding and decoding using Java as the pri-mary platform. A comparative analysis of several symmetric key ciphers was performed, focusing on handling large datasets. Despite this limitation, comparing different images helped evaluate the techniques' novelty. The results showed that ChaCha20 had the best average time for both encryp-tion and decryption, being over 50% faster than some other algorithms. However, the Twofish algo-rithm had lower throughput during testing. The paper concludes with findings and suggestions for future improvements.</description>

      <title>Attacks on fairness in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning is an important emerging distributed training paradigm that keeps data private on clients. It is now well understood that by controlling only a small subset of FL clients, it is possible to introduce a backdoor to a federated learning model, in the presence of certain attributes. In this paper, we present a new type of attack that compromises the fairness of the trained model. Fairness is understood to be the attribute-level performance distribution of a trained model. It is particularly salient in domains where, for example, skewed accuracy discrimination between subpopulations could have disastrous consequences. We find that by employing a threat model similar to that of a backdoor attack, an attacker is able to influence the aggregated model to have an unfair performance distribution between any given set of attributes. Furthermore, we find that this attack is possible by controlling only a single client. While combating naturally induced unfairness in FL has previously been discussed in depth, its artificially induced kind has been neglected. We show that defending against attacks on fairness should be a critical consideration in any situation where unfairness in a trained model could benefit a user who participated in its training.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Flaw Disclosure for AI: Beyond Security Vulnerabilities</title>

Abstract: Harm reporting in Artificial Intelligence (AI) currently lacks a structured process for disclosing and addressing algorithmic flaws, relying largely on an ad-hoc approach. This contrasts sharply with the well-established Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) ecosystem in software security. While global efforts to establish frameworks for AI transparency and collaboration are underway, the unique challenges presented by machine learning (ML) models demand a specialized approach. To address this gap, we propose implementing a Coordinated Flaw Disclosure (CFD) framework tailored to the complexities of ML and AI issues. This paper reviews the evolution of ML disclosure practices, from ad hoc reporting to emerging participatory auditing methods, and compares them with cybersecurity norms. Our framework introduces innovations such as extended model cards, dynamic scope expansion, an independent adjudication panel, and an automated verification process. We also outline a forthcoming real-world pilot of CFD. We argue that CFD could significantly enhance public trust in AI systems. By balancing organizational and community interests, CFD aims to improve AI accountability in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Unlearnable Examples: Protecting Data against Multimodal Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning (MCL) has shown remarkable advances in zero-shot classification by learning from millions of image-caption pairs crawled from the Internet. However, this reliance poses privacy risks, as hackers may unauthorizedly exploit image-text data for model training, potentially including personal and privacy-sensitive information. Recent works propose generating unlearnable examples by adding imperceptible perturbations to training images to build shortcuts for protection. However, they are designed for unimodal classification, which remains largely unexplored in MCL. We first explore this context by evaluating the performance of existing methods on image-caption pairs, and they do not generalize effectively to multimodal data and exhibit limited impact to build shortcuts due to the lack of labels and the dispersion of pairs in MCL. In this paper, we propose Multi-step Error Minimization (MEM), a novel optimization process for generating multimodal unlearnable examples. It extends the Error-Minimization (EM) framework to optimize both image noise and an additional text trigger, thereby enlarging the optimized space and effectively misleading the model to learn the shortcut between the noise features and the text trigger. Specifically, we adopt projected gradient descent to solve the noise minimization problem and use HotFlip to approximate the gradient and replace words to find the optimal text trigger. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MEM, with post-protection retrieval results nearly half of random guessing, and its high transferability across different models.

      <title>Exploring Scaling Trends in LLM Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language model capabilities predictably improve from scaling a model's size and training data. Motivated by this, increasingly large language models have been trained, yielding an array of impressive capabilities. Yet these models are vulnerable to adversarial prompts, such as "jailbreaks" that hijack models to perform undesired behaviors, posing a significant risk of misuse. Prior work indicates that computer vision models become more robust with model and data scaling, raising the question: does language model robustness also improve with scale? We study this question empirically, finding that larger models respond substantially better to adversarial training, but there is little to no benefit from model scale in the absence of explicit defenses.</description>
