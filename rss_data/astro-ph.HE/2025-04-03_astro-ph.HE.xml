      <title>Transient gamma rays from the 2021 outburst of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi: the effect of gamma-ray absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2021, RS Ophiuchi was the first nova to be detected in the very-high-energy (TeV) gamma-ray domain, directly testifying of efficient acceleration of charged particles up to at least the TeV range at the nova shock. Surprisingly, the TeV gamma-ray signal peaks $\sim 2$ days after the GeV signal and the origin of this delay has still not been clearly understood. We investigate the possibility that this delay is due to the effect of gamma-ray absorption resulted from interactions between gamma rays and optical photons copiously emitted during the outburst. We model particle acceleration at a nova shock to obtain the gamma-ray emission produced in interactions between the accelerated particles and the shocked gas. The effect of gamma-ray absorption is then included in details using the radiative transfer equation. We find that this can naturally account for the delay between the peaks of GeV and TeV gamma-ray lightcurves. This result emphasizes the importance of gamma-ray absorption for interpreting gamma-ray observations of novae in the TeV range which, in turn, demonstrates the necessity of a multi-wavelength view for unraveling the underlying physics of particle acceleration in these systems.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Recursive Short X-ray Burst Behavior of Magnetars Through Crustal Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energetic bursts from strongly magnetized neutron stars, known as magnetars, are typically detected in clusters. Once an active episode begins, anywhere from a few to thousands of hard X-ray bursts can occur over durations ranging from days to months. The temporal clustering of these recurrent bursts during an active episode suggests an underlying mechanism that triggers multiple bursts in rapid succession. These burst clusters are likely crucial for understanding the processes driving magnetar activity. In this study, we investigate the repetitive short X-ray burst behavior of magnetars through crustal interactions, employing the cellular automaton model for the magnetar crust proposed by Lander (2023). Our simulations, based on physically motivated criteria, successfully reproduce burst clustering. Additionally, the durations and energetics of active episodes in our simulations agree well with observational data. We discuss the potential physical mechanisms underlying burst clusters observed in numerous magnetars, as well as the reactivations of an individual magnetar.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength observation of a candidate pulsar halo LHAASO J0621+3755 and the first X-ray detection of PSR J0622+3749</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar halos are regions around middle-aged pulsars extending out to tens of parsecs. The large extent of the halos and well-defined central cosmic-ray accelerators make this new class of Galactic sources an ideal laboratory for studying cosmic-ray transport. LHAASO J0621+3755 is a candidate pulsar halo associated with the middle-aged gamma-ray pulsar PSR J0622+3749. We observed LHAASO J0621+3755 with VERITAS and XMM-Newton in the TeV and X-ray bands, respectively. For this work, we developed a novel background estimation technique for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope observations of such extended sources. No halo emission was detected with VERITAS (0.3--10 TeV) or XMM-Newton (2--7 keV) within 1 degree and 10 arcmin around PSR J0622+3749, respectively. Combined with the LHAASO-KM2A and Fermi-LAT data, VERITAS flux upper limits establish a spectral break at ~1--10 TeV, a unique feature compared with Geminga, the most studied pulsar halo. We model the gamma-ray spectrum and LHAASO-KM2A surface brightness as inverse Compton emission and find suppressed diffusion around the pulsar, similar to Geminga. A smaller diffusion suppression zone and harder electron injection spectrum than Geminga are necessary to reproduce the spectral cutoff. A magnetic field &lt;= 1 uG is required by our XMM-Newton observation and synchrotron spectral modeling, consistent with Geminga. Our findings support slower diffusion and lower magnetic field around pulsar halos than the Galactic averages, hinting at magnetohydrodynamic turbulence around pulsars. Additionally, we report the detection of an X-ray point source spatially coincident with PSR J0622+3749, whose periodicity is consistent with the gamma-ray spin period of 333.2 ms. The soft spectrum of this source suggests a thermal origin.</description>

      <title>Search for Fast Radio Bursts and radio pulsars from pulsing Ultraluminous X-ray Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted targeted fast radio burst (FRB) and pulsar searches on eight pulsing ultraluminous X-ray sources (PULXs) using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) and the Parkes 64-meter Radio Telescope (Murriyang) to investigate whether PULXs could be progenitors of FRBs. FAST carried out 12 observations of four PULXs, totaling 8 hours, while Parkes conducted 12 observations of the remaining four PULXs, totaling 11 hours. No significant signals were detected through single-pulse and periodic searches, covering a dispersion measure (DM) range of 0-5000 pc cm$^{-3}$, placing stringent upper limits on the radio flux density from these sources. The results imply that accretion processes and dense stellar winds in PULXs likely suppress or attenuate potential coherent emission in radio band. Additionally, the beaming factor and luminosity of FRBs associated with PULXs, as well as the highly relativistic and magnetized nature of their outflows, may limit detectability. Non-detection yielded from the observations covering the full orbital phases of PULXs can also constrain the theoretical models that link FRB emission to highly magnetized neutron stars in binary systems.</description>

      <title>GRB 170519A: Thermal Radiation in an X-ray Flare and Decaying Magnetic Fields for the Early-Time Afterglow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB 170519A was discovered by \emph{Swift}/BAT, and then observed by \emph{Swift}/XRT, \emph{Swift}/UVOT, and ground-based telescopes. We report Lick/KAIT observations of GRB 170519A, and make temporal analysis and spectral joint fits of its multiwavelength light curves. The observations present a relatively complete afterglow structure, including two X-ray flares (Flares I and II), optical onset (Slice 1), normal decay (Slices 2 and 3), and a possible jet break. The spectrum of the bright X-ray flare (Flare II) indicates that a thermal component exists at $t = 190$--240~s. \textbf{The blackbody emits in the photospheric radius $R_{\rm ph}\sim 10^{11}$ cm,} and its temperature ($kT$) decreases with time from \textbf{1.08 to 0.37 keV, its Lorentz factor of blackbody ($\Gamma_{\rm BB}$) decreases with time from 67.71 to 46.70. The luminosity of the blackbody ($L_{\rm BB}$), $kT$ and $\Gamma_{\rm BB}$ follow the relations $\bf L_{\rm BB} \propto kT^{2.49\pm 0.03}$ and $\Gamma_{\rm BB}\propto L_{\rm BB}^{0.27}$ (estimated from \cite{fan2012}).} In the optical light curves, there is an onset bump in the early-time afterglow, rising with an index $\alpha_{O,1} \approx -0.43$ and peaking $\sim1174.9$ s since the BAT trigger. The bump then decays with $\bf \alpha_{O,2} \approx 0.88$ in the normal decay phase, and the X-ray flux decays with a similar index of $\bf \alpha_{X,1} \approx 0.95$. There is no obvious spectral evolution in the normal decay phases, with photon index $\hat{\Gamma} = 1.86$ and 1.92 in Slices 2 and 3, respectively. We find that the multiwavelength light curves of the GRB 170519A afterglow can be well fitted by an external shock with time-dependent $\epsilon_B$. In the early afterglow, the value of $\epsilon_B$ decays rapidly from $\bf 4.29\times10^{-2}$ to $\bf 8.23\times10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the reflection spectrum in the ultracompact LMXB 4U 1820-30</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4U 1820-30 is a ultracompact X-ray binary located in the globular cluster NGC 6624, consisting of a neutron star accreting material from a helium white dwarf companion characterized by the shortest known orbital period for this type of star (11.4 minutes). Despite extensive studies, the detection of the relativistic Fe K emission line, has been inconsistently reported and no measurement of the system inclination has been achieved. In this work, we investigate the broadband spectral and polarimetric properties of 4U 1820-30, exploring the presence of a reflection component and its role in shaping the polarization signal. We analyzed simultaneous X-ray observations from NICER, NuSTAR, and IXPE. The spectral continuum was modeled with a disk blackbody, a power law, and a Comptonization component with seed photons originating from a boundary layer. We detected a strong reflection component, described, for the first time, with two self-consistent models ({\tt Relxillns} and {\tt Rfxconv}), allowing us to provide a measurement of the system inclination angle (about 31 degrees), supporting the low-inclination hypothesis. Subsolar iron abundances were detected in the accretion disk and interstellar medium, probably related to the source location in a metal-poor globular cluster. The polarization increases from an upper limit of $1.2\%$ in the 2--4 keV band up to about $8\%$ in the 7--8 keV range. The disk is expected to be orthogonally polarized to these components, which may help to explain the decreasing of the observed polarization at low energies. However, the high polarization degree we found challenges the current models, also taking into consideration the relatively low inclination angle derived from the spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo evaluations of gamma-ray and radio pulsar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on well-grounded Galactic neutron star populations formed from radio pulsar population syntheses of canonical pulsars (CPs) and millisecond pulsars (MSPs), we use the latest Fermi-LAT catalog (4FGL-DR4) to investigate the implications of proposed $\gamma-$ray luminosity models. Using Monte Carlo techniques, we calculate the number of CPs and MSPs that would comprise the sample of pulsar-like unidentified sources (PLUIDs) in 4FGL-DR4. While radio beaming fractions were used to scale the sizes of the populations, when forming the mock 4FGL-DR4 samples, we make the simplifying assumption that all $\gamma-$ray pulsars are beaming towards the Earth. We then explore the observable outcomes of seven different $\gamma-$ray luminosity models. Four of the models provide a good match to the observed number of PLUIDs, while three others significantly over-predict the number of PLUIDs. For these latter models, either the average beaming fraction of $\gamma-$ray pulsars is more like 25--50\%, or a revision in the luminosity scaling is required. Most of the radio detectable MSPs that our models predict as part of the PLUIDs within 4FGL-DR4 are, unsurprisingly, fainter than the currently observed sample and at larger dispersion measures. For CPs, in spite of an excellent match to the observed radio population, none of the $\gamma-$ray models we investigated could replicate the observed sample of 150 $\gamma-$ray CPs. Further work is required to understand this discrepancy. For both MSPs and CPs, we provide encouraging forecasts for targeted radio searches of PLUIDs from 4FGL-DR4 to elucidate the issues raised in this study.</description>

      <title>Variability study of classical supergiant X-ray binary 4U 1907+09 using NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the X-ray variability of the supergiant X-ray binary 4U 1907+09 using the new NuSTAR observation of 2024. The source had a relatively stable flux level during previous NuSTAR observations, but the flux varied significantly during the current one. The light curve exhibits dips (off-state) and flares (on-state). The phase-coherent timing analysis during the on-state yields a pulse period of $443.99(4)~\mathrm{s}$, showing the pulsar's continued spin-down. The pulse profiles show an asymmetric double-peaked structure with a phase separation of 0.47 between the two peaks. A cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) is also detected at $\sim 17.6~\mathrm{keV}$, along with its harmonic at $\sim 38~\mathrm{keV}$, persisting across all flux states. Flux-resolved spectroscopy reveals that the CRSF remains constant despite a 25-fold change in flux. The spectral parameters like photon index and e-fold energy are out of phase with the pulse shape, whereas cutoff energy is in phase with the pulse shape. The source's luminosity during the on-state is $2.85 \times 10^{35}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$, consistent with a "pencil" beam radiation pattern expected at this flux level from a collisionless gas-mediated shock. These results offer further insights into the accretion dynamics and magnetic field geometry of this system.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star Eclipses as Axion Laboratories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light-shining-through-walls experiments, axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are searched for by exposing an optically thick barrier to a laser beam. In a magnetic field, photons could convert into ALPs in front of the barrier and reconvert behind it, giving rise to a signal that can occur only in the presence of such hidden particles. In this work, we utilize the light-shining-through-walls concept and apply it to astrophysical scales. Namely, we consider eclipsing binary systems, consisting of a neutron star, which is a bright source of X-rays, and a companion star with a much larger radius. Space observatories such as XMM-Newton and NuSTAR have performed extensive measurements of such systems, obtaining data on both out-of-eclipse photon rates and those during eclipses. The latter are typically $\mathscr{O}(10^2-10^3)$ times smaller, due to the fact that X-rays propagating along the line of sight from the neutron star to the X-ray observatory do not pass through the barrier that is the companion star. Using this attenuation, we derive a constraint on ALP-photon coupling of $g_{a\gamma} \simeq 10^{-10} \,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for the LMC X-4 eclipsing binary system, surpassing current bounds from light-shining-through-walls experiments by several orders of magnitude. We also present future prospects that could realistically improve this limit by an order of magnitude in $g_{a\gamma}$, making it competitive with some of the strongest limits derived to date.</description>

      <title>Probing axion-like particles with multimessenger observations of neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can be copiously produced in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers through nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung if the ALP-nucleon couplings $g_{a N}$ are sizable. Furthermore, the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ may trigger conversions of ultralight ALPs into photons in the magnetic fields of the merger remnant and of the Milky Way. This effect would lead to a potentially observable short gamma-ray signal, in coincidence with the gravitational-wave signal produced during the merging process. This event could be detected through multi-messenger observation of BNS mergers employing the synergy between gravitational-wave detectors and gamma-ray telescopes. Here, we study the sensitivity of current and proposed MeV gamma-ray experiments to detect such a signal. We find that the proposed instruments can reach a sensitivity down to $g_{a\gamma}\gtrsim \textrm{few} \times 10^{-13}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-9}~\mathrm{eV}$, comparable with the SN 1987A limit.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Compton telescope imaging with maximum a posteriori estimation: a modified Richardson-Lucy algorithm for the Compton Spectrometer and Imager</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a modified Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm tailored for image reconstruction in MeV gamma-ray observations, focusing on its application to the upcoming Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) mission. Our method addresses key challenges in MeV gamma-ray astronomy by incorporating Bayesian priors for sparseness and smoothness while optimizing background components simultaneously. We introduce a novel sparsity term suitable for Poisson-sampled data in addition to a smoothness prior, allowing for flexible reconstruction of both point sources and extended emission. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using simulated three-month COSI observations of gamma-ray lines of $^{44}$Ti (1.157 MeV), $^{26}$Al (1.809 MeV), and positron annihilation (0.511 MeV), respectively, representing various spatial features. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over conventional RL methods, particularly in suppressing artificial structures in point source reconstructions and retaining diffuse spatial structures. This work represents an important step towards establishing a robust data analysis for studying nucleosynthesis, positron annihilation, and other high-energy phenomena in our Galaxy.</description>

Abstract: The lower energy thresholds of large wide-field gamma-ray observatories are often determined by their capability to deal with the very low-energy cosmic ray background. In fact, in observatories with areas of tens or hundreds of thousands of square meters, the number of background events generated by the superposition of random, very low energy cosmic rays is huge and may exceed by far the possible signal events. In this article, we argue that a trigger strategy based on pattern recognition of the shower front can significantly reject the background, keeping a good efficiency and a good angular accuracy (few square degrees) for gamma rays with energies as low as tens of GeV. In this way, alerts can be followed or emitted within time lapses of the order of the second, enabling wide-field gamma-ray observatories to better contribute to global multi-messenger networks of astrophysical observatories.</description>

      <title>Revealing EMRI/IMRI candidates with quasiperiodic ultrafast outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first detection of the quasiperiodic ultrafast outflow in the ASASSN-20qc system was reported by Pasham et al. (2024). The outflow is revealed in the soft X-ray spectra as an absorption feature, which is enhanced periodically every $\sim 8.3$ days. The repetitive nature of the ultrafast outflow is tentatively explained by an orbiting massive perturber, possibly an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH), trajectory of which is inclined with respect to the accretion flow around the primary supermassive black hole (SMBH). In this scenario, the orbiting body pushes the disc gas into the outflow funnel, where it is accelerated by the ordered magnetic field (Sukov\'a et al. 2021). Quasiperiodic ultrafast outflows (a.k.a. QPOuts) are thus a novel phenomenon that can help reveal new extreme-/intermediate-mass ratio inspiral (EMRI/IMRI) candidates. These then would be prime candidate sources for a simultaneous detection and monitoring in electromagnetic as well as gravitational wave domains.</description>

      <title>Neutrino and pair creation in reconnection-powered coronae of accreting black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12638v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A ubiquitous feature of accreting black hole systems is their hard X-ray emission which is thought to be produced through Comptonization of soft photons by electrons and positrons in the vicinity of the black hole, in a region with optical depth of order unity. The origin and composition of this Comptonizing region, known as the corona, is a matter open for debate. In this paper we investigate the role of relativistic protons accelerated in black-hole magnetospheric current sheets for the pair enrichment and neutrino emission of AGN coronae. Our model has two free parameters, namely the proton plasma magnetization $\sigma_{\rm p}$, which controls the peak energy of the neutrino spectrum, and the Eddington ratio $\lambda_{\rm X, Edd}$ (defined as the ratio between X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and Eddington luminosity $L_{\rm Edd}$), which controls the amount of energy transferred to secondary particles. For sources with $\lambda_{\rm X, Edd} \gtrsim \lambda_{\rm Edd, crit}$ (where $\lambda_{\rm Edd, crit} \sim 10^{-1}$ for $\sigma_{\rm p}=10^5$ or $\sim 10^{-2}$ for $\sigma_{\rm p}=10^7$), proton-photon interactions and $ \gamma \gamma$ annihilation produce enough secondary pairs to achieve Thomson optical depths $\tau_{\rm T} \sim 0.1-10$. In the opposite case of $\lambda_{\rm X, Edd} \lesssim \lambda_{\rm Edd, crit}$, the coronal pairs cannot originate only from hadronic interactions. Additionally, we find that the neutrino luminosity scales as $L^2_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd}$ for $\lambda_{\rm X, Edd} \lesssim \lambda_{\rm Edd, crit}$, while it is proportional to $L_{\rm X}$ for higher $\lambda_{\rm X, Edd}$ values. We apply our model to four Seyfert galaxies, including NGC 1068, and discuss our results in light of recent IceCube observations.</description>

      <title>Rapid Rotation of Polarization Orientations in PSR B1919+21's Single Pulses: Implications On Pulsar's Magnetospheric Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze and model rapid rotations of polarization orientations in PSR B1919+21's single pulses based on Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope observation data. In more than one-third of B1919+21's single pulses, the polarization position angle (PA) is found to rotate quasi-monotonically with pulse longitude, by over 180 degrees or even 360 degrees. Some single pulse PA even rotates by over 540 degrees. Most of these quasi-monotonic PA curves have negative slopes with respect to pulse longitude. Oscillations of circular polarization fraction accompany these PA rotations. This rapid rotation could be induced by a quick change of phase lag between two normal wave modes within an individual pulse. We propose a phenomenological model to reproduce the observed polarization rotations in single pulses, and calculate phase lags in a dipolar magnetic field of an aligned rotating pulsar, with a dispersion relation of orthogonal wave modes in strongly magnetized electron-positron plasma. According to the dispersion relation, the weak frequency dependence of observed polarization rotation requires small angles between the radio wavevector and local magnetic fields, which requires the radio emission height to be low, on the order of 10 times neutron star radius.</description>

      <title>Identifying Thorne-\.Zytkow Objects through Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thorne-\.Zytkow Objects (T\.ZOs) have been predicted to form when a neutron star is engulfed by a diffuse, convective giant envelope. Accretion onto a neutron star at a rate that is larger than $10^{-4}\, M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is expected to lead to significant emission of neutrinos of all flavors with energy of $1$-$100$ MeV. Since the neutrino signal is expected to largely vary in time (from milliseconds to thousands of years), we outline detection strategies tailored to the signal duration. We find that neutrino detection from T\.ZOs up to the Small Magellanic Cloud is within the reach of current- and next-generation neutrino observatories, such as Super- and Hyper-Kamiokande, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, and JUNO. Interestingly, if targeted searches for neutrinos from T\.ZO candidates (e.g.VX Sgr in our Galaxy as well as HV 2112 and HV 11417 in the Small Magellanic Cloud) should lead to positive results, neutrinos could positively identify the nature of such sources and their accretion rate. Furthermore, the diffuse supernova neutrino background may be able to rule out extreme scenarios for the formation and accretion rates of T\.ZOs. Our findings should serve as motivation for establishing dedicated searches for neutrino emission from T\.ZOs. This is especially timely since it is challenging to detect T\.ZOs via electromagnetic radiation unambiguously, and the T\.ZO gravitational wave signal could be probed with next-generation detectors for sources within our Galaxy only.</description>

      <title>The Mini-SiTian Array: Prospects of Searching for Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assess the detectability of tidal disruption events (TDEs) using mock observations from the Mini-SiTian array. We select 100 host galaxy samples from a simulated galaxy catalog based on specific criteria such as redshift, BH mass, and event rate. Taking into account the site conditions and survey strategy, we simulate observations over a 440 deg$^2$ field. The results indicate that $0.53\pm 0.73$ TDEs can be detected per year when observing in both $g$ and $r$ bands with 300-second exposures every 3 days. Applying this method to the SiTian project, we expect to discover approximately 204 TDEs annually, heralding a new era in TDE science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical observations of the cosmos allow us to probe extreme physics and answer foundational questions on our universe. Modern astronomy is increasingly operating under a holistic approach, probing the same question with multiple diagnostics including how sources vary over time, how they appear across the electromagnetic spectrum, and through their other signatures, including gravitational waves, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and dust on Earth. Astrophysical observations are now reaching the point where approximate physics models are insufficient. Key sources of interest are explosive transients, whose understanding requires multidisciplinary studies at the intersection of astrophysics, gravity, nuclear science, plasma physics, fluid dynamics and turbulence, computation, particle physics, atomic, molecular, and optical science, condensed matter and materials science, radiation transport, and high energy density physics. This white paper provides an overview of the major scientific advances that lay at the intersection of physics and astronomy and are best probed through time-domain and multimessenger astrophysics, an exploration of how multidisciplinary science can be fostered, and introductory descriptions of the relevant scientific disciplines and key astrophysical sources of interest.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the origin of fast radio bursts by modeling the stellar mass and star formation distributions of their host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diverse formation channels have been proposed to explain the emergence of fast radio bursts (FRBs), yet their origin remains elusive. With improved localization precision, roughly 90 FRBs are now associated with host galaxies. SED fitting to the host galaxy photometry reveals their stellar masses ($M_\star$) and star formation rates (SFRs), enabling discrimination between various formation channels. We conduct an extensive comparison of the stellar mass, SFR and z distributions of 51 FRB hosts and mock-generated galaxy samples to test whether FRBs trace SFR or $M_\star$. We incorporate a mass-to-light ratio prescription to address optical selection biases. In line with Sharma et al. (2024), we provide evidence in favor of FRB progenitors tracking SF rather than stellar mass. We show that the shape of the assumed $(M_\star/L_r)_{obs}$ distribution affects the predictions, bringing the low mass end of the stellar mass distribution closer to the data when accounting for the $\mathrm{SFR} - (M_\star/L_r)_{obs}$ correlation. The K-correction effect in the $r-$band is minimal for galaxies at $z \lesssim 0.7$. Even if FRBs trace SF, up to $\sim 6\%$ of a flux-limited FRB host sample can reside below the star-forming main sequence. Finally, we examine a hybrid model in which a fraction of FRBs tracks stellar mass rather than SF. This fraction can be as large as $\sim(40-50)\%$, suggesting that multiple formation channels are still consistent with observations. The toolkit developed in this work is publicly available (GALFRB code), offering a straightforward way to generate mock galaxy samples suitable for direct comparisons with future FRB host galaxy data.</description>

      <title>The origin of the very-high-energy radiation along the jet of Centaurus A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the closest known active galactic nucleus, Centaurus A (Cen A) provides a rich environment for astrophysical exploration. It has been observed across wavelengths from radio to gamma rays, and indications of ongoing particle acceleration have been found on different scales. Recent measurements of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays ($&gt;240$ GeV) by the HESS observatory have inferred the presence of ultra-relativistic electrons along Cen A's jet, yet the underlying acceleration mechanism remains uncertain. Various authors have proposed that jet substructures, known as knots, may serve as efficient particle accelerators. In this study, we investigate the hypothesis that knots are the particle acceleration sites along Cen A's jets. We focus on stationary knots, and assume that they result from interactions between the jet and the stellar winds of powerful stars. By combining relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and shock acceleration theory with the radio and X-ray data, we compare theoretical predictions with morphological and spectral data from different knots. We estimate the maximum electron energy and the resulting VHE gamma-ray emission. Our findings suggest that electrons accelerated at the knots are responsible for the gamma-ray spectrum detected in the VHE band.</description>

      <title>Is Lorentz invariance violation found?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) has long been recognized as an observable low-energy signature of quantum gravity. In spite of a great effort to detect LIV effects, so far only lower bounds have been derived. The high energy photons from the gamma ray burst GRB 221009A have been detected by the LHAASO collaboration and one at ${\cal E} \simeq 251 \, \rm TeV$ by the Carpet collaboration using a partial data set. Very recently, the Carpet collaboration has completed the full data analysis, reporting further support for their previously detected photon now at ${\cal E} = 300^{+ 43}_{- 38} \, {\rm TeV}$, which manifestly clashes with conventional physics. Taking this result at face value, we derive the first evidence for LIV and we show that such a detection cannot be explained by axion-like particles (ALPs), which allow for the observation of the highest energy photons detected by LHAASO. We also outline a scenario in which ALPs and LIV naturally coexist. If confirmed by future observations our finding would represent the first positive result in quantum gravity phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.04498v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a closed-form false vacuum decay rate at one loop in the thin wall limit, where the true and false vacua are nearly degenerate. We obtain the bounce configuration in $D$ dimensions, together with the Euclidean action with a higher order correction, counter-terms and renormalization group running. We extract the functional determinant via the Gel'fand-Yaglom theorem for low and generic orbital multipoles. The negative and zero eigenvalues appear for low multipoles and the translational zeroes are removed. We compute the fluctuations for generic multipoles, multiply and regulate the orbital modes. We find an explicit finite renormalized decay rate in $D = 3, 4$ and give a closed-form expression for the finite functional determinant in any dimension.</description>
