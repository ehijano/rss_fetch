      <title>Analytical Aberration Theory for Plane-symmetric Optical Systems and its Application in the Analysis of Distortion in Freeform Spectrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent history of optical design saw a progressive trend of also designing without rotational symmetry, especially spectrometers due to the use of reflective and diffractive elements in their designs. A freeform hyperspectral imager design in CubeSat format is presented in this work, which has large deviation from rotational symmetry. Based on a generalization of paraxial optics and wavefront aberration expansion applicable to plane-symmetric systems, in this dissertation we derived the aberration coefficients of aberration types in the third group for plane-symmetric systems that include the second order effects of the light beam footprint on optical surfaces. We also expanded the theory to include the contributions from freeform surfaces and induced aberrations. For the application to plane-symmetric spectrometers, the aberration coefficients related to distortion are of special interest. Comparisons between the distortion results predicted by the aberration coefficients and simulated from real raytracing show good consistency in example systems of a Dyson spectrometer and freeform spectrometers that share the three-mirror double-pass structure, which is similar to the spectrometer component of the hyperspectral imager we designed. In comparison to real raytracing, results of the theory applied to the spectrometer of the hyperspectral imager we designed show the limits of the theory that is limited to the third group of aberrations, while in this design, high-order groups also significantly contribute. In all cases, the analytical formulae of the aberration coefficients contain the information on surface contributions, induced aberrations, and the relation between the aberration behavior and system parameters, which provide valuable insights in the analysis of plane-symmetric systems.</description>

      <title>An Angular Spectrum Approach to Inverse Synthesis for the Characterization of Optical and Geometrical Properties of Semiconductor Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To design semiconductor-based optical devices, the optical properties of the used semiconductor materials must be precisely measured over a large band. Transmission spectroscopy stands out as an inexpensive and widely available method for this measurement but requires model assumptions and reconstruction algorithms to convert the measured transmittance spectra into optical properties of the thin films. Amongst the different reconstruction techniques, inverse synthesis methods generally provide high precision but rely on rigid analytical models of a thin film system. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel flexible inverse synthesis method that uses angular spectrum wave propagation and does not rely on rigid model assumptions. Amongst other evaluated parameters, our algorithm is capable of evaluating the geometrical properties of thin film surfaces, which reduces the variance caused by inverse synthesis optimization routines and significantly improves measurement precision. The proposed method could potentially allow for the characterization of "uncommon" thin film samples that do not fit the current model assumptions, as well as the characterization of samples with higher complexity, e.g., multi-layer systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical polarizers are essential components for the selection and manipulation of light polarization states in optical systems. Over the past decade, the rapid advancement of photonic technologies and devices has led to the development of a range of novel optical polarizers, opening avenues for many breakthroughs and expanding applications across diverse fields. Particularly, two dimensional (2D) materials, known for their atomic thin film structures and unique optical properties, have become attractive for implementing optical polarizers with high performance and new features that were not achievable before. This paper reviews recent progress in 2D material based optical polarizers. First, an overview of key properties of various 2D materials for realizing optical polarizers is provided. Next, the state of the art optical polarizers based on 2D materials, which are categorized into spatial light devices, fiber devices, and integrated waveguide devices, are reviewed and compared. Finally, we discuss the current challenges of this field as well as the exciting opportunities for future technological advances.</description>

      <title>Purcell Enhancement of Spontaneous Emission of a Quantum Emitter on a Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a waveguide on an emitter spontaneous emission in its vicinity. The impact of various possible orientations of an emitter with respect to the waveguide surface is studied through simulations and compared with experimental demonstration. Quantum emitters are dip coated on waveguides and Purcell enhancement and a decrease in the lifetime of the emitter are observed. This study serves as a proof of concept for the Purcell effect offered by waveguides and helps ineffectively estimate the efficiency of waveguide-based evanescent sensors and quantum photonic applications</description>

      <title>Identity-enabled CDMA LiDAR for massively parallel ranging with a single-element receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06918v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) have emerged as a crucial tool for high-resolution 3D imaging, particularly in autonomous vehicles, remote sensing, and augmented reality. However, the increasing demand for faster acquisition speed and higher resolution in LiDAR systems has highlighted the limitations of traditional mechanical scanning methods. This study introduces a novel wavelength-multiplexed code-division multiple access (CDMA) parallel laser ranging approach with a single-pixel receiver to address these challenges. By leveraging the unique properties of Gold-sequences in a direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) framework, our design enables comprehensive parallelization in detection and ranging activities to significantly enhance system efficiency and user capacity. The proposed coaxial architecture simplifies hardware requirements using a single avalanche photodiode (APD) for multi-reception, reducing susceptibility to ambient noise and external interferences. We demonstrate 3D imaging at 5 m and 10 m, and the experimental results highlight the capability of our CDMA LiDAR system to achieve 40 parallel ranging channels with centimeter-level depth resolution and an angular resolution of 0.03 degree. Furthermore, our system allows for user identification modulation, enabling identity-based ranging among different users. The robustness of our proposed system against interference and speckle noise and near-far signal problems, combined with its potential for miniaturization and integration into chip-scale optics, presents a promising avenue to develop high-performance, compact LiDAR systems suitable for commercial applications.</description>

      <title>Stimulated Raman Scattering and Molecular Modulation in Anti-resonant Hollow-core Fibres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman scattering is the inelastic process where photons bounce off molecules, losing energy and becoming red-shifted. This weak effect is unique to each molecular species, making it an essential tool in e.g. spectroscopy and label-free microscopy. The invention of the laser enabled a regime of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), where the efficiency is greatly increased by inducing coherent molecular oscillations. However, this phenomenon required high intensities due to the limited interaction volumes, and this limitation was overcome by the emergence of anti-resonant fibres (ARFs) guiding light in a small hollow channel over long distances. Based on their unique properties, this Perspective reviews the transformative impact of ARFs on modern SRS-based applications ranging from development of light sources and convertors for spectroscopy and materials science, to quantum technologies for the future quantum networks, providing insights into future trends and the expanding horizons of the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss our vision for neuromorphic accelerators based on integrated photonics within the framework of the Horizon Europe NEUROPULS project. Augmented integrated photonic architectures that leverage phase-change and III-V materials for optical computing will be presented. A CMOS-compatible platform will be discussed that integrates these materials to fabricate photonic neuromorphic architectures, along with a gem5-based simulation platform to model accelerator operation once it is interfaced with a RISC-V processor. This simulation platform enables accurate system-level accelerator modeling and benchmarking in terms of key metrics such as speed, energy consumption, and footprint.</description>

      <title>Four no-go theorems on the existence of spin and orbital angular momentum of massless bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past thirty years there has been an ever-increasing interest in the so-called orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, driven in large part by its diverse range of applications, from new imaging techniques to optical tweezers. However, there are fundamental theoretical issues with splitting the photon angular momentum operator into spin (SAM) and orbital angular momentum parts. While such an SAM-OAM splitting is simple and unambiguous for massive particles, there are many different proposed splittings for massless photons and no consensus about which is correct. Moreover, it has been explicitly shown that most of the proposed SAM and OAM operators do not satisfy the defining commutation relations of angular momentum operators and are thus not legitimate splittings. Here we prove that it is generally impossible to split the total angular momentum operator of massless bosons, like photons and gravitons, into spin and orbital parts. We show that the obstruction to such a splitting can be understood as both geometric and topological. We prove two additional no-go theorems which generalize this result, in particular showing that there are no SAM-OAM splittings even if (1) the SAM operator is allowed to represent non-internal symmetries or (2) if one allows the SAM and OAM operators to generate non-$\mathrm{SO}(3)$ symmetries. We show how gauge redundant descriptions of massless particles can suggest SAM-OAM splittings which are invalid once gauge-invariance is imposed.</description>

      <title>The impact of microwave phase noise on diamond quantum sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision optical measurements of the electron-spin precession of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond form the basis of numerous applications. The most sensitivity-demanding applications, such as femtotesla magnetometry, require the ability to measure changes in GHz spin transition frequencies at the sub-millihertz level, corresponding to a fractional resolution of better than 10^{-12}. Here we study the impact of microwave (MW) phase noise on the response of an NV sensor. Fluctuations of the phase of the MW waveform cause undesired rotations of the NV spin state. These fluctuations are imprinted in the optical readout signal and, left unmitigated, are indistinguishable from magnetic field noise. We show that the phase noise of several common commercial MW generators results in an effective pT s^{1/2}-range noise floor that varies with the MW carrier frequency and the detection frequency of the pulse sequence. The data are described by a frequency domain model incorporating the MW phase noise spectrum and the filter-function response of the sensing protocol. For controlled injection of white and random-walk phase noise, the observed NV magnetic noise floor is described by simple analytic expressions that accurately capture the scaling with pulse sequence length and the number of pi pulses. We outline several strategies to suppress the impact of MW phase noise and implement a version, based on gradiometry, that realizes a &gt;10-fold suppression. Our study highlights an important challenge in the pursuit of sensitive diamond quantum sensors and is applicable to other qubit systems with a large transition frequency.</description>

      <title>Interference of ultrahigh frequency acoustic phonons from distant quasi-continuous sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of propagating acoustic waves is essential for telecommunication applications, quantum technologies, and sensing. Up to now, the electrical generation has been at the core of most implementations, but is technologically limited to a few gigahertz. Overcoming this frequency limit holds the prospect of faster modulators, quantum acoustics at higher working temperatures, nanoacoustic sensing from smaller volumes. Alternatively, the optical excitation of acoustic resonators has unlocked frequencies up to 1 THz, but in most cases, the acoustic energy cannot be efficiently extracted from the resonator into a propagating wave. Here, we demonstrate a quasi-continuous and coherent source of 20 GHz acoustic phonons, based on a ridge waveguide, structured in the vertical direction as a high-Q acousto-optic resonator. The high frequency phonons propagate up to 20 $\mu$m away from the source, with a decay rate of $\sim$1.14 dB/$\mu$m. We demonstrate the coherence between acoustic phonons generated from two distant sources through spatio-temporal interference. This concept could be scaled up to a larger number of sources, which enable a new generation of optically programmed, reconfigurable nanoacoustic devices and applications.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable unitary transformations of optical beam arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial transformations of light are ubiquitous in optics, with examples ranging from simple imaging with a lens to quantum and classical information processing in waveguide meshes. Multi-plane light converter (MPLC) systems have emerged as a platform that promises completely general spatial transformations, i.e., a universal unitary. However until now, MPLC systems have demonstrated transformations that are far from general, e.g., converting from a Gaussian to Laguerre-Gauss mode. Here, we demonstrate the promise of an MLPC, the ability to impose an arbitrary unitary transformation that can be reconfigured dynamically. Specifically, we consider transformations on superpositions of parallel free-space beams arranged in an array, which is a common information encoding in photonics. We experimentally test the full gamut of unitary transformations for a system of two parallel beams and make a map of their fidelity. We obtain an average transformation fidelity of $0.85 \pm 0.03$. This high-fidelity suggests MPLCs are a useful tool implementing the unitary transformations that comprise quantum and classical information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Frequency Mixing using an NV Diamond Microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wide-field magnetic microscopy using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond can yield high-quality magnetic images of DC and AC magnetic fields. The unique combination of micron-scale spatial resolution of scalar or vector fields at room temperature and parallel camera readout make this an appealing technique for applications in biology, geology, condensed-matter physics, and electronics. However, while NV magnetic microscopy has achieved great success in these areas, historically the accessible frequency range has been limited. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by implementing the recently developed technique of quantum frequency mixing. With this approach, we generate wide-field magnetic images of test structures driven by alternating currents up to 70 MHz, well outside the reach of DC and Rabi magnetometry methods. With further improvements, this approach could find utility in hyperspectral imaging for electronics power spectrum analysis, electronics diagnostics and troubleshooting, and quantum computing hardware validation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In active imaging protocols, information about a landscape is encoded into the spatial mode of a scattered photon. A common assumption is that the landscape is rigid; however, in principle it can be altered by radiation pressure, a concept that has found fruitful application in the field of quantum optomechanics. Here we explore active imaging of a mechanical resonator with an eye to generalizing the concept of radiation pressure backaction to spatially multimode light. As a thought experiment, we consider imaging the flexural modes of a membrane by sorting the spatial modes of a laser reflected from its surface. We show that backaction in this setting arises from spatial photon shot noise, an effect that cannot be observed in single-mode optomechanics. We also derive the imprecision-backaction product for coherent illumination in the limit of purely spatial backaction, revealing it to be equivalent to the standard quantum limit for purely dispersive, single-mode optomechanical coupling. Finally, we show that optomechanical correlations due to spatial backaction can give rise to two-mode entangled light. In conjunction with high-$Q$ nanomechanics, our findings point to new opportunities at the interface of quantum imaging and optomechanics, including sensors and networks enhanced by spatial mode entanglement.</description>

      <title>Active Control of Bound States in the Continuum in Toroidal Metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The remarkable properties of toroidal metasurfaces, featuring ultrahigh-Q bound states in the continuum (BIC) resonances and nonradiating anapole modes, have garnered significant attention. The active manipulation of quasi-BIC resonance characteristics offers substantial potential for advancing tunable metasurfaces. Our study explores explicitly the application of vanadium dioxide, a phase change material widely used in active photonics and room-temperature bolometric detectors, to control quasi-BIC resonances in toroidal metasurfaces. The phase change transition of vanadium dioxide occurs in a narrow temperature range, providing a large variation in material resistivity. Through heating thin film patches of vanadium dioxide integrated into a metasurface comprising gold split-ring resonators on a sapphire substrate, we achieve remarkable control over the amplitude and frequency of quasi-BIC resonances due to their high sensitivity to losses present in the system. Breaking the symmetry of meta-atoms reveals enhanced tunability. The predicted maximum change in the quasi-BIC resonance amplitude reaches 14 dB with a temperature variation of approximately 10 {\deg}C.</description>

      <title>A Highly Efficient Hybrid Fiber Optic Laser Using a Cesium Atom Vapor Cell as an Optical Gain Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new scheme of a highly efficient hybrid laser cavity is proposed and experimentally demonstrated utilizing a hot cesium (Cs) vapor cell as an optical gain medium. The laser cavity consists of a macroscopic concave reflecting mirror (&gt;99% reflectivity) and a 4% Fresnel-reflecting perpendicularly cleaved facet of a single mode fiber (SMF). The cylindrical cesium gain cell is located between these two reflectors. The SMF serves multiple roles: 1) a passive mode-matching component to approximate the pump beam diameter to that of the laser cavity mode within the cesium cell, 2) an output coupler with low reflectivity, and 3) a high beam-quality laser delivery with a low loss. Optimizing the pump beam waist diameter and the cesium vapor cell temperature, a high slope efficiency of 86% and continuous wave power of 419 mW were obtained in the pump power range of 400 to 600 mW, with an optical-to-optical conversion efficiency of 71%. The unique multi-functional role of the SMF in the hybrid cavity is fully described, and it can also be applied to other phases of high optical gain media.</description>

      <title>The electromagnetic symmetry sphere: a framework for energy, momentum, spin and other electromagnetic quantities</title>

Abstract: Electromagnetic quantities such as energy density, momentum, spin, and helicity bring meaning and intuition to electromagnetism and possess intricate interrelations, particularly prominent in complex non-paraxial near-fields. These quantities are conventionally expressed using electric and magnetic field vectors, yet the electric-magnetic basis is one among other often overlooked alternatives, including parallel-antiparallel and right-left-handed helicity bases, related to the parity and duality symmetries of electromagnetism. Projecting time-harmonic electromagnetic fields into a variety of bases allows re-interpreting established quantities and reveals underlying mathematical structures: a Bloch sphere which describes asymmetries in electromagnetic energy, a systematic path to unify and uncover relations between electromagnetic quantities, and the unlocking of symmetry-driven equations in light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Optical properties and energy propagation in a dielectric medium supporting magnetic current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine a dielectric medium supporting a magnetic current in connection with optical properties and energy propagation. The dispersion relations, propagating modes, and some optical effects are examined for isotropic and anisotropic magnetic conductivity tensors, with the latter ones implying nonreciprocal permittivities. The eigenvalues of the effective permittivity are carried out and associated with the optical symmetries (uniaxial, biaxial) and the subjacent crystal systems. Aspects of electromagnetic energy transport for such systems are also discussed, with the group and energy velocities being presented and carried out for all the particular cases addressed. Our results suggest that a dielectric supporting magnetic current breaks the usual equivalence between group velocity and energy velocity that holds in a nonabsorbing medium, while establishing the equivalence between them in an effective absorbing scenario, two unexpected behaviors.</description>

      <title>Pump-probe studies of resonantly saturated selective reflection from high-density rubidium vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear selective reflection from the interface YAG window-high density rubidium vapor in the high-temperature cell is studied at the transition 5S$_{1/2}$-5P$_{3/2}$. In the experiment tunable pump and probe lasers are used. The selective reflection spectra for the laser probe beam are investigated at four different rubidium atomic densities and five different pump beam intensities. The estimated dipole-dipole interaction-induced line broadening varies from $13.2$ to $39.6$ GHz, the measured pumped intensities change from $1.2$ to $8.8$ kW$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$. Growth of the pump intensity causes reduction of the magnitude and the width of the recorded selective reflection resonance. We suggest developing all-optical modulators on the basis of nonlinear selective reflection.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Beam Guide for Large-Scale Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vacuum beam guide (VBG) presents a completely different solution for quantum channels to overcome the limitations of existing fiber and satellite technologies for long-distance quantum communication. With an array of aligned lenses spaced kilometers apart, the VBG offers ultra-high transparency over a wide range of optical wavelengths. With realistic parameters, the VBG can outperform the best fiber by three orders of magnitude in terms of attenuation rate. Consequently, the VBG can enable long-range quantum communication over thousands of kilometers with quantum channel capacity beyond $10^{13}$ qubit/sec, orders of magnitude higher than the state-of-the-art quantum satellite communication rate. Remarkably, without relying on quantum repeaters, the VBG can provide a ground-based, low-loss, high-bandwidth quantum channel that enables novel distributed quantum information applications for computing, communication, and sensing.</description>

      <title>A method of laser frequency stabilization based on the effect of linear dichroism in alkali metal vapors in a modulated transverse magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method of laser frequency stabilization based on the linear dichroism signal in a transverse magnetic field. The method is similar to the DAVLL (Dichroic Atomic Vapor Laser Lock) method. It differs from DAVLL and from its existing modifications primarily by the fact that it uses signal of linearly polarized light caused by alignment, rather than circular refraction caused by orientation, and therefore allows to obtain error signals at the magnetic field modulation frequency (or its second harmonic) by extremely simple means. The method does not require the strong magnetic fields or careful shielding of the working cell. The method allows the laser frequency to be stabilized in the vicinity of the low-frequency transition in the D1 line of Cs. Although the absorption line in a gas-filled cell is typically gigahertz wide, the achievable resolution, limited by the signal-to-noise ratio of photon shot noise, can reach tens of kilohertz in one hertz bandwidth.</description>

      <title>On the Dual-Phase-Lag thermal response in the Pulsed Photoacoustic effect: 1D approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent work, assuming a Beer-Lambert optical absorption and a Gaussian laser time profile, the exact solutions for a 1D-photoacoustic(PA)-boundary value problem predict a null pressure for optically strong absorbent materials. To overcome this, a heuristic correction was introduced by assuming that heat flux travels a characteristic length during the duration of the laser pulse\cite{Ruiz-Veloz2021} $\tau_p$. In this work, we obtained exact solutions in the frequency domain for a 1D-boundary-value-problem for the Dual-Phase-Lag (DPL) heat equation coupled with a 1D PA-boundary-value-problem via the wave-equation. Temperature and pressure solutions were studied by assuming that the sample and its surroundings have a similar characteristic thermal lag response time $\tau_{_T}$, which was assumed to be a free parameter that can be adjusted to reproduce experimental results. Solutions for temperature and pressure were obtained for a three-layer 1D system. It was found that for $\tau_{_T}&lt; \tau_{p}$, the DPL temperature has a similar thermal profile of the Fourier heat equation, however, when $\tau_{_T}\ge \tau_{p}$ this profile is very different from the Fourier case. Additionally, via a numerical Fourier transform the wave-like behavior of DPL temperature is explored, and it was found that as $\tau_{_T}$ increases, thermal wave amplitude is increasingly attenuated. Exact solutions for pressure were compared with experimental signals, showing a close resemblance between both data sets, particularly in the time domain, for an appropriated value of $\tau_{_T}$; the transference function was also calculated, which allowed us to find the maximum response in frequency for the considered experimental setup.</description>
