      <title>Classification of earthquakes main shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of a triad of tectonic earthquakes as a natural trinity of foreshocks, main shock and aftershocks is introduced. The basis for classifying the main shocks is the belonging of the main shock to one or another category of triads. The basis for classifying triads is the ratio between the number of foreshocks and the number of aftershocks that occurred during equal periods of time before and after the main shock. The existence of three classes of triads has been discovered, called classical, mirror and symmetrical triads. Each class is divided into two species, called the full and shortened triad. Thus, the existence of three classes and six species of main shocks is established. The classification is natural, is made on one basis and is proportionate, i.e. the sum of classes and the sum of species are equal to the volume of the generic concept of the triad. The discovery of a small but obviously non-empty set of mirror triads is an interesting and important concrete result of classification. Confidence is expressed that the classification of main shocks opens up new perspectives for earthquake research. Key words: foreshocks, aftershocks, triad of earthquakes, taxonomy of triads, mirror triad.</description>

      <title>Machine learning potential for serpentines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serpentines are layered hydrous magnesium silicates (MgO$\cdot$SiO$_2\cdot$H$_2$O) formed through serpentinization, a geochemical process that significantly alters the physical property of the mantle. They are hard to investigate experimentally and computationally due to the complexity of natural serpentine samples and the large number of atoms in the unit cell. We developed a machine learning (ML) potential for serpentine minerals based on density functional theory (DFT) calculation with the r$^2$SCAN meta-GGA functional for molecular dynamics simulation. We illustrate the success of this ML potential model in reproducing the high-temperature equation of states of several hydrous phases under the Earth's subduction zone conditions, including brucite, lizardite, and antigorite. In addition, we investigate the polymorphism of antigorite with periodicity $m$ = 13--24, which is believed to be all the naturally existent antigorite species. We found that antigorite with $m$ larger than 21 appears more stable than lizardite at low temperatures. This machine learning potential can be further applied to investigate more complex antigorite superstructures with multiple coexisting periodic waves.</description>

      <title>Identification of extreme weather events and impacts of the disasters in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important consequence of human-induced climate change emerges through extreme weather events. The impact of extreme weather events is quantified in some parts of the globe, but it remains underestimated in several countries. In this work we first quantify the extreme temperature and precipitation events in Brazil using data from the Brazilian Institute of Meteorology, which includes 634 meteorological stations that have worked intermittently since 1961. We show that the anomaly in temperature has increased by more than 1{\deg}C in the last 60 years and that extreme events are heterogeneously distributed in the country. In terms of precipitation, our analyses show that it is getting drier in the Northwest region of Brazil while excessive precipitation events are increasing in the South, in agreement with previous works. We then use data from S2iD, an official database that registers disasters in Brazil to estimate their impact in terms of human damage and financial costs in the last ten years. The analysis shows that the drought extreme events are the most expensive, several of them reaching a cost of over a billion USD. Although we are not able to attribute the natural disasters registered in one database to the extreme weather events identified using the meteorological data, we discuss the possible correlations between them. Finally, we present a proposal of using extreme value theory to estimate the probability of having severe extreme events of precipitation in locations where there are already some natural disasters.</description>

      <title>European summer weather regimes 1990-2019: Automatic classification and representation in a small global climate model ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Central Europe, the occurrence of different weather regimes (WRs) plays a major role in spatiotemporal temperature and precipitation patterns. In the context of increasingly extreme summers, this study focuses on European summer WRs (June-August, JJA) over the last three decades (1990-2019), and aims to examine the changing characteristics of these WRs and their potential implications. In addition, based on ERA5 reanalysis data, the WR representation from a carefully preselected, small ensemble of global general circulation models (GCMs) is analyzed. A methodological refinement concerns the combination of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) with a novel GCM selection technique, which enhances the robustness of the simulated large-scale circulation patterns. WRs are defined using daily sea level pressure (SLP) and wind in the upper troposphere. Results reveal that the SOM captures predominant European summer synoptic patterns, and the salient result is a positive trend in 2 m air temperature across nearly all WRs. The selected GCMs - MPI-ESM1-2-LR r29i1p1f1, CanESM5 r1i1p1f1 and MRI-ESM2-0 r5i1p1f1 - identify WRs correctly and ERA5-based results are always within the range of this small GCM ensemble. Its members clearly show skill in representing large-scale WRs accurately and, thus, serve as valuable tools for studying synoptic weather patterns during summer in Central Europe. Therefore, we can recommend these GCMs for studies on WR-related climate projections of future summer conditions, particularly for those interested in climate impacts in Central Europe from a synoptic-scale perspective.</description>

      <title>Osmosis drives explosions and methane release in Siberian permafrost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mysterious craters, with anomalously high concentrations of methane, have formed in the Yamal and Taymyr peninsulas of Siberia since 2014. While thawing permafrost owing to climate warming promotes methane releases, it is unknown how such release might be associated with explosion and crater formation. A significant volume of surface ice-melt water can migrate downward driven by osmotic pressure associated with a cryopeg, a lens of salty water below. Overpressure reached at depth may lead to the cracking of the soil and subsequent decomposition of methane hydrates, with implications for the climate.</description>
