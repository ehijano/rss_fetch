      <title>State-of-the-art Methods for Pseudo-Boolean Solving with SCIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03390v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pseudo-Boolean problem deals with linear or polynomial constraints with integer coefficients over Boolean variables. The objective lies in optimizing a linear objective function, or finding a feasible solution, or finding a solution that satisfies as many constraints as possible. In the 2024 Pseudo-Boolean competition, solvers incorporating the SCIP framework won five out of six categories it was competing in. From a total of 1,207 instances, SCIP successfully solved 759, while its parallel version FiberSCIP solved 776. Based on the results from the competition, we further enhanced SCIP's Pseudo-Boolean capabilities. This article discusses the results and presents the winning algorithmic ideas.</description>

      <title>Power System Steady-State Estimation Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In power system steady-state estimation (PSSE), one needs to consider (1) the need for robust statistics, (2) the nonconvex transmission constraints, (3) the fast-varying nature of the inputs, and the corresponding need to track optimal trajectories as closely as possible. In combination, these challenges have not been considered, yet. In this paper, we address all three challenges. The need for robustness (1) is addressed by using an approach based on the so-called Huber model. The non-convexity (2) of the problem, which results in first order methods failing to find global minima, is dealt with by applying global methods. One of these methods is based on a mixed integer quadratic formulation, which provides results of several orders of magnitude better than conventional gradient descent. Lastly, the trajectory tracking (3) is discussed by showing under which conditions the trajectory tracking of the SDP relaxations has meaning.</description>

      <title>Optimization Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces the concept of optimization learning, a methodology to design optimization proxies that learn the input/output mapping of parametric optimization problems. These optimization proxies are trustworthy by design: they compute feasible solutions to the underlying optimization problems, provide quality guarantees on the returned solutions, and scale to large instances. Optimization proxies are differentiable programs that combine traditional deep learning technology with repair or completion layers to produce feasible solutions. The article shows that optimization proxies can be trained end-to-end in a self-supervised way. It presents methodologies to provide performance guarantees and to scale optimization proxies to large-scale optimization problems. The potential of optimization proxies is highlighted through applications in power systems and, in particular, real-time risk assessment and security-constrained optimal power flow.</description>

      <title>Positivstellens\"atze for polynomial matrices with universal quantifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies Positivstellens\"atze for a polynomial matrix subject to polynomial matrix inequality constraints with universal quantifiers. We first present a Scherer-Hol-type Positivstellensatz under the Archimedean condition. When the objective is a scalar polynomial, we further provide a sparse Scherer-Hol-type Positivstellensatz in the presence of correlative sparsity. Next, without assuming the Archimedean condition, we derive Putinar-Vasilescu-type, P\'olya-type, and Lasserre-Netzer-type Positivstellens\"atze under the same setting. These results can be viewed as common generalizations of corresponding Positivstellens\"atze in the cases of polynomials, polynomials with universal quantifiers, and polynomial matrices. For the proofs, techniques from *-algebra, real algebraic geometry, operator theory, and convex optimization are employed. Applications of the established Positivstellens\"atze to robust polynomial matrix optimization are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Joint Chance-Constrained Optimal Power Flow using Relative Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing robust algorithms for the optimal power flow (OPF) problem is critical for the control of large-scale power systems under uncertainty. The chance-constrained OPF (CCOPF) problem provides a natural formulation of the trade-off between the operating cost and the constraint satisfaction rate. In this work, we propose a new data-driven algorithm for the CCOPF problem, based on distributionally robust optimization (DRO). \revise{We show that the proposed reformulation of the distributionally robust chance constraints is exact, whereas other approaches in the CCOPF literature rely on conservative approximations. We establish out-of-sample robustness guarantees for the distributionally robust solution and prove that the solution is the most efficient among all approaches enjoying the same guarantees.} We apply the proposed algorithm to the the CCOPF problem and compare the performance of our approach with existing methods using simulations on IEEE benchmark power systems.</description>

      <title>Controlling the low-temperature Ising model using spatiotemporal Markov decision theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the spatiotemporal Markov decision process (STMDP), a special type of Markov decision process that models sequential decision-making problems which are not only characterized by temporal, but also by spatial interaction structures. To illustrate the framework, we construct an STMDP inspired by the low-temperature two-dimensional Ising model on a finite, square lattice, evolving according to the Metropolis dynamics. We consider the situation in which an external decision maker aims to drive the system towards the all-plus configuration by flipping spins at specified moments in time. In order to analyze this problem, we construct an auxiliary MDP by means of a reduction of the configuration space to the local minima of the Hamiltonian. Leveraging the convenient form of this auxiliary MDP, we uncover the structure of the optimal policy by solving the Bellman equations in a recursive manner. Finally, we conduct a numerical study on the performance of the optimal policy obtained from the auxiliary MDP in the original Ising STMDP.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Strictly Pre-Dissipative Receding Horizon Linear Quadratic Control by Terminal Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic stability in receding horizon control is obtained under a strict pre-dissipativity assumption, in the presence of suitable state constraints. In this paper we analyze how terminal constraints can be replaced by suitable terminal costs. We restrict to the linear-quadratic setting as that allows us to obtain stronger results, while we analyze the full nonlinear case in a separate contribution.</description>

      <title>Computational complexity of sum-of-squares bounds for copositive programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, copositive programming has received significant attention for its ability to model hard problems in both discrete and continuous optimization. Several relaxations of copositive programs based on semidefinite programming (SDP) have been proposed in the literature, meant to provide tractable bounds. However, while these SDP-based relaxations are amenable to the ellipsoid algorithm and interior point methods, it is not immediately obvious that they can be solved in polynomial time (even approximately). In this paper, we consider the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchies of relaxations for copositive programs introduced by Parrilo (2000), de Klerk &amp; Pasechnik (2002) and Pe\~na, Vera &amp; Zuluaga (2006), which can be formulated as SDPs. We establish sufficient conditions that guarantee the polynomial-time computability (up to fixed precision) of these relaxations. These conditions are satisfied by copositive programs that represent standard quadratic programs and their reciprocals. As an application, we show that the SOS bounds for the (weighted) stability number of a graph can be computed efficiently. Additionally, we provide pathological examples of copositive programs (that do not satisfy the sufficient conditions) whose SOS relaxations admit only feasible solutions of doubly-exponential size.</description>

      <title>Scalable Second-Order Optimization Algorithms for Minimizing Low-rank Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03718v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a random-subspace variant of cubic regularization algorithm that chooses the size of the subspace adaptively, based on the rank of the projected second derivative matrix. Iteratively, our variant only requires access to (small-dimensional) projections of first- and second-order problem derivatives and calculates a reduced step inexpensively. The ensuing method maintains the optimal global rate of convergence of (full-dimensional) cubic regularization, while showing improved scalability both theoretically and numerically, particularly when applied to low-rank functions. When applied to the latter, our algorithm naturally adapts the subspace size to the true rank of the function, without knowing it a priori.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Network Expansion Planning considering the Chicken-and-egg Dilemma and Market Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03744v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Green hydrogen is thought to be a game changer for reaching sustainability targets. However, the transition to a green hydrogen economy faces a critical challenge known as the `chicken-and-egg dilemma', wherein establishing a hydrogen supply network relies on demand, while demand only grows with reliable supply. In addition, as the hydrogen market is in the early stage, predicting demand distributions is challenging due to lack of data availability. This paper addresses these complex issues through a risk-averse framework with the introduction of a distributionally robust hydrogen network expansion planning problem under decision-dependent demand ambiguity. The problem optimizes location and production capacity decisions of the suppliers considering the moments of the stochastic hydrogen demand as a function of these investment decisions. To obtain tractable representations of this problem, we derive two different reformulations that consider continuous and discrete hydrogen demand support sets under different forms of decision dependencies. To efficiently solve the reformulations, we develop a tailored algorithm based on the column-and-constraint generation approach, and enhance the computational performance through solving the master problems to a relative optimality gap, decomposing the subproblems, and integrating pre-generated columns and constraints. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we investigate a real case study leveraging data from the "Hydrogen Energy Applications in Valley Environments for Northern Netherlands (HEAVENN)" project. The results reveal that considering the chicken-and-egg dilemma under uncertain hydrogen market conditions leads to earlier and more diverse investments, providing critical insights for policymakers based on the degree of decision dependency.</description>

      <title>The maximal angle between $3 \times 3$ copositive matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2010, Hiriart-Urruty and Seeger posed the problem of finding the maximal possible angle $\theta_n$ between two copositive matrices of order $n$. They proved that $\theta_2=\frac{3}{4}\pi$. In this paper, we study the maximal angle between two copositive matrices of order 3. We show that $\theta_3=\frac{3}{4}\pi$ and give all possible pairs of matrices achieving this maximal angle. The proof is based on case analysis and uses optimization and basic linear algebra techniques.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of a nonlinear kinetic Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tracking type optimal control problem for a nonlinear and nonlocal kinetic Fokker-Planck equation which arises as the mean field limit of an interacting particle systems that is subject to distance dependent random fluctuations is studied. As the equation of interest is only hypocoercive and the control operator is unbounded with respect to the canonical state space, classical variational solution techniques cannot be utilized directly. Instead, the concept of admissible control operators is employed. For the underlying nonlinearities, local Lipschitz estimates are derived and subsequently used within a fixed point argument to obtain local existence of solutions. Again, due to hypocoercivity, existence of optimal controls requires non standard techniques as (compensated) compactness arguments are not readily available.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entropic regularizations of optimal transport problems under suitable summability assumptions on the point-wise transport cost. These summability assumptions already appear in the literature. However, we show that the weakest compactness conditions that can be derived are already enough to obtain the convergence of the regularized functionals. This approach allows us to characterize the variational limit of the regularization even when it does not converge to the original problem. The results apply also to problems with more than two marginals.</description>

      <title>Learning to Relax Nonconvex Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) are ubiquitous in optimization: Such problems arise in applications from operations research, power systems, signal processing, chemical engineering, portfolio theory, among others. Despite their flexibility in modeling real-life situations and the recent effort to understand their properties, nonconvex QCQPs are hard to solve in practice. Most of the approaches in the literature are based on either Linear Programming (LP) or Semidefinite Programming (SDP) relaxations, each of which works very well for some problem subclasses but perform poorly on others. In this paper, we develop a relaxation selection procedure for nonconvex QCQPs that can adaptively decide whether an LP- or SDP-based approach is expected to be more beneficial by considering the instance structure. The proposed methodology relies on utilizing machine learning methods that involve features derived from spectral properties and sparsity patterns of data matrices, and once trained appropriately, the prediction model is applicable to any instance with an arbitrary number of variables and constraints. We train and test classification and regression models over synthetically generated instances, and empirically show the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the particle method to approximate the gradient flow on the $L^p$-Wasserstein space. This method relies on the discretization of the energy introduced by [3] via nonoverlapping balls centered at the particles and preserves the gradient flow structure at the particle level. We prove the convergence of the discrete gradient flow to the continuum gradient flow on the $L^p$-Wasserstein space over $\mathbb R$, specifically to the doubly nonlinear diffusion equation in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Turbulence modeling over riblets via domain transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical and experimental studies have demonstrated the drag-reducing potential of carefully designed streamwise-elongated riblets in lowering skin-friction drag. To support the systematic design of such surface corrugations, recent efforts have integrated simplified versions of the governing equations with innovative methods for representing the effects of rough boundaries on flow dynamics. Notably, the statistical response of the eddy-viscosity-enhanced linearized Navier-Stokes equations has been shown to effectively capture the ability of riblets in suppressing turbulence, quantify the influence of background turbulence on the mean velocity, and reproduce established drag-reduction trends. In this paper, we enhance the flexibility and computational efficiency of this simulation-free approach by implementing a domain transformation for surface representation, along with a perturbation analysis on a small geometric parameter of the riblets. While domain transformation complicates the differential equations, it provides accurate boundary representations and facilitates the analysis of complex riblet shapes at high Reynolds numbers by enabling perturbation analysis to simplify the dimensional complexity of the governing equations. Our method successfully predicts drag reduction trends for semi-circular riblets, consistent with existing literature. We further utilize our framework to investigate flow mechanisms influenced by riblets and extend our study to channel flows with friction Reynolds numbers up to 2003. Our findings reveal the emergence of Kelvin-Helmholtz rollers over large and sharp semi-circular riblets, contributing to the degradation of drag reduction in these geometries. Additionally, we examine the impact of riblets on near-wall flow structures, focusing on their suppression of streamwise-elongated structures in flows over large riblets.</description>

      <title>Proxy Control Barrier Functions: Integrating Barrier-Based and Lyapunov-Based Safety-Critical Control Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel Proxy Control Barrier Function (PCBF) scheme that integrates barrier-based and Lyapunov-based safety-critical control strategies for strict-feedback systems with potentially unknown dynamics. The proposed method employs a modular design procedure, decomposing the original system into a proxy subsystem and a virtual tracking subsystem that are controlled by the control barrier function (CBF)-based and Lyapunov-based controllers, respectively. By integrating these separately designed controllers, the overall system's safety is ensured. Moreover, a new filter-based disturbance observer is utilized to design a PCBF-based safe controller for strict-feedback systems subject to mismatched disturbances. This approach broadens the class of systems to which CBF-based methods can be applied and significantly simplifies CBF construction by requiring only the model of the proxy subsystem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>An obstruction to small-time local controllability for a bilinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the small-time local controllability in the vicinity of the ground state of a bilinear Schr\"odinger equation with Neumann boundary conditions. We prove that, when the linearized system is not controllable, the nonlinear system is not controllable, due to a quadratic obstruction involving the squared norm of the control's primitive. This obstruction has been known since 1983 for ODEs and observed for some PDEs since 2006. However, our situation is more intricate since the kernel describing the quadratic expansion of the solution is not twice differentiable. We thus follow a Fourier-based approach, closer to the one used for quadratic obstructions of fractional Sobolev regularity.
  In this Fourier-based approach, a challenge is to formulate a necessary and sufficient condition on the convolution kernel, for the quadratic form to be coercive. In previous studies, the coercivity was ensured by a signed asymptotic equivalent for the Fourier transform of the convolution kernel of the form $\widehat{K}(\omega) \sim \omega^{-2}$ as $|\omega| \to \infty$. In our case, $\widehat{K}$ is a distribution which has singularities and changes sign up to infinity. We still prove coercivity because one of the signs appears too infrequently.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Optimization for the Evolve-Filter-Relax regularization of convection-dominated flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical stabilization techniques are often employed in under-resolved simulations of convection-dominated flows to improve accuracy and mitigate spurious oscillations. Specifically, the Evolve-Filter-Relax (EFR) algorithm is a framework which consists in evolving the solution, applying a filtering step to remove high-frequency noise, and relaxing through a convex combination of filtered and original solutions. The stability and accuracy of the EFR solution strongly depend on two parameters, the filter radius $\delta$ and the relaxation parameter $\chi$. Standard choices for these parameters are usually fixed in time, and related to the full order model setting, i.e., the grid size for $\delta$ and the time step for $\chi$. This paper makes two significant improvements to the standard EFR framework by proposing: (i) time-dependent parameters, (ii) data-driven adaptive optimization of the parameters in time, considering a fully-resolved simulation as a reference. In particular, we propose three different classes of Optimized-EFR strategies, aiming to optimize one or both parameters. Moreover, we investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed optimization algorithms considering different objective functions, both local (point-valued) and global (such as the kinetic energy). The new Optimized-EFR strategies are tested in the under-resolved simulation of a turbulent flow past a cylinder at $Re=1000$. The new Optimized-EFR results are more accurate than the standard EFR solution while maintaining a similar computational time. In particular, we show that using a global objective function and including the $H^1$ velocity seminorm is crucial to accurately match the reference flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Optimal Partition for Multi-Type Queueing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an optimal server partition and customer assignment problem for an uncapacitated FCFS queueing system with heterogeneous types of customers. Each type of customers is associated with a Poisson arrival, a certain service time distribution, and a unit waiting cost. The goal is to minimize the expected total waiting cost by partitioning the server into sub-queues, each with a smaller service capacity, and routing customer types probabilistically. First, we show that by properly partitioning the queue, it is possible to reduce the expected waiting costs by an arbitrarily large ratio. Then, we show that for any given server partition, the optimal customer assignment admits a certain geometric structure, enabling an efficient algorithm to find the optimal assignment. Such an optimal structure also applies when minimizing the expected sojourn time. Finally, we consider the joint partition-assignment optimization problem. The customer assignment under the optimal server partition admits a stronger structure. Specifically, if the first two moments of the service time distributions satisfy certain properties, it is optimal to deterministically assign customer types with consecutive service rates to the same sub-queue. This structure allows for more efficient algorithms. Overall, the common rule of thumb to partition customers into continuous segments ranked by service rates could be suboptimal, and our work is the first to comprehensively study the queue partition problem based on customer types.</description>

      <title>Improving the Convergence Rates for the Kinetic Fokker-Planck Equation by Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.01369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long time behavior and detailed convergence analysis of Langevin equations has received increased attention over the last years. Difficulties arise from a lack of coercivity, usually termed hypocoercivity, of the underlying kinetic Fokker-Planck operator which is a consequence of the partially deterministic nature of a second order stochastic differential equation. In this manuscript, the effect of controlling the confinement potential without altering the original invariant measure is investigated. This leads to an abstract bilinear control system with an unbounded but infinite-time admissible control operator which, by means of an artificial diffusion approach, is shown to possess a unique solution. The compactness of the underlying semigroup is further used to define an infinite-horizon optimal control problem on an appropriately reduced state space. Under smallness assumptions on the initial data, feasibility of and existence of a solution to the optimal control problem are discussed. Numerical results based on a local approximation based on a shifted Riccati equation illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Variable Projection Algorithms: Theoretical Insights and A Novel Approach for Problems with Large Residual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper delves into an in-depth exploration of the Variable Projection (VP) algorithm, a powerful tool for solving separable nonlinear optimization problems across multiple domains, including system identification, image processing, and machine learning. We first establish a theoretical framework to examine the effect of the approximate treatment of the coupling relationship among parameters on the local convergence of the VP algorithm and theoretically prove that the Kaufman's VP algorithm can achieve a similar convergence rate as the Golub \&amp; Pereyra's form. These studies fill the gap in the existing convergence theory analysis, and provide a solid foundation for understanding the mechanism of VP algorithm and broadening its application horizons. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from these theoretical revelations, we design a refined VP algorithm for handling separable nonlinear optimization problems characterized by large residual, called VPLR, which boosts the convergence performance by addressing the interdependence of parameters within the separable model and by continually correcting the approximated Hessian matrix to counteract the influence of large residual during the iterative process. The effectiveness of this refined algorithm is corroborated through numerical experimentation.</description>

      <title>Constrained Stochastic Recursive Momentum Successive Convex Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider stochastic optimization problems with non-convex functional constraints, such as those arising in trajectory generation, sparse approximation, and robust classification. To this end, we put forth a recursive momentum-based accelerated successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. At each iteration, the proposed algorithm entails constructing convex surrogates of the stochastic objective and the constraint functions, and solving the resulting convex optimization problem. A recursive update rule is employed to track the gradient of the stochastic objective function, which contributes to variance reduction and hence accelerates the algorithm convergence. A key ingredient of the proof is a new parameterized version of the standard Mangasarian-Fromowitz Constraints Qualification, that allows us to bound the dual variables and hence obtain problem-dependent bounds on the rate at which the iterates approach an $\epsilon$-stationary point. Remarkably, the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal stochastic first-order (SFO) complexity with adaptive step sizes and optimal SFO complexity with non-adaptive step sizes at par with that achieved by state-of-the-art stochastic optimization algorithms for solving unconstrained problems. As an example, we detail a obstacle-avoiding trajectory optimization problem that can be solved using the proposed algorithm and show that its performance is superior to that of the existing algorithms used for trajectory optimization. The performance of the proposed algorithm is also shown to be comparable to that of a specialized sparse classification algorithm applied to a binary classification problem.</description>

      <title>Converse Lyapunov Results for Stability of Switched Systems with Average Dwell-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article provides a characterization of stability for switched nonlinear systems under average dwell-time constraints, in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions involving multiple Lyapunov functions. Earlier converse results focus on switched systems with dwell-time constraints only, and the resulting inequalities depend on the flow of individual subsystems. With the help of a counterexample, we show that a lower bound that guarantees stability for dwell-time switching signals may not necessarily imply stability for switching signals with same lower bound on the average dwell-time. Based on these two observations, we provide a converse result for the average dwell-time constrained systems in terms of inequalities which do not depend on the flow of individual subsystems and are easier to check. The particular case of linear switched systems is studied as a corollary to our main result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of optimization problems in the Wasserstein space (the space of probability measures) where the objective function is nonconvex along generalized geodesics. Specifically, the objective exhibits some difference-of-convex structure along these geodesics. The setting also encompasses sampling problems where the logarithm of the target distribution is difference-of-convex. We derive multiple convergence insights for a novel semi Forward-Backward Euler scheme under several nonconvex (and possibly nonsmooth) regimes. Notably, the semi Forward-Backward Euler is just a slight modification of the Forward-Backward Euler whose convergence is -- to our knowledge -- still unknown in our very general non-geodesically-convex setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the policy iteration algorithm (PIA) for entropy-regularized stochastic control problems on an infinite time horizon with a large discount rate, focusing on two main scenarios. First, we analyze PIA with bounded coefficients where the controls applied to the diffusion term satisfy a smallness condition. We demonstrate the convergence of PIA based on a uniform $\mathcal{C}^{2,\alpha}$ estimate for the value sequence generated by PIA, and provide a quantitative convergence analysis for this scenario. Second, we investigate PIA with unbounded coefficients but no control over the diffusion term. In this scenario, we first provide the well-posedness of the exploratory Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation with linear growth coefficients and polynomial growth reward function. By such a well-posedess result we achieve PIA's convergence by establishing a quantitative locally uniform $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}$ estimates for the generated value sequence.</description>

      <title>Aubin Property and Strong Regularity Are Equivalent for Nonlinear Second-Order Cone Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper solves a fundamental open problem in variational analysis on the equivalence between the Aubin property and the strong regularity for nonlinear second-order cone programming (SOCP) at a locally optimal solution. We achieve this by introducing a reduction approach to the Aubin property characterized by the Mordukhovich criterion and a lemma of alternative choices on cones to replace the S-lemma used in Outrata and Ram\'irez [SIAM J. Optim. 21 (2011) 789-823] and Opazo, Outrata, and Ram\'irez [SIAM J. Optim. 27 (2017) 2141-2151], where the same SOCP was considered under the strict complementarity condition except for possibly only one block of constraints. As a byproduct, we also offer a new approach to the well-known result of Dontchev and Rockafellar [SIAM J. Optim. 6 (1996) 1087-1105] on the equivalence of the two concepts in conventional nonlinear programming.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of the Aubin Property of the Solution Mapping for Nonlinear Semidefinite Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Aubin property of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker solution mapping for the nonlinear semidefinite programming (NLSDP) problem at a locally optimal solution. In the literature, it is known that the Aubin property implies the constraint nondegeneracy by Fusek [SIAM J. Optim. 23 (2013), pp. 1041-1061] and the second-order sufficient condition by Ding et al. [SIAM J. Optim. 27 (2017), pp. 67-90]. Based on the Mordukhovich criterion, here we further prove that the strong second-order sufficient condition is also necessary for the Aubin property to hold. Consequently, several equivalent conditions including the strong regularity are established for NLSDP's Aubin property. Together with the recent progress made by Chen et al. on the equivalence between the Aubin property and the strong regularity for nonlinear second-order cone programming [SIAM J. Optim., in press; arXiv:2406.13798v3 (2024)], this paper constitutes a significant step forward in characterizing the Aubin property for general non-polyhedral $C^2$-cone reducible constrained optimization problems.</description>

      <title>SymILO: A Symmetry-Aware Learning Framework for Integer Linear Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integer linear programs (ILPs) are commonly employed to model diverse practical problems such as scheduling and planning. Recently, machine learning techniques have been utilized to solve ILPs. A straightforward idea is to train a model via supervised learning, with an ILP as the input and an optimal solution as the label. An ILP is symmetric if its variables can be permuted without changing the problem structure, resulting in numerous equivalent and optimal solutions. Randomly selecting an optimal solution as the label can introduce variability in the training data, which may hinder the model from learning stable patterns. In this work, we incorporate the intrinsic symmetry of ILPs and propose a novel training framework called SymILO. Specifically, we modify the learning task by introducing solution permutation along with neural network weights as learnable parameters and then design an alternating algorithm to jointly optimize the loss function. We conduct extensive experiments on ILPs involving different symmetries and the computational results demonstrate that our symmetry-aware approach significantly outperforms three existing methods -- achieving $50.3\%$, $66.5\%$, and $45.4\%$ average improvements, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We consider a system of diffusion processes interacting through their empirical distribution. Assuming that the empirical average of a given observable can be observed at any time, we derive regularity and quantitative stability results for the optimal solutions in the associated version of the Gibbs conditioning principle. The proofs rely on the analysis of a McKean-Vlasov control problem with distributional constraints. Some new estimates are derived for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations and the Hessian of the log-density of diffusion processes, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Trade-off Invariance Principle for minimizers of regularized functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider functionals of the form $H_\alpha(u)=F(u)+\alpha G(u)$ with $\alpha\in[0,+\infty)$, where $u$ varies in a set $U\neq\emptyset$ (without further structure). We first show that, excluding at most countably many values of $\alpha$, we have that $\inf_{H_\alpha^\star}G= \sup_{H_\alpha^\star}G$, where $H_\alpha^\star := \arg \min_U H_\alpha$, which is assumed to be non-empty. We further prove a stronger result that concerns the invariance of the limiting value of the functional $G$ along minimizing sequences for $H_\alpha$. Moreover, we show to what extent these findings generalize to multi-regularized functionals and -- in the presence of an underlying differentiable structure -- to critical points. Finally, the main result implies an unexpected consequence for functionals regularized with uniformly convex norms: excluding again at most countably many values of $\alpha$, it turns out that for a minimizing sequence, convergence to a minimizer in the weak or strong sense is equivalent.</description>

Abstract: Convex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) involve finding a solution within a convex feasible region defined by quadratic constraints while minimizing a convex quadratic objective function. These problems arise in various industrial applications, including power systems and signal processing. Traditional methods for solving convex QCQPs primarily rely on matrix factorization, which quickly becomes computationally prohibitive as the problem size increases. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained attention for their potential in representing and solving various optimization problems such as linear programs and linearly constrained quadratic programs. In this work, we investigate the representation power of GNNs in the context of QCQP tasks. Specifically, we propose a new tripartite graph representation for general convex QCQPs and properly associate it with message-passing GNNs. We demonstrate that there exist GNNs capable of reliably representing key properties of convex QCQPs, including feasibility, optimal value, and optimal solution. Our result deepens the understanding of the connection between QCQPs and GNNs, paving the way for future machine learning approaches to efficiently solve QCQPs.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Modeling and Decomposition of Hierarchical Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a graph-theoretic modeling approach for hierarchical optimization that leverages the OptiGraph abstraction implemented in the Julia package Plasmo.jl. We show that the abstraction is flexible and can effectively capture complex hierarchical connectivity that arises from decision-making over multiple spatial and temporal scales (e.g., integration of planning, scheduling, and operations in manufacturing and infrastructures). We also show that the graph abstraction facilitates the conceptualization and implementation of decomposition and approximation schemes. Specifically, we propose a graph-based Benders decomposition (gBD) framework that enables the exploitation of hierarchical (nested) structures and that uses graph aggregation/partitioning procedures to discover such structures. In addition, we provide a Julia implementation of gBD, which we call PlasmoBenders.jl. We illustrate the capabilities using examples arising in the context of energy and power systems.</description>

      <title>On Penalty-based Bilevel Gradient Descent Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05185v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization enjoys a wide range of applications in emerging machine learning and signal processing problems such as hyper-parameter optimization, image reconstruction, meta-learning, adversarial training, and reinforcement learning. However, bilevel optimization problems are traditionally known to be difficult to solve. Recent progress on bilevel algorithms mainly focuses on bilevel optimization problems through the lens of the implicit-gradient method, where the lower-level objective is either strongly convex or unconstrained. In this work, we tackle a challenging class of bilevel problems through the lens of the penalty method. We show that under certain conditions, the penalty reformulation recovers the (local) solutions of the original bilevel problem. Further, we propose the penalty-based bilevel gradient descent (PBGD) algorithm and establish its finite-time convergence for the constrained bilevel problem with lower-level constraints yet without lower-level strong convexity. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets showcase the efficiency of the proposed PBGD algorithm.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Learning and Decision-Making: Breaking the $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ Barrier in Online Resource Allocation with First-Order Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online linear programming plays an important role in both revenue management and resource allocation, and recent research has focused on developing efficient first-order online learning algorithms. Despite the empirical success of first-order methods, they typically achieve a regret no better than $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$, which is suboptimal compared to the $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ bound guaranteed by the state-of-the-art linear programming (LP)-based online algorithms. This paper establishes several important facts about online linear programming, which unveils the challenge for first-order-method-based online algorithms to achieve beyond $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. To address the challenge, we introduce a new algorithmic framework that decouples learning from decision-making. For the first time, we show that first-order methods can attain regret $\mathcal{O}(T^{1/3})$ with this new framework.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Jump-Diffusions, with Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) for stochastic control in which system dynamics are governed by jump-diffusion processes. We formulate an entropy-regularized exploratory control problem with stochastic policies to capture the exploration--exploitation balance essential for RL. Unlike the pure diffusion case initially studied by Wang et al. (2020), the derivation of the exploratory dynamics under jump-diffusions calls for a careful formulation of the jump part. Through a theoretical analysis, we find that one can simply use the same policy evaluation and $q$-learning algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022a, 2023), originally developed for controlled diffusions, without needing to check a priori whether the underlying data come from a pure diffusion or a jump-diffusion. However, we show that the presence of jumps ought to affect parameterizations of actors and critics in general. We investigate as an application the mean--variance portfolio selection problem with stock price modelled as a jump-diffusion, and show that both RL algorithms and parameterizations are invariant with respect to jumps. Finally, we present a detailed study on applying the general theory to option hedging.</description>

      <title>Adjoint Matching: Fine-tuning Flow and Diffusion Generative Models with Memoryless Stochastic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08861v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical generative models that produce samples through an iterative process, such as Flow Matching and denoising diffusion models, have seen widespread use, but there have not been many theoretically-sound methods for improving these models with reward fine-tuning. In this work, we cast reward fine-tuning as stochastic optimal control (SOC). Critically, we prove that a very specific memoryless noise schedule must be enforced during fine-tuning, in order to account for the dependency between the noise variable and the generated samples. We also propose a new algorithm named Adjoint Matching which outperforms existing SOC algorithms, by casting SOC problems as a regression problem. We find that our approach significantly improves over existing methods for reward fine-tuning, achieving better consistency, realism, and generalization to unseen human preference reward models, while retaining sample diversity.</description>

      <title>Robust Gaussian Processes via Relevance Pursuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are non-parametric probabilistic regression models that are popular due to their flexibility, data efficiency, and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. However, standard GP models assume homoskedastic Gaussian noise, while many real-world applications are subject to non-Gaussian corruptions. Variants of GPs that are more robust to alternative noise models have been proposed, and entail significant trade-offs between accuracy and robustness, and between computational requirements and theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose and study a GP model that achieves robustness against sparse outliers by inferring data-point-specific noise levels with a sequential selection procedure maximizing the log marginal likelihood that we refer to as relevance pursuit. We show, surprisingly, that the model can be parameterized such that the associated log marginal likelihood is strongly concave in the data-point-specific noise variances, a property rarely found in either robust regression objectives or GP marginal likelihoods. This in turn implies the weak submodularity of the corresponding subset selection problem, and thereby proves approximation guarantees for the proposed algorithm. We compare the model's performance relative to other approaches on diverse regression and Bayesian optimization tasks, including the challenging but common setting of sparse corruptions of the labels within or close to the function range.</description>

      <title>Constrained Sampling with Primal-Dual Langevin Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers the problem of sampling from a probability distribution known up to a normalization constant while satisfying a set of statistical constraints specified by the expected values of general nonlinear functions. This problem finds applications in, e.g., Bayesian inference, where it can constrain moments to evaluate counterfactual scenarios or enforce desiderata such as prediction fairness. Methods developed to handle support constraints, such as those based on mirror maps, barriers, and penalties, are not suited for this task. This work therefore relies on gradient descent-ascent dynamics in Wasserstein space to put forward a discrete-time primal-dual Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm (PD-LMC) that simultaneously constrains the target distribution and samples from it. We analyze the convergence of PD-LMC under standard assumptions on the target distribution and constraints, namely (strong) convexity and log-Sobolev inequalities. To do so, we bring classical optimization arguments for saddle-point algorithms to the geometry of Wasserstein space. We illustrate the relevance and effectiveness of PD-LMC in several applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we polynomially reduce an instance of the partition problem to a dynamic lot sizing problem, and show that solving the latter problem solves the former problem. By solving the dynamic programming formulation of the dynamic lot sizing problem, we show that the instance of the partition problem can be solved with pseudo-polynomial time complexity. Numerical results on solving instances of the partition problem are also provided using an implementation of the algorithm that solves the dynamic program.</description>

      <title>Gradient descent inference in empirical risk minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient descent is one of the most widely used iterative algorithms in modern statistical learning. However, its precise algorithmic dynamics in high-dimensional settings remain only partially understood, which has therefore limited its broader potential for statistical inference applications.
  This paper provides a precise, non-asymptotic distributional characterization of gradient descent iterates in a broad class of empirical risk minimization problems, in the so-called mean-field regime where the sample size is proportional to the signal dimension. Our non-asymptotic state evolution theory holds for both general non-convex loss functions and non-Gaussian data, and reveals the central role of two Onsager correction matrices that precisely characterize the non-trivial dependence among all gradient descent iterates in the mean-field regime.
  Although the Onsager correction matrices are typically analytically intractable, our state evolution theory facilitates a generic gradient descent inference algorithm that consistently estimates these matrices across a broad class of models. Leveraging this algorithm, we show that the state evolution can be inverted to construct (i) data-driven estimators for the generalization error of gradient descent iterates and (ii) debiased gradient descent iterates for inference of the unknown signal. Detailed applications to two canonical models--linear regression and (generalized) logistic regression--are worked out to illustrate model-specific features of our general theory and inference methods.</description>

      <title>Follow The Approximate Sparse Leader for No-Regret Online Sparse Linear Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of \textit{online sparse linear approximation}, where one predicts the best sparse approximation of a sequence of measurements in terms of linear combination of columns of a given measurement matrix. Such online prediction problems are ubiquitous, ranging from medical trials to web caching to resource allocation. The inherent difficulty of offline recovery also makes the online problem challenging. In this letter, we propose Follow-The-Approximate-Sparse-Leader, an efficient online meta-policy to address this online problem. Through a detailed theoretical analysis, we prove that under certain assumptions on the measurement sequence, the proposed policy enjoys a data-dependent sublinear upper bound on the static regret, which can range from logarithmic to square-root. Numerical simulations are performed to corroborate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed online policy.</description>
