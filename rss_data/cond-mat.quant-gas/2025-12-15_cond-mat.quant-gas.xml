      <title>Geometry Induced Localization and Multifractality in Spiral quasiperiodic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a quasiperiodic Aubry Andre lattice arranged along a spiral curve. In this setup, the changing angle of the spiral naturally stretches and compresses the distances between neighboring sites, which in turn modulates the hopping amplitudes.
  The onsite potential itself remains the familiar AA form, but this geometry induced variation in the hopping dramatically changes how the system behaves both in its energy spectrum and in how its states localize.Using inverse participation ratios together with a full multifractal analysis, we find that curvature makes the system localize much more easily, even at relatively small quasiperiodic strengths. It also produces clear windows where the eigenstates become strongly multifractal. This shows that quasiperiodicity and geometry do not act independently rather, they reinforce one another in shaping the wavefunctions. Overall, we observe a smooth evolution of the states from extended, to multifractal, and finally to strongly localized. Our results pave the way for creating tunable quasiperiodic and geometry-driven localization effects in photonic waveguide arrays, ultracold atoms, mechanical metamaterials, and nanoscale platforms.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal scales of dynamical quantum phase transitions in the Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spatial and temporal scales of dynamical quantum phase transitions in the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the strong interaction limit. Using Jordan-Wigner transformation, we obtain the time-dependent wavefunction and therefore the subsystem Loschmidt echo, and systematically investigate how its properties vary with subsystem size. It is found that when the subsystem is sufficiently large, it exhibits logarithmic divergence identical to that of the full system Loschmidt echo, yielding a critical exponent of zero. We also obtain the required subsystem size and temporal resolution for detecting dynamical quantum phase transitions using the subsystem Loschmidt echo. It is expected that the present results provide a reliable foundation for further experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent effective field theory to nonuniversal Lee-Huang-Yang term in quantum droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum droplets (QDs) in weakly interacting ultracold quantum gases are typically characterized by mean-field theories incorporating Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) quantum fluctuations under simplified zero-range interaction assumptions. However, bridging these models to broader physical regimes like superfluid helium requires precise understanding of short-range interatomic interactions. Here, we investigate how finite-range interactions--next-order corrections to zero-range potentials--significantly alter QDs mechanics. Using a consistent effective theory, we derive an analytical equation of state (EOS) for three-dimensional bosonic mixtures under finite-range interactions at zero temperature. Leveraging the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, we demonstrate that interspecies attraction facilitates bosonic pairing across components characterized by the non-perturbative parameter of $\Delta$, leading to nonuniversal LHY terms that encode short-range interaction details while recovering previous universal QDs EOS in the zero-range limit. Extending superfluid hydrodynamic equations for two-component systems, we predict fractional frequency shifts in breathing modes induced by these nonuniversal terms. Experimental observation of these shifts would reveal critical insights into QDs dynamics and interatomic potential characteristics.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent inclusion of disorder in the BCS-BEC crossover near $T_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic theoretical approach to incorporate the effects of a static white-noise disorder into the BCS-BEC crossover near the critical temperature ($T_c$) of the superfluid transition. Starting from a functional-integral formulation in momentum-frequency space, we derive an effective thermodynamic potential that fully accounts for Gaussian fluctuations of the order-parameter field and its coupling to the disorder potential. The effective action, expanded to second order in both the disorder potential and the bosonic field, naturally involves third- and fourth-order terms arising from the logarithmic expansion near $T_c$. This formalism, valid across the entire BCS-BEC crossover, reproduces the well-established BCS and BEC limits and yields self-energy expressions consistent with previous analyses for non-interacting point bosons and tightly bound fermion pairs. The approach applies equally to continuum and lattice systems and provides a natural framework for generalizations to multiband models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter we review results on the lattice Schwinger model. In par-ticular, we show how the effect of the anomaly is reproduced on the lattice. We connect these results to recent developments in the field of quantum simulation of interacting field theories. Schemes for the quantum simulation of (approximations of) Schwinger models are discussed.</description>

      <title>Tailoring quantum walks in integrated photonic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike discrete photonic circuits, which manipulate photons step-by-step using a series of optical elements, arrays of coupled waveguides enable photons to interfere continuously across the entire structure. When composed of a nonlinear material, such arrays can also directly generate quantum states of light within the circuit. To clarify the similarities and distinctions between these two approaches of quantum walks, we conduct here a systematic comparison between linear waveguide arrays, injected with photons produced externally, and nonlinear arrays, where photon pairs are continuously generated via parametric down-conversion. We experimentally validate these predictions using III-V semiconductor nonlinear waveguide lattices with varied geometries, enabling us to tune the depth of the quantum walks over an order of magnitude and reveal the gradual emergence of non-classicality in the output state. Finally, we demonstrate an inverse-design approach to engineer \textit{aperiodic} waveguide arrays, whose optimized coupling profiles generate maximally entangled states such as the biphoton W-state. These results highlight the potential of continuously-coupled photonic systems to harness high-dimensional entanglement within compact architectures.</description>

      <title>Parametric pair production of collective excitations in a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By exciting the transverse breathing mode of an elongated Bose-Einstein condensate, we parametrically produce longitudinal collective excitations in a pairwise manner. This process also referred to as Faraday wave generation, can be seen as an analog to cosmological particle production. Building upon single particle detection, we investigate the early time dynamics of the exponential growth and compare our observations with a Bogoliubov description. The growth rate we observe experimentally is in very good agreement with theoretical predictions, demonstrating the validity of the Bogoliubov description and thereby confirming the smallness of quasiparticle interactions in such an elongated gas. We also discuss the presence of oscillations in the atom number, which are due to pair correlations and to the rate at which interactions are switched off.</description>

      <title>Steady state diagram of interacting fermionic atoms coupled to dissipative cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate fermionic atoms subjected to an optical lattice and coupled to a high finesse optical cavity with photon losses. A transverse pump beam introduces a coupling between the atoms and the cavity field. We explore the steady state phase diagram taking fluctuations around the mean-field of the atoms-cavity coupling into account. Our approach allows us to investigate both one- and higher-dimensional atomic systems. The fluctuations beyond mean-field lead to an effective temperature which changes the nature of the self-organization transition. We find a strong dependence of the results on the atomic filling, in particular when contrasting the behavior at low filling and at half filling. At low filling the transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths a strongly non-monotonous behavior of the temperature is found and hints towards effects of cavity cooling at many-body resonances. Additionally multiple self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a fluctuation-induced bistability, with the two solutions having different effective temperatures previously discussed in [Tolle et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 133602 (2025)]. In contrast, at half filling a bistable region arises at the self-organization transition already neglecting the fluctuations. The presence of the fluctuations induce an effective temperature as at lower filling and change the behavior of the transition and the steady states drastically. We analyze the properties of the occurring steady states of the coupled atoms-cavity system.</description>

      <title>Quartic level repulsion in a quantum chaotic three-body system without symplectic symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the fundamental symmetry classes of quantum chaotic systems in Dyson's threefold way, the symplectic class is rarely observed in nature. Characterized by the strongest possible level repulsion in the energy spectrum, the symplectic symmetry class also implies a double (Kramers) degeneracy of levels. Studying the spectral statistics of three quantum particles (identical bosons or mass-imbalanced fermions) in a harmonic trap, we find numerical evidence for strong level repulsion in the regime of weak contact interactions. While the statistical indicators are consistent with quantum chaos in systems with symplectic symmetry, the absence of Kramers degeneracy rules out this symmetry. In the strongly-interacting unitary limit either Poissonian or stick statistics are observed (depending on commensurability of the mass ratio) indicating regular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dispersion of plasmons in three-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the plasma branch of an homogeneous three-dimensional electron gas in an $s$-wave superconducting state. We focus on the regime where the plasma frequency $\omega_p$ is comparable to the gap $\Delta$, which is experimentally realized in cuprates. Although a sum rule guarantees that the departure of the plasma branch always coincides with the plasma frequency, the dispersion and lifetime of the plasmons is strongly affected by the presence of the pair condensate, especially at energies close to the pair-breaking threshold $2\Delta$. When $\omega_p $ is above $1.7\Delta $, the level repulsion is strong enough to give the plasma branch an anomalous, negative dispersion with a minimum at finite wavelength. At non-zero temperature and at $\omega_p&gt;2\Delta$, we treat in a non-perturbative way the coupling of plasmons to the fermionic excitations, and show that a broadened plasma resonance inside the pair-breaking continuum coexists with an undamped solution in the band gap. This resonance splitting is associated with the presence of multiple poles in the analytic continuation of the propagator of the Cooper pairs.</description>

      <title>A theory of quasiballistic spin transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15756v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent work [Mierzejewski et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 045134 (2023)] observed "quasiballistic spin transport" - long-lived and transiently ballistic modes of the magnetization density - in numerical simulations of infinite-temperature XXZ chains with power-law exchange interactions. We develop an analytical theory of such quasiballistic spin transport. Previous work found that this effect was maximized along a specific locus in the space of model parameters, which interpolated smoothly between the integrable Haldane-Shastry and XX models and whose shape was estimated from numerics. We obtain an analytical estimate for the lifetime of the spin current and show that it has a unique maximum along a different locus, which interpolates more gradually between the two integrable points. We further rule out the existence of a conserved two-body operator that protects ballistic spin transport away from these integrable points by proving that a corresponding functional equation has no solutions. We discuss connections between our approach and an integrability-transport conjecture for spin.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy dark matter halos with repulsive self-interactions: coherent soliton and halo vortex network with moderate self-coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the impact of moderate repulsive self-interactions on fuzzy dark matter halos generated by merging smaller Gaussian density concentrations. We study the size of the core and the granules, the spatial dependence of the field's coherence, the turbulent vortex tangle and the oscillation frequency of the central soliton, covering the range from quantum-pressure-dominated to self-interaction-dominated stabilisation of the solitonic core. For the probed self-coupling strengths $g$ and with a fixed initial configuration, mergers with increasing $g$ result in cores with increased size and a reduced central density, oscillating with decreased frequency, in accordance with expectations from the study of isolated Self-interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter (SFDM) solitons. By contrast, the characteristic granule size and typical inter-vortex distances in the surrounding halo are only mildly affected, growing much less relative to the core. The total length of the vortex network, although less robust, shows no signs of decay over our simulation timescales. The generated halos therefore develop central self-interaction-dominated cores, but with the outer halos still supported by quantum-pressure and classical kinetic energy in equipartition as in the non-interacting case. Furthermore, measures of coherence of the field clearly separate the condensed core, identified via the Penrose-Onsager (largest eigenvalue) mode of the entire classical field, from the surrounding quasi-coherent halo. Unlike the $g=0$ case, we observe a relative increase of incoherent fluctuations coexisting with the coherent mode at the centre of the halo with increasing $g$, a phenomenon also observed in laboratory condensates at non-zero temperature.</description>
