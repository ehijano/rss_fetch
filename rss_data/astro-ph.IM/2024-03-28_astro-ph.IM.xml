      <title>Increasing the raw contrast of VLT/SPHERE with dark hole techniques III. Broadband reference differential imaging of HR\,4796 using a four-quadrant phase mask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging exoplanetary systems is essential to characterizing exoplanetary systems and to studying planet-disk interactions to understand planet formation. Such imaging in the visible and near-infrared is challenging because these objects are very faint relative to their star and only fractions of an arcsecond away. Coronagraphic instruments have already allowed the imaging of a few exoplanets, but their performance is limited by wavefront aberrations. Adaptive optics systems partly compensate for the Earth's atmosphere turbulence, but they cannot fully control the wavefront. Some of the starlight leaks through the coronagraph and forms speckles in the image. Focal plane wavefront control, used as a second stage after the adaptive optics system, can minimize the speckle intensity within an area called the dark hole. We demonstrated the on-sky performance of dark hole techniques, pairwise probing coupled with electric field conjugation, using the apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph of the VLT/SPHERE instrument. In this paper, we probe their performance using the SPHERE four-quadrant phase mask coronagraph. We demonstrate the interest of combining dark hole techniques and reference differential imaging (RDI). We create a dark hole on-sky in the narrow band around~$1.7\,\mu$m observing HR\,4796. We then record broadband images of HR\,4796 and a reference star at the H band. The dark hole techniques improve the H-band detection limit by a factor of three. The dark hole is stable from one star to a nearby star enabling RDI. This stability offers two new strategies of observation. First, one can quickly create a dark hole observing a bright star before pointing to a faint target star. Furthermore, one can couple dark hole techniques and RDI. A very interesting point is that the performance of these methods does not depend on the astrophysical signal.</description>

      <title>Experience deploying an analysis facility for the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is preparing for the execution of the most ambitious astronomical survey ever attempted, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Currently in its final phase of construction in the Andes mountains in Chile and due to start operations in 2025 for 10 years, its 8.4-meter telescope will nightly scan the southern sky and collect images of the entire visible sky every 4 nights using a 3.2 Gigapixel camera, the largest imaging device ever built for astronomy. Automated detection and classification of celestial objects will be performed by sophisticated algorithms on high-resolution images to progressively produce an astronomical catalog eventually composed of 20 billion galaxies and 17 billion stars and their associated physical properties. In this paper, we briefly present the infrastructure deployed at the French Rubin data facility (operated by IN2P3 computing center, CC-IN2P3) to deploy the Rubin Science Platform, a set of web-based services to provide effective and convenient access to LSST data for scientific analysis. We describe the main services of the platform, the components that provide those services and our deployment model. We also present the Kubernetes-based infrastructure we are experimenting with for hosting the LSST astronomical catalog, a petabyte-scale relational database developed for the specific needs of the project.</description>

      <title>Development of wavelength-shifting PEN foils for next generation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) foils have been demonstrated as a wavelength shifter suitable for operation in liquid argon. At the same time, wavelength shifting efficiency of technical grades of PEN, commercially available on the market, is lower than that of tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB). This paper reports on an R&amp;D program focused on exploring the intrinsic limitations of PEN and optimizing it for the highest achievable wavelength shifting efficiency.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of High-Resolution Transmission Spectroscopy for Low-Velocity Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, high-resolution transmission spectroscopy in the near-infrared has led to detections of prominent molecules in several giant exoplanets on close-in orbits. This approach has traditionally relied on the large Doppler shifts of the planetary spectral lines induced by the high velocities of the close-in planets, which were considered necessary for separating them from the quasi-static stellar and telluric lines. In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of high-resolution transmission spectroscopy for chemical detections in atmospheres of temperate low-mass exoplanets around M dwarfs with low radial velocity variation during transit. We pursue this goal using model injection and recovery tests with H- and K- band high-resolution spectroscopy of the temperate sub-Neptune TOI-732 c, observed using the IGRINS spectrograph on Gemini-S. We show that planetary signals in transit may be recovered when the change in the planet's radial velocity is very small, down to sub-pixel velocities. This is possible due to the presence of the planetary signal in only a subset of the observed spectra. A sufficient number of out-of-transit spectra can create enough contrast between the planet signal and telluric/stellar contaminants that the planet signal does not constitute a principal component of the time-series spectra and can therefore be isolated using PCA-based detrending without relying on a significant Doppler shift. We additionally explore novel metrics for finding such signals, and investigate trends in their detectability. Our work extends the scope of high-resolution transmission spectroscopy and creates a pathway towards the characterisation of habitable sub-Neptune worlds with ground-based facilities.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Search For Mid-Infrared Excesses Among Five Million Main-Sequence FGK Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar infrared excesses can indicate various phenomena of interest, from protoplanetary disks to debris disks, or (more speculatively) techno-signatures along the lines of Dyson spheres. In this paper, we conduct a large search for such excesses, designed as a data-driven contextual anomaly detection pipeline. We focus our search on FGK stars close to the main sequence to favour non-young host stars. We look for excess in the mid-infrared, unlocking a large sample to search in while favouring extreme IR excess akin to the ones produced by Extreme Debris Disks (EDD). We combine observations from ESA Gaia DR3, 2MASS, and the unWISE of NASA WISE, and create a catalogue of 4,898,812 stars with $G &lt; 16$ mag. We consider a star to have an excess if it is substantially brighter in $W1$ and $W2$ bands than what is predicted from an ensemble of machine-learning models trained on the data, taking optical and near-infrared information as input features. We apply a set of additional cuts (derived from the ML models and the objects' astronomical features) to avoid false-positive and identify a set of 53 objects (a rate of $1.1\times 10^{-5}$), including one previously identified EDD candidate. Typical infrared-excess fractional luminosities we find are in the range 0.005 to 0.1, consistent with known EDDs.</description>

      <title>Fast and faithful interpolation of numerical relativity surrogate waveforms using meshfree approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several theoretical waveform models have been developed over the years to capture the gravitational wave emission from the dynamical evolution of compact binary systems of neutron stars and black holes. As ground-based detectors improve their sensitivity at low frequencies, the real-time computation of these waveforms can become computationally expensive, exacerbating the steep cost of rapidly reconstructing source parameters using Bayesian methods. This paper describes an efficient numerical algorithm for generating high-fidelity interpolated compact binary waveforms at an arbitrary point in the signal manifold by leveraging computational linear algebra techniques such as singular value decomposition and meshfree approximation. The results are presented for the time-domain \texttt{NRHybSur3dq8} inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) waveform model that is fine tuned to numerical relativity simulations and parameterized by the two component-masses and two aligned spins. For demonstration, we target a specific region of the intrinsic parameter space inspired by the previously inferred parameters of the \texttt{GW200311\_115853} event -- a binary black hole system whose merger was recorded by the network of advanced-LIGO and Virgo detectors during the third observation run. We show that the meshfree interpolated waveforms can be evaluated in $\sim 2.3$ ms, which is about $\times 38$ faster than its brute-force (frequency-domain tapered) implementation in the \textsc{PyCBC} software package at a median accuracy of $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$. The algorithm is computationally efficient and scales favourably with an increasing number of dimensions of the parameter space. This technique may find use in rapid parameter estimation and source reconstruction studies.</description>

      <title>Effects of lunisolar perturbations on TianQin constellation: An analytical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TianQin is a proposed space-based gravitational-wave observatory mission that critically relies on the stability of an equilateral-triangle constellation. Comprising three satellites in high Earth orbits of a $ 10^5 $ km radius, this constellation's geometric configuration is significantly affected by gravitational perturbations, primarily originating from the Moon and the Sun. In this paper, we present an analytical model to quantify the effects of lunisolar perturbations on the TianQin constellation, derived using Lagrange's planetary equations. The model provides expressions for three kinematic indicators of the constellation: arm-lengths, relative line-of-sight velocities, and breathing angles. Analysis of these indicators reveals that lunisolar perturbations can distort the constellation triangle, resulting in three distinct variations: linear drift, bias, and fluctuation. Furthermore, it is shown that these distortions can be optimized to display solely fluctuating behavior, under certain predefined conditions. These results can serve as the theoretical foundation for numerical simulations and offer insights for engineering a stable constellation in the future.</description>

      <title>Ambient Dose and Dose Rate Measurement in SNOLAB Underground Laboratory at Sudbury, Ontario, Canada</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper describes a system and experimental procedure that use integrating passive detectors, such as thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs), for the measurement of ultra-low-level ambient dose equivalent rate values at the underground SNOLAB facility located in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. Because these detectors are passive and can be exposed for relatively long periods of time, they can provide better sensitivity for measuring ultra-low activity levels. The final characterization of ultra-low-level ambient dose around water shielding for ongoing direct dark matter search experiments in Cube Hall at SNOLAB underground laboratory is given. The conclusion is that TLDs provide reliable results in the measurement of the ultra-low-level environmental radiation background.</description>

      <title>A new kinematic model of the Galaxy: analysis of the stellar velocity field from Gaia Data Release 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents the results of a kinematic analysis of the Galaxy that uses a new model as applied to the newest available Gaia data. We carry out the Taylor decomposition of the velocity field up to second order for 18 million high luminosity stars (i.e. OBAF-type stars, giants and subgiants) from the Gaia DR3 data. We determine the components of mean stellar velocities and their first and second partial derivatives (relative to cylindrical coordinates) for more than 28 thousand points in the plane of our Galaxy. We estimate Oort's constants $A$, $B$, $C$, and $K$ and other kinematics parameters and map them as a function of Galactocentric coordinates. The values found confirm the results of our previous works and are in excellent agreement with those obtained by other authors in the Solar neighbourhood. In addition, the introduction of second order partial derivatives of the stellar velocity field allows us to determine the values of the vertical gradient of the Galaxy azimuthal, radial and vertical velocities. Also, we determine the mean of the Galaxy rotation curve for Galactocentric distances from 4 kpc to 18 kpc by averaging Galactic azimuths in the range -30$^\circ$ &lt; $\theta$ &lt; +30$^\circ$ about the direction Galactic Centre-Sun-Galactic anticentre. Maps of the velocity components and of their partial derivatives with respect to coordinates within 10 kpc of the Sun reveal complex substructures, which provide clear evidence of non-axisymmetric features of the Galaxy. Finally, we show evidence of differences in the Northern and Southern hemispheres stellar velocity fields.</description>
