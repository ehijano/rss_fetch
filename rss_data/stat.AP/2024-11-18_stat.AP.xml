      <title>Spatio-Temporal Jump Model for Urban Thermal Comfort Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal comfort is essential for well-being in urban spaces, especially as cities face increasing heat from urbanization and climate change. Existing thermal comfort models usually overlook temporal dynamics alongside spatial dependencies. We address this problem by introducing a spatio-temporal jump model that clusters data with persistence across both spatial and temporal dimensions. This framework enhances interpretability, minimizes abrupt state changes, and easily handles missing data. We validate our approach through extensive simulations, demonstrating its accuracy in recovering the true underlying partition. When applied to hourly environmental data gathered from a set of weather stations located across the city of Singapore, our proposal identifies meaningful thermal comfort regimes, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic urban settings and suitability for real-world monitoring. The comparison of these regimes with feedback on thermal preference indicates the potential of an unsupervised approach to avoid extensive surveys.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Framework for Estimating the Modal Age at Death</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for estimating the empirical probability distribution of the modal age at death - the age at which the highest number of deaths occurs within a population. Traditional demographic methods often relies on point estimates derived from parametric models or smoothing techniques, which can overlook the variability and uncertainty in mortality data. By contrast, our probabilistic assessment captures this variability, providing a more comprehensive understanding of mortality patterns essential for accurate demographic forecasting and policy planning. We model death counts across discrete age intervals as outcomes of a multinomial experiment, thus aligning with the categorical nature of mortality data. A Gaussian approximation facilitates computational feasibility, allowing us to estimate modal age probabilities numerically. While our method offers a robust approach to analyzing mortality data, we acknowledge that the assumption of independent deaths may not hold in situations such as epidemics or when social factors significantly impact mortality. We discuss the scenarios where the approach holds and note any limitations in specific applications.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Net Migration By Age: The Flow-Difference Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most population projection models require age-specific information on net migration totals as a key demographic component of population change. Existing methods for predicting future patterns of net migration by age have proven inadequate. The main reason is that methods applied to model net migration are unable to distinguish factors influencing the inflows from those influencing the outflows. In this paper, we develop two flow-difference methods to produce age-specific forecasts of net migration for counties in the Washington State. One uses a deterministic approach; the other uses a Bayesian approach and includes measures of uncertainty. Both methods model the age-specific flows of in-migration and out-migration to derive age-specific net migration. By including models for in-migration and out-migration, even in the absence of data on such flows, the resulting net migration predictions are greatly improved over existing methods that only model the net migration totals. The estimation intervals from the Bayesian flow-difference method are found to be well calibrated, while the other approaches do not yield such intervals. The implications for future county-level population projections in Washington State are shown.</description>

      <title>The Winner of the NFL Draft is Not Necessarily Cursed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Football analysts traditionally determine the relative value of draft picks by average future player value at each draft position. One implication is the loser's curse: top draft picks belonging to last year's worst teams produce less surplus value on average than draft picks later in the first round belonging to better teams. Additionally, these valuations do not match the valuation implied by the trade market. Either general managers are making terrible trades on average, or there is a sound economic reason for the discrepancy; we are partial to the latter explanation. Traditional analyses don't consider that variance in performance decays convexly accross the draft, causing eliteness (e.g., right tail probability) to decay much more steeply than expected value. Because elite players have an outsize influence on winning the Super Bowl, we suspect general managers value performance nonlinearly, placing exponentially higher value on players as their eliteness increases. Draft curves that account for this closely resemble the trade market. Additionally, we create draft curves that adjust for position via a novel Bayesian hierarchical Beta regression model. We find that if you are interested in an elite quarterback, there is no loser's curse.</description>

      <title>Wavelet analysis of possible association between sunspot number and rainfall over Kerala, India: A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global attention has been focused on extreme climatic changes. This paper investigates the relationship between different phases of solar activity and extreme precipitation events in Kerala, India. Sunspot number and rainfall data were analysed over 122 years (1901-2022) on an annual scale. A negative correlation was observed in the winter and post-monsoon seasons, while positive correlations were seen in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons, all of which were statistically significant. Using cross-wavelet transform, the temporal relationship between sunspot number and rainfall values was investigated, revealing significant cross-power at an 8-12 year scale across all seasons. Wavelet coherence between the two data sets demonstrated significant correlation at the 2-4 and 4-8 year scales throughout the four seasons. The results show that the seasonal rainfall over Kerala is related to solar activity. The solar phases of Solar Cycles 14-24 were determined for all seasons, and the years with excessive and insufficient rainfall were identified. It was observed that the descending phase had an impact on excess rainfall events during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons, while the ascending phase notably affected the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The study specifically examined the different magnetic polarities of sunspots in alternating solar cycles, focusing on even and odd cycles. It was found that extreme rainfall events were more frequent during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons in the even cycles, whereas in the odd cycles, they were more prevalent during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. These findings are presented for the first time and may offer new perspectives on how different phases affect rainfall. This study suggests a physical link between solar activity and extreme precipitation in Kerala, which could increase predictability.</description>

      <title>SureMap: Simultaneous Mean Estimation for Single-Task and Multi-Task Disaggregated Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disaggregated evaluation -- estimation of performance of a machine learning model on different subpopulations -- is a core task when assessing performance and group-fairness of AI systems. A key challenge is that evaluation data is scarce, and subpopulations arising from intersections of attributes (e.g., race, sex, age) are often tiny. Today, it is common for multiple clients to procure the same AI model from a model developer, and the task of disaggregated evaluation is faced by each customer individually. This gives rise to what we call the multi-task disaggregated evaluation problem, wherein multiple clients seek to conduct a disaggregated evaluation of a given model in their own data setting (task). In this work we develop a disaggregated evaluation method called SureMap that has high estimation accuracy for both multi-task and single-task disaggregated evaluations of blackbox models. SureMap's efficiency gains come from (1) transforming the problem into structured simultaneous Gaussian mean estimation and (2) incorporating external data, e.g., from the AI system creator or from their other clients. Our method combines maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation using a well-chosen prior together with cross-validation-free tuning via Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE). We evaluate SureMap on disaggregated evaluation tasks in multiple domains, observing significant accuracy improvements over several strong competitors.</description>

      <title>Bayesian estimation of finite mixtures of Tobit models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper outlines a Bayesian approach to estimate finite mixtures of Tobit models. The method consists of an MCMC approach that combines Gibbs sampling with data augmentation and is simple to implement. I show through simulations that the flexibility provided by this method is especially helpful when censoring is not negligible. In addition, I demonstrate the broad utility of this methodology with applications to a job training program, labor supply, and demand for medical care. I find that this approach allows for non-trivial additional flexibility that can alter results considerably and beyond improving model fit.</description>

      <title>Generation of synthetic gait data: application to multiple sclerosis patients' gait patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the leading cause of severe non-traumatic disability in young adults and its incidence is increasing worldwide. The variability of gait impairment in MS necessitates the development of a non-invasive, sensitive, and cost-effective tool for quantitative gait evaluation. The eGait movement sensor, designed to characterize human gait through unit quaternion time series (QTS) representing hip rotations, is a promising approach. However, the small sample sizes typical of clinical studies pose challenges for the stability of gait data analysis tools. To address these challenges, this article presents two key scientific contributions. First, a comprehensive framework is proposed for transforming QTS data into a form that preserves the essential geometric properties of gait while enabling the use of any tabular synthetic data generation method. Second, a synthetic data generation method is introduced, based on nearest neighbors weighting, which produces high-fidelity synthetic QTS data suitable for small datasets and private data environments. The effectiveness of the proposed method, is demonstrated through its application to MS gait data, showing very good fidelity and respect of the initial geometry of the data. Thanks to this work, we are able to produce synthetic data sets and work on the stability of clustering methods.</description>

      <title>Reliability modeling and statistical analysis of accelerated degradation process with memory effects and unit-to-unit variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A reasonable description of the degradation process is essential for credible reliability assessment in accelerated degradation testing. Existing methods usually use Markovian stochastic processes to describe the degradation process. However, degradation processes of some products are non-Markovian due to the interaction with environments. Misinterpretation of the degradation pattern may lead to biased reliability evaluations. Besides, owing to the differences in materials and manufacturing processes, products from the same population exhibit diverse degradation paths, further increasing the difficulty of accurately reliability estimation. To address the above issues, this paper proposes an accelerated degradation model incorporating memory effects and unit-to-unit variability. The memory effect in the degradation process is captured by the fractional Brownian motion, which reflects the non-Markovian characteristic of degradation. The unit-to-unit variability is considered in the acceleration model to describe diverse degradation paths. Then, lifetime and reliability under normal operating conditions are presented. Furthermore, to give an accurate estimation of the memory effect, a new statistical analysis method based on the expectation maximization algorithm is devised. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a simulation case and a real-world tuner reliability analysis case. The simulation case shows that the estimation of the memory effect obtained by the proposed statistical analysis method is much more accurate than the traditional one. Moreover, ignoring unit-to-unit variability can lead to a highly biased estimation of the memory effect and reliability.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian approach to uncover local and temporal determinants of heterogeneity in repeated cross-sectional health surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In several countries, including Italy, a prominent approach to population health surveillance involves conducting repeated cross-sectional surveys at short intervals of time. These surveys gather information on the health status of individual respondents, including details on their behaviours, risk factors, and relevant socio-demographic information. While the collected data undoubtedly provides valuable information, modelling such data presents several challenges. For instance, in health risk models, it is essential to consider behavioural information, local and temporal dynamics, and disease co-occurrence. In response to these challenges, our work proposes a multivariate temporal logistic model for chronic disease diagnoses at local level. Linear predictors are modelled using individual risk factor covariates and a latent individual propensity to diseases. Leveraging a state space formulation of the model, we construct a framework in which temporal heterogeneity in regression coefficients is informed by exogenous information at local level, correspond ing to different contextual risk factors that may affect the occurrence of chronic diseases in different ways. To explore the utility and the effectiveness of our method, we analyse behavioural and risk factor surveillance data collected in Italy (PASSI), which is well-known as a country characterised by high peculiar administrative, social and territorial diversities reflected on high variability in morbidity among population subgroups.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Parameters as Ridge Regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.00401v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-varying parameters (TVPs) models are frequently used in economics to capture structural change. I highlight a rather underutilized fact -- that these are actually ridge regressions. Instantly, this makes computations, tuning, and implementation much easier than in the state-space paradigm. Among other things, solving the equivalent dual ridge problem is computationally very fast even in high dimensions, and the crucial "amount of time variation" is tuned by cross-validation. Evolving volatility is dealt with using a two-step ridge regression. I consider extensions that incorporate sparsity (the algorithm selects which parameters vary and which do not) and reduced-rank restrictions (variation is tied to a factor model). To demonstrate the usefulness of the approach, I use it to study the evolution of monetary policy in Canada using large time-varying local projections. The application requires the estimation of about 4600 TVPs, a task well within the reach of the new method.</description>

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) searches for analytical expressions representing the relationship between a set of explanatory and response variables. Current SR methods assume a single dataset extracted from a single experiment. Nevertheless, frequently, the researcher is confronted with multiple sets of results obtained from experiments conducted with different setups. Traditional SR methods may fail to find the underlying expression since the parameters of each experiment can be different. In this work we present Multi-View Symbolic Regression (MvSR), which takes into account multiple datasets simultaneously, mimicking experimental environments, and outputs a general parametric solution. This approach fits the evaluated expression to each independent dataset and returns a parametric family of functions f(x; theta) simultaneously capable of accurately fitting all datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MvSR using data generated from known expressions, as well as real-world data from astronomy, chemistry and economy, for which an a priori analytical expression is not available. Results show that MvSR obtains the correct expression more frequently and is robust to hyperparameters change. In real-world data, it is able to grasp the group behavior, recovering known expressions from the literature as well as promising alternatives, thus enabling the use of SR to a large range of experimental scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bayesian compositional regression with flexible microbiome feature aggregation and selection</title>

Abstract: Ongoing advances in microbiome profiling have allowed unprecedented insights into the molecular activities of microbial communities. This has fueled a strong scientific interest in understanding the critical role the microbiome plays in governing human health, by identifying microbial features associated with clinical outcomes of interest. Several aspects of microbiome data limit the applicability of existing variable selection approaches. In particular, microbiome data are high-dimensional, extremely sparse, and compositional. Importantly, many of the observed features, although categorized as different taxa, may play related functional roles. To address these challenges, we propose a novel compositional regression approach that leverages the data-adaptive clustering and variable selection properties of the spiked Dirichlet process to identify taxa that exhibit similar functional roles. Our proposed method, Bayesian Regression with Agglomerated Compositional Effects using a dirichLET process (BRACElet), enables the identification of a sparse set of features with shared impacts on the outcome, facilitating dimension reduction and model interpretation. We demonstrate that BRACElet outperforms existing approaches for microbiome variable selection through simulation studies and an application elucidating the impact of oral microbiome composition on insulin resistance.</description>

      <title>Temporal Patterns of Multiple Long-Term Conditions in Individuals with Intellectual Disability Living in Wales: An Unsupervised Clustering Approach to Disease Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying and understanding the co-occurrence of multiple long-term conditions (MLTC) in individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) is vital for effective healthcare management. These individuals often face earlier onset and higher prevalence of MLTCs, yet specific co-occurrence patterns remain unexplored. This study applies an unsupervised approach to characterise MLTC clusters based on shared disease trajectories using electronic health records (EHRs) from 13069 individuals with ID in Wales (2000-2021). Disease associations and temporal directionality were assessed, followed by spectral clustering to group shared trajectories. The population consisted of 52.3% males and 47.7% females, with an average of 4.5 conditions per patient. Males under 45 formed a single cluster dominated by neurological conditions (32.4%), while males above 45 had three clusters, the largest characterised circulatory (51.8%). Females under 45 formed one cluster with digestive conditions (24.6%) as most prevalent, while those aged 45 and older showed two clusters: one dominated by circulatory (34.1%), and the other by digestive (25.9%) and musculoskeletal (21.9%) system conditions. Mental illness, epilepsy, and reflux were common across groups. These clusters offer insights into disease progression in individuals with ID, informing targeted interventions and personalised healthcare strategies.</description>
