      <title>Intersection of curves in projective 4 space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two distinct reduced, irreducible curves of given degrees, contained in projective space but whose union is not contained in a hyperplane, what is the largest number of points of intersection they can have? When the projective space is the plane, this is trivial. For projective 3 space this problem was solved independently by Diaz and by Giuffrida in 1986. They showed that two curves achieving the maximum number of intersection points have to be rational curves on a smooth surface of minimal degree, i.e., a quadric surface. Note that these curves are far from being arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay. In contrast, Hartshorne and Mir\'o-Roig addressed this problem in 2015 for space curves under the assumption that the curves are arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay (ACM), introducing very deep techniques and obtaining very different results from Diaz and Giuffrida. Diaz and Giuffrida also gave initial results in dimensions greater than 3. Here we continue this study for dimension 4. We introduce a number B defined in terms of the degrees of the curves and prove that when both curves lie on a surface of minimal degree (thus a cubic surface) then the number of points of intersection is at most B. Moreover, we conjecture that B is always an upper bound and we prove this conjecture in many cases, including when at least one of the curves is ACM. Our approach focuses on the genera of the curves and their union. In addition we define a second number B' in terms of the degrees and the genus of the union which we can show bounds the number of points of intersection above, and we use a variety of methods to study how B and B' compare.</description>

      <title>Semistable Reduction of Plane Quartics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stable Reduction Theorem guarantees that any smooth, projective, geometrically irreducible curve of genus $g \geq 2$ over a discretely valued field admits a unique stable model after a finite field extension. Computing this model is a central problem in arithmetic geometry. For non-hyperelliptic genus $3$ curves, which are canonically embedded as plane quartics, methods like admissible reduction become challenging in small residue characteristics. This thesis establishes a precise connection between the abstractly defined stable model and computationally accessible GIT-stable plane models. We prove that a GIT-stable plane model of a smooth plane quartic exists if and only if its stable reduction is non-hyperelliptic. When this condition holds, we show that the stable model is the unique minimal semistable model that dominates the GIT-stable model. The corresponding domination morphism is geometrically explicit: it contracts the $1$-tails of the stable reduction to cusps on the special fiber of the GIT-stable model and is an immersion elsewhere. This result provides a geometric framework for computing the stable model by first finding a GIT-stable model and then resolving its cuspidal singularities.</description>

      <title>Normalization of Puiseux Hipersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the normalization of a quasi-ordinary complex singularity is a Hirzebruch-Jung, see [Gon00; Pop04; AS05]. We extend this result to Puiseux hypersurfaces. Moreover, we prove that Hirzebruch-Jung singularities are precisely normalizations of Puiseux hypersurfaces. Our result holds over an algebraically closed field whose characteristic does not divide the degree of the polynomial defining the hypersurface. Finally, in the analytic complex case, we conclude that the normalization of an irreducible Puiseux hypersurface is the normalization of a complex analytic quasi-ordinary singularity.</description>

      <title>Avoidance Loci of Real Projective Varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study real linear spaces in projective space that avoid the real points of a non-degenerate projective variety. For a variety $X \subset \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ with a real smooth point, we define the avoidance locus $\mathcal{A}_k(X)$ as the subset of the real Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(k,n)_{\mathbb{R}}$ consisting of linear spaces that meet $X$ transversely but contain no real point of $X$. Our construction generalizes the cone of positive polynomials on $\mathbb{R}^n.$ We prove that the avoidance locus is an open semi-algebraic set equal to a union of regions in the complement of a higher Chow form, and that distinct regions are non-adjacent. We present explicit examples for linear spaces, curves, and surfaces, and provide bounds on the number of connected components of $\mathcal{A}_{n-1}(X)$ in terms of the topology of the real locus $X_{\mathbb{R}}$. Finally, we prove that avoidance loci are slice-convex.</description>

Abstract: We show that the optimal Jordan constant for the volume-preserving plane Cremona group $\mathrm{Bir}(\mathbb P^2, \Delta)$ is 12. We provide a Jordan constant of $60$ for the three-dimensional volume-preserving Cremona group $\mathrm{Bir}(\mathbb P^3,\Delta)$. We also provide a weak geometric Jordan constant of $288\cdot 16$ for $\mathrm{Bir}(\mathbb P^2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the Cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory of loop stacks of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks. In particular, we compare $(-1)$-shifted tangent stacks of these moduli problems, which we view as additive, to loop stacks, which we view as multiplicative, via an exponential map that preserves induced $(-1)$-shifted symplectic structures. As an application, we prove for certain moduli of objects of $2$-Calabi-Yau categories a loop dimensional reduction theorem for the loop stacks of these moduli spaces. Finally, we prove a loop version of nonabelian Hodge theory for stacks in the $\mathrm{GL}_n$ case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the multiplicative version of the dimensional reduction theorem in cohomological Donaldson--Thomas theory. More precisely, we show that the BPS cohomology associated with the loop stack of a $0$-shifted symplectic stack admits a description analogous to orbifold cohomology, even though our stacks are not necessarily Deligne--Mumford. As an application, we propose a new, purely two-dimensional formulation of the topological mirror symmetry conjecture for the moduli space of $G$-Higgs bundles, which in turn leads to a formulation of the conjecture for logarithmic $G$-Higgs bundles. We also investigate a twisted version of the multiplicative dimensional reduction, which applies, in particular, to the cohomological Donaldson--Thomas theory for $S^1$-bundles over compact oriented surfaces, and more generally to Seifert-fibred $3$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>The maximal destabilizers for Chow and K-stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Donaldson showed that the constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics can be quantized by the balanced Hermitian norms on the spaces of global sections. We explore an analogous problem in the unstable situation. For a K-unstable manifold $(X,L)$, its projective embedding via $\left|kL\right|$ will be Chow-unstable when $k$ is sufficiently large and divisible. There is a unique filtration on $\mathrm{H}^{0}(X,kL)$, that corresponds to the maximal destabilizer for Chow-stability of the embedded variety. On the other hand, there is a maximal destabilizer for K-stability after the work of Xia and Li, which corresponds to the steepest descent direction of K-energy. Based on Boucksom-Jonsson's non-Archimedean pluripotential theory and some idealistic assumptions, we provide a route to show that maximal K-destabilizers are quantized by the maximal Chow-destabilizers.</description>

Abstract: Given a number field $k$ with the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_k$ and a matrix $M\in \mathrm{M}_{n}(\mathcal{O}_k)$. We prove that if $\mathcal{O}_k$ is a principal ideal domain, the local-global principle for triangularizability and diagonalizability of $M$ holds. To explain the possible failures of the local-global principle, we prove that the stratified Brauer--Manin obstruction is the only obstruction to the local-global principle for triangularizability and diagonalizability of $M$ in some special cases.</description>

      <title>Elliptic modular graph forms, equivariant iterated integrals and single-valued elliptic polylogarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy expansion of genus-one string amplitudes produces infinite families of non-holomorphic modular forms after each step of integrating over a point on the torus worldsheet which are known as elliptic modular graph forms (eMGFs). We solve the differential equations of eMGFs depending on a single point $z$ and the modular parameter $\tau$ via iterated integrals over holomorphic modular forms which individually transform inhomogeneously under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$. Suitable generating series of these iterated integrals over $\tau$, their complex conjugates and single-valued multiple zeta values (svMZVs) are combined to attain equivariant transformations under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ such that their components are modular forms.
  Our generating series of equivariant iterated integrals for eMGFs is related to elliptic multiple polylogarithms (eMPLs) through a gauge transform of the flat Calaque-Enriquez-Etingof connection. By converting iterated $\tau$-integrals to iterated integrals over points on a torus, we arrive at an explicit construction of single-valued eMPLs where all the monodromies in the points cancel. Each single-valued eMPL depending on a single point $z$ is found to be a finite combination of meromorphic eMPLs, their complex conjugates, svMZVs and equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals. Our generating series determines the latter two admixtures via so-called zeta generators and Tsunogai derivations which act on the two generators $x$, $y$ of a free Lie algebra and where the coefficients of words in $x,y$ define the single-valued eMPLs.</description>

      <title>Nilpotent Holomorphic Foliations on $(\mathbb{C}^n,\mathbf{0})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study nilpotent holomorphic foliations in complex dimension $n+1$, at the origin, defined by germs of integrable 1-forms whose linear part is given by \(zdz\). These foliations generalize the classical nilpotent foliations in dimension two. We show that every nilpotent foliation in higher dimensions can be described as the pullback of Takens' normal form, which naturally leads to the existence of cuspidal hypersurfaces as invariant sets.
  We focus on the case where the separatrix is a quasi-ordinary cuspidal hypersurface, and we provide a characterization of those foliations that are of generalized hypersurface type. Furthermore, we recall the Newton polyhedron of a foliation and prove that, for foliations with a quasi-ordinary cuspidal separatrix, being of generalized hypersurface type is equivalent to the coincidence of the Newton polyhedra of the foliation and its separatrix. This provides a new criterion that extends previous results studied by Fern\'andez-S\'anchez and J. Mozo (2006), and later partially generalized by the second-named author.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a discretely valued Henselian field. Creutz and Viray show that the degree set of a curve $C$ over a $p$-adic field can miss infinitely many multiples of the index of $C$, a phenomenon that cannot occur over finitely generated fields. For curves $C/K$ with a cyclic cover of $\mathbb{P}^1$ of prime degree, under mild assumptions, we completely characterize how and when this behavior can occur, and give a method for computing degree sets of curves of this type.</description>

      <title>Topological 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ Gauge Theories: Mirror Symmetry and Langlands Duality of $A_\infty$-categories of Floer Homologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain why on certain five-manifolds, topological 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ gauge theory of Haydys-Witten twist with gauge group $G$, is dual to that of Geyer-M\"{u}lsch twist with gauge group $^LG$, where $G$ is a real, compact Lie group with Langlands dual $^LG$. In turn, via their 2d and 3d gauged A/B-twisted Landau-Ginzburg model interpretations, we can show that (i) a Fukaya-Seidel-type $A_\infty$-1-category of an HW$_4$-instanton Floer homology of three-manifolds and (ii) a Fueter-type $A_\infty$-2-category of an HW$_3$-instanton Floer homology of two-manifolds, are dual to (i) an Orlov-type $A_\infty$-1-category of a novel $^LG_{\mathbb{H}}$-flat Floer homology of three-manifolds and (ii) a Rozansky-Witten-type $A_\infty$-2-category of a novel $^LG_{\mathbb{O}}$-flat Floer homology of two-manifolds, respectively. We also derive their Atiyah-Floer-type correspondences to symplectic categories. Our work, which demonstrates a mirror symmetry and Langlands duality of (higher) $A_\infty$-categories of Floer homologies, therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and gauge-theoretic generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Bousseau [1] and Doan-Rezchikov [2], and more.</description>

      <title>Gibbs polystability of Fano manifolds, stability thresholds and symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the probabilistic approach for constructing Kahler-Einstein metrics on log Fano manifolds - involving random point processes - to the case of non-discrete automorphism groups, by explicitly breaking the symmetry. This yields a new algebraic notion of Gibbs polystability, conjecturally equivalent to K-polystability. The definition involves a limit of log canonical thresholds on the GIT semistable locus of the N-fold products of the Fano manifold that we conjecture coincides with an analytic reduced stability threshold encoding the coercivity of the K-energy functional modulo automorphisms. These conjectures follow from an overarching conjectural Large Deviation Principle for the limit when N tends to infinity. We prove several of our conjectures for log Fano curves and derive a strengthened logarithmic Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality on the two-sphere, which implies Aubin's refinement of the Moser-Trudinger inequality.

      <title>On the Bergman Kernel of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an exact formula for the Bergman kernel function of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces either of finite topology or of positive injectivity radius. The formula involves summation over all geodesic loops based at a point, which has a striking analogy with the Selberg trace formula. As an application, we prove a result about the maximum and minimum of the Bergman kernel function. We also prove an estimate of the off-diagonal Bergman kernel.</description>

      <title>Subtlety of oscillation indices of oscillatory integrals of real analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a locally defined real analytic function, we study the relation between the oscillation index of oscillatory integrals and the real log canonical threshold. The former is always negative, and its absolute value is greater than or equal to the latter. They coincide very often, but there are certain exceptional cases even in the Newton nondegenerate convenient homogeneous case where the number of variables is even and smaller than the degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elastic properties of a material are encoded in a stiffness tensor field and the propagation of elastic waves is modeled by the elastic wave equation. We characterize analytic and algebraic properties a general anisotropic stiffness tensor field has to satisfy in order for Finsler-geometric methods to be applicable in studying inverse problems related to imaging with elastic waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.12541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tropical expansion is a degeneration of a toroidal embedding, induced by a polyhedral subdivision of its tropicalisation. Each irreducible component of a tropical expansion admits a collapsing map down to a stratum of the original variety. We study the relative geometry of this map. We give a polyhedral criterion for the map to have the structure of a toric variety bundle, and prove that this structure always exists over the interior of the codomain. We give examples demonstrating that this is the strongest statement one can hope for in general. In addition, we provide a combinatorial recipe for constructing the toric variety bundle as a fibrewise GIT quotient of an explicit split vector bundle. Our proofs make systematic use of Artin fans as a language for globalising local toric models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We state a conjecture relating de Rham cohomology of a smooth rigid analytic variety to its compactly supported pro-\'etale cohomology. We prove the conjecture in the cases where the variety is a Stein curve of dimension one or a Stein space of higher dimension with low Frobenius slopes. The proof uses computation of the Galois cohomology of the almost de Rham period ring BdR[log(t)].</description>

Abstract: We establish the minimal model program (MMP) for generalized foliated threefolds $(X, \mathcal{F}, B, \mathbf{M})$ of rank 1, extending the result of Cascini and Spicer in [CS25d]. As an application of the generalized foliated MMP, we prove a base-point-free theorem for foliated triples on threefolds. We also prove the ACC for log canonical thresholds for generalized foliated threefolds of rank 1.</description>

      <title>Characteristic cycles for coadmissible D-modules on smooth rigid analytic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{X}$ be a formal smooth curve over a complete discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristic and let $\mathfrak{X}\_K$ be its generic fiber. We consider respectively over $\mathfrak{X}$ and $\X\_K$ the sheaves of differential operators $\mathcal{D}\_{\mathfrak{X}, \infty}$ and $\wideparen{\D}\_{\mathfrak{X}\_K}$ with a rapid convergence condition. In this article, we define a characteristic variety as a subset of the cotangent space $T^*\mathfrak{X}\_K$ together with a characteristic cycle for coadmissible $\wideparen{\D}\_{\mathfrak{X}\_K}$-modules. We deduce a notion of ''sub-holonomicity'' for coadmissible $\wideparen{\D}\_{\mathfrak{X}\_K}$-modules which is equivalent to being generically an integrable connection. When $\mathfrak{X}$ is quasi-compact, we get an Artinian category of sub-holonomic $\wideparen{\D}\_{\mathfrak{X}\_K}$ which are weakly-holonomic. Moreover, we prove that a coadmissible $\wideparen{\D}\_{\mathfrak{X}\_K}$-modules is sub-holonomic if and only if the corresponding coadmissible $\Di$-module is.</description>

      <title>A Criterion for Perfectoid Purity and the Rationality of Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new criterion providing a sufficient condition for a hypersurface in an unramified regular local ring to be perfectoid pure. The criterion is formulated in terms of an explicitly computable sequence of integers, called the splitting-order sequence. Our main theorem shows that if all entries of the sequence are at most $p-1$, then the hypersurface is perfectoid pure, and the perfectoid-pure threshold can be computed explicitly from it. As a consequence, we prove that for any regular local ring $R$, the perfectoid pure threshold $\mathrm{ppt}(R,p)$ with respect to $p$ is always a rational number. Moreover, we show that for sufficiently large primes $p$, the cone over a Fermat type Calabi-Yau hypersurface is perfectoid pure, revealing new and unexpected examples of perfectoid pure singularities. Moreover, we show that for sufficiently large primes $p$, the cone over a Fermat type Calabi-Yau hypersurface is perfectoid pure, revealing new and unexpected examples of perfectoid pure singularities.</description>

      <title>Chow classes of matroids and standard Young tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Chow classes of arbitrary matroids in the Grassmannian. We develop a new combinatorial approach for computing them, by first focusing on snake matroids and then extending our results via valuativity to any matroid. Our main contribution identifies the Poincar\'e dual of the Chow class of a snake matroid with a specific ribbon Schur function, providing an explicit formula for its coefficients in the Schubert basis as the number of standard Young tableaux of a given shape with a prescribed descent set. This agrees with a formula by Klyachko for the uniform matroid. As consequences, we recover and simplify classical results such as Gessel and Viennot's enumeration of permutations with fixed descent sets, and formulas for the volume of lattice path matroids. Furthermore, we demonstrate the power of our findings by proving that certain Schubert coefficients are positive for all connected paving matroids.</description>
