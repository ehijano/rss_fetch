      <title>A Hybrid Computational Intelligence Framework for scRNA-seq Imputation: Integrating scRecover and Random Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables transcriptomic profiling at cellular resolution but suffers from pervasive dropout events that obscure biological signals. We present SCR-MF, a modular two-stage workflow that combines principled dropout detection using scRecover with robust non-parametric imputation via missForest. Across public and simulated datasets, SCR-MF achieves robust and interpretable performance comparable to or exceeding existing imputation methods in most cases, while preserving biological fidelity and transparency. Runtime analysis demonstrates that SCR-MF provides a competitive balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for mid-scale single-cell datasets.</description>

      <title>Approximating a gene regulatory network from non-sequential data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given non-sequential snapshots from instances of a dynamical system, we design a compressed sensing based algorithm that reconstructs the dynamical system. On the theoretical side, we show that: (1) successful reconstruction is possible under the assumption that we can construct an approximate clock from a subset of the coordinates of the underlying system, and (2) computing the minimal Lyapunov exponent of the dynamical system, where the minimum is taken over all subsets of coordinates of the dynamical system, equates to computing a min-max equilibrium. We design an efficient randomized algorithm for computing the above equilibrium.
  As an application of our theoretical results, we reconstruct the underlying dynamical system from publicly available RNA-seq data to: (1) predict the underlying gene regulatory networks (as opposed to individual genes) that may help differentiate between metastatic vs non-metastatic breast cancer (and also colorectal cancer), and (2) identify candidate genes that could be used as target biomarkers for basket trials. In particular, our in silico analysis suggests that RORC agonists, which are already used in colorectal cancer therapies, may be worth investigating for breast cancers.</description>

      <title>Genomic Next-Token Predictors are In-Context Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) -- the capacity of a model to infer and apply abstract patterns from examples provided within its input -- has been extensively studied in large language models trained for next-token prediction on human text. In fact, prior work often attributes this emergent behavior to distinctive statistical properties in human language. This raises a fundamental question: can ICL arise organically in other sequence domains purely through large-scale predictive training?
  To explore this, we turn to genomic sequences, an alternative symbolic domain rich in statistical structure. Specifically, we study the Evo2 genomic model, trained predominantly on next-nucleotide (A/T/C/G) prediction, at a scale comparable to mid-sized LLMs. We develop a controlled experimental framework comprising symbolic reasoning tasks instantiated in both linguistic and genomic forms, enabling direct comparison of ICL across genomic and linguistic models. Our results show that genomic models, like their linguistic counterparts, exhibit log-linear gains in pattern induction as the number of in-context demonstrations increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of organically emergent ICL in genomic sequences, supporting the hypothesis that ICL arises as a consequence of large-scale predictive modeling over rich data. These findings extend emergent meta-learning beyond language, pointing toward a unified, modality-agnostic view of in-context learning.</description>
