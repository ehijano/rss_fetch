      <title>Noncommuting common causes revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the concept of noncommuting common causes; refute two objections raised against them, the triviality objection and the lack of causal explanatory force; and explore how their existence modifies the EPR argument. More specifically, we show that 1) product states screening off all quantum correlations do not compromise noncommuting common causal explanations; 2) noncommuting common causes can satisfy the law of total probability; 3) perfect correlations can have indeterministic noncommuting common causes; and, as a combination of the above claims, 4) perfect correlations can have noncommuting common causes which are both nontrivial and satisfy the law of total probability.</description>

      <title>What is a physical theory? Philosophers do have an answer by distinguishing two forms of empirical adequacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What is a physical theory? Although this intriguing question has been addressed from many different perspectives, some physicists and philosophers of physics have implicitly or explicitly embraced a philosophically-neutral definition of a physical theory, independently of the philosophical position endorsed with respect to it. Considering some objections against this view, I shall argue that the most appropriate definition of a physical theory already presupposes some commitments shared by a philosophical position associated with scientific realism. As we shall see, what physical theories and scientific realist positions have in common is the commitment of satisfying a non-factive notion of empirical adequacy, whilst a factive notion of empirical adequacy shall be solely associated with scientific realism. Based on this factive/non-factive distinction, we shall finally present a case study in physics in order to show that a well-known foundational problem associated with the concept of manifest time can be dissolved once the non-factive notion of empirical adequacy (as opposed to factive one) is endorsed.</description>
