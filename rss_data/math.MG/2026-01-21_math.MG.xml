      <title>A volume formula for Reuleaux polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A ball polyhedron is a finite intersection of congruent balls in $\mathbb{R}^3$. These shapes arise in various contexts in discrete and convex geometry. We focus on Reuleaux polyhedra, the subclass of ball polyhedra whose centers and vertices coincide. Building on Bogosel's recent work on the volume of Meissner polyhedra, we derive a formula for the volume of Reuleaux polyhedra in terms of their edges.</description>

      <title>On the discrete logarithmic Minkowski problem in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper characterizes the convex hull of the closure of the cone-volume set $C_\cv(U)$, consisting of all cone-volume vectors of polygons with outer unit normals vectors contained in $U$, for any finite set $U \subseteq \R^2, \pos(U) = \R^2$. We prove that this convex hull has finitely many extreme points by providing both a vertex representation as well as a half space representation. As a consequence, we derive new necessary conditions, which depend on $U$, for the existence of solutions to the logarithmic Minkowski problem in $\R^2$.</description>

      <title>Packing minima of convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2021, Henk, Schymura and Xue introduced packing minima, associated with a convex body and a lattice, as packing counterparts to the covering minima of Kannan and Lov\'asz. Motivated by conjectures on the volume inequalities for the successive minima, we generalized the definition of the packing minima to the class of all convex bodies that contain the origin in their interior. For these packing minima, we presented several novel volume inequalities and calculated the specific values of the packing minima for several special convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Conformal dimension and its attainment on self-similar Laakso-type fractal spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general construction of Laakso-type fractal spaces was recently introduced by the first two authors. In this paper, we establish a simple condition characterizing when the Ahlfors regular conformal dimension of a symmetric Laakso-type fractal space is attained. The attaining metrics are constructed explicitly. This gives new examples of attainment and clarifies the possible obstructions.</description>

      <title>Observing rurality of a geographical area from road graph geometry -- a qualitative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the Finnish road network as a graph in order to measure whether the "rurality" or "urbanity" of an area correlates with local geometrical properties of the graph. Our primary motivation is the observation that the road systems in rural areas look similar to hyperbolic graphs, while in large cities they resemble more the Cayley graph of $\mathbb{Z}^2$. We do not aim for a comprehensive analysis, but rather wish to demonstrate that this observation can be measured and analyzed through looking at various "hyperbolicity measures" of randomly sampled geodesic triangles in the road graph.</description>

      <title>Equiprojective polytopes in higher dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A 3-dimensional polytope is called k-equiprojective if every planar projection along a direction non-parallel to any facet is a k-gon. In this article, we generalise equiprojectivity to higher dimensions and give a lower bound on the number of combinatorial types of equiprojective polytopes. We also establish the pathwise connectedness of a subset of the Grassmannian in the case of (d-2)-dimensional spaces with conditions on the explicit path. This makes it possible to extend the Hasan--Lubiw characterisation of equiprojectivity to higher dimensions. Equiprojectivity provides cases relevant to the study of the Shadow Vertex algorithm, showing there is no hope minimising the complexity of the projection. It also offers a reverse point of view on the usual study of planar projections of polytopes as the projections have a fixed size.</description>

      <title>PDE aspects of the dynamical optimal transport in the Lorentzian setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the crucial features of optimal transport on Riemannian manifolds is the equivalence of the `static', original, formulation of the problem and of the `dynamic' one, based on the study of the continuity equation. This furnishes the key link between Wasserstein geometry and PDEs that has found so many applications in the last 20 years.
  In this paper we investigate this kind of equivalence on spacetimes. At the PDE level, this requires to transition from the continuity equation to a suitable `continuity inequality', to which we shall refer to as `causal continuity inequality'. As a direct consequence of our findings we obtain a Lorentzian version of the celebrated Benamou--Brenier formula.</description>

      <title>Eigensets of switching dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reachability sets of linear switching dynamical systems (systems of ODE with time-dependent matrices that take values from a given compact set) are analysed. An eigenset is a non-trivial compact set M that possesses the following property: the closure of the set of points reachable by trajectories starting in M in time t is equal to exp(at)M. This concept introduced in a recent paper of E.Viscovini is an analogue of an eigenvector for compact sets of matrices. We prove the existence of eigensets, analyse their structure and properties, and find ``eigenvalues'' a for an arbitrary system. The question which compact sets, in particular, which convex sets and polyhedra, can be presented as eigensets of suitable systems, is studied.</description>

      <title>Translation invariant curvature measures of convex bodies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a series of papers, Weil initiated the investigation of translation invariant curvature measures of convex bodies, which include as prime examples Federer's curvature measures. In this paper, we continue this line of research by introducing new tools to study curvature measures. Our main results suggest that the space of curvature measures, which is graded by degree and parity, is highly structured: We conjecture that each graded component has length at most $2$ as a representation of the general linear group, and we prove this in degrees $0$ and $n-2$. Beyond this conjectural picture, our methods yield a characterization of Federer's curvature measures under weaker assumptions.</description>

      <title>New Topological Restrictions For Spaces With Nonnegative Ricci Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain new topological restrictions for complete Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and RCD(0,n) spaces. Our main results are a Betti number rigidity theorem which answers a question open since work of M.-T. Anderson in 1990, and a vanishing theorem for the simplicial volume generalizing a theorem of M. Gromov from 1982. Combining such results we obtain a new proof of the classification of noncompact 3-manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature, originally due to G. Liu in 2011, which extends to the synthetic setting.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity via Geodesic Stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:1504.06863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A geodesic $g$ is Morse, for every $L \geq 1, A \geq 0$ there exists a $C=C_g(L,A)$ such that any $(L,A)$-quasi-geodesic connecting two points on $g$ stays $C$-close to $g$. The Morse lemma implies that in a hyperbolic space every geodesic is Morse. Here we prove the converse: If a homogeneous proper geodesic space is such that for every geodesic $g$ and every $L\geq 1, A \geq 0$ there exists a constant $C=C_g(L,A)$ such that any $(L,A)$-quasi-geodesic between any two points on $g$ stays $C$-close, then the space is hyperbolic. This applies in particular to infinite groups in which all geodesics are Morse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.00698v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we introduce a concept of Ricci curvature on hypergraphs for a nonlinear Laplacian. We prove that our definition of the Ricci curvature is a generalization of Lin-Lu-Yau coarse Ricci curvature for graphs to hypergraphs. We also show a lower bound of nonzero eigenvalues of Laplacian, gradient estimate of heat flow, and diameter bound of Bonnet-Myers type for our curvature notion. This research leads to understanding how nonlinearity of Laplacian causes complexity of curvatures.</description>

      <title>Functional dimension of feedforward ReLU neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the parameterized family of functions representable by fully-connected feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation function is precisely the class of piecewise linear functions with finitely many pieces. It is less well-known that for every fixed architecture of ReLU neural network, the parameter space admits positive-dimensional spaces of symmetries, and hence the local functional dimension near any given parameter is lower than the parametric dimension. In this work we carefully define the notion of functional dimension, show that it is inhomogeneous across the parameter space of ReLU neural network functions, and continue an investigation - initiated in [14] and [5] - into when the functional dimension achieves its theoretical maximum. We also study the quotient space and fibers of the realization map from parameter space to function space, supplying examples of fibers that are disconnected, fibers upon which functional dimension is non-constant, and fibers upon which the symmetry group acts non-transitively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2014 the author showed that in the three-dimensional spherical space, alongside with three classical types of flexible octahedra constructed by Bricard, there exists a new type of flexible octahedra, which was called exotic. In the present paper we give a geometric construction for exotic flexible octahedra, describe their configuration spaces, and calculate their volumes. We show that the volume of an exotic flexible octahedron is nonconstant during the flexion, and moreover the volume remains nonconstant if we replace any set of vertices of the octahedron with their antipodes. So exotic flexible octahedra are counterexamples to the Modified Bellows Conjecture proposed by the author in 2015.</description>

We also provide sufficient conditions for $d_1\cong d_2$ and consider several examples related to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Non-continuous valuations on convex bodies and a new characterization of volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of automatic continuity techniques in the context of valuations on convex bodies. We first provide an automatic continuity theorem for valuations restricted to parallelotopes with respect to a fixed basis. This result in combination with a counting argument provides a strengthened version of a classical characterization of volume due to Hadwiger. As a byproduct of the proof it is shown that $[0,n-1]\cup\{n\}$ are precisely the possible degrees of homogeneity of bounded translation invariant valuations on $n$-dimensional convex bodies.</description>
