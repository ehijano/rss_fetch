      <title>Capturing Perception to Poverty using Conjoint Analysis &amp; Partial Profile Choice Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this study is applying a utility based analysis to a comparatively efficient design experiment which can capture people's perception towards the various components of a commodity. Here we studied the multi-dimensional poverty index and the relative importance of its components and their two-factor interaction effects. We also discussed how to model a choice based conjoint data for determining the utility of the components and their interactions. Empirical results from survey data shows the nature of coefficients, in terms of utility derived by the individuals, their statistical significance and validity in the present framework. There has been some discrepancies in the results between the bootstrap model and the original model, which can be understood by surveying more people, and ensuring comparative homogeneity in the data.</description>

      <title>A Firm Link: Overall, Between- and Within-Firm Inequality Through the Lens of a Sorting Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a new theory of the observed co-movement between overall wage inequality and its between-firm component. We develop and solve analytically a frictionless sorting model with two-sided heterogeneity, in which firms consist of distributions of tasks, choose how many workers to employ and reward their workers both through wages and amenities. We show that, for empirically-relevant parameter ranges, overall and between-firm inequality are firmly linked: A change in any of the models' primitives increases overall wage inequality if and only if it also increases the ratio of between-firm to overall inequality. Subsequently, we calibrate the model to match the Norwegian economy and find that the increase in wage inequality from 1995 to 2014 had a different primary cause (raising span-of-control cost) than the accompanying rise in welfare inequality (increased skill variance), and that the apparent decrease in wage inequality after 2015 masked a continued increase in welfare inequality.</description>

      <title>Power sector benefits of flexible heat pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat pumps play a major role in decreasing fossil fuel use in heating. They increase electricity demand, but could also foster the system integration of variable renewable energy sources. We analyze three scenarios for expanding decentralized heat pumps in Germany by 2030, focusing on the role of buffer heat storage. Using an open-source power sector model, we assess costs, capacity investments, and emissions effects. We find that investments in solar photovoltaics can cost-effectively accompany the roll-out of heat pumps in case wind power expansion potentials are limited. Results further show that short-duration heat storage substantially reduces the need for firm capacity and battery storage. Larger heat storage sizes do not substantially change the results. Increasing the number of heat pumps from 1.7 to 10 million units could annually save around a quarter of Germany's overall natural gas consumption and around half of households' building-related CO2 emissions.</description>
