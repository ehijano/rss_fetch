      <title>Classical elliptic integrable systems from the moduli space of instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is intended to serve as a review of a series of papers with Nikita Nekrasov, where we achieved several important results concerning the relation between the moduli space of instantons and classical integrable systems. We derive I. Krichever's Lax matrix for the elliptic Calogero-Moser system from the equivariant cohomology of the moduli space of instantons. This result also has K-theoretic and elliptic cohomology counterparts. Our methods rely upon the so-called $\theta$-transform of the $qq$-characters vev's, defined as integrals of certain classes in these cohomology theories. The key step is the non-commutative Jacobi-like product formula for them. We also obtained a natural answer for the eigenvector of the Lax matrix and the horizontal section for the associated isomonodromic connection in terms of the partition function of folded instantons. As an application of our formula, we demonstrate some progress towards the spectral duality of the many-body systems in question, as well as give a new look at the quantum-classical duality between their trigonometric version and the corresponding spin chains.</description>

      <title>Continuous Topological Insulators Classification and Bulk Edge Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews recent results on the classification of partial differential operators modeling bulk and interface topological insulators in Euclidean spaces. Our main objective is the mathematical analysis of the unusual, robust-to-perturbations, asymmetric transport that necessarily appears at interfaces separating topological insulators in different phases. The central element of the analysis is an interface current observable describing this asymmetry. We show that this observable may be computed explicitly by spectral flow when the interface Hamiltonian is explicitly diagonalizable.
  We review the classification of bulk phases for Landau and Dirac operators and provide a general classification of elliptic interface pseudo-differential operators by means of domain walls and a corresponding bulk-difference invariant (BDI). The BDI is simple to compute by the Fedosov-H\"ormander formula implementing in a Euclidean setting an Atiyah-Singer index theory. A generalized bulk-edge correspondence then states that the interface current observable and the BDI agree on elliptic operator, whereas this is not necessarily the case for non-elliptic operators.</description>

      <title>On the phase diagram of the multiscale mean-field spin-glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the phase diagram of a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model where the couplings are forced to thermalize at different times scales. Besides being a challenging generalization of the SK model, such settings may arise naturally in physics whenever part of the many degrees of freedom of a system relaxes to equilibrium considerably faster than the others. For this model we compute the asymptotic value of the second moment of the overlap distribution. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous sufficient condition for an annealed solution to hold, identifying a high temperature region. In addition, we also prove that for sufficiently low temperature the solution must present a number of replica symmetry breaking levels at least equal to the number of time scales already present in the multiscale model. Finally, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of gaps in the support of the functional order parameters.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of effective transport for continuous uniaxial polycrystalline materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following seminal work in the early 1980s that established the existence and representations of the homogenized transport coefficients for two phase random media, we develop a mathematical framework that provides Stieltjes integral representations for the bulk transport coefficients for uniaxial polycrystalline materials, involving spectral measures of self-adjoint random operators, which are compositions of non-random and random projection operators. We demonstrate the same mathematical framework also describes two-component composites, with a simple substitution of the random projection operator, making the mathematical descriptions of these two distinct physical systems directly analogous to one another. A detailed analysis establishes the operators arising in each setting are indeed self-adjoint on an $L^2$-type Hilbert space, providing a rigorous foundation to the formal spectral theoretic framework established by Golden and Papanicolaou in 1983. An abstract extension of the Helmholtz theorem also leads to integral representations for the inverses of effective parameters, e.g., effective conductivity and resistivity. An alternate formulation of the effective parameter problem in terms of a Sobolev-type Hilbert space provides a rigorous foundation for an approach first established by Bergman and Milton. We show that the correspondence between the two formulations is a one-to-one isometry. Rigorous bounds that follow from such Stieltjes integrals and partial knowledge about the material geometry are reviewed and validated by numerical calculations of the effective parameters for polycrystalline media.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous symplectic reduction of quadratic forms into normal forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental result in symplectic linear algebra states that for a given positive semi-definite quadratic form on a symplectic space there exists a symplectic in which the quadratic form reduces to a normal form. The special case of the aforementioned result for positive-definite quadratic forms is known as Williamson's theorem. In this work, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions on positive semi-definite quadratic forms on a symplectic space to be simultaneously reduced to their normal forms in a common symplectic basis. In particular, we establish conditions on 2n x 2n real symmetric positive-definite matrices to be simultaneously diagonalizable by a symplectic matrix in the sense of Williamson's theorem. We also discuss some applications of the main result in quantum information theory and statistical thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nelson model describes non-relativistic particles coupled to a relativistic Bose scalar field. In this article, we study the renormalized version of the Nelson model with massless bosons in Davies' weak coupling limit. Our main result states that the two-body Coulomb potential emerges as an effective pair interaction between the particles, which arises from the exchange of virtual excitations of the quantum field.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of bosonic Gaussian thermal states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bosonic Gaussian thermal states form a fundamental class of states in quantum information science. This paper explores the information geometry of these states, focusing on characterizing the distance between two nearby states and the geometry induced by a parameterization in terms of their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. In particular, for the family of bosonic Gaussian thermal states, we derive expressions for their Fisher-Bures and Kubo-Mori information matrices with respect to their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. An important application of our formulas consists of fundamental limits on how well one can estimate these parameters. We additionally establish formulas for the derivatives and the symmetric logarithmic derivatives of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. The former could have applications in gradient descent algorithms for quantum machine learning when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz, and the latter in formulating optimal strategies for single parameter estimation of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. Finally, the expressions for the aforementioned information matrices could have additional applications in natural gradient descent algorithms when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz.</description>

      <title>Edge modes and boundary impurities in the anisotropic Heisenberg spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of boundary phenomena in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain (XXZ-$\frac{1}{2}$) in the gapped antiferromagnetic phase, with a particular focus on the interplay between fractionalized spin-$\frac{1}{4} $ edge modes and a coupled spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity at the edge. Employing a combination of Bethe Ansatz, exact diagonalization, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods, we explore the intricate phase diagram that emerges when the impurity is coupled either integrably or non-integrably to the chain. For integrable antiferromagnetic impurity couplings, we identify two distinct phases: the Kondo phase, where the impurity is screened by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and the antiferromagnetic bound mode phase, where an exponentially localized bound state screens the impurity in the ground state. When coupled ferromagnetically while maintaining integrability, the impurity behaves as a free spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, leading to either a ferromagnetic bound mode phase, where the impurity remains free in the ground state but may be screened at higher energy excitations or an unscreened (or local moment) phase where impurity remains unscreened in every eigenstate whereas for non-integrable ferromagnetic coupling, the impurity is not free. In the case of non-integrable antiferromagnetic coupling, a third phase emerges, characterized by mid-gap excitations with two degenerate states below the mass gap on top of the Kondo and antiferromagnetic bound mode phases, further enriching the phase diagram. Our findings highlight the nuanced behavior of boundary impurities in gapped antiferromagnetic systems, offering new insights into Kondo effects and impurity screening in the presence of fractionalized edge modes and bulk antiferromagnetic order.</description>

      <title>Mass Hierarchy of Z(2) Monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we establish every spherically symmetric non-Abelian Z(2) monopole generated by su(2) embeddings in the SU(4) Yang-Mills-Higgs model minimally broken to SO(4) by a symmetric second-rank tensor Higgs field. We find new monopole solutions associated with index 4 and index 10 embeddings. These solutions belong to su(2) multiplets that are higher dimensional than triplets. Properties of these monopoles such as their mass and radius are calculated in the vanishing potential limit. A parallel between this result and the Standard Model hierarchy of fermion masses is considered.</description>

      <title>Localization Phenomena in Large-Scale Networked Systems: Implications for Fragility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study phenomena where some eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian are largely confined in small subsets of the graph. These localization phenomena are similar to those generally termed Anderson Localization in the Physics literature, and are related to the complexity of the structure of large graphs in still unexplored ways. Using spectral perturbation theory and pseudo-spectrum analysis, we explain how the presence of localized eigenvectors gives rise to fragilities (low robustness margins) to unmodeled node or link dynamics. Our analysis is demonstrated by examples of networks with relatively low complexity, but with features that appear to induce eigenvector localization. The implications of this newly-discovered fragility phenomenon are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Algebraic approach to spacetime bulk reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the theory of holographic quantum error correction in the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, together with the kink transform conjecture on the bulk AdS description of boundary cocycle flow, we characterize (approximate) complementary recovery in terms of (approximate) intertwining of bulk and boundary cocycle derivatives. Using the geometric modular structure in vacuum AdS, we establish an operator algebraic subregion-subregion duality of boundary causal diamonds and bulk causal wedges for Klein-Gordon fields in the universal cover of AdS. Our results suggest that, from an algebraic perspective, the kink transform is bulk cocycle flow, which (in the above case) induces the bulk geometry via geometric modular action and the corresponding notion of time. As a by-product, we find that if the von Neumann algebra of a boundary CFT subregion is a type $\mathrm{III}_1$ factor with an ergodic vacuum, then the von Neumann algebra of the corresponding dual bulk subregion, is either $\mathbb{C}1$ (with a one-dimensional Hilbert space) or a type $\mathrm{III}_1$ factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the mass-shell constraints in the gauged twistor formulation of a massive particle given in [Phys. Rev. D 93, 045016 (2016)] are incorporated in an action automatically by extending the local $U(2)$ transformation to its inhomogeneous extension denoted by $IU(2)$. Therefore it turns out that all the necessary constraints are incorporated into an action by virtue of the local $IU(2)$ symmetry of the system.</description>

      <title>Fractures and thin heterogeneities as Robin-Wentzell interface conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formally derive interface conditions for modeling fractures in Darcy flow problems and, more generally, thin inclusions in heterogeneous diffusion problems expressed as the divergence of a flux. Through a formal integration of the governing equations within the inclusions, we establish that the resulting interface conditions are of Wentzell type for the flux jump and Robin type for the flux average. Notably, the flux jump condition is unconventional, involving a tangential diffusion operator applied to the average of the solution across the interface.
  The corresponding weak formulation is introduced, offering a framework that is readily applicable to finite element discretizations. Extensive numerical validation highlights the robustness and versatility of the proposed modeling technique. The results demonstrate its effectiveness in accommodating a wide range of material properties, managing networks of inclusions, and naturally handling fractures with varying apertures -- all without requiring an explicit geometric representation of the fractures.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Accelerations Characterize the Instability of the Critical Friedmann Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a definitive characterization of the instability of the pressureless ($p=0$) critical ($k=0$) Friedmann spacetime to smooth radial perturbations. We use this to characterize the global accelerations away from $k\leq0$ Friedmann spacetimes induced by the instability in the underdense case. The analysis begins by incorporating the Friedmann spacetimes into a mathematical analysis of smooth spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein field equations expressed in self-similar coordinates $(t,\xi)$ with $\xi=\frac{r}{t}&lt;1$, conceived to realize the critical Friedmann spacetime as an unstable saddle rest point $SM$. We identify a new maximal asymptotically stable family $\mathcal{F}$ of smooth outwardly expanding solutions which globally characterize the evolution of underdense perturbations. Solutions in $\mathcal{F}$ align with a $k&lt;0$ Friedmann spacetime at early times, generically introduce accelerations away from $k&lt;0$ Friedmann spacetimes at intermediate times and then decay back to the same $k&lt;0$ Friedmann spacetime as $t\to\infty$ uniformly at each fixed radius $r&gt;0$. We propose $\mathcal{F}$ as the maximal asymptotically stable family of solutions into which generic underdense perturbations of the unstable critical Friedmann spacetime will evolve and naturally admit accelerations away from Friedmann spacetimes within the dynamics of solutions of Einstein's original field equations, that is, without recourse to a cosmological constant or dark energy.</description>

Abstract: We find the novel class of the supersymmetric deformation of the $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ $\sigma$-model and its equivalence with the generalised chiral Gross-Neveu. This construction allows the use of field-theoretic techniques and particularly the study of renormalisability and $\beta$-function. Provided approach is useful in finding conformal limits and establishes relation between chiral (GN) and sigma model description (geometric), which is explicitly demonstrated for the case of $ \mathbb{R} \times S^{1} $/Super-Thirring models. We also provide discussion on its emergence in $\mathcal{N}=2$ Liouville and 4-dim Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <title>Exponential and algebraic double-soliton solutions of the massive Thirring model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The newly discovered exponential and algebraic double-soliton solutions of the massive Thirring model in laboratory coordinates are placed in the context of the inverse scattering transform. We show that the exponential double-solitons correspond to double isolated eigenvalues in the Lax spectrum, whereas the algebraic double-solitons correspond to double embedded eigenvalues on the imaginary axis, where the continuous spectrum resides. This resolves the long-standing conjecture that multiple embedded eigenvalues may exist in the spectral problem associated with the massive Thirring model. To obtain the exponential double-solitons, we solve the Riemann--Hilbert problem with the reflectionless potential in the case of a quadruplet of double poles in each quadrant of the complex plane. To obtain the algebraic double-solitons, we consider the singular limit where the quadruplet of double poles degenerates into a symmetric pair of double embedded poles on the imaginary axis.</description>

      <title>Finite-time quantum equilibration for continuous variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of equilibration in quantum dynamics for the case were the dynamics-generating Hamiltonians have continuous spectrum. The main goal of this paper will be to propose a framework to extend the results obtained by Short in [11], where estimates for equilibration on average and effective equilibration are derived. We will primarily focus on the case where the quantum dynamics are generated by a semi-group whose generator, i.e. the Hamiltonian, has purely absolutely continuous spectrum, and show that for such a case it is compulsory to constrain ourselves to finite time equilibration; we then develop estimates analogous to the main results in the proposed setting</description>

Abstract: We consider the optimal transportation problem on a globally hyperbolic spacetime for some Lorentzian cost function, which corresponds to the optimal transportation problem on a complete Riemannian manifold where the cost function is the Riemannian distance squared. We establish existence and uniqueness results for the optimal transport map and we investigate the regularity of weak Kantorovich potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to identify the limit in a high temperature regime of classical beta ensembles on the real line and related eigenvalue processes by using the Markov--Krein transform. We show that the limiting measure of Gaussian beta ensembles (resp.\ beta Laguerre ensembles and beta Jacobi ensembles) is the inverse Markov--Krein transform of the Gaussian distribution (resp.\ the gamma distribution and the beta distribution). At the process level, we show that the limiting probability measure-valued process is the inverse Markov--Krein transform of a certain 1d stochastic process.</description>

      <title>Explicit symplectic integrators with adaptive time steps in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, our group developed explicit symplectic methods for curved spacetimes that are not split into several explicitly integrable parts, but are via appropriate time transformations. Such time-transformed explicit symplectic integrators should have employed adaptive time steps in principle, but they are often difficult in practical implementations. In fact, they work well if time transformation functions cause the time-transformed Hamiltonians to have the desired splits and approach 1 or constants for sufficiently large distances. However, they do not satisfy the requirement of step-size selections in this case. Based on the step-size control technique proposed by Preto $\&amp;$ Saha, the nonadaptive time step time-transformed explicit symplectic methods are slightly adjusted as adaptive ones. The adaptive methods have only two additional steps and a negligible increase in computational cost as compared with the nonadaptive ones. Their implementation is simple. Several dynamical simulations of particles and photons near black holes have demonstrated that the adaptive methods typically improve the efficiency of the nonadaptive methods. Because of the desirable property, the new adaptive methods are applied to investigate the chaotic dynamics of particles and photons outside the horizon in a Schwarzschild-Melvin spacetime. The new methods are widely applicable to all curved spacetimes corresponding to Hamiltonians or time-transformed Hamiltonians with the expected splits. Also application to the backwards ray-tracing method for studying the motion of photons and shadows of black holes is possible.</description>

Abstract: This paper examines a generalization of the Camassa-Holm equation from the perspective of integrability. Using the framework developed by Dubrovin on bi-Hamiltonian deformations and the general theory of quasi-integrability, we demonstrate that a unique bi-Hamiltonian structure is possible for this generalized equation only when it reduces to the original CH equation.</description>

      <title>On the classification of duality defects in $c=2$ compact boson CFTs with a discrete group orbifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to exploring duality defects in the $c=2$ compact boson conformal field theory (CFT). This study is motivated by the desire to classify categorical symmetries, particularly duality defects, in CFTs. While the $c=1$ case has been extensively studied, and the types of realizable duality defects are largely understood, the situation becomes significantly more complex for $c=2$. The simplicity of the $c=1$ case arises from the fact that its theory is essentially determined by the radius of compactification. In contrast, the $c=2$ case involves more parameters, leading to a more intricate action of T-duality. As a result, directly solving the condition for a theory to be self-dual under orbifolding becomes highly challenging. To address this, we categorize duality defects into four types and demonstrate that the condition for a toroidal branch theory to be self-dual under an orbifold induced by an automorphism generated by shift symmetry can be reformulated as quadratic equations. We also found that for ``almost all" theories we can enumerate all solutions for such equations. Moreover, this reformulation enables the simultaneous exploration of multiple duality defects and provides evidence for the existence of duality defects under specific parameter families for the theory, such as $(\tau, \rho) = (it, \frac{1}{2}+it)$ where $t \in \mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>One- and two-particle spectral gap identities for the symmetric inclusion process and related models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetric inclusion process (SIP) models particles diffusing on a graph with mutual attraction. We recently showed that, in the log-concave regime (where diffusivity dominates interaction), the spectral gap of the conservative SIP matches that of a single particle. In this paper, our main result demonstrates that this identity generally fails outside this regime, but always holds for the non-conservative SIP, regardless of the interaction strength. When this one-particle spectral gap identity breaks down, we derive sharp bounds for the gap in terms of diffusivity, and reveal a two-particle spectral gap identity in the vanishing diffusivity limit. Our approach leverages the rigid eigenstructure of SIP, refined comparisons of Dirichlet forms for arbitrary diffusivity and particle numbers, and techniques from slow-fast system analysis. These findings extend to the dual interacting diffusion known as Brownian energy process, and shed some light on the spectral gap behavior for related Dirichlet-reversible systems on general, non-mean-field, geometries.</description>

      <title>Nonuniqueness of lattice Boltzmann schemes derived from finite difference methods</title>

Abstract: Recently, the construction of finite difference schemes from lattice Boltzmann schemes has been rigorously analyzed [Bellotti et al. (2022), Numer. Math. 152, pp. 1-40]. It is thus known that any lattice Boltzmann scheme can be expressed in terms of a corresponding multi-step finite difference scheme on the conserved variables. In the present work, we provide counterexamples for the conjecture that any multi-step finite difference scheme has a unique lattice Boltzmann formulation. Based on that, we indicate the existence of equivalence classes for discretized relaxation systems.</description>

      <title>Total variations reduction for an exact control applied to a dynamical mechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an optimal control strategy, an important point is to define the cost of the control. Usually it is added to the control criterion and multiplied by a small coefficient denoted by $\varepsilon$ which is known as the marginal cost of the control. The key idea of this paper, is to introduce a smoothing term in the control cost which aims at reducing the quantity of energy spent and reducing the oscillations of the control. Then using a so-called asymptotic control based on the smallness of $\varepsilon$, we construct an exact control which can be implemented in a close loop. The energy involved in the control depends mainly on the variation of the control. Therefore it seems natural to include this quantity (the total variations) in the criterion involved in the optimal control. This can be done approximately by introducing the $L^1$ norm of the first order derivative of the control. The control strategy that we develop in this paper can be applied to such linear models. One important and new point is that we focus on exact control strategies for a non-differentiable criterion because of the cost of the control. Following the ideas of Tykhonov regularization method, it is proved using the so-called asymptotic method based on the smallness of the marginal cost of the control, that the exact control suggested is the one which represents the minimum of the marginal cost among exact controls. Furthermore, and it is the main technical point, it can reduce the variations of the control with an adequate tuning of the various parameters of the control loop. We test the method on three examples.</description>

      <title>Steady states of the spherically symmetric Vlasov-Poisson system as fixed points of a mass-preserving algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof for the existence of spherically symmetric steady states to the Vlasov-Poisson system, following a strategy that has been used successfully to approximate axially symmetric solutions numerically, both to the Vlasov-Poisson system and to the Einstein-Vlasov system. There are several reasons why a mathematical analysis of this numerical scheme is important. A generalization of the present result to the case of flat axially symmetric solutions would prove that the steady states obtained numerically in \cite{AR3} do exist. Moreover, in the relativistic case the question whether a steady state can be obtained by this scheme seems to be related to its dynamical stability. This motivates the desire for a deeper understanding of this strategy.</description>

      <title>On a countable sequence of homoclinic orbits arising near a saddle-center point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exponential small splitting of separatrices in the singular perturbation theory leads generally to nonvanishing oscillations near a saddle--center point and to nonexistence of a true homoclinic orbit. It was conjectured long ago that the oscillations may vanish at a countable set of small parameter values if there exist a quadruplet of singularities in the complex analytic extension of the limiting homoclinic orbit. The present paper gives a rigorous proof of this conjecture for a particular fourth-order equation relevant to the traveling wave reduction of the modified Korteweg--de Vries equation with the fifth-order dispersion term.</description>

      <title>Direct linearisation of the non-commutative Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the non-commutative Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation and a `lifted' modified Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (mKP) equation are directly linearisable, and thus integrable in this sense. There are several versions of the non-commutative mKP equations, including the two-dimensional generalisations of the non-commutative modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation and its alternative form (amKdV). Herein we derive the `lifted' mKP equation, whose solutions are the natural two-dimensional extension of those for the non-commutative mKdV equation derived in Blower and Malham. We also present the log-potential form of the mKP equation, from which all of these non-commutative mKP equations can be derived. To achieve the integrability results, we construct the pre-Poppe algebra that underlies the KP and mKP equations. This is a non-commutative polynomial algebra over the real line generated by the solution (and its partial derivatives) to the linearised form of the KP and mKP equations. The algebra is endowed with a pre-Poppe product, based on the product rule for semi-additive operators pioneered by Poppe for the commutative KP equation. Integrability corresponds to establishing a particular polynomial expansion in the respective pre-Poppe algebra. We also present numerical simulations of soliton-like interactions for the non-commutative KP equation.</description>

      <title>Quasi-optimal sampling from Gibbs states via non-commutative optimal transport metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from and preparing quantum Gibbs states of local commuting Hamiltonians on hypercubic lattices of arbitrary dimension. We prove that any such Gibbs state which satisfies a clustering condition that we coin decay of matrix-valued quantum conditional mutual information (MCMI) can be quasi-optimally prepared on a quantum computer. We do this by controlling the mixing time of the corresponding Davies evolution in a normalized quantum Wasserstein distance of order one. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a non-commutative transport metric has been used in the study of quantum dynamics, and the first time quasi-rapid mixing is implied by solely an explicit clustering condition. Our result is based on a weak approximate tensorization and a weak modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality for such systems, as well as a new general weak transport cost inequality. If we furthermore assume a constraint on the local gap of the thermalizing dynamics, we obtain rapid mixing in trace distance for interactions beyond the range of two, thereby extending the state-of-the-art results that only cover the nearest neighbor case. We conclude by showing that systems that admit effective local Hamiltonians, like quantum CSS codes at high temperature, satisfy this MCMI decay and can thus be efficiently prepared and sampled from.</description>

      <title>Solving one-body ensemble N-representability problems with spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pauli exclusion principle is fundamental to understanding electronic quantum systems. It namely constrains the expected occupancies $n_i$ of orbitals $\varphi_i$ according to $0 \leq n_i \leq 2$. In this work, we first refine the underlying one-body $N$-representability problem by taking into account simultaneously spin symmetries and a potential degree of mixedness $\boldsymbol w$ of the $N$-electron quantum state. We then derive a comprehensive solution to this problem by using basic tools from representation theory, convex analysis and discrete geometry. Specifically, we show that the set of admissible orbital one-body reduced density matrices is fully characterized by linear spectral constraints on the natural orbital occupation numbers, defining a convex polytope $\Sigma_{N,S}(\boldsymbol w) \subset [0,2]^d$. These constraints are independent of $M$ and the number $d$ of orbitals, while their dependence on $N, S$ is linear, and we can thus calculate them for arbitrary system sizes and spin quantum numbers. Our results provide a crucial missing cornerstone for ensemble density (matrix) functional theory.</description>

      <title>Holography for BCFTs with Multiple Boundaries: Multi-Splitting Quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on the method introduced in arXiv:2403.02165 for holographic duals of Boundary Conformal Field Theories (BCFTs) with multiple boundaries. Using these advances we calculate the entanglement entropy as a function of time for 1+1-dimensional CFTs that are split into $N$ subsystems. We give explicit results for $N = 4$ and $N = 17$. We find that all qualitative differences that arise for larger $N$ are present for $N = 4$.</description>

      <title>On matrix product ansatz for Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process with open boundary in the singular case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.09536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a substitute for the matrix product ansatz for Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process with open boundary in the ``singular case'' $\alpha\beta=q^N\gamma\delta$, when the standard form of the matrix product ansatz of Derrida, Evans, Hakim and Pasquier does not apply. In our approach, the matrix product ansatz is replaced with a pair of linear functionals on an abstract algebra. One of the functionals, $\varphi_1$, is defined on the entire algebra, and determines stationary probabilities for large systems on $L\geq N+1$ sites. The other functional, $\varphi_0$, is defined only on a finite-dimensional linear subspace of the algebra, and determines stationary probabilities for small systems on $L&lt; N+1$ sites. Functional $\varphi_0$ vanishes on non-constant Askey-Wilson polynomials and in non-singular case becomes an orthogonality functional for the Askey-Wilson polynomials.</description>

      <title>Inverse Laplace transform based on Widder's method for Tsallis exponential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.03545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalization of the Laplace transform based on the generalized Tsallis $q$-exponential is given in the present work for a new type of kernel. We also define the inverse transform for this generalized transform based on the complex integration method. We prove identities corresponding to the Laplace transform and inverse transform like the $q$-convolution theorem, the action of generalized derivative and generalized integration on the Laplace transform. We then derive a $q$-generalization of the inverse Laplace transform based on the Post-Widder's method which bypasses the necessity for a complex contour integration. We demonstrate the usefulness of this in computing the Laplace and inverse Laplace transform of some elementary functions. Finally we use the Post-Widder's method based inverse Laplace transform to compute the density of states from the partition function for the case of a generalized classical ideal gas and linear harmonic oscillator in $D$-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian representation of isomonodromic deformations of twisted rational connections: The Painlev\'{e} $1$ hierarchy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we build the Hamiltonian system and the corresponding Lax pairs associated to a twisted connection in $\mathfrak{gl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ admitting an irregular and ramified pole at infinity of arbitrary degree, hence corresponding to the Painlev\'{e} $1$ hierarchy. We provide explicit formulas for these Lax pairs and Hamiltonians in terms of the irregular times and standard $2g$ Darboux coordinates associated to the twisted connection. Furthermore, we obtain a map that reduces the space of irregular times to only $g$ non-trivial isomonodromic deformations. In addition, we perform a symplectic change of Darboux coordinates to obtain a set of symmetric Darboux coordinates in which Hamiltonians and Lax pairs are polynomial. Finally, we apply our general theory to the first cases of the hierarchy: the Airy case $(g=0)$, the Painlev\'{e} $1$ case $(g=1)$ and the next two elements of the Painlev\'{e} $1$ hierarchy.</description>

Abstract: We prove the orbital stability of soliton solutions for 2D Maxwell--Lorentz system with extended charged particle. The solitons corresponds to the uniform motion and rotation of the particle.
  We reduce the corresponding Hamilton system by the canonical transformation via transition to a comoving frame. The solitons are the critical points of the reduced Hamiltonian. The key point of the proof is a lower bound for the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Equality of magnetization and edge current for interacting lattice fermions at positive temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the magnetization is equal to the edge current in the thermodynamic limit for a large class of models of lattice fermions with finite-range interactions satisfying local indistinguishability of the Gibbs state, a condition known to hold for sufficiently high temperatures. Our result implies that edge currents in such systems are determined by bulk properties and are therefore stable against large perturbations near the boundaries. Moreover, the equality persists also after taking the derivative with respect to the chemical potential. We show that this form of bulk-edge correspondence is essentially a consequence of homogeneity in the bulk and locality of the Gibbs state. An important intermediate result is a new version of Bloch's theorem for two-dimensional systems, stating that persistent currents vanish in the bulk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the massless Sine-Gordon model in de Sitter spacetime, in the regime $\beta^2 &lt; 4 \pi$ and using the framework of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory. We show that a Fock space representation exists for the free massless field, but that the natural one-parameter family of vacuum-like states breaks the de Sitter boost symmetries. We prove convergence of the perturbative series for the S matrix in this representation, and construct the interacting Haag-Kastler net of local algebras from the relative S matrices. We show that the net fulfills isotony, locality and de Sitter covariance (in the algebraic adiabatic limit), even though the states that we consider are not invariant. We furthermore prove convergence of the perturbative series for the interacting field and the vertex operators, and verify that the interacting equation of motion holds.</description>

Abstract: We consider the six-vertex model at its free-fermion point with domain wall boundary conditions, which is equivalent to random domino tilings of the Aztec diamond. We compute the scaling limit of a particular non-local correlation function, essentially equivalent to the partition function for the domino tilings of a pentagon-shaped domain, obtained by cutting away a triangular region from a corner of the initial Aztec diamond. We observe a third-order phase transition when the geometric parameters of the obtained pentagonal domain are tuned to have the fifth side exactly tangent to the arctic ellipse of the corresponding initial model.</description>

Abstract: Building on the recent work in~[J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57, 235204 (2024)], we propose a Hamiltonian for the Hilbert-P\'olya Conjecture. We establish the existence of a well-defined similarity transformation that renders this Hamiltonian self-adjoint for the nontrivial Riemann zeros. In particular, we explicitly demonstrate that the eigenfunctions of the transformed Hamiltonian are orthogonal and square-integrable, and crucially, that the eigenvalues are real. This represents a significant step toward proving the Riemann Hypothesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a system of $N$ Fermions of spin $1/2$, with its interaction potential of scattering length $a$, the classical Huang-Yang formula states that the energy density $e(\rho)$ is of the form
  \begin{equation*}
  e(\rho)=\frac{3}{5}(3\pi^2)^{\frac{2}{3}}\rho^{\frac{5}{3}}+2\pi a\rho^2
  +\frac{12}{35}(11-2\ln2)3^{\frac{1}{3}}\pi^{\frac{2}{3}}a^2\rho^{\frac{7}{3}}
  +o(\rho^{\frac{7}{3}}).
  \end{equation*}
  We consider a general system of $N$ Fermions of spin $1/\mathbf{q}$ with the scattering length of the interaction potential at the scale $a\propto N^{-1}$, that is, in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime. We prove the 2nd order ground state energy approximation corresponding to the Huang-Yang formula. The thermodynamic limit case shares a similar logic, and could be dealt with in a separate paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some advantages of the algebraic approach to many body physics, based on resolvent algebras, are illustrated by the simple example of non-interacting bosons which are confined in compact regions with soft boundaries. It is shown that the dynamics of these systems converges to the spatially homogeneous dynamics for increasing regions and particle numbers and a variety of boundary forces. The corresponding correlation functions of thermal equilibrium states also converge in this limit. Depending on the filling of the regions with particles, the limits can either be spatially homogeneous, including the Bose-Einstein condensates, or they become inhomogeneous with varying, but finite local particle densities. In case of this spontaneous breakdown of the spatial symmetry, the presence of condensates can be established by exhibiting temporal correlations over large temporal distances (memory effects).</description>

      <description>arXiv:1801.09880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discover a large class of simple affine vertex algebras $V_{k} (\mathfrak g)$, associated to basic Lie superalgebras $\mathfrak g$ at non-admissible collapsing levels $k$, having exactly one irreducible $\mathfrak g$-locally finite module in the category ${\mathcal O}$. In the case when $\mathfrak g$ is a Lie algebra, we prove a complete reducibility result for $V_k(\mathfrak g)$-modules at an arbitrary collapsing level. We also determine the generators of the maximal ideal in the universal affine vertex algebra $V^k (\mathfrak g)$ at certain negative integer levels. Considering some conformal embeddings in the simple affine vertex algebras $V_{-1/2} (C_n)$ and $V_{-4}(E_7)$, we surprisingly obtain the realization of non-simple affine vertex algebras of types $B$ and $D$ having exactly one non-trivial ideal.</description>

      <title>Non-integrability of the axisymmetric Bianchi IX cosmological model via Differential Galois Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.10108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the integrability of an anisotropic universe with matter and cosmological constant formulated as Bianchi IX models. The presence of the cosmological constant causes the existence of a critical point in the finite part of the phase space. The separatrix associated to this Einstein's static universe is entirely contained in an invariant isotropic plane forgetting the singularity at the origin. This invariant plane of isotropy is an integrable sub-space of the Taub type. In this paper we analyse the differential Galois group of the second order variational equations to this plane in order to apply the integrability theorem of the second author with Ramis and Sim\' o. The main result is that the model is non-integrable by meromorphic functions.</description>

      <title>Quantum stochastic phase-space theorems lead to hidden causal loops in a model for measurement consistent with macroscopic realism, Bell nonlocality and no-signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06070v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how quantum measurement and nonlocality can be explained consistently with macroscopic realism and no-signaling. We analyze a measurement of $\hat{x}$ on a system prepared in a superposition of eigenstates, with measurement modeled as amplification, realized by interacting the system with an amplifier. Deriving quantum stochastic path-integral theorems, we prove an equivalence between a phase-space probability distribution $Q(x,p)$ (which uniquely represents the quantum state) and stochastic trajectories for the amplified and attenuated variables, $x$ and $p$, that propagate backwards and forwards in time, respectively. For the superposition, but not the mixture, the backward and forward-propagating trajectories are connected by the initial-time conditional distribution $Q(p|x)$, leading to a causal loop. The joint densities for $x(t)$ and $p(t)$ yield $Q(x,p,t)$, confirming causal consistency. A feature is hidden noise associated with an eigenstate. Unlike the eigenvalue, this noise is not amplified. This motivates an ontological model for measurement, where the amplified amplitude x(t) gives the detected outcome, from which Born's rule follows. For macroscopic superpositions, we demonstrate consistency with macroscopic realism: Further, we evaluate the initial-time distribution $Q_{loop}(x,p)$ for the coupled trajectories conditioned on a given outcome, showing that this cannot correspond to a quantum state. Finally, we analyze Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen and Bell nonlocality. Our conclusion is a model for the collapse of the wave-function and nonlocality, consistent with three weak local realistic premises. We deduce a hybrid causal structure involving causal relations for amplified variables, demonstrating through explicit simulation how microscopic retrocausality can explain measurement and entanglement, without leading to retrocausality at a macroscopic level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit homogenisation theory for Friedrichs systems. In particular, we show that $G$-compactness can be obtained under severely weaker assumptions than in the original work of Burazin and Vrdoljak (2014). In this way we extend the applicability of $G$-compactness results for Friedrichs systems to equations that yield memory effects in the homogenised limit and detour any usage of compactness techniques previously employed.</description>

      <title>Unified framework for continuity of sandwiched R\'enyi divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove uniform continuity bounds for entropic quantities related to the sandwiched R\'enyi divergences such as the sandwiched R\'enyi conditional entropy. We follow three different approaches: The first one is the "almost additive approach", which exploits the sub-/ superadditivity and joint concavity/ convexity of the exponential of the divergence. In our second approach, termed the "operator space approach", we express the entropic measures as norms and utilize their properties for establishing the bounds. These norms draw inspiration from interpolation space norms. We not only demonstrate the norm properties solely relying on matrix analysis tools but also extend their applicability to a context that holds relevance in resource theories. By this, we extend the strategies of Marwah and Dupuis as well as Beigi and Goodarzi employed in the sandwiched R\'enyi conditional entropy context. Finally, we merge the approaches into a mixed approach that has some advantageous properties and then discuss in which regimes each bound performs best. Our results improve over the previous best continuity bounds or sometimes even give the first continuity bounds available. In a separate contribution, we use the ALAFF method, developed in a previous article by some of the authors, to study the stability of approximate quantum Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Microlocal Analysis of Waves Across the Event Horizon of an Extremal Rotating Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Static black holes contain regions of spacetime which not even light can escape from. In the centre of mass frame, these blocks are separated from each other by event horizons. Unlike pointlike particles, fields can spread and interact non-causally across the horizons. The microlocal theory of this is somewhat incomplete, however. For instance, the theory of real principal type operators does not apply on the horizon. In this article, we address this issue for the extremal rotating black hole. Namely, we show that null covectors on the horizon of the extremal Kerr spacetime form an involutive double characteristic manifold and then extend the construction of parametrix across the event horizon. This provides a mathematical basis for the asymptotic oscillatory solutions in the region. Such approximations are central in quantum mechanics. In contrast to the real principal case, solutions near the horizon admit two channels for propagation of singularities. Indeed, there is additional propagation along the double characteristic variety.</description>

      <title>Symmetries as Ground States of Local Superoperators: Hydrodynamic Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry algebras of quantum many-body systems with locality can be understood using commutant algebras, which are defined as algebras of operators that commute with a given set of local operators. In this work, we show that these symmetry algebras can be expressed as frustration-free ground states of a local superoperator, which we refer to as a ``super-Hamiltonian". We demonstrate this for conventional symmetries such as $Z_2$, $U(1)$, and $SU(2)$, where the symmetry algebras map to various kinds of ferromagnetic ground states, as well as for unconventional ones that lead to weak ergodicity breaking phenomena of Hilbert space fragmentation and quantum many-body scars. In addition, we show that the low-energy excitations of this super-Hamiltonian can be understood as approximate symmetries, which in turn are related to slowly relaxing hydrodynamic modes in symmetric systems. This connection is made precise by relating the super-Hamiltonian to the superoperator that governs the operator relaxation in noisy symmetric Brownian circuits, and this physical interpretation also provides a novel interpretation for Mazur bounds for autocorrelation functions. We find examples of gapped/gapless super-Hamiltonians indicating the absence/presence of slow-modes, which happens in the presence of discrete/continuous symmetries. In the gapless cases, we recover hydrodynamic modes such as diffusion, tracer diffusion, and asymptotic scars in the presence of $U(1)$ symmetry, Hilbert space fragmentation, and a tower of quantum scars respectively. In all, this demonstrates the power of the commutant algebra framework in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of exact symmetries, and associated approximate symmetries and hydrodynamic modes, and their dynamical consequences in systems with locality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a synthetic Bonnet-Myers rigidity theorem for globally hyperbolic Lorentzian length spaces with global curvature bounded below by $K&lt;0$ and an open distance realizer of length $L=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{|K|}}$: It states that the space necessarily is a warped product with warping function $\cos:(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})\to\mathbb{R}_+$. From this, one also sees that a globally hyperbolic spacetime with curvature bounded above by $K&lt;0$ and an open distance realizer of length $L=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{|K|}}$ is a warped product with warping function $\cos$.</description>

      <title>Decoherence Implies Information Gain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that if the wave function of a quantum system undergoes an arbitrary random transformation such that the diagonal elements of the density matrix in the decoherence basis associated with a preferred observable remain constant, then (i) the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix become smaller in magnitude, and (ii) the state of the system gains information about the preferred observable from its environment in the sense that the uncertainty of the observable is reduced in the transformed state. These results do not depend on the details of how the system-environment interaction generates the random state transformation, and together imply that decoherence leads in general to information gain, not information loss.</description>

      <title>Conditional Independence of 1D Gibbs States with Applications to Efficient Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that spin chains in thermal equilibrium have a correlation structure in which individual regions are strongly correlated at most with their near vicinity. We quantify this with alternative notions of the conditional mutual information, defined through the so-called Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy. We prove that these measures decay superexponentially at every positive temperature, under the assumption that the spin chain Hamiltonian is translation-invariant. Using a recovery map associated with these measures, we sequentially construct tensor network approximations in terms of marginals of small (sublogarithmic) size. As a main application, we show that classical representations of the states can be learned efficiently from local measurements with a polynomial sample complexity. We also prove an approximate factorization condition for the purity of the entire Gibbs state, which implies that it can be efficiently estimated to a small multiplicative error from a small number of local measurements. The results extend from strictly local to exponentially-decaying interactions above a threshold temperature, albeit only with exponential decay rates. As a technical step of independent interest, we show an upper bound to the decay of the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy upon the application of a conditional expectation.</description>

      <title>Quantum resonances and scattering poles of classical rank one locally symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For negatively curved symmetric spaces it is known from [Hansen-Hilgert-Parthasarathy,2019] that the poles of the scattering matrices defined via the standard intertwining operators for the spherical principal representations of the isometry group are either given as poles of the intertwining operators or as quantum resonances, i.e. poles of the meromorphically continued resolvents of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We extend this result to classical locally symmetric spaces of negative curvature with convex-cocompact fundamental group using results of Bunke and Olbrich. The method of proof forces us to exclude the spectral parameters corresponding to singular Poisson transforms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Stochastic Burgers equation was introduced in [H. van Beijeren, R. Kutner and H. Spohn, Excess noise for driven diffusive systems, PRL, 1985] as a continuous approximation of the fluctuations of the asymmetric simple exclusion process. It is formally given by $$\partial_t\eta =\frac{1}{2}\Delta\eta+ \mathfrak w\cdot\nabla(\eta^2) + \nabla\cdot\xi,$$ where $\xi$ is $d$-dimensional space time white noise and $\mathfrak w$ is a fixed non-zero vector. In the critical dimension $d=2$ at stationarity, we show that this system exhibits superdiffusve behaviour: more specifically, its bulk diffusion coefficient behaves like $(\log t)^\frac23$, in a Tauberian sense, up to $\log\log\log t$ corrections. This confirms a prediction made in the physics literature and complements [G. Cannizzarro, M. Gubinelli, F. Toninelli, Gaussian Fluctuations for the stochastic Burgers equation in dimension $d\geq 2$, CMP, 2024], where the same equation was studied in the weak-coupling regime. Furthermore this model can be seen as a continuous analogue to [H.T. Yau, $(\log t)^\frac{2}{3}$ law of the two dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion process, Annals of Mathematics, 2004].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new model equation for Stokes gravity waves based on conformal transformations of Euler's equations. The local version of the model equation is relevant for dynamics of shallow water waves. It allows us to characterize the traveling periodic waves both in the case of smooth and peaked waves and to solve the existence problem exactly, albeit not in elementary functions. Spectral stability of smooth waves with respect to co-periodic perturbations is proven analytically based on the exact count of eigenvalues in a constrained spectral problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contact angle hysteresis of droplets will be examined in light of static friction between liquid drop and solid surface. Unlike frictions in solid-solid interfaces, pinning forces at contact points or contact lines would be the cause of friction. We will define coefficients of static friction and relate them with advancing and receding contact angles for the case of two-dimensional droplets. In our work sessile drops in an inclined plane, and pendent drops in a slanted ceiling will all be analyzed within a single framework with the inclination angle as a free parameter. We can then visualize the gradual change of shapes of a droplet put on a plane as the inclination angle changes adiabatically to make a complete turn. We point out that there could be two distinct stable configurations of pendent droplets for the same physical conditions, hence dubbed the bifurcation. And in the case of pendent droplets we investigate at what ranges of parameters pinch-offs occur, and find an interesting relation between the fallen-out volume and the Bond number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that the completeness relation for the eigenvectors, which is an essential assumption of quantum mechanics, remains true if the initial Hamiltonian, having a discrete spectrum, is modified by a delta potential (to be made precise by a renormalization scheme) supported at a point in two and three-dimensional compact manifolds or Euclidean spaces. The formulation can be easily extended to $N$ center case, and the case where delta interaction is supported on curves in the plane or space.</description>

      <title>Signed R\'enyi Entropy and Quantum Second Laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We modify the R\'enyi (1961) axioms for entropy to apply to negative (``signed") measures as arise, for example, in phase-space representations of quantum mechanics. We obtain two new measures of (lack of) information about a system -- which we propose as signed analogs to classical Shannon entropy and classical R\'enyi entropy, respectively. We show that signed R\'enyi entropy witnesses non-classicality of a system. Specifically, a measure has at least one negative component if and only if signed R\'enyi $\alpha$-entropy is negative for some $\alpha &gt; 1$. The corresponding non-classicality test does not work with signed Shannon entropy. We next show that signed R\'enyi $2k$-entropy, when $k$ is a positive integer, is Schur-concave. (An example shows that signed Shannon entropy is not Schur-concave.) We then establish an abstract quantum H-theorem for signed measures. We prove that signed R\'enyi $2k$-entropy is non-decreasing under classical (``decohering") evolution of a signed measure, where the latter could be a Wigner function or other phase-space representation of a quantum system. (An example shows that signed Shannon entropy may be non-monotonic.) We also provide a characterization of the Second Law for signed R\'enyi $2$-entropy in terms of what we call eventual classicalization of evolution of a system. We conclude with an argument that signed R\'enyi $2$-entropy of the Wigner function is constant under Moyal bracket evolution.</description>

      <title>Closed-form solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with arbitrary dispersion and potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, the general nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is investigated, in which the chromatic dispersion and potential are specified by two arbitrary functions. The equation in question is a natural generalization of a wide class of related nonlinear partial differential equations that are often used in various areas of theoretical physics, including nonlinear optics, superconductivity and plasma physics. To construct exact solutions, a combination of the method of functional constraints and methods of generalized separation of variables is used. Exact closed-form solutions of the general nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, which are expressed in quadratures or elementary functions, are found. One-dimensional non-symmetry reductions are described, which lead the considered nonlinear partial differential equation to a simpler ordinary differential equation or a system of such equations. The exact solutions obtained in this work can be used as test problems intended to assess the accuracy of numerical and approximate analytical methods for integrating nonlinear equations of mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of Vortices in Quasi-2D Scalar Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, vortex-vortex interactions approximately vary with the logarithm of the inter-vortex distance, making it possible to describe an ensemble of vortices as a Coulomb gas. We introduce a duality between vortices in a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) scalar Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and effective Maxwell's electrodynamics. Specifically, we address the general scenario of inhomogeneous, time-dependent BEC number density with dissipation or rotation. Starting from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which describes the mean-field dynamics of a quasi-2D scalar BEC without dissipation, we show how to map vortices in a quasi-2D scalar BEC to 2D electrodynamics beyond the point-vortex approximation, even when dissipation is present or in a rotating system. The physical meaning of this duality is discussed.</description>
