      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesizer is a fast, flexible, modular, and extensible Python package that empowers astronomers to turn theoretical galaxy models into realistic synthetic observations - including spectra, photometry, images, and spectral cubes - with a focus on interchangeable modelling assumptions. By offloading computationally intensive tasks to threaded C++ extensions, Synthesizer delivers both simplicity and speed, enabling rapid forward-modelling workflows without requiring users to manage low-level data processing and computational details.</description>

      <title>Background Measurements and Simulations of the ComPair Balloon Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ComPair, a prototype of the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory (AMEGO), completed a short-duration high-altitude balloon campaign on August 27, 2023 from Fort Sumner, New Mexico, USA. The goal of the balloon flight was the demonstration of ComPair as both a Compton and Pair telescope in flight, rejection of the charged particle background, and measurement of the background $\gamma$-ray spectrum. This analysis compares measurements from the balloon flight with Monte Carlo simulations to benchmark the instrument. The comparison finds good agreement between the measurements and simulations and supports the conclusion that ComPair accomplished its goals for the balloon campaign. Additionally, two charged particle background rejection schemes are discussed: a soft ACD veto that records a higher charged particle event rate but with less risk of event loss, and a hard ACD veto that limits the charged particle event rate on board. There was little difference in the measured spectra from the soft and hard ACD veto schemes, indicating that the hard ACD veto could be used for future flights. The successes of ComPair's engineering flight will inform the development of the next generation of ComPair with upgraded detector technology and larger active area.</description>

      <title>Calibrating the photometric performance of a high-time-resolution photon-counting imager for optical astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical observations with high time resolution are essential for understanding the origin of sub-millisecond timescale astronomical phenomena, including giant radio pulses from the Crab Pulsar. We have developed a high-speed imaging system called the Imager of MPPC-based Optical photoN counter from Yamagata (IMONY). The system uses a customized Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC), which independently reads out signals from all $8\times8$ pixels and functions as an imager based on a Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode array. This system assigns timestamps to detected photons with a time resolution of 100 ns. We installed IMONY on the 3.8 m aperture Seimei Telescope in Okayama, Japan. We have successfully detected the 34-ms period of the Crab Pulsar and imaged stars in the sensor's field of view. However, we have also found that a small fraction of the pixels have shown double or multiple pulses that are used for photon arrival timing. This situation is likely due to circuit noise and may unfortunately result in overestimating the number of photons detected. In order to precisely estimate the photon flux of targets or the sky background, calibration of such over-counts is important. We measured the number of detected photons relative to the light intensity of each pixel in a laboratory environment. We estimated the number of spurious hit pulses caused by signal tail fluctuations exceeding the comparator threshold, based on the exponential distribution of time intervals between pulses. These are distinct from typical SiPM afterpulses and originate from electronic effects in our readout system. After applying the calibration to the observed data, we confirmed the linearity between the V-band magnitudes of stars and the number of detected photons.</description>

      <title>Radio Galaxy Zoo: EMU -- paving the way for EMU cataloging using AI and citizen science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey with ASKAP is transforming our understanding of radio galaxies, AGN duty cycles, and cosmic structure. EMUCAT efficiently identifies compact radio sources, yet struggles with extended objects, requiring alternative approaches. The Radio Galaxy Zoo: EMU (RGZ EMU) project proposes a general framework that combines citizen science and machine learning to identify around 4 million extended sources in EMU. This framework is expected to enhance the EMUCAT cataloging on extended sources and can be further empowered with the introduction of cross-matched external data from surveys such as POSSUM and WALLABY.</description>

      <title>Broadband Low-Resolution Spectrograph -- SpectrumMate LR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and application of SpectrumMate LR, a broadband, low-resolution spectrograph for small telescope use. SpectrumMate LR is designed to offer affordable, accessible spectroscopic capabilities for amateur astronomers and educators, inspired by the need for versatile instruments in amateur and educational settings. Utilising a 300 grooves/mm grating, 80 mm collimator and objective lenses, SpectrumMate LR is optimised to perform analyses across the visible spectrum, enabling users to classify stars by spectral type, measure stellar temperatures, and test filter transmission ranges. Tests demonstrate SpectrumMate LR's ability to capture accurate spectral data, validating its efficacy in observing both celestial and terrestrial light sources. This instrument fills a niche for cost-effective spectroscopy, empowering a broader audience to engage in detailed observational astronomy</description>

      <title>Category-based Galaxy Image Generation via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional galaxy generation methods rely on semi-analytical models and hydrodynamic simulations, which are highly dependent on physical assumptions and parameter tuning. In contrast, data-driven generative models do not have explicit physical parameters pre-determined, and instead learn them efficiently from observational data, making them alternative solutions to galaxy generation. Among these, diffusion models outperform Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in quality and diversity. Leveraging physical prior knowledge to these models can further enhance their capabilities. In this work, we present GalCatDiff, the first framework in astronomy to leverage both galaxy image features and astrophysical properties in the network design of diffusion models. GalCatDiff incorporates an enhanced U-Net and a novel block entitled Astro-RAB (Residual Attention Block), which dynamically combines attention mechanisms with convolution operations to ensure global consistency and local feature fidelity. Moreover, GalCatDiff uses category embeddings for class-specific galaxy generation, avoiding the high computational costs of training separate models for each category. Our experimental results demonstrate that GalCatDiff significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of the consistency of sample color and size distributions, and the generated galaxies are both visually realistic and physically consistent. This framework will enhance the reliability of galaxy simulations and can potentially serve as a data augmentor to support future galaxy classification algorithm development.</description>

      <title>The Indian Pulsar Timing Array Data Release 2: I. Dataset and Timing Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) employs unique features of the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) to monitor dozens of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) millisecond pulsars (MSPs), simultaneously in the 300-500 MHz and the 1260-1460 MHz bands. This dual-band approach ensures that any frequency-dependent delays are accurately characterized, significantly improving the timing precision for pulsar observations, which is crucial for pulsar timing arrays. We present details of InPTA's second data release that involves 7 yrs of data on 27 IPTA MSPs. This includes sub-banded Times of Arrival (ToAs), Dispersion Measures (DM), and initial timing ephemerides for our MSPs. A part of this dataset, originally released in InPTA's first data release, is being incorporated into IPTA's third data release which is expected to detect and characterize nanohertz gravitational waves in the coming years. The entire dataset is reprocessed in this second data release providing some of the highest precision DM estimates so far and interesting solar wind related DM variations in some pulsars. This is likely to characterize the noise introduced by the dynamic inter-stellar ionised medium much better than the previous release thereby increasing sensitivity to any future gravitational wave search.</description>

      <title>Navigating AGN variability with self-organizing maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The classification of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is a challenge in astrophysics. Variability features extracted from light curves offer a promising avenue for distinguishing AGNs and their subclasses. This approach would be very valuable in sight of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).
  Aims. Our goal is to utilize self-organizing maps (SOMs) to classify AGNs based on variability features and investigate how the use of different subsets of features impacts the purity and completeness of the resulting classifications.
  Methods. We derived a set of variability features from light curves, similar to those employed in previous studies, and applied SOMs to explore the distribution of AGNs subclasses. We conducted a comparative analysis of the classifications obtained with different subsets of features, focusing on the ability to identify different AGNs types.
  Results. Our analysis demonstrates that using SOMs with variability features yields a relatively pure AGNs sample, though completeness remains a challenge. In particular, Type 2 AGNs are the hardest to identify, as can be expected. These results represent a promising step toward the development of tools that may support AGNs selection in future large-scale surveys such as LSST.</description>

      <title>Frequently Used References For Atomic Data In X-ray Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate atomic physics reference data are a crucial requirement for analysis and interpretation of observed spectra, even more so for observations with high spectral resolution. This document provides a curated list of atomic physics references frequently used for plasma diagnostics in X-ray spectroscopy, outside of comprehensive plasma models that typically come with their own underlying atomic databases. The list includes references to physical constants, laboratory benchmarks, transition energies, position and line shapes of neutral fluorescence lines, radiative branching ratios, and commonly used notation for prominent transitions. Quick-look tables for transition energies in H-, He-, and Li-like ions and line positions and shapes for fluorescence lines in neutrals. The main focus is on K-shell transitions. For the H- and He-like tables, we cite state-of-the art calculations that we consider currently the best available reference energies, which are considered high accuracy and thus typically used for energy scale calibration in laboratory measurements. Omissions in these tables are due to the lack of availability in the chosen references, and are not a statement about the relevance of these lines. Due to their complex and highly source-dependent line shape, the atomic data for neutrals is of lower accuracy than that for the highly charged ions, and the best reference data for these line shapes typically consist of empirical models derived from very high-resolution laboratory measurements. The table for neutrals provided here is consistent with the reference used for the energy gain scale calibration of XRISM/Resolve. This document is meant to serve as a resource to help find relevant references and conveniently formatted overview tables. When making use of the information found in these papers, credit should be given to their original authors by citing the appropriate references.</description>

      <title>Real-time Broadband RFI Excision for the Upgraded GMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A real-time broadband RFI mitigation system has been developed for the Upgraded GMRT (uGMRT). Here, we report the engineering, imaging, and beam/pulsar results from the test observations in all the bands of the uGMRT during the monsoon of 2018 and 2019. Broadband power-line RFI is almost always present in uGMRT bands 2 (120 - 240 MHz), 3 (300 - 500 MHz) and 4 (550 - 850 MHz), but the monsoon period is chosen to understand the performance in the worst RFI situations arising due to an increase in the wind-speed and moisture.</description>

      <title>A general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics extension to mesh-less schemes in the code GIZMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The profound comprehension of the evolution and phenomenology of an Active Galactic Nucleus requires an accurate exploration of the dynamics of the magnetized gaseous disk surrounding the massive black hole in the centre. Many numerical simulations have studied this environment using elaborate grid-based codes, but in recent years, new mesh-less schemes have exhibited excellent conservation properties and good accuracy at a more moderate computational cost. Still, none implement general relativistic magnetic fields, a fundamental ingredient to model an accretion disk around a massive black hole. We present here a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) scheme working within the mesh-less framework of the code \texttt{GIZMO}. We implement the hyperbolic divergence cleaning procedure, consistently extended to general relativistic effects, to keep the magnetic field divergence under safe levels. We benchmark the scheme against various relativistic magnetohydrodynamics stress tests, considering different dimensionalities and both a Minkowski or a Schwarzchild/Kerr background. To date, this is the first GRMHD scheme working in a mesh-free environment.</description>

      <title>Laboratory Investigation of CO2-Driven Enhancement of Radiolytic H2O2 on Europa and Other Icy Moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of Europa's leading hemisphere reveal elevated H2O2 in the warmer, low latitude chaos terrains compared to the colder, polar regions. This distribution disagrees with prior laboratory radiolysis studies of pure water ice, which show higher H2O2 yields at colder temperatures. The regions with higher peroxide abundance, Tara and Powys Regiones, also present increased amounts of CO2, possibly sourced from Europa's interior. To investigate whether CO2 influences radiolysis of water ice to boost H2O2 production, we irradiated water ice doped with varying amounts of CO2 with 10 keV electrons at 70 and 100 K. Our results indicate that CO2, even in trace amounts (&lt; 3%), significantly enhances H2O2 yields at temperatures relevant to Europa. We discuss the mechanisms by which CO2 boosts peroxide synthesis and quantify H2O2 creation and destruction cross sections and G-values across different CO2 concentrations. These findings provide a plausible explanation for the perplexing H2O2 distribution on Europa and has implications for understanding peroxide on other icy bodies such as Ganymede and Charon, where it has been detected alongside CO2.</description>

      <title>Impact of Detector Calibration Accuracy on Black Hole Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systematic errors in detector calibration can bias signal analyses and potentially lead to incorrect interpretations suggesting violations of general relativity. In this study, we investigate how calibration systematics affect black hole (BH) spectroscopy, a technique that uses the quasinormal modes (QNMs) emitted during the ringdown phase of gravitational waves (GWs) to study remnant BHs formed in compact binary coalescences. We simulate a series of physically motivated, tunable calibration errors and use them to intentionally miscalibrate numerical relativity waveforms. We then apply a QNM extraction method -- the rational QNM filter -- to quantify the impact of these calibration errors. We find that current calibration standards (errors within $10\%$ in magnitude and $10^\circ$ in phase across the most sensitive frequency range of 20--2000 Hz) are adequate for BH ringdown analyses with existing observations, but insufficient for the accuracy goals of future upgraded and next-generation observatories. Specifically, we show that for events with a high ringdown signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 120$, calibration errors must remain $\lesssim 6\%$ in magnitude and $\lesssim 4^\circ$ in phase to avoid introducing biases. While this analysis addresses a particular aspect of BH spectroscopy, the results offer broadly applicable quantitative benchmarks for calibration standards crucial to fully realizing the potential of precision GW astrophysics in the next-generation detector era.</description>

      <title>(Re)-Defining Planets -- the Fundamental Plane of Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 6000+ exoplanets are now detected using various techniques, with estimates of billions of planets existing in our Galaxy alone. They are called super-Earths, hot Earths, mini-Neptunes, hot Neptunes, sub-Neptunes, Saturns, Jupiters, hot Jupiters, gas giants, ice giants, rocky, terran, subterran, superterran, and so on. This prompted the emergence of many recent works on taxonomy, or classification, of exoplanets. However, there is still no basic, fundamental definition of 'What is a planet?'. IAU has forwarded a definition in 2006 which, however, raised more questions than it solved. The first ambitious task here is to establish if there are limits on the size/mass of planets. The lower mass limit may be assumed as of Mimas - approximately minimum mass required to attain a nearly spherical hydrostatic equilibrium shape. The upper mass limit may be easier - there is a natural lower limit to what constitutes a star: ~0.08 SU. But then there are brown dwarfs: IAU has defined brown dwarfs as objects that exceed the deuterium burning limit (~13 JU), and giant exoplanets generally have masses of ~0.3 to ~60 JU. The resolution requires assembling the basic physical parameters that define planets quantitatively. Mass and radius are the two fundamental properties, and we propose to use a third correlated parameter: the moment of inertia. Based on this, we create the fundamental planet plane where the two parameters are correlated with the third, similar to a fundamental galactic plane. The fundamental planetary plane with turn-off point diagrams is constructed for the first time in this work. We define a planet as 'A celestial spherical object, bound to a star or unbound, that lies on the fundamental planetary plane, within a mass range between 0.02 EU to 13 JU'.</description>

      <title>BLADE: An Automated Framework for Classifying Light Curves from the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) Fireball Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fireballs (bolides) are high-energy luminous phenomena produced when meteoroids and small asteroids enter Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds, often resulting in fragmentation or complete disintegration accompanied by significant energy release. The resulting bolide light curves capture temporal brightness variations as these objects traverse increasingly dense atmospheric layers, providing essential information on meteoroid entry dynamics, fragmentation behavior, and atmospheric energy deposition processes. The Center for Near-Earth Object Studies' (CNEOS) continuously expanding fireball database offers a globally comprehensive archive of bolide events, including light curves and associated metadata. Events associated with infrasound detections allow direct correlations between acoustic signatures and light-curve features, therefore enabling detailed analyses of fragmentation dynamics and energy deposition. Here, we introduce BLADE (Bolide Light-curve Analysis and Discrimination Explorer), a robust and high-fidelity framework specifically designed to analyze bolide light curves for objects detected from space. BLADE incorporates a processing pipeline integrating Savitzky-Golay filtering, prominence-based peak detection, and gradient analysis, enabling systematic identification and classification of fragmentation events and their associated energy release characteristics. Preliminary results demonstrate that BLADE reliably distinguishes distinct bolide behaviors, providing an objective, scalable methodology for characterization and analysis of large bolide light curve datasets. This foundational work establishes a novel pathway for advanced bolide research, with promising applications in planetary defense and global atmospheric monitoring.</description>

      <title>Solar Transient Recognition Using Deep Learning (STRUDL) for heliospheric imager data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are space weather phenomena capable of causing significant disruptions to both space- and ground-based infrastructure. The timely and accurate detection and prediction of CMEs is a crucial steps towards implementing strategies to minimize the impacts of such events. CMEs are commonly observed using coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers (HIs), with some forecasting methods relying on manually tracking CMEs across successive images in order to provide an estimate of their arrival time and speed. This process is time-consuming, and the growing volume of available data makes manual identification of CMEs increasingly impractical.
  We investigate the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to the problem of automated CME detection, focusing on data from the HI instruments aboard the STEREO spacecraft. HI data facilitates the tracking of CMEs through interplanetary space, providing valuable information on their evolution along the way. Building on advances in image segmentation, we present the Solar Transient Recognition Using Deep Learning (STRUDL) model. STRUDL is designed to automatically detect and segment CME fronts in HI data. We address the challenges inherent to this task and evaluate the model's performance across a range of solar activity conditions. To complement segmentation, we implement a basic tracking algorithm that links CME detections across successive frames, thus allowing us to automatically generate time-distance profiles for all CMEs under study.
  Our results demonstrate the feasibility of applying ML-based segmentation techniques to HI data, while highlighting areas for future improvement, particularly regarding the accurate segmentation and tracking of faint and interacting CMEs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Frontiers of Cosmic Ray Physics: Perspectives on GRANDProto300 and the GRAND Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is an envisioned large-scale radio array designed to detect ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, $E &gt; 100$ PeV) and neutrinos. Employing cost-effective antennas distributed across vast areas, GRAND is optimized to observe the rare flux of ultra-high-energy particles with high precision. The GRANDProto300 (GP300) pathfinder array, currently under deployment, targets the $10^{16.5} - 10^{18}$ eV range and is anticipated to achieve approximately 15\% energy resolution and 20g/cm$^2$ $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ precision. This level of precision enables accurate measurements of the fine structure of the energy spectrum, mean logarithmic mass ($\langle \ln A \rangle$), and proton flux within this range. After five years of data collection, the sensitivity for detecting anisotropy could reach $5 \times 10^{-3}$ for energies below $10^{17.1}$ eV. With its substantially larger effective area, GRAND extends these capabilities to the highest energies ($\sim 10^{20}$ eV), offering enhanced statistics and sensitivity for spectral, composition, and anisotropy measurements within one year for UHECRs.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning is often viewed as a black box when it comes to understanding its output, be it a decision or a score. Automatic anomaly detection is no exception to this rule, and quite often the astronomer is left to independently analyze the data in order to understand why a given event is tagged as an anomaly. We introduce here idea of anomaly signature, whose aim is to help the interpretability of anomalies by highlighting which features contributed to the decision.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Telescope Event Classification on Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers represent a new computational paradigm with steadily improving hardware capabilities. In this article, we present the first study exploring how current quantum computers can be used to classify different neutrino event types observed in neutrino telescopes. We investigate two quantum machine learning approaches, Neural Projected Quantum Kernels (NPQKs) and Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs), and find that both achieve classification performance comparable to classical machine learning methods across a wide energy range. By introducing a moment-of-inertia-based encoding scheme and a novel preprocessing approach, we enable efficient and scalable learning with large neutrino astronomy datasets. Tested on both simulators and the IBM Strasbourg quantum processor, the NPQK achieves a testing accuracy near 80 percent, with robust results above 1 TeV and close agreement between simulation and hardware performance. A simulated QCNN achieves approximately a 70 percent accuracy over the same energy range. These results underscore the promise of quantum machine learning for neutrino astronomy, paving the way for future advances as quantum hardware matures.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Classification through Vision Transformers with Temporal Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification of exoplanets has been a longstanding challenge in astronomy, requiring significant computational and observational resources. Traditional methods demand substantial effort, time, and cost, highlighting the need for advanced machine learning techniques to enhance classification efficiency. In this study, we propose a methodology that transforms raw light curve data from NASA's Kepler mission into Gramian Angular Fields (GAFs) and Recurrence Plots (RPs) using the Gramian Angular Difference Field and recurrence plot techniques. These transformed images serve as inputs to the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, leveraging its ability to capture intricate temporal dependencies. We assess the performance of the model through recall, precision, and F1 score metrics, using a 5-fold cross-validation approach to obtain a robust estimate of the model's performance and reduce evaluation bias. Our comparative analysis reveals that RPs outperform GAFs, with the ViT model achieving an 89.46$\%$ recall and an 85.09$\%$ precision rate, demonstrating its significant capability in accurately identifying exoplanetary transits. Despite using under-sampling techniques to address class imbalance, dataset size reduction remains a limitation. This study underscores the importance of further research into optimizing model architectures to enhance automation, performance, and generalization of the model.</description>

      <title>Transformers for Stratified Spectropolarimetric Inversion: Proof of Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar spectropolarimetric inversion -- inferring atmospheric conditions from the Stokes vector -- is a key diagnostic tool for understanding solar magnetism, but traditional inversion methods are computationally expensive and sensitive to local minima. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer faster solutions, but are often restricted to shallow models or a few spectral lines. We present a proof-of-concept study using a transformer machine learning (ML) model for multi-line, full-Stokes inversion, to infer stratified parameters from synthetic spectra produced from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We synthesise a large set of Stokes vectors using forward modelling across 15 spectral lines spanning the deep photosphere towards the chromosphere. The model maps full-Stokes input to temperature, magnetic field strength, inclination, azimuth (encoded as $\sin2\phi$, $\cos2\phi$), and line-of-sight velocity as a function of optical depth. The transformer incorporates an attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on the most informative regions of the spectrum for each inferred parameter, and uses positional embedding to encode wavelength and depth order. We benchmark it against a multilayer perceptron (MLP), test robustness to noise, and assess generalisation. The transformer outperforms the MLP, especially in the higher layers and for magnetic parameters, yielding higher correlations and more regularised stratifications. The model retains strong performance across a range of noise levels typical for real observations, with magnetic parameter inference degrading predictably while temperature and velocity remain stable. We establish transformer architectures as a powerful tool for spectropolarimetric regression. This approach paves the way for analysis of large datasets from large solar telescopes.</description>

Abstract: The Magellanic Clouds are two nearby dwarf irregular galaxies whose study can help us in understanding galaxy and stellar evolution. In particular, the Large Magellanic Cloud, the larger one, contains approximately 30 billion stars at various evolutionary stages. In this work, we present an SDSS $gri$-bands photometric analysis based on multiple images acquired with DECam, the Dark Energy Camera, installed on the Blanco telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (Chile). We performed a full image analysis and photometric calibration, resulting in a photometric catalog named COSMIC-L, consisting of 57,997,665 stars, of which 18,676,294 contain estimates for all three $gri$ magnitudes, resulting in a completeness magnitude of $\simeq 21$ and a limiting magnitude of $\simeq 22$ in all three bands.</description>

      <title>Search for the in-situ production of $^{77}$Ge in the GERDA neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The beta decay of $^{77}$Ge and $^{77\mathrm{m}}$Ge, both produced by neutron capture on $^{76}$Ge, is a potential background for Germanium based neutrinoless double-beta decay search experiments such as GERDA or the LEGEND experiment. In this work we present a search for $^{77}$Ge decays in the full GERDA Phase II data set. A delayed coincidence method was employed to identify the decay of $^{77}$Ge via the isomeric state of $^{77}$As (9/2$^+$, 475 keV, ${T_{1/2} = 114}\,\mu $s, $^{77\mathrm{m}}$As). New digital signal processing methods were employed to select and analyze pile-up signals. No signal was observed, and an upper limit on the production rate of was set at $&lt;0.216$ nuc/(kg$\cdot$yr) (90% CL). This corresponds to a total production rate of $^{77}$Ge and $^{77\mathrm{m}}$Ge of $&lt;0.38$ nuc/(kg$\cdot$ yr) (90% CL), assuming equal production rates. A previous Monte Carlo study predicted a value for in-situ $^{77}$Ge and $^{77\mathrm{m}}$Ge production of (0.21$\pm$0.07) nuc/(kg$\cdot$yr), a prediction that is now further corroborated by our experimental limit. Moreover, tagging the isomeric state of $^{77\mathrm{m}}$As can be utilised to further suppress the $^{77}$Ge background. Considering the similar experimental configurations of LEGEND-1000 and GERDA, the cosmogenic background in LEGEND-1000 at LNGS is estimated to remain at a sub-dominant level.</description>

      <title>Chorus: Optimizing Synchrotron Transfer Coefficients with Weighted Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate synchrotron transfer coefficients are essential for modeling radiation processes in astrophysics. However, their current calculation methods face significant challenges. Analytical approximations of the synchrotron emissivity, absorptivity, and rotativity are limited to a few simple electron distribution functions that inadequately capture the complexity of cosmic plasmas. Numerical integrations of the transfer coefficients, on the other hand, are accurate but computationally prohibitive for large-scale simulations. In this paper, we present a new numerical method, Chorus, which evaluates the transfer coefficients by expressing any electron distribution function as a weighted sum of functions with known analytical formulas. Specifically, the Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution function is employed as the basic component in the weighted sum. The Chorus leverages the additivity of transfer coefficients, drawing inspiration from an analogous approach that uses stochastic averaging to approximate the $\kappa$ distribution function. The key findings demonstrate median errors below $5\%$ for emissivity and absorptivity, with run times reduced from hours to milliseconds compared to first-principles numerical integrations. Validation against a single $\kappa$ distribution, as well as its extension to more complex distributions, confirms the robustness and versatility of the method. However, limitations are found, including increased errors at higher energies due to numerical precision constraints and challenges with rotativity calculations arising from fit function inaccuracies. Addressing these issues could further enhance the method's reliability. Our method has the potential to provide a powerful tool for radiative transfer simulations, where synchrotron emission is the main radiative process.</description>

      <title>Exoplaneteers Keep Calling Plots "Allan Variance" Plots When They Aren't</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I highlight that there is a substantial number of papers (at least 11 published since 2024) which all refer to a specific type of plot as an "Allan variance" plot, when in fact they seem to be plotting the standard deviation of the residuals versus bin size. The Allan variance quantifies the stability of a time series by calculating the average squared difference between successive time-averaged segments over a specified interval; it is not equivalent to the standard deviation. This misattribution seems particularly prolific in the exoplanet transit spectroscopy community. However, I emphasize that it does not impact the scientific analyses presented in those works. I discuss where this confusion seems to stem from and encourage the community to ensure statistical measures are named correctly to avoid confusion.</description>

      <title>Exoplaneteers Keep Overestimating Sigma Significances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astronomers, and in particular exoplaneteers, have a curious habit of expressing Bayes factors as frequentist sigma values. This is of course completely unnecessary and arguably rather ill-advised. Regardless, the practice is common - especially in the detection claims of chemical species within exoplanet atmospheres. The current canonical conversion strategy stems from a statistics paper from Sellke et al. (2001), who derived an upper bound on the Bayes factor between the test and null hypotheses, as a function of the $p$-value (or number of sigmas, $n_{\sigma}$). A common practice within the exoplanet atmosphere community is to numerically invert this formula, going from a Bayes factor to $n_\sigma$. This goes back to Benneke &amp; Seager (2013) -- a highly cited paper that introduced Bayesian model comparison as a means of inferring the presence of specific chemical species -- in an attempt to calibrate the Bayes factors from their technique for a community that in 2013 was more familiar with frequentist sigma significances. However, as originally noted by Sellke et al. (2001), the conversion only provides an upper limit on $n_\sigma$, with the true value generally being lower. This can result in inflations of claimed detection significances, and this note strongly urges the community to stop converting to $n_\sigma$ at all and simply stick with Bayes factors.</description>

      <title>Gaseous Dynamical Friction: a Numerical Study of Extended Perturbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.15848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of momentum and energy transfer between a massive body and a background medium it is moving through is known as dynamical friction (DF). It is key to our understanding of many astrophysical systems. We present a series of high-resolution simulations of gaseous DF using Lagrangian meshless finite mass hydrodynamics solver, the moving-mesh MUSCL scheme, and the piecewise parabolic method (PPM) solver. We use a set of simulations of massive bodies, modelled as Plummer spheres, moving with Mach $0.2 \leq \mathcal{M} \leq 3$. We investigate at which radial distances from the perturber these solvers recover the linear point mass solution for gaseous DF. We analyse the drag force and the structure and time evolution of the wake. The different solvers agree closely. Numerical convergence is reached when the initial spatial resolution is $0.2r_s$, where $r_s$ is the softening scale of the Plummer sphere. We find that the wake structure and drag force are recovered, at the $5\%$ level, when compared beyond $4r_\mathrm{s}$. Our results predict that models using the standard linear point mass DF solution will overestimate the drag force on extended perturbers by as much as 25\%, for Mach$\sim$1. Finally, we consider DF in the context of galaxy clusters, where dark matter subhaloes move through circumgalactic media. We show that DF is typically in the linear regime for most subhaloes in hosting haloes $&lt;10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ but non-linear in more massive host haloes.</description>

      <title>Towards multi-messenger observations of core-collapse supernovae harbouring choked jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Choked jets (CJ) have attracted particular attention as potential sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos. Testing this hypothesis is challenging because of the missing gamma-ray counterpart, hence the identification of other electromagnetic (EM) signatures is crucial. A CJ source is expected harbouring in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with extended H envelopes, releasing ultraviolet (UV) and optical emission for a few days. The UV band will be visible with an unprecedentedly large field of view by the future satellite ULTRASAT, for which we investigate the detection prospects in relation to the CJ visibility in the optical band with the currently operating telescope ZTF. ULTRASAT will be able to double the volume of sky currently visible by ZTF for the same emitting sources (sample of observed Type II SNe enlarged by 50%). As these sources can produce neutrinos via hadronic/photohadronic interactions in CJ, we investigate how neutrino observations by existing Cherenkov high-energy neutrino telescopes (IceCube and KM3NeT) can be used in association with EM signals coming from shock breakout (SBO) events. For optimized multimessenger detections, the delay between neutrino produced at SBO (during the jet propagation inside the stellar envelope) and ULTRASAT observations should be of around 4(5) days, with a follow-up by instruments like ZTF about one week after. We estimate that at most ~20% of the CCSNe from red supergiant stars detectable with ULTRASAT might host a CJ and release TeV neutrinos. EM and neutrino detections, if accompanied by photometric and spectroscopic follow-up with evidence for a relativistic jet launched by the central engine, would suggest CCSNe harbouring choked jets as main contributors to the cosmic diffuse neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>Exploring the evolution of gravitational-wave emitters with efficient emulation: Constraining the origins of binary black holes using normalising flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary population synthesis simulations allow detailed modelling of gravitational-wave sources from a variety of formation channels. These population models can be compared to the observed catalogue of merging binaries to infer the uncertain astrophysical input parameters describing binary formation and evolution, as well as relative rates between various formation pathways. However, it is computationally infeasible to run population synthesis simulations for all variations of uncertain input physics. We demonstrate the use of normalising flows to emulate population synthesis results and interpolate between astrophysical input parameters. Using current gravitational-wave observations of binary black holes, we use our trained normalising flows to infer branching ratios between multiple formation channels, and simultaneously infer common-envelope efficiency and natal spins across a continuous parameter range. Given our set of formation channel models, we infer the natal spin to be $0.04^{+0.04}_{-0.01}$, and the common-envelope efficiency to be $&gt;3.7$ at 90% credibility, with the majority of underlying mergers coming from the common-envelope channel. Our framework allows us to measure population synthesis inputs where we do not have simulations, and better constrain the astrophysics underlying current gravitational-wave populations.</description>

      <title>An Early Look at the Performance of IGRINS-2 at Gemini-North with Application to the ultrahot Jupiter, WASP-33 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy enables precise molecular detections and velocity-resolved atmospheric dynamics, offering a distinct advantage over low-resolution methods for exoplanetary atmospheric studies. IGRINS-2, the successor to IGRINS, features improved throughput and enhanced sensitivity to carbon monoxide by shifting its $\textit{K}$-band coverage by 36 nm to longer wavelengths. IGRINS is a near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph mounted at McDonald, Lowell, and Gemini-South observatories. Our order-drop test shows this added range improves the CO cross-correlation signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by 2$-$3%, confirming a measurable but modest sensitivity gain. To evaluate its performance, we attempt to investigate the atmospheric characteristics of WASP-33 b. Observations were conducted on 2024 January 7 for a total of 2.43 hours; This includes 1.46 hours in the pre-eclipse phase to capture the planet's thermal emission spectrum. We successfully detect clear cross-correlation signals from molecular species in the dayside atmosphere of WASP-33 b with a combined SNR of 7.4. More specifically, we capture CO, H$_{2}$O, and OH with SNRs of 6.3, 4.7, and 4.2, respectively. These results are consistent with previous studies and demonstrate that IGRINS-2 is well-suited for detailed investigation of exoplanetary atmospheres. We anticipate that future observations with IGRINS-2 will further advance our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enabled optical large-baseline interferometry: applications, protocols and feasibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) offers the potential for unprecedented angular resolution in both astronomical imaging and precision measurements. Classical approaches, however, face significant limitations due to photon loss, background noise, and the requirements for dynamical delay lines over large distances. This document surveys recent developments in quantum-enabled VLBI, which aim to address these challenges using entanglement-assisted protocols, quantum memory storage, and nonlocal measurement techniques. While its application to astronomy is well known, we also examine how these techniques may be extended to geodesy -- specifically, the monitoring of Earth's rotation. Particular attention is given to quantum-enhanced telescope architectures, including repeater-based long baseline interferometry and quantum error-corrected encoding schemes, which offer a pathway toward high-fidelity optical VLBI. To aid the discussion, we also compare specifications for key enabling technologies to current state-of-the-art experimental components, including switching rates, gate times, entanglement distribution rates, and memory lifetimes. By integrating quantum technologies, future interferometric networks may achieve diffraction-limited imaging at optical and near-infrared wavelengths, surpassing the constraints of classical techniques and enabling new precision tests of astrophysical and fundamental physics phenomena.</description>

      <title>Applying TDI to Hardware-Simulated Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many years of development have gone into producing instruments that meet the required noise performance of the LISA interferometric detection system. Concurrently, software simulations have been used to extensively develop the data analysis libraries to be used in the LISA pipeline, not least among which are the Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) algorithms. To bridge the gap between these two, we are developing a hardware-in-the-loop testbed to apply realistic, time-varying delays to signals traveling between phasemeters. We have shown that the testbed adds a sufficiently low amount of noise across the entire relevant LISA spectrum. We have also injected a realistic gravitational wave signal, generated via the LISA Data Challenge codebase, and successfully extracted it using TDI to remove the obscuring frequency noise of the carrier signal. Future efforts will expand the testbed to create a representative simulation of the entire LISA constellation, with an eye towards its use as a tool to aid in the development of the LISA data analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>Study of Venera Spacecraft Trajectories and Wider Implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Historically, there is no doubt that the early years of the USSR space program put them way ahead of the competition (the USA). Nonetheless, although this was not what the Russians wished to present to the world, the interplanetary campaign, centred around missions to the planet Venus (the Venera program) was also beset with difficulties. Many of the early Venera probes failed, despite making it to a heliocentric orbit, but naturally the success rate improved with time. The result is that there are now many Venera probes in heliocentric orbits, either completely intact, or the main bus after a successful deployment of the lander; together with the associated Blok-L upper stages. This paper is a response to some previous quite contentious research proposing that a certain member of a new class of objects, designated $2005\ VL_1$ may in fact be the Venera-2 probe. In this paper we look into the invariance of the Earth Tisserand parameter in an attempt to establish if there are indeed any members of this class which could be Venera probes. It is found, with extremely small probability, that compared to a sample of randomly chosen NEOs, members of the class of Dark Comet have an Earth Tisserand unusually close to 3, a property shared by the Venera missions. Furthermore there are particular associations of 3 Dark Comets with 3 of these probes, the most significant being $2010\ VL_{65}$ with the Venera-12 mission</description>

      <title>Enhancing Taiji's Parameter Estimation under Non-Stationarity: a Time-Frequency Domain Framework for Galactic Binaries and Instrumental Noises</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The data analysis of space-based gravitational wave detectors like Taiji faces significant challenges from non-stationary noise, which compromises the efficacy of traditional frequency-domain analysis. This work proposes a unified framework based on short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to enhance parameter estimation of Galactic binary and characterization of instrumental noise under non-stationarity. Segmenting data into locally stationary intervals, we derive STFT-based models for signals and noises, and implement Bayesian inference via the extended Whittle likelihood. Validated through the analysis of verification Galactic binaries and instrumental noises, our STFT approach outperforms frequency-domain methods by reducing the uncertainty and bias of estimation, successfully recovering low signal-to-noise ratio signals missed by frequency-domain analysis, and mitigating the degeneracy among noise parameters. The framework's robustness against noise drifts and computational efficiency highlight its potential for integration into future global analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary models for the Very Massive Stars in the R136 cluster of 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cluster R136 in the LMC contains a population of stars in excess of 100 M$_\odot$, including R136a1, the most massive star known. Very Massive Stars (VMSs) play an influential role in feedback processes and may potentially produce exotic supernova types and black holes of tens of solar masses. The evolutionary history and final fate of the three most luminous stars, R136a1, R136a2, and R136a3, has been a puzzling issue. We aim to resolve this by rotating single-star MESA models. We produce interpolated model grids and apply a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis to compare our models with observations. The nature of supernova progenitors strongly depends on mass loss and the AM coupling schemes. We predict no pair-instability and no GRB progenitors from our fiducial model grid at LMC metallicity. The onset of Wolf-Rayet-type mass-loss rates on the main sequence leads to a rapid decrease in stellar mass and luminosity. The mass turnover implies that the evolutionary history can only be inferred if additional constraints are available. We utilise the surface helium abundance, which poses a conundrum: R136a1, the most luminous star, is less enriched in helium than R136a2 and R136a3. We propose that this can be explained if both R136a2 and R136a3 were initially more massive than R136a1. From a rigorous confrontation of our models to spectroscopically-derived observables, we estimate an initial mass of 346$\pm41$ M$_\odot$ for R136a1, and $\gtrsim$500 M$_\odot$ for R136a2 and R136a3. Even though VMSs are only present in the youngest clusters below 2 Myr of age, our study strengthens their role in local and galaxy evolution. At LMC metallicity, they will be observable as helium-enriched massive stars after their drastic mass loss, produced via single-star evolution. If the core collapse leads to a supernova, it will be of Type Ib/c. [abridged]</description>
