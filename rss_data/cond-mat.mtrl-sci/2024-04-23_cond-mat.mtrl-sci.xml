      <title>Cation exchange synthesis of AgBiS$_2$ quantum dots for highly efficient solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silver bismuth sulfide (AgBiS$_2$) nanocrystals have emerged as a promising eco-friendly, low-cost solar cell absorber material. Their direct synthesis often relies on the hot-injection method, requiring the application of high temperatures and vacuum for prolonged times. Here, we demonstrate an alternative synthetic approach via a cation exchange reaction. In the first-step, bis(stearoyl)sulfide is used as an air-stable sulfur precursor for the synthesis of small, monodisperse Ag2S nanocrystals at room-temperature. In a second step, bismuth cations are incorporated into the nanocrystal lattice to form ternary AgBiS$_2$ nanocrystals, without altering their size and shape. When implemented into photovoltaic devices, AgBiS$_2$ nanocrystals obtained by cation exchange reach power conversion efficiencies of up to 7.35%, demonstrating the efficacy of the new synthetic approach for the formation of high-quality, ternary semiconducting nanocrystals.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric modulation of quantum emitters in monolayer WS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum photonics promises significant advances in secure communications, metrology, sensing and information processing/computation. Single photon sources are fundamental to this endeavor. However, the lack of high quality single photon sources remains a significant obstacle. We present here a new paradigm for the control of single photon emitters (SPEs) and single photon purity by integrating monolayer WS$_2$ with the organic ferroelectric polymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)). We demonstrate that the ferroelectric domains in the P(VDF-TrFE) film control the purity of single photon emission from the adjacent WS$_2$. By switching the ferroelectric polarization, we reversibly tune the single photon purity between the semi-classical and quantum light regimes, with single photon purities as high as 94%. This provides another avenue for modulating and encoding quantum photonic information, complementing more complex approaches. This novel multidimensional heterostructure introduces a new avenue for control of quantum emitters by combining the nonvolatile ferroic properties of a ferroelectric with the radiative properties of the zero-dimensional atomic scale emitters embedded in the two-dimensional WS$_2$ semiconductor monolayer.</description>

      <title>Effect of biquadratic magnetic exchange interaction in the 2D antiferromagnets MPS_3 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials MPS_3(M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) display antiferromagnetic ordering of the magnetic moments at the transition metal ions. The possibility to exfoliate thin layers that preserve the magnetic order makes these materials interesting for numerous applications in devices that require integration of flexible patches of magnetic materials, e.g. in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Hence, an improved understanding of their magnetic properties is desirable. Here, we parameterize spin Hamiltonians for a monolayer of all four materials of this class using density functional theory plus Hubbard U calculations. We provide a step-by-step guide for calculating the magnetic exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropy energy using the (non-)collinear DFT+U(+ SOC) approach with a suitably chosen U for each material. It is found that the biquadratic interactions gain in importance while moving through the 3d series. Retaining the leading terms of a Holstein-Primakoff-transformed spin Hamiltonian, the magnon spectra are calculated. While MnPS_3 is found to be an almost isotropic antiferromagnet with a tiny gap, the biquadratic interaction opens an increasingly wider gap for FePS_3, CoPS_3 and NiPS_3. In line with this observation, Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the biquadratic interactions contribute to a systematic rise in the Neel temperature from FePS_3 to NiPS_3.</description>

      <title>Fermiology and transport properties of the proposed topological crystalline insulator SrAg4Sb2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to time-reversal symmetry-protected Z2 topological insulators and Dirac/Weyl semimetals, there are significantly fewer candidates for topological crystalline insulators. SrAg4Sb2 is predicted to exhibit topological crystalline insulator behavior when considering spin-orbit coupling. In this study, we systematically investigate single crystals of SrAg4Sb2 using electrical transport and magnetic torque measurements, along with first-principles calculations. Our transport data reveals its compensated semimetal nature with a magnetoresistance up to around 700% at 2 K and 9 T. Analysis of de Haas-van Alphen oscillations uncovers a Fermi surface consisting of three distinct Fermi pockets with light effective masses. Comparison between the three-dimensional fermiology obtained from our oscillation data and the first-principles calculations demonstrates excellent agreement. This confirms the accuracy of the calculations, which indicate a band inversion centered at the {\Gamma} point and identify the existence of nontrivial tube and needle hole Fermi pockets at {\Gamma}, alongside one trivial diamond electron pocket at the T point in the Brillouin zone. Furthermore, symmetry and topology analysis results in two potential sets of topological invariants, suggesting the emergence of two-dimensional gapless Dirac surface states either on the ab planes or on both the ab planes and mirror planes, protected by crystal symmetries. Therefore, SrAg4Sb2 emerges as a promising candidate topological crystalline insulator.</description>

      <title>Control of a ferrimagnet phase by a two-component magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a theoretical study of the phase diagram of a ferrimagnetic iron-garnet with uniaxial anisotropy near a magnetization compensation point in the presence of a two-component magnetic field. The study is performed based on a quasi-antiferromagnetic approximation. The number and stability of the equilibrium states of the Neel vector are analyzed using the effective energy function. It is shown that application of the small out-of-plane magnetic field in addition to the stronger in-plane magnetic field significantly changes the equilibrium states of a ferrimagnet. The possibilities to control the equilibrium Neel vector position and to switch between the monostable and bistable states by tuning the value and ratio of the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic field components are demonstrated. This opens new possibilities for the utilization of ferrimagnets since the magnetic field could be changed much faster than the temperature.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Nanodomains Dictate Macroscopic Properties in Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical A-site cation substitution has advanced the stability and efficiency of hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites solar cells and the functionality of X-ray detectors. Yet, the fundamental mechanisms underpinning their unique performance remain elusive. This multi-modal study unveils the link between nanoscale structural dynamics and macroscopic optoelectronic properties in these materials by utilising X-ray diffuse scattering, inelastic neutron spectroscopy and optical microscopy complemented by state-of-the-art machine learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach uncovers the presence of dynamic, lower-symmetry local nanodomains embedded within the higher-symmetry average phase in various perovskite compositions. The properties of these nanodomains are tunable via the A-site cation selection: methylammonium induces a high density of anisotropic, planar nanodomains of out-of-phase octahedral tilts, while formamidinium favours sparsely distributed isotropic, spherical nanodomains with in-phase tilting, even when crystallography reveals cubic symmetry on average. The observed variations in the properties of dynamic nanodomains are in agreement with our simulations and are directly linked to the differing macroscopic optoelectronic and ferroelastic behaviours of these compositions. By demonstrating the influence of A-site cation on local nanodomains and consequently, on macroscopic properties, we propose leveraging this relationship to engineer the optoelectronic response of these materials, propelling further advancements in perovskite-based photovoltaics, optoelectronics, and X-ray imaging.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning of Individual Kohn-Sham States: Interpretable Representations and Consequences for Downstream Predictions of Many-Body Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representation learning for the electronic structure problem is a major challenge of machine learning in computational condensed matter and materials physics. Within quantum mechanical first principles approaches, Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is the preeminent tool for understanding electronic structure, and the high-dimensional wavefunctions calculated in this approach serve as the building block for downstream calculations of correlated many-body excitations and related physical observables. Here, we use variational autoencoders (VAE) for the unsupervised learning of high-dimensional DFT wavefunctions and show that these wavefunctions lie in a low-dimensional manifold within the latent space. Our model autonomously determines the optimal representation of the electronic structure, avoiding limitations due to manual feature engineering and selection in prior work. To demonstrate the utility of the latent space representation of the DFT wavefunction, we use it for the supervised training of neural networks (NN) for downstream prediction of the quasiparticle bandstructures within the GW formalism, which includes many-electron correlations beyond DFT. The GW prediction achieves a low error of 0.11 eV for a combined test set of metals and semiconductors drawn from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), suggesting that latent space representation captures key physical information from the original data. Finally, we explore the interpretability of the VAE representation and show that the successful representation learning and downstream prediction by our model is derived from the smoothness of the VAE latent space, which also enables the generation of wavefunctions on arbitrary points in latent space. Our work provides a novel and general machine-learning framework for investigating electronic structure and many-body physics.</description>

      <title>A figure-of-merit-based framework to evaluate photovoltaic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I propose a general quantitative framework to evaluate the quality, track the historical development, and guide future optimization of photovoltaic (PV) absorbers at any development level, including both experimentally synthesized and computer-simulated materials. The framework is based on a PV figure of merit designed to include efficiency limitations due to imperfect photocarrier collection that are not included in classic detailed balance methods. Figure-of-merit-driven efficiency limits including collection losses are calculated for 28 experimentally synthesized PV absorbers and 9 PV absorbers simulated by electronic structure methods. Among emerging absorbers for which no working solar cells have yet been reported, there are very large differences in their likelihood to achieve high PV efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Unveiling dynamic bifurcation of Resch-patterned origami for self-adaptive impact mitigation structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the classic realm of impact mitigation, targeting different impact scenarios with a universally designed device still remains an unassailable challenge. In this study, we delve into the untapped potential of Resch-patterned origami for impact mitigation, specifically considering the adaptively reconfigurable nature of the Resch origami structure. Our unit-cell-level analyses reveal two distinctive modes of deformation, each characterized by contrasting mechanical responses: the folding mode that displays monostability coupled with strain-hardening, and the unfolding mode that manifests bistability, facilitating energy absorption through snap-through dynamics. Drop tests further unveil a novel dynamic bifurcation phenomenon, where the origami switches between folding and unfolding depending on impact speed, thereby showcasing its innate self-reconfigurability in a wide range of dynamic events. The tessellated meter-scale Resch structure mimicking an automotive bumper inherits this dynamically bifurcating behavior, demonstrating the instantaneous morphing into favorable deformation mode to minimize the peak acceleration upon impact. This suggests a self-adaptive and universally applicable impact-absorbing nature of the Resch-patterned origami system. We believe that our findings pave the way for developing smart, origami-inspired impact mitigation devices capable of real-time response and adaptation to external stimuli, offering insights into designing universally protective structures with enhanced performance in response to various impact scenarios.</description>

      <title>Strong exciton-polariton correlations shape the many-body polariton dynamics in two-dimensional metal halide semiconductor microcavities: Competitive pathways for polariton condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polariton condensation relies on the massive occupation of the lowest-energy polariton state beyond a required critical density. The mechanisms driving both the occupation and depopulation of the lowest-energy polariton state all rely on multi-particle scattering, and its dynamics determine the extent to which condensates can form spontaneously. To pinpoint many-body processes hindering polariton condensation in two-dimensional metal-halide semiconductors, we examine the exciton-polariton dynamics in a Fabry-P\'erot microcavity over timescales involving the dynamics of multi-particle polariton ($\ll 1$\,ps) and exciton scattering processes ($\gg 1$\,ps). We find evidence of enhanced nonlinear exciton-exciton scattering in the microcavity compared to that in the semiconductor, and that the exciton reservoir mediates polariton scattering. We posit that the complex scattering landscape between the exciton reservoir and polaritons limits the formation of polariton condensates in two-dimensional metal-halide semiconductors, and we discuss the generality of our conclusions for materials systems in which the lattice mediates strong multi-particle correlations.</description>

      <title>2D Monolayer Molybdenum (IV) Telluride TMD: An Efficient Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An electrocatalyst is needed to efficiently lower the reaction barriers to produce hydrogen through the H2 evolution reaction (HER). Recently, two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs), such as the pure 2D monolayer MoTe2 TMD, have become attractive materials for HER. Using the first principle-based hybrid DFT-D method, we have computationally designed a pure 2D monolayer MoTe2 TMD and examined its structural and electronic properties and electrocatalytic efficacy towards HER. A non-periodic finite molecular cluster model Mo10Te21 system was employed to explore the feasibility of both the Volmer-Heyrovsky and Volmer-Tafel reaction mechanisms for the HER. The solvent-phase calculations of the HER on the 2D monolayer MoTe2 TMD demonstrate that this material can effectively undergo either Volmer-Heyrovsky or Volmer-Tafel reaction pathways. This conclusion is supported by our determination of low reaction barriers for the H*-migration, Heyrovsky, and Tafel transition states (TSs), which were found to be approximately 9.80, 12.55, and 5.29 kcal.mol-1, respectively. These results highlight the potential utility of MoTe2 TMD as a promising electrocatalyst for HER. The unusual electrocatalytic activity of the pure 2D monolayer MoTe2 TMD is evidenced by its ability to significantly reduce reaction barriers, achieving impressive turnover frequency during the Heyrovsky and Tafel reaction steps, respectively. Additionally, it demonstrates a remarkably low Tafel slope of 29.58 mV.dec-1. Further exploration of its potential applications in electrocatalysis is warranted. The present work provides valuable insights into the atomic modulation of active sites for enhanced electrocatalytic performance towards HER, paving a way for designing advanced non-noble metal free electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast nanocomposite scintillators based on Cd-enhanced CsPbCl3 nanocrystals in polymer matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP-NCs) embedded in polymer matrices are gaining traction for next-generation radiation detectors. While progress has been made on green-emitting CsPbBr3 NCs, scant attention has been given to the scintillation properties of CsPbCl3 NCs, which emit size-tunable UV-blue light matching the peak efficiency of ultrafast photodetectors. In this study, we explore the scintillation characteristics of CsPbCl3 NCs produced through a scalable method and treated with CdCl2. Spectroscopic, radiometric and theoretical analysis on both untreated and treated NCs uncover deep hole trap states due to surface undercoordinated chloride ions, eliminated by Pb to Cd substitution. This yields near-perfect efficiency and resistance to polyacrylate mass-polymerization. Radiation hardness tests demonstrate stability to high gamma doses while time-resolved experiments reveal ultrafast radioluminescence with an average lifetime as short as 210 ps. These findings enhance our comprehension of LHP NCs' scintillation properties, positioning CsPbCl3 as a promising alternative to conventional fast scintillators.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced Spin Centers in Photocatalytic Metal-Organic Framework UiO-66</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for the advanced photocatalytic active materials. These porous crystalline compounds have large active surface area and structural tunability, highly competitive with oxides, the well-established material class for the photocatalysis. However, due to their complex organic and coordination chemistry composition, photophysical mechanisms involved in the photocatalytic process in MOFs are still not well understood. Employing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, we investigate the fundamental processes of electron and hole generation, as well as capture events that lead to the formation of various radical species in UiO-66, an archetypical MOF photocatalyst. As a result, we detected a manifold of photoinduced electron spin centers, which we subsequently analyzed and identified with the help of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our findings provide new insights into the photo-induced charge transfer processes, which are the basis of photocatalytic activity in UiO-66. This sets the stage for further studies on photogenerated spin centers in this and similar MOF materials.</description>

Abstract: Although the principal physical behaviour of a material is inherently connected to its fundamental crystal structure, the behaviours observed in the real-world are often driven by the microstructure, which for many polycrystalline materials, equates to the size and shape of the constituent crystal grains. Here we highlight a cutting edge synthesis route to the controlled engineering of grain structures in thin films and the simplification of associated 3-dimensional problems to less complex 2D ones. This has been applied to the actinide ceramic, uranium dioxide, to replicate structures typical in nuclear fission fuel pellets, in order to investigate the oxidation and subsequent transformation of cubic UO$_{2}$ to orthorhombic U$_{3}$O$_{8}$. This article shows how this synthesis approach could be utilised to investigate a range of phenomena, affected by grain morphology, and highlights some unusual results in the oxidation behaviour of UO$_{2}$, regarding the phase transition to U$_{3}$O$_{8}$.</description>

      <title>A detailed first-principles study of the structural, elastic, thermomechanical and optoelectronic properties of binary rare-earth tritelluride NdTe3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth tritellurides (RTe3) are popular for their charge density wave (CDW) phase, magnetotransport properties and pressure induced superconducting state among other features. In this literature, Density functional theory has been exploited to study various properties of NdTe3. The calculated elastic and thermomechanical parameters, which were hitherto untouched for any RTe3, uncover soft, ductile, highly machinable and damage tolerant characteristics, as well as highly anisotropic mechanical behavior of this layered compound. Its thermomechanical properties make it a prospective thermal barrier coating material. Band structure, density of states, Fermi surfaces and various optical functions of the material have been reported. The band structure demonstrates highly directional metallic nature. The highly dispersive bands indicate very low effective charge carrier mass for the in-plane directions. The Fermi surfaces display symmetric pockets, including signs of nesting, bilayer splitting among others, corroborating previous works. The optical spectra expose high reflectivity across the visible region, while absorption is high in the ultraviolet region. Two plasma frequencies are noticed in the optical loss function. The optical conductivity, reflectivity and absorption reaffirm its metallic properties. The electronic band structure manifests evidence of CDW phase in the ground state.</description>

      <title>Single-Spin Waved-Brim Flat-Top Hat in the Band Edge of GdIH Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exotic electronic bands, such as flat bands, linear crossing bands, spontaneously valley- or spin-polarized bands, in two-dimensional materials have been the hot topics in condensed matter physics. Herein, we first propose a general dispersion model for possible hat-like electronic bands, and then identify an intriguing single-spin \emph{waved-brim flat-top hat} in the valence band edge of a stable ferromagnetic semiconducting electrene (i.e., Janus GdIH monolayer), which can be well described by a simplified two-bands Hamiltonian model. Specifically, the hat-band has a waved brim with six valleys along the boundary of the first Brillouin zone; meanwhile it holds a flat top close to the Fermi level, resulting in the emergence of single-spin van Hove singularities divergence and Lifshitz transitions. Owing to the breaking of both time-reversal and space inversion symmetries, a sizable spontaneous valley polarization is formed between the adjacent brim valleys, which provides the opportunity to realize the high-temperature anomalous valley Hall effect. Particularly, via modest strains and carriers doping, various conductive bipolar-states (spin-up vs. spin-down, K valley vs. $-$K valley, and ultra-low-speed vs. ultra-high-speed) can be modulated out from the distorted waved-brim flat-top hat of GdIH ML.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rashba spin-orbit coupling effect, primarily arising from structural-inversion asymmetry in periodic crystals, has garnered considerable attention due to its tunability and potential applications in spintronics. Its capability to manipulate electron spin without an external magnetic field opens new avenues for spintronic device design, particularly in semiconductor technology. Within this framework, 2D Rashba materials hold special interest due to their inherent characteristics, which facilitate miniaturization and engineering capabilities. In this Perspective article, we provide an overview of recent advancements in the research of 2D Rashba materials, aiming to offer a comprehensive understanding of the diverse manifestations and multifaceted implications of the Rashba effect in material science. Rather than merely presenting a list of materials, our approach involves synthesizing various viewpoints, assessing current trends, and addressing challenges within the field. Our objective is to bridge the gap between fundamental research and practical applications by correlating each material with the necessary advancements required to translate theoretical concepts into tangible technologies. Furthermore, we highlight promising avenues for future research and development, drawing from insights gleaned from the current state of the field.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the crystallization kinetics in Ge-rich Ge$_x$Te alloys by large scale simulations with a machine-learned interatomic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A machine-learned interatomic potential for Ge-rich Ge$_x$Te alloys has been developed aiming at uncovering the kinetics of phase separation and crystallization in these materials. The results are of interest for the operation of embedded phase change memories which exploits Ge-enrichment of GeSbTe alloys to raise the crystallization temperature. The potential is generated by fitting a large database of energies and forces computed within Density Functional Theory with the neural network scheme implemented in the DeePMD-kit package. The potential is highly accurate and suitable to describe the structural and dynamical properties of the liquid, amorphous and crystalline phases of the wide range of compositions from pure Ge and stoichiometric GeTe to the Ge-rich Ge$_2$Te alloy. Large scale molecular dynamics simulations revealed a crystallization mechanism which depends on temperature. At 600 K, segregation of most of Ge in excess occurs on the ns time scale followed by crystallization of nearly stoichiometric GeTe regions. At 500 K, nucleation of crystalline GeTe occurs before phase separation, followed by a slow crystal growth due to the concurrent expulsion of Ge in excess.</description>

      <title>Giant Spin-Orbit Torque in Cr-based Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a very large spin-orbit torque (SOT) capability of chromium-based transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) in their Janus forms CrXTe, with X=S,Se. The structural inversion symmetry breaking, inherent to Janus structures is responsible for a large SOT response generated by giant Rashba splitting, equivalent to that obtained by applying a transverse electric field of $\sim 100 \,\text{V} \,\text{nm}^{-1}$ in non-Janus CrTe\textsubscript{2}, completely out of experimental reach. By performing transport simulations on custom-made Wannier tight-binding models, Janus systems are found to exhibit a SOT performance comparable to the most efficient two-dimensional materials, while allowing for field-free perpendicular magnetization switching owing to their reduced in-plane symmetry. Altogether, our findings evidence that magnetic Janus TMDs stand as suitable candidates for ultimate SOT-MRAM devices.</description>

      <title>Insights into the defect-driven heterogeneous structural evolution of Ni-rich layered cathode in lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, considerable efforts have been made on research and improvement for Ni-rich lithium-ion batteries to meet the demand from vehicles and grid-level large-scale energy storage. Development of next-generation high-performance lithium-ion batteries requires a comprehensive understanding on the underlying electrochemical mechanisms associated with its structural evolution. In this work, advanced operando neutron diffraction and four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques are applied to clarify the structural evolution of electrodes in two distinct full cells with identical LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode but different anode counterparts. It is found that both of cathodes in two cells exhibit non-intrinsic two-phase-like behavior at the early charge stage, indicating selective Li+ extraction from cathodes. But the heterogeneous evolution of cathode is less serious with graphite-silicon blended anode than that with graphite anode due to the different delithiation rate. Moreover, it is revealed that the formation of heterogeneous structure is led by the distribution of defects including Li/Ni disordering and microcracks, which should be inhibited by assembling appropriate anode to avoid potential threaten on cell performance. The present work unveils the origin of inhomogeneity in Ni-rich lithium-ion batteries and highlights the significance of kinetics control in electrodes for batteries with higher capacity and longer life.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Magnetism in Magnetic Topological Semimetal NdSb$_x$Te$_{2-x+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological semimetals LnSbTe (Ln = Lanthanide) have attracted intensive attention because of the presence of interplay between magnetism, topological, and electron correlations depending on the choices of magnetic Ln elements. Recently, varying Sb-Te composition has been found to effectively control the electronic and magnetic states in LnSbxTe$_{2-x}$. With this motivation, we report the evolution of magnetic properties with Sb-Te substitution in NdSb$_x$Te$_{2-x+\delta}$. Our work reveals the interesting non-monotonic change in magnetic ordering temperature with varying composition stoichiometry. In addition, reducing the Sb content x drives the reorientation of moments from in-plane (ab-plane) to out-of-plane (c-axis) direction that results in the distinct magnetic structures for two end compounds NdTe$_2$ ($x = 0$) and NdSbTe ($x = 1$). Furthermore, the moment orientation in NdSb$_x$Te$_{2-x+\delta}$ is also found to be strongly tunable upon application of weak magnetic field, leading to rich magnetic phases depending on the composition stoichiometry, temperature, and magnetic field. Such strong tuning of magnetism in this material establishes it as a promising platform for investigating tunable topological states and correlated topological physics.</description>

      <title>Nucleation mechanism of multiple-order parameter ferroelectric domain wall motion in hafnia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric hafnia exhibits promising robust polarization and silicon compatibility for ferroelectric devices. Unfortunately, it suffers from difficult polarization switching. Methods to enable easier polarization switching are needed, and the underlying reason for this switching difficulty is not understood. Here, we investigated the 180$^\circ$ domain walls of hafnia and their motion through nucleation. We found that the domains of multiple-order parameter hafnia possess complicated three-dimensional dipole patterns and lead to domain walls of different symmetry. The most common domain wall type is a complex domain wall involving reversal of both polarization and tetragonality order parameters. This domain wall symmetry ensures a good matching of the dipoles perpendicular to the domain wall, which leads to low domain wall energy. However, this ensures a sharp, high energy, charged domain wall on the edges of nuclei that results in difficult nucleation. Thus, this domain wall is too stable to move, which explains the switching difficulty of hafnia. By contrast, another simple domain wall, involving only polarization reversal, has a poor matching of dipoles perpendicular to the domain wall. This leads to higher domain wall energy and ensures a diffusive and low energy charged domain wall that enables easier nucleation. This simple domain wall is thus not too stable and easier to move. Our theory advances domain wall nucleation theory from the field of conventional single-order parameter to multiple-order parameters. We propose controlling the populations of different domain wall types in hafnia as a way to enable fast polarization switching and lower coercive fields.</description>

      <title>A community-led calibration of the Zr isotope Reference Materials: NIST candidate RM 8299 and SRM 3169</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the field of Zr stable isotopes is rapidly expanding from the study of mass-independent to that of mass-dependent isotope effects, a variety of Zr standards have appeared in the literature. While several of these standards have been proposed as the ideal isotope reference material (iRM) against which all data should be reported, none of them have been shown to meet the compositional and/or conflict-of-interest-free distribution requirements put forth by the community. To remedy this situation, we report on a community-led effort to develop and calibrate a scale defining iRM for Zr isotopes: NIST RM 8299. Developed in partnership with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) from the widely used SRM 3169 Zr Standard Solution, the candidate RM 8299 was calibrated through an inter-laboratory study involving three laboratories. Our data show that RM 8299 meets all requirements of an ideal iRM. It is an isotopically homogeneous, high-purity reference material, that is free of isotope anomalies, and whose composition is identical to that of a major geological reservoir (Ocean Island Basalts). Furthermore, RM 8299 will be curated and distributed by NIST, a neutral, conflict-of-interest free organization, and was produced in sufficient quantities to last multiple decades. We recommend that all Zr isotope data to be reported against RM 8299. Our results also show that SRM 3169 lots #130920 and #071226 have identical composition to RM 8299. Therefore, using RM 8299 as the scale defining iRM will enable direct comparison of all future data with the vast majority of the existing literature data, both for mass-independent and mass-dependent isotope effects. To facilitate conversion of d94/90Zr values reported against other Zr standards, we provide high-precision conversion factors to the RM 8299 scale obtained using the double-spike method.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Vibrational Control of Hybrid Perovskite Devices Reveals the Influence of the Organic Cation on Electronic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrational control (VC) of photochemistry through the optical stimulation of structural dynamics is a nascent concept only recently demonstrated for model molecules in solution. Extending VC to state-of-the-art materials may lead to new applications and improved performance for optoelectronic devices. Metal halide perovskites are promising targets for VC due to their mechanical softness and the rich array of vibrational motions of both their inorganic and organic sublattices. Here, we demonstrate the ultrafast VC of FAPbBr3 perovskite solar cells via intramolecular vibrations of the formamidinium cation using spectroscopic techniques based on vibrationally promoted electronic resonance. The observed short (~300 fs) time window of VC highlights the fast dynamics of coupling between the cation and inorganic sublattice. First-principles modelling reveals that this coupling is mediated by hydrogen bonds that modulate both lead halide lattice and electronic states. Cation dynamics modulating this coupling may suppress non-radiative recombination in perovskites, leading to photovoltaics with reduced voltage losses.</description>

      <title>Cobalt-based Co$_3$Mo3N/Co$_4$N/Co Metallic Heterostructure as a Highly Active Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alkaline water electrolysis is considered a commercially viable option for large-scale hydrogen production. However, this process still faces challenges due to the high voltage (&gt;1.65 V at 10 mA cm$^{-2}$) and its limited stability at higher current densities due to the inefficient electron transport kinetics. Herein, a novel cobalt based metallic heterostructure (Co$_3$Mo3N/Co$_4$N/Co/Co) is designed for application for water electrolysis. Operando Raman experiments reveal that the formation of Co$_3$Mo3N/Co$_4$N/Co heterointerface boosts the free water adsorption and dissociation, resulting in a surplus of protons available for subsequent hydrogen production. Furthermore, the altered electronic structure of Co$_3$Mo3N/Co$_4$N/Co heterointerface optimizes the {\Delta}GH of nitrogen atoms at the interface. This synergistic effect between interfacial nitrogen atoms and metal phase cobalt creates highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) active sites, thereby enhancing the overall performance. Additionally, the heterostructure exhibits a rapid OH- adsorption rate, coupled with a strong adsorption strength, leading to improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Crucially, the metallic heterojunction facilitates fast electron transport, expediting the aforementioned reaction steps and ultimately improving the overall efficiency of water splitting. The water electrolyzer with Co$_3$Mo3N/Co$_4$N/Co/Co as a catalyst exhibits outstanding performance, requiring an impressively low cell voltage of 1.58 V at 10 mA cm$^{-2}$ and maintaining approximately 100% retention over a remarkable 100 h duration at 200 mA cm$^{-2}$. This performance significantly exceeds that of the commercial Pt/C || RuO2 electrolyzer.</description>

      <title>Investigating the missing wedge problem in small-angle x-ray scattering tensor tomography across real and reciprocal space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small-angle scattering tensor tomography is a technique for studying anisotropic nanostructures of millimeter-sized samples in a volume-resolved manner. It requires the acquisition of data through repeated tomographic rotations about an axis which is subjected to a series of tilts. The tilt that can be achieved with a typical setup is geometrically constrained, which leads to limits in the set of directions from which the different parts of the reciprocal-space map can be probed. Here, we characterize the impact of this limitation on reconstructions in terms of the missing wedge problem of tomography, by treating the problem of tensor tomography as the reconstruction of a three-dimensional field of functions on the unit sphere, represented by a grid of Gaussian radial basis functions. We then devise an acquisition scheme to obtain complete data by remounting the sample, which we apply to a sample of human trabecular bone. Performing tensor tomographic reconstructions of limited data sets as well as the complete data set, we further investigate and validate the missing wedge understanding of data incompleteness by investigating reconstruction errors due to data incompleteness across both real and reciprocal space. Finally, we carry out an analysis of orientations and derived scalar quantities, to quantify the impact of this missing wedge problem on a typical tensor tomographic analysis. We conclude that the effects of data incompleteness are consistent with the predicted impact of the missing wedge problem, and that the impact on tensor tomographic analysis is appreciable but limited, especially if precautions are taken. In particular, there is only limited impact on the means and relative anisotropies of the reconstructed reciprocal space maps.</description>

      <title>Probing the Spin-Momentum Locking in Rashba Surfaces via Spin Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the intriguing spin-momentum locking phenomenon within the Rashba states of antimony (Sb) films. By combining spin pumping with the flow of an external charge current, we reveal the topological properties of surface states in Sb films. Taking advantage of the well-defined spin polarization of both spin-momentum-locked charge currents and spin-pumped currents, we demonstrate precise manipulation over the direction and magnitude of the resulting charging current, generated through the inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect. This fascinating phenomenon is attributed to the dynamic interaction between the accumulation of out-of-equilibrium pumped spins and the flowing spins, intrinsically locked perpendicular to the direction of the charge current. The results show that Sb as a promising material for basic and applied investigation of spintronics phenomena. We believe that the nanostructures investigated here open the way for the development of low-power logic gates operating in the range of a few tens of microamperes.</description>

      <title>Creation and Manipulation of Higher-Order Topological States by Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to implement tunable higher-order topological states in a heterojunction consisting of a two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator and the recently discovered altermagnets, whose unique spin-polarization in both real and reciprocal space and null magnetization are in contrast to conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Based on symmetry analysis and effective edge theory, we show that the special spin splitting in altermagnets with different symmetries, such as $d$-wave, can introduce Dirac mass terms with opposite signs on the adjacent boundaries of the topological insulator, resulting in the higher-order topological state with mass-domain bound corner states. Moreover, by adjusting the direction of the N\'{e}el vector, we can manipulate such topological corner states by moving their positions. By first-principles calculations, taking a 2D topological insulator bismuthene with a square lattice on an altermagnet MnF$_2$ as an example, we demonstrate the feasibility of creating and manipulating the higher-order topological states through altermagnets. Finally, we discuss the experimental implementation and detection of the tunable topological corner states, as well as the potential non-Abelian braiding of the Dirac corner fermions.</description>

      <title>Reversal in Thermally Driven Rotation of Chiral Liquid Crystal Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For chiral liquid crystals that express topologically protected defects and thermally driven mechanical rotation, the size- and temperature-driven reversal of the rotational direction of their droplets was demonstrated even under a fixed temperature gradient. This unconventional reversal indicates the dependence of thermomechanical coupling on the molecular orientational order, this dependence is justified through an examination of the size, temperature, and molecular structure as well as by phenomenological arguments on the order parameter.</description>

      <title>Competing anisotropies in the chiral cubic magnet Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$ unveiled by resonant x-ray magnetic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cubic $\beta$-Mn-type alloy Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$ is a chiral helimagnet that exhibits a peculiar temperature-dependent behavior in the spiral pitch, which decreases from 130 nm at room temperature to 70 nm below 20 K. Notably, this shortening is also accompanied by a structural transition of the metastable skyrmion texture, transforming from a hexagonal lattice to a square lattice of elongated skyrmions. The underlying mechanism of these transformations remain unknown, with interactions potentially involved including temperature-dependent Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and exchange anisotropy. Here, x-ray resonant magnetic small-angle scattering in vectorial magnetic fields was employed to investigate the temperature dependence of the anisotropic properties of the helical phase in Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$. Our results reveal quantitatively that the magnitude of the anisotropic exchange interaction increases by a factor of 4 on cooling from room temperature to 20 K, leading to a 5% variation in the helical pitch within the (001) plane at 20 K. While anisotropic exchange interaction contributes to the shortening of the spiral pitch, its magnitude is insufficient to explain the variation in the spiral periodicity from room to low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that magnetocrystalline and exchange anisotropies compete, favoring different orientations of the helical vector in the ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The levitation of a cylindrical permanent magnet over a high-temperature superconductor cooled by liquid nitrogen can be accompanied by spontaneous oscillations and rotation. The reason for spontaneous rotation of the magnet is magnetization inhomogeneity induced by the temperature gradient. An experiment was carried out on the levitation of Nd-Fe-B magnets over a composite high-temperature superconductor. The experimental results confirm that the rotation frequency depends on the difference in the magnetization values in the upper and lower halves of the magnet. Methods for controlling the rotation frequency of a levitating magnet are proposed.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity at 9 K in Pb-Bi Alloy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we report the synthesis of Pb-Bi alloy with enhanced Tc up to 9K, which is higher than that of Pb. The alloy is synthesized via solid state reaction route in vacuum encapsulated quartz tube at 700C in an automated furnace. The synthesized sample is characterized by X-ray Diffraction for its phase purity. Rietveld refinement of XRD reveals that the end product is majority hexagonal Pb7Bi3, with minor rhombohedral Bi. The electronic transport measurement shows metallic behavior with the Debye temperature of 108K and a superconductivity transition temperature (Tc) at below 9K, which is maximum till date for any reported Pb-Bi alloy, Pb or Bi at ambient pressure . It is possible that partial substitution of Bi at the Pb site, modifies the free density of electronic states within BCS model to attain the optimum Tc, which is higher by around 2K from the reported Tc of Pb. The superconductor phase diagram derived from magneto-transport measurements reveals that the synthesized alloy is a conventional superconductor with upper critical field (Hc) of 3.9Tesla, which lies well within the Pauli paramagnetic limit.</description>

      <title>Canalization-based super-resolution imaging using a single van der Waals layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Canalization is an optical phenomenon that enables unidirectional propagation of light in a natural way, i.e., without the need for predefined waveguiding designs. Predicted years ago, it was recently demonstrated using highly confined phonon polaritons (PhPs) in twisted layers of the van der Waals (vdW) crystal alpha-MoO3, offering unprecedented possibilities for controlling light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. However, despite this finding, applications based on polariton canalization have remained elusive so far, which can be explained by the complex sample fabrication of twisted stacks. In this work, we introduce a novel canalization phenomenon, arising in a single vdW thin layer (alpha-MoO3) when it is interfaced with a substrate exhibiting a given negative permittivity, that allows us to demonstrate a proof-of-concept application based on polariton canalization: super-resolution (up to ~{\lambda}0/220) nanoimaging. Importantly, we find that canalization-based imaging transcends conventional projection constraints, allowing the super-resolution images to be obtained at any desired location in the image plane. This versatility stems from the synergetic manipulation of three distinct parameters: incident frequency, rotation angle of the thin vdW layer, and thickness. These results provide valuable insights into the fundamental properties of canalization and constitute a seminal step towards multifaceted photonic applications, encompassing imaging, data transmission, and ultra-compact photonic integration.</description>

      <title>Higher-magnesium-doping effects on the singlet ground state of the Shastry-Sutherland SrCu2(BO3)2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doping of quantum antiferromagnets is an established approach to investigate the robustness of their ground state against the competing phases. Predictions of doping effects on the ground state of the Shastry-Sutherland dimer model are here verified experimentally on Mg-doped SrCu2(BO3)2. A partial incorporation of Mg2+ on the Cu2+-site in the SrCu2(BO3)2 structure leads to a subtle but systematic lattice expansion with the increasing Mg-doping concentration, which is accompanied by a concomitant decrease in the spin gap, the Curie-Weiss temperature and the peak temperature of the susceptibility. These findings indicate a doping-induced breaking of Cu2+ spin-1/2 dimers which is also corroborated by X-band EPR spectroscopy that points to a systematic increase in intensity of free Cu2+ sites with increasing Mg-doping concentration. Extending the Mg-doping up to nominal x = 0.10 or SrCu1.9Mg0.1(BO3)2, in the magnetisation measurements taken up to 35 T, a suppression of the pseudo-1/8 plateau is found along with a clear presence of an anomaly at an onset critical field H'C0 ~ 9 T. The latter, absent in pure SrCu2(BO3)2, emerges due to the coupling of liberated Cu2+ spin-1/2 entities in the vicinity of Mg-doping induced impurities.</description>

      <title>Designing athermal disordered solids with automatic differentiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to control forces between sub-micron-scale building blocks offers considerable potential for designing new materials through self-assembly. A typical paradigm is to first identify a particular (crystal) structure that has some desired property, and then design building-block interactions so that this structure assembles spontaneously. While significant theoretical and experimental progress has been made in assembling complicated structures in a variety of systems, this two-step paradigm fundamentally fails for structurally disordered solids, which lack a well-defined structure to use as a target. Here we show that disordered solids can still be treated from an inverse self-assembly perspective by targeting material properties directly. Using the Poisson's ratio, $\nu$, as a primary example, we show how differentiable programming connects experimentally relevant interaction parameters with emergent behavior, allowing us to iteratively "train" the system until we find the set of interactions that leads to the Poisson's ratio we desire. Beyond the Poisson's ratio, we also tune the pressure and a measure of local 8-fold structural order, as well as multiple properties simultaneously, demonstrating the potential for nontrivial design in disordered solids. This approach is highly robust, transferable, and scalable, can handle a wide variety of model systems, properties of interest, and preparation dynamics, and can optimize over 100s or even 1000s of parameters. This result connects the fields of disordered solids and inverse self-assembly, indicating that many of the tools and ideas that have been developed to understand the assembly of crystals can also be used to control the properties of disordered solids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the transition from asymptotically reversible to asymptotically irreversible response in amorphous solids subject to oscillatory shear is still unknown. It is known that the plastic events that result from shearing always involve localized particle rearrangements, but it is unclear why some are reversible while others are not. Here we show, using simulations and models, that overlaps between particle rearrangements caused by straining the solid in alternating directions can cause the response to become irreversible when they occur frequently. As the forcing amplitude increases, plastic events become more frequent, the number of such overlaps increases, and the probability of the system returning to previous states diminishes.</description>

Abstract: We explore the impact of optical excitation using two interfering ultrashort optical pulses on ultrafast magnetization dynamics. Our investigation focuses on Pt/Co/Pt multilayers and TbCo alloy samples, employing a dual pump approach. We observe significant variations in the dynamics of magnetization suppression and subsequent recovery when triggered with two optical pulses of the same polarization-essentially meeting conditions for interference. Conversely, dynamics triggered with cross-polarized pump beams exhibit expected similarity to that triggered with a single pulse. Delving into the underlying physical processes contributing to laser-induced demagnetization and recovery dynamics, we find that our current understanding cannot elucidate the observed trends. Consequently, we propose that optical excitation with interfering light possesses not previously acknowledged capacity to induce long-lasting alterations in the dynamics of angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Motion of 2D exciton in momentum space leads to pseudospin distribution narrowing on the Bloch Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motional narrowing implies narrowing induced by motion, for example, in nuclear resonance, the thermally induced random motion of the nuclei in an inhomogeneous environment leads to counter-intuitive narrowing of the resonance line. Similarly, the excitons in monolayer semiconductors experience magnetic inhomogeneity: the electron-hole spin-exchange interaction manifests as an in-plane pseudo-magnetic field with a periodically varying orientation inside the exciton band. The excitons undergo random momentum scattering and pseudospin precession repeatedly in this inhomogeneous magnetic environment - typically resulting in fast exciton depolarization. On the contrary, we show that such magnetic inhomogeneity averages out at high scattering rate due to motional narrowing. Physically, a faster exciton scattering leads to a narrower pseudospin distribution on the Bloch sphere, implying a nontrivial improvement in exciton polarization. The in-plane nature of the pseudo-magnetic field enforces a contrasting scattering dependence between the circularly and linearly polarized excitons - providing a spectroscopic way to gauge the sample quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-mechanical coupling is vital in diverse fields including spintronics, sensing and quantum transduction. Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials provide a unique platform for investigating spin-mechanical coupling, attributed to their mechanical flexibility and novel spin orderings. However, studying spin-mechanical coupling in 2D magnets presents challenges in probing mechanical deformation and thermodynamic properties change at nanoscale. Here we use nano opto-electro-mechanical interferometry to mechanically detect the phase transition and magnetostriction effect in multilayer CrSBr, an air-stable antiferromagnets with large magnon-exciton coupling. The transitions among antiferromagnetism, spin-canted ferromagnetism and paramagnetism are visualized by optomechanical frequency anomalies. Nontrivial magnetostriction coefficient 2.3x10^(-5) and magnetoelastic coupling strength on the order of 10^6 J/m^3 have been found. Moreover, we demonstrate the substantial tunability of the magnetoelastic constant by nearly 50% via gate-induced strain. Our findings demonstrate the strong spin-mechanical coupling in CrSBr and paves the way for developing sensitive magnetic sensing and efficient quantum transduction at atomically thin limit.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Free Determination of Microstructure Representative Volume Element Size via Fisher Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A representative volume element (RVE) is a reasonably small unit of microstructure that can be simulated to obtain the same effective properties as the entire microstructure sample. Finite element (FE) simulation of RVEs, as opposed to much larger samples, saves computational expense, especially in multiscale modeling. Therefore, it is desirable to have a framework that determines RVE size prior to FE simulations. Existing methods select the RVE size based on when the FE-simulated properties of samples of increasing size converge with insignificant statistical variations, with the drawback that many samples must be simulated. We propose a simulation-free alternative that determines RVE size based only on a micrograph. The approach utilizes a machine learning model trained to implicitly characterize the stochastic nature of the input micrograph. The underlying rationale is to view RVE size as the smallest moving window size for which the stochastic nature of the microstructure within the window is stationary as the window moves across a large micrograph. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed Fisher score-based framework for microstructure nonstationarity monitoring. Because the resulting RVE size is based solely on the micrograph and does not involve any FE simulation of specific properties, it constitutes an RVE for any property of interest that solely depends on the microstructure characteristics. Through numerical experiments of simple and complex microstructures, we validate our approach and show that our selected RVE sizes are consistent with when the chosen FE-simulated properties converge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong changes in bulk properties, such as modulus and viscosity, are observed near the glass transition temperature, T_{g}, of amorphous materials. For more than a century, intense efforts have been made to define a microscopic origin for these macroscopic changes in properties. Using transition state theory, we delve into the atomic/molecular level picture of how microscopic localized relaxations, or "cage rattles," translate to macroscopic structural relaxations above T_{g}. Unit motion is broken down into two populations: (1) simultaneous rearrangement occurs among a critical number of units, n_{\alpha}, which ranges from 1 to 4, allowing a systematic classification of glasses that is compared to fragility; (2) near T_{g}, adjacent units provide additional free volume for rearrangement, not simultaneously, but within the "primitive" lifetime, {\tau}_{1}, of one unit rattling in its cage. Relaxation maps illustrate how Johari-Goldstein \{beta} relaxations stem from the rattle of n_{\alpha} units. We analyzed a wide variety of glassy materials, and materials with glassy response, using literature data. Our four-parameter equation fits "strong" and "weak" glasses over the entire range of temperatures and also extends to other glassy systems, such as ion-transporting polymers and ferroelectric relaxors. The role of activation entropy in boosting preexponential factors to high "unphysical" apparent frequencies is discussed.</description>

For example, 2D materials exhibit stronger electron-phonon and electron-hole interactions, and their energy gaps and effective carrier masses can be easily tuned. Surprisingly, published band gaps of several 2D materials obtained with the $GW$ approach, the state-of-the-art in electronic-structure calculations, are quite scattered. The details of these calculations, such as the underlying geometry, the starting point, the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling, and the treatment of the Coulomb potential can critically determine how accurate the results are. Taking monolayer MoS$_2$ as a representative material, we employ the linearized augmented planewave + local orbital method to systematically investigate how all these aspects affect the quality of $G_0W_0$ calculations, and also provide a summary of literature data. We conclude that the best overall agreement with experiments and coupled-cluster calculations is found for $G_0W_0$ results with HSE06 as a starting point including spin-orbit coupling, a truncated Coulomb potential, and an analytical treatment of the singularity at $q=0$.</description>

      <title>Electronic States in One-Dimensional Helical Crystals: General Properties and Application to InSeI</title>

Abstract: In this article, we systematically explore several key properties of electronic states in helical materials systems, including the inheritance of orbital angular momentum (OAM) from local atomic orbitals to the entire helical structure, the conservation of helical momentum, and the emergence of helical-induced spin-orbit coupling (hSOC). We then apply this comprehensive theoretical framework to elucidate the electronic structure of one-dimensional (1D) helical crystal InSeI. Our analysis reveals the influence of hSOC, evident in spin-mixing energy gaps within the electronic band structure, as calculated through density functional theory. Utilizing a combination of tight-binding modeling and first-principles calculations, we ascertain the spin-polarized electric response and the chiral-switchable second-order photocurrent response of InSeI, characterized as the Landauer-Buttiker ballistic transport and shift current response. The results highlight the potential of 1D InSeI for applications in spintronics and optoelectronics. The overarching theoretical framework established in this work will prove invaluable for the investigation of other helical electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast light-induced magnetization in non-magnetic films: from orbital and spin Hall phenomena to the inverse Faraday effect</title>

Abstract: The field of orbitronics has emerged with great potential to impact information technology by enabling environmentally friendly electronic devices. The main electronic degree of freedom at play is the orbital angular momentum, which can give rise to a myriad of phenomena such as the orbital Hall effect (OHE), torques and orbital magnetoelectric effects. Here, we explore via realistic time-dependent electronic structure simulations the magnetic response of a non-magnetic material, an ultrathin Pt film, to ultrafast laser pulses of different polarizatons and helicities. We demonstrate the generation of significant orbital and spin magnetizations and identify the underlying mechanisms consisting of the interplay of the OHE, inverse Faraday effect and spin-orbit interaction. Our discoveries advocate for the prospect of encoding magnetic information using light in materials that are not inherently magnetic.</description>

Abstract: We describe the effect of the Fe layer thickness on the antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange coupling in [Fe/MgO]$_N$ superlattices. An increase in coupling strength with increasing Fe layer thickness is observed, which highlights the need of including the extension of both the layers when discussing the interlayer exchange coupling in superlattices.</description>

      <title>Electron mobility of SnO2 from first principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transparent conducting oxide SnO2 is a wide bandgap semiconductor that is easily n-type doped and widely used in various electronic and optoelectronic applications. Experimental reports of the electron mobility of this material vary widely depending on the growth conditions and doping concentrations. In this work, we calculate the electron mobility of SnO2 from first principles to examine the temperature- and doping-concentration dependence, and to elucidate the scattering mechanisms that limit transport. We include both electron-phonon scattering and electron-ionized impurity scattering to accurately model scattering in a doped semiconductor. We find a strongly anisotropic mobility that favors transport in the direction parallel to the c-axis. At room temperature and intrinsic carrier concentrations, the low-energy polar-optical phonon modes dominate scattering, while ionized-impurity scattering dominates above 10^18 cm^-3.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic phonon polaritons and wave vector direction dependent dielectric tensors in anisotropic crystals</title>

Abstract: Hyperbolic phonon polariton is important in precisely controlling photons at the nanoscale. It was common practice to calculate the dielectric function of the phonon polariton system with the Drude-Lorenz model. We considered the impact of LO-TO splitting while applying the Drude-Lorenz model. Then the dielectric functions become wave vector direction dependent besides electric polarization direction dependent. Our results show that considering LO-TO splitting can more accurately predict dielectric functions. Additionally, we discovered that, besides hexagonal BN, hexagonal AlN exhibits a wide hyperbolic frequency band range, while the other four materials display it scarcely. Furthermore, we found that the phonon frequency, lifetime, and the difference of infrared active transverse optical phonon frequencies with different wave vector directions are critical factors in determining the width of the hyperbolic frequency band range. We also found some dumbbell-shaped and butterfly-shaped isofrequency curves in h-AlN, h-GaP, and especially h-GaN. Our study provides a fresh perspective on understanding the dielectric properties of these materials and lays a theoretical foundation for further exploration and development of new hyperbolic phonon polariton materials.</description>

      <title>Colossal Seebeck coefficient of thermoelectric material calculated by space charge effect, and phonon drag background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present colossal Seebeck coefficient ($S$) and large thermal electron motivate force (EMF) reproduced by space charge (SC) effect, introducing multi-Debye lengths into grain boundaries (GBs) of thermoelectric (TE) materials with phonon drag (PD) effect. Recently colossal $S$ was reported in several TE materials. In addition, the polarity reversal was also reproduced by transfer process with inner bias around SP generated from thermal EMF. Colossal $S$ and EMF for TE material were reproduced by SC model as the functions of Debye length into GBs, reduced mass: $m^*/m$, and temperature.</description>

      <title>Physics-based reward driven image analysis in microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of electron microscopy has expanded our ability to acquire nanometer and atomically resolved images of complex materials. The resulting vast datasets are typically analyzed by human operators, an intrinsically challenging process due to the multiple possible analysis steps and the corresponding need to build and optimize complex analysis workflows. We present a methodology based on the concept of a Reward Function coupled with Bayesian Optimization, to optimize image analysis workflows dynamically. The Reward Function is engineered to closely align with the experimental objectives and broader context and is quantifiable upon completion of the analysis. Here, cross-section, high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) images of ion-irradiated $(Y, Dy)Ba_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}$ thin-films were used as a model system. The reward functions were formed based on the expected materials density and atomic spacings and used to drive multi-objective optimization of the classical Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) method. These results can be benchmarked against the DCNN segmentation. This optimized LoG* compares favorably against DCNN in the presence of the additional noise. We further extend the reward function approach towards the identification of partially-disordered regions, creating a physics-driven reward function and action space of high-dimensional clustering. We pose that with correct definition, the reward function approach allows real-time optimization of complex analysis workflows at much higher speeds and lower computational costs than classical DCNN-based inference, ensuring the attainment of results that are both precise and aligned with the human-defined objectives.</description>

      <title>Observation of Negative Surface and Interface Energies of Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface energy is a fundamental property of materials and is particularly important in describing nanomaterials where atoms or molecules at the surface constitute a large fraction of the material. Traditionally, surface energy is considered to be a positive quantity, where atoms or molecules at the surface are less thermodynamically stable than their counterparts in the interior of the material because they have fewer bonds or interactions at the surface. Using calorimetric methods, we show that the surface energy is negative in some prototypical colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, or quantum dots with organic ligand coatings. This implies that the surface atoms are more thermodynamically stable than those on the interior due to the strong bonds between these atoms and surfactant molecules, or ligands, that coat their surface. In addition, we extend this work to core/shell indium phosphide/zinc sulfide nanocrystals and show that the interfacial energy between these materials is highly thermodynamically favorable in spite of their large lattice mismatch. This work challenges many of the assumptions that have guided thinking about colloidal nanomaterial thermodynamics, investigates the fundamental stability of many technologically relevant colloidal nanomaterials, and paves the way for future experimental and theoretical work on nanocrystal thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>3D Heisenberg universality in the Van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials are comprised of layers of atomically thin sheets, making them ideal platforms for studying magnetism at the two-dimensional (2D) limit. These materials are at the center of a host of novel types of experiments, however, there are notably few pathways to directly probe their magnetic structure. We report the magnetic order within a single crystal of NiPS$_3$ and show it can be accessed with resonant elastic X-ray diffraction along the edge of the vdW planes in a carefully grown crystal by detecting structurally forbidden resonant magnetic X-ray scattering. We find the magnetic order parameter has a critical exponent of $\beta\sim0.36$, indicating that the magnetism of these vdW crystals is more adequately characterized by the three-dimensional (3D) Heisenberg universality class. We verify these findings with first-principle density functional theory, Monte-Carlo simulations, and density matrix renormalization group calculations.</description>
