      <title>Robust reduced-order model predictive control using peak-to-peak analysis of filtered signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the design of a model predictive control (MPC) scheme for large-scale linear systems using reduced-order models (ROMs). Our approach uses a ROM, leverages tools from robust control, and integrates them into an MPC framework to achieve computational tractability with robust constraint satisfaction. Our key contribution is a method to obtain guaranteed bounds on the predicted outputs of the full-order system by predicting a (scalar) error-bounding system alongside the ROM. This bound is then used to formulate a robust ROM-based MPC that guarantees constraint satisfaction and robust performance. Our method is developed step-by-step by (i) analysing the error, (ii) bounding the peak-to-peak gain, an (iii) using filtered signals. We demonstrate our method on a 100-dimensional mass-spring-damper system, achieving over four orders of magnitude reduction in conservatism relative to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Oscillation Analysis and Damping Control for a Proposed North American AC-DC Macrogrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, several studies conducted by both industry and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-funded initiatives have proposed linking North America's Eastern and Western Interconnections (EI and WI) through a multiterminal DC (MTDC) macrogrid. These studies have explored the advantages and opportunities of the proposed configuration from the perspectives of capacity sharing and frequency support. However, the potential challenges of small-signal stability arising from this interconnection have not been thoroughly examined. To address this gap, detailed model-based simulation studies are performed in this paper to assess the risks of poorly damped inter-area oscillations in the proposed macrogrid. A custom-built dynamic model of the MTDC system is developed and integrated with industry-grade models of the EI and WI, incorporating high levels of inverter-based energy resources. Through model-based oscillation analysis, potential shifts in inter-area modes for both EI and WI, resulting from the MTDC integration are characterized, and modes with inadequate damping are identified. Furthermore, to mitigate the risks of unstable oscillations, supplementary damping controllers are designed for the MTDC system, leveraging wide-area feedback to modulate active power set points at selected converter stations. A frequency scanning approach is employed for data-driven model linearization and controller synthesis. The damping performance is evaluated under the designed operating conditions and selected contingency scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Power Systems Resilience Using Statistical Analysis and Bayesian Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events is significantly affecting the power grid, causing large-scale outages and impacting power system resilience. Yet limited work has been done on systematically modeling the impacts of weather parameters to quantify resilience. This study presents a framework using statistical and Bayesian learning approaches to quantitatively model the relationship between weather parameters and power system resilience metrics. By leveraging real-world publicly available outage and weather data, we identify key weather variables of wind speed, temperature, and precipitation influencing a particular region's resilience metrics. A case study of Cook County, Illinois, and Miami-Dade County, Florida, reveals that these weather parameters are critical factors in resiliency analysis and risk assessment. Additionally, we find that these weather variables have combined effects when studied jointly compared to their effects in isolation. This framework provides valuable insights for understanding how weather events affect power distribution system performance, supporting decision-makers in developing more effective strategies for risk mitigation, resource allocation, and adaptation to changing climatic conditions.</description>

      <title>Microgrids optimal radial reconfiguration via FORWARD algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microgrids offer a promising paradigm for integrating distributed energy resources, bolstering energy resilience, and reducing the impact of blackouts. However, their inherent decentralization and dynamic operation present substantial energy management complexities. These complexities, including balancing supply and demand, ensuring system stability, and minimizing operational costs, often necessitate solving computationally intractable NP-hard Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problems. Traditional MINLP solvers struggle with the scalability and feasibility guarantees required for these challenges. To address this, this paper tackles the problem of resource allocation and radial configuration design for microgrid power distribution and proposes and abstracted problem which is solved by introducing a permutation-based iterative search method over the recently introduced FORWARD method to efficiently identify feasible, near-optimal radial network structures while inherently respecting physical constraints. Furthermore, this paper investigates the integration of the proposed method as a warm-start strategy for benchmark MINLP solvers offering a scalable solution for comprehensive microgrid design.</description>

      <title>Active Noise Control Method Using Time Domain Neural Networks for Path Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In decentralized active noise control (ANC) systems, crosstalk between multichannel secondary sources and error microphones significantly degrades control accuracy. Moreover, prefiltering reference signals in filtered-x (Fx) type algorithms may further introduce modeling errors. A theoretical analysis of the Fx-based decentralized control algorithm was performed, which reveals how prefiltering and crosstalk affect the control performance. Then, a hybrid method combining fixed-value neural networks and adaptive strategies was proposed for efficient decentralized ANC. The adaptive filter models the primary path of its own channel online using the least mean square (LMS) algorithm while the neural network (named DecNet) is used for secondary paths inverting and decoupling. The hybrid DecNet-LMS algorithm was implemented in the time domain to guarantee causality and avoid latency. Simulation results with measured acoustic paths show that the proposed method outperforms the existing ANC algorithms using either traditional adaptive filters or neural network-based fixed-coefficient methods under different acoustic conditions.</description>

      <title>MHE in Output Feedback Control of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems via IQCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a moving horizon estimation (MHE) scheme for general nonlinear constrained systems with parametric or static nonlinear uncertainties and a predetermined state feedback controller that is assumed to robustly stabilize the system in the absence of estimation errors. Leveraging integral quadratic constraints (IQCs), we introduce a new notion of detectability that is robust to possibly non-parametric uncertainties and verifiable in practice. Assuming that the uncertain system driven by the controller satisfies this notion of detectability, we provide an MHE formulation such that the closed-loop system formed of the uncertain system, the controller and MHE is input-to-state stable w.r.t. exogenous disturbances.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Experimental Limitations of RoCoF Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precise estimation of the Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) is crucial for secure power system operation. In fact, RoCoF is strictly related to the amount of the available physical and/or virtual inertia of the system and the severity of the active power unbalance following a disturbance. For this reason, it is widely exploited in different protection systems, e.g., Anti-Islanding, Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS) and wide-area protection systems. The new paradigm of modern power systems, with a low-inertia and converter-based generation assets, is increasing the transient severity, making the frequency and the RoCoF estimation more complex and less precise for the actual devices. This work addresses this issue by proposing a numerically robust approach based on concepts inherited from differential geometry and fluid mechanics. The proposed approach is then tested with high-sampling real experimental measurements and used to develop a faster control logic for a RoCoF-based UFLS control scheme. The proposed approach provides information to protections regarding the nature of the contingency which can be used to improve its response.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Dynamics in Continuous-time Finite-state Mean Field Games -- Part II: Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a dynamic game with a large population of players who choose actions from a finite set in continuous time. Each player has a state in a finite state space that evolves stochastically with their actions. A player's reward depends not only on their own state and action but also on the distribution of states and actions across the population, capturing effects such as congestion in traffic networks. In Part I, we introduced an evolutionary model and a new solution concept - the mixed stationary Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) - which coincides with the rest points of the mean field evolutionary model under meaningful families of revision protocols. In this second part, we investigate the evolutionary stability of MSNE. We derive conditions on both the structure of the MSNE and the game's payoff map that ensure local and global stability under evolutionary dynamics. These results characterize when MSNE can robustly emerge and persist against strategic deviations, thereby providing insight into its long-term viability in large population dynamic games.</description>

      <title>Lightwave Power Transfer-Enabled Underwater Optical ISAC Systems under Ship Attitude Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a lightwave power transfer-enabled underwater optical integrated sensing and communication (O-ISAC) system, where an access point (AP) mounted on a seasurface ship transmits lightwave signals to two nodes, namely ($i$) a seabed sensor that harvests energy and transmits uplink information to the AP, and ($ii$) a sensing target whose position is estimated by the AP using an array of pinhole cameras. To capture practical deployment conditions, the ship attitude variation is modeled through its roll, pitch, and yaw angles, each following a Gaussian distribution under low-to-moderate sea states. Closed-form approximations are derived for the mean squared error (MSE) of target localization and the achievable uplink data rate. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate excellent agreement, validating the proposed models and derived expressions, while revealing the fundamental communication-sensing tradeoff in the O-ISAC system. The results further provide valuable design insights, including the optimal camera placement on the ship to minimize localization error, achieving a minimum MSE of $10^{-2}$ $\text{m}^2$ with multiple cameras under roll, pitch, and yaw angle variation of $10^{\circ}$, and the optimal harvest-use ratio of $0.55$ for the considered setup.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twin of Evaporative Thermo-Fluidic Process in Fixation Unit of DoD Inkjet Printers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In inkjet printing, optimal paper moisture is crucial for print quality, achieved through hot-air impingement in the fixation unit. This paper presents a modular digital twin of the fixation unit, modeling the thermo-fluidic drying process and monitoring its spatio-temporal performance. The novel approach formulates the digital twin as an infinite-dimensional state estimator that infers fixation states from limited sensor data, while remaining robust to disturbances. Modularity is achieved through a graph-theoretic model, where each node represents thermo-fluidic dynamics in different sections of the fixation unit. Evaporation is modeled as a nonlinear boundary effect coupled with node dynamics via Linear Fractional Representation. Using the Partial Integral Equation (PIE) framework, we develop a unified approach for stability, input-output analysis, simulation, and rapid prototyping, validated with operational data from a commercial printer. An $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$-optimal Luenberger state estimator is then synthesized to estimate thermal states from available sensor data, enabling real-time monitoring of spatio-temporal thermal effects on paper sheets.</description>

      <title>Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Dynamic Sub-Networks with Missing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum likelihood estimation is effective for identifying dynamical systems, but applying it to large networks becomes computationally prohibitive. This paper introduces a maximum likelihood estimation method that enables identification of sub-networks within complex interconnected systems without estimating the entire network. The key insight is that under specific topological conditions, a sub-network's parameters can be estimated using only local measurements: signals within the target sub-network and those in the directly connected to the so-called separator sub-network. This approach significantly reduces computational complexity while enhancing privacy by eliminating the need to share sensitive internal data across organizational boundaries. We establish theoretical conditions for network separability, derive the probability density function for the sub-network, and demonstrate the method's effectiveness through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>An Alternative Derivation and Optimal Design Method of the Generalized Bilinear Transformation for Discretizing Analog Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A popular method for designing digital systems is transforming the transfer function of the corresponding analog systems from the continuous-time domain (s-domain) into the discrete-time domain (z-domain) using the Euler or Tustin method. We demonstrate that these transformations are two specific forms of the Generalized Bilinear Transformation (GBT) with a design parameter, $\alpha$. However, the physical meaning and optimal design method for this parameter are not sufficiently studied. In this paper, we propose an alternative derivation of the GBT derived by employing a new hexagonal shape to approximate the enclosed area of the error function, and we define the parameter $\alpha$ as the shape factor. The physical meaning of the shape factor is firstly revealed, which equals to the percentage of the backward rectangular ratio of the proposed hexagonal shape. We demonstrate that the stable range of the shape factor is [0.5, 1] through domain mapping. Depending on the operating frequencies and the shape factor, we observe two distinct distortion modes, i.e., the magnitude and phase distortion. We proceed to develop an optimal design method for the shape factor based on an objective function in form of the normalized magnitude or phase error. Finally, a low-pass filter (LPF) is designed and tested to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing the theoretical calculations with the experimental results.</description>

      <title>System Identification of a Moored ASV with Recessed Moon Pool via Deterministic and Bayesian Hankel-DMDc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the system identification of a small autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) under moored conditions using Hankel dynamic mode decomposition with control (HDMDc) and its Bayesian extension (BHDMDc). Experiments were carried out on a Codevintec CK-14e ASV in the towing tank of CNR-INM, under both irregular and regular head-sea wave conditions. The ASV under investigation features a recessed moon pool, which induces nonlinear responses due to sloshing, thereby increasing the modelling challenge. Data-driven reduced-order models were built from measurements of vessel motions and mooring loads. The HDMDc framework provided accurate deterministic predictions of vessel dynamics, while the Bayesian formulation enabled uncertainty-aware characterization of the model response by accounting for variability in hyperparameter selection. Validation against experimental data demonstrated that both HDMDc and BHDMDc can predict the vessel's response to unseen regular and irregular wave excitations. In conclusion, the study shows that HDMDc-based ROMs are a viable data-driven alternative for system identification, demonstrating for the first time their generalization capability for a sea condition different from the training set, achieving high accuracy in reproducing vessel dynamics.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Modeling of Grid-following Control in Grid-connected Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As power systems evolve with the integration of renewable energy sources and the implementation of smart grid technologies, there is an increasing need for flexible and scalable modeling approaches capable of accurately capturing the complex dynamics of modern grids. To meet this need, various methods, such as the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics and deep symbolic regression, have been developed to identify dynamical systems directly from data. In this study, we examine the application of a converter-based resource as a replacement for a traditional generator within a lossless transmission line linked to an infinite bus system. This setup is used to generate synthetic data in grid-following control mode, enabling the evaluation of these methods in effectively capturing system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Powered Descent Trajectory Optimization of Chandrayaan-3 using Radau Collocation and Controllable Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: India achieved a significant milestone on August $23^{\text{rd}}$ 2023, becoming the fourth country to accomplish a soft landing on the Moon. This paper presents the powered descent trajectory design for the Chandrayaan-3 mission. The optimization framework is based on pseudospectral Radau collocation, and controllability-based waypoint refinement is employed to further enhance the robustness of the trajectory against state and control perturbations. Furthermore, the trade-off between fuel consumption and robustness is explicitly quantified, providing insights into the practical considerations of mission planning.</description>

      <title>Artificial-reference tracking MPC with probabilistically validated performance on industrial embedded systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial embedded systems are typically used to execute simple control algorithms due to their low computational resources. Despite these limitations, the implementation of advanced control techniques such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) has been explored by the control community in recent years, typically considering simple linear formulations or explicit ones to facilitate the online computation of the control input. These simplifications often lack features and properties that are desirable in real-world environments. In this article, we present an efficient implementation for embedded systems of MPC for tracking with artificial reference, solved via a recently developed structure-exploiting first-order method. This formulation is tailored to a wide range of applications by incorporating essential practical features at a small computational cost, including integration with an offset-free scheme, back-off parameters that enable constraint tightening, and soft constraints that preserve feasibility under disturbances or plant-model mismatch. We accompany this with a framework for probabilistic performance validation of the closed-loop system over long-term operation. We illustrate the applicability of the approach on a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), incorporated in a hardware-in-the-loop setup to control a nonlinear continuous stirred-tank reactor. The behavior of the closed-loop system is probabilistically validated with respect to constraint violations and the number of iterations required at each time step by the MPC optimization algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Constant-Gain Equation-Error Framework for Airliner Aerodynamic Monitoring Using QAR Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring the in-service aerodynamic performance of airliners is critical for operational efficiency and safety, but using operational Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data for this purpose presents significant challenges. This paper first establishes that the absence of key parameters, particularly aircraft moments of inertia, makes conventional state-propagation filters fundamentally unsuitable for this application. This limitation necessitates a decoupled, Equation-Error Method (EEM). However, we then demonstrate through a comparative analysis that standard recursive estimators with time-varying gains, such as Recursive Least Squares (RLS), also fail within an EEM framework, exhibiting premature convergence or instability when applied to low-excitation cruise data. To overcome these dual challenges, we propose and validate the Constant-Gain Equation-Error Method (CG-EEM). This framework employs a custom estimator with a constant, Kalman-like gain, which is perfectly suited to the stationary, low-signal-to-noise characteristics of cruise flight. The CG-EEM is extensively validated on a large, multi-fleet dataset of over 200 flights, where it produces highly consistent, physically plausible aerodynamic parameters and correctly identifies known performance differences between aircraft types. The result is a robust, scalable, and computationally efficient tool for fleet-wide performance monitoring and the early detection of performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Toward an Agricultural Operational Design Domain: A Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The agricultural sector increasingly relies on autonomous systems that operate in complex and variable environments. Unlike on-road applications, agricultural automation integrates driving and working processes, each of which imposes distinct operational constraints. Handling this complexity and ensuring consistency throughout the development and validation processes requires a structured, transparent, and verified description of the environment. However, existing Operational Design Domain (ODD) concepts do not yet address the unique challenges of agricultural applications.
  Therefore, this work introduces the Agricultural ODD (Ag-ODD) Framework, which can be used to describe and verify the operational boundaries of autonomous agricultural systems. The Ag-ODD Framework consists of three core elements. First, the Ag-ODD description concept, which provides a structured method for unambiguously defining environmental and operational parameters using concepts from ASAM Open ODD and CityGML. Second, the 7-Layer Model derived from the PEGASUS 6-Layer Model, has been extended to include a process layer to capture dynamic agricultural operations. Third, the iterative verification process verifies the Ag-ODD against its corresponding logical scenarios, derived from the 7-Layer Model, to ensure the Ag-ODD's completeness and consistency.
  Together, these elements provide a consistent approach for creating unambiguous and verifiable Ag-ODD. Demonstrative use cases show how the Ag-ODD Framework can support the standardization and scalability of environmental descriptions for autonomous agricultural systems.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Driven Pavement Health Monitoring and Maintenance Optimization Using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pavement infrastructure monitoring is challenged by complex spatial dependencies, changing environmental conditions, and non-linear deterioration across road networks. Traditional Pavement Management Systems (PMS) remain largely reactive, lacking real-time intelligence for failure prevention and optimal maintenance planning. To address this, we propose a unified Digital Twin (DT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for scalable, data-driven pavement health monitoring and predictive maintenance. Pavement segments and spatial relations are modeled as graph nodes and edges, while real-time UAV, sensor, and LiDAR data stream into the DT. The inductive GNN learns deterioration patterns from graph-structured inputs to forecast distress and enable proactive interventions. Trained on a real-world-inspired dataset with segment attributes and dynamic connectivity, our model achieves an R2 of 0.3798, outperforming baseline regressors and effectively capturing non-linear degradation. We also develop an interactive dashboard and reinforcement learning module for simulation, visualization, and adaptive maintenance planning. This DT-GNN integration enhances forecasting precision and establishes a closed feedback loop for continuous improvement, positioning the approach as a foundation for proactive, intelligent, and sustainable pavement management, with future extensions toward real-world deployment, multi-agent coordination, and smart-city integration.</description>

      <title>Observer-based neural networks for flow estimation and control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network observers (NNOs) are proposed for real-time estimation of fluid flows, addressing a key challenge in flow control: obtaining real-time flow states from a limited set of sparse and noisy sensor data. For this task, we propose a generalization of the classical Luenberger observer. In the present framework, the estimation loop is composed of subsystems modeled as neural networks (NNs). By combining flow information from selected probes and an NN surrogate model (NNSM) of the flow system, we train NNOs capable of fusing information to provide the best estimation of the states, that can in turn be fed back to an NN controller (NNC). The NNO capabilities are demonstrated for three nonlinear dynamical systems. First, a variation of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation with control inputs is studied, where variables are sparsely probed. We show that the NNO is able to track states even when probes are contaminated with random noise or with sensors at insufficient sample rates to match the control time step. Then, a confined cylinder flow is investigated, where velocity signals along the cylinder wake are estimated by using a small set of wall pressure sensors. In both the KS and cylinder problems, we show that the estimated states can be used to enable closed-loop control, taking advantage of stabilizing NNCs. Finally, we present a legacy dataset of a turbulent boundary layer experiment, where convolutional NNs (CNNs) are employed to implement the models required for the estimation loop. We show that, by combining low-resolution noise-corrupted sensor data with an imperfect NNSM, it is possible to produce more accurate estimates, outperforming both the direct reconstructions via specialized super-resolution NNs and the direct model propagation from initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Distributed Incast Detection in Data Center Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incast traffic in data centers can lead to severe performance degradation, such as packet loss and increased latency. Effectively addressing incast requires prompt and accurate detection. Existing solutions, including MA-ECN, BurstRadar and Pulser, typically rely on fixed thresholds of switch port egress queue lengths or their gradients to identify microburst caused by incast flows. However, these queue length related methods often suffer from delayed detection and high error rates. In this study, we propose a distributed incast detection method for data center networks at the switch-level, leveraging a probabilistic hypothesis test with an optimal detection threshold. By analyzing the arrival intervals of new flows, our algorithm can immediately determine if a flow is part of an incast traffic from its initial packet. The experimental results demonstrate that our method offers significant improvements over existing approaches in both detection speed and inference accuracy.</description>

      <title>D2-UC: A Distributed-Distributed Quantum-Classical Framework for Unit Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces D2-UC, a quantum-ready framework for the unit commitment (UC) problem that prepares UC for near-term hybrid quantum-classical solvers by combining distributed classical decomposition with distributed quantum execution. We reformulate deterministic and stochastic UC into a three-block alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM): (i) a convex quadratic subproblem for dispatch and reserves, (ii) a binary subproblem expressed as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and (iii) a proximal slack update for consensus. The core contributions are fivefold. First, we demonstrate how the full UC problem can be expressed as a single monolithic QUBO, establishing a direct interface to quantum solvers. Second, we decompose this large binary block into three type-specific QUBOs for commitment, startup, and shutdown, making the problem more tractable but revealing slower ADMM convergence. Third, we restore local logical couplings through per-unit-time micro-QUBOs, which accelerate convergence. Fourth, we batch micro-QUBOs into K non-overlapping block-diagonal problems, reducing many subproblems to a fixed number of solver-ready QUBOs per iteration, compatible with distributed variational quantum eigensolvers (DVQE). Fifth, we integrate an accept-if-better safeguard with DVQE to stabilize hybrid updates and prevent oscillations. Case studies confirm that the proposed methods deliver feasible schedules, faster convergence, and QUBO sizes aligned with current and near-term quantum hardware capabilities.

      <title>Control Barrier Function for Aligning Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03121v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a control-based framework for aligning large language models (LLMs) by leveraging a control barrier function (CBF) to ensure user-desirable text generation. The presented framework applies the CBF safety filter to the predicted token generated from the baseline LLM, to intervene in the generated text. The safety filter includes two significant advantages: this safety filter is an add-on type, allowing it to be used for alignment purposes without fine-tuning the baseline LLM, and if there is an evaluation model regarding the desired alignment, it can be directly applied to the filter design. The overall text-generation system is implemented with open-source language models, aiming to generate positive text.</description>

      <title>Frequency- and Amplitude-Modulated Gates for Universal Quantum Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates is essential for executing arbitrary digital quantum algorithms and for building error-corrected quantum computers. We propose a theoretical framework for implementing quantum gates using frequency- and amplitude-modulated microwave control, which extends conventional amplitude modulation by introducing frequency modulation as an additional degree of control. Our approach operates on fixed-frequency qubits, converting the need for qubit frequency tunability into drive frequency modulation. Using Floquet theory, we analyze and design these drives for optimal fidelity within specified criteria. Our framework spans adiabatic to nonadiabatic gates within the Floquet framework, ensuring broad applicability across gate types and control schemes. Using typical transmon qubit parameters in numerical simulations, we demonstrate a universal gate set-including the X, Hadamard, phase, and CZ gates-with control error well below 0.1% and gate times of 25-40 ns for single-qubit operations and 125-135 ns for two-qubit operations. Furthermore, we show an always-on CZ gate tailored for driven qubits, which has gate times of 80-90 ns.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Assembly Policy Learning of a Sightless Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) task involving the joint insertion of a board into a frame by a sightless robot and a human operator. While admittance control is commonly used in pHRC tasks, it can be challenging to measure the force/torque applied by the human for accurate human intent estimation, limiting the robot's ability to assist in the collaborative task. Other methods that attempt to solve pHRC tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) are also unsuitable for the board-insertion task due to its safety constraints and sparse rewards. Therefore, we propose a novel RL approach that utilizes a human-designed admittance controller to facilitate more active robot behavior and reduce human effort. Through simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms admittance control in terms of success rate and task completion time. Additionally, we observed a significant reduction in measured force/torque when using our proposed approach compared to admittance control.

Abstract: For a given set $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{C}$, a matrix pair $(E,A)$ is called $\Omega$-admissible if it is regular, impulse-free and its eigenvalues lie inside the region $\Omega$. In this paper, we provide a dissipative Hamiltonian characterization for the matrix pairs that are $\Omega$-admissible where $\Omega$ is an LMI region. We then use these results for solving the nearest $\Omega$-admissible matrix pair problem: Given a matrix pair $(E,A)$, find the nearest $\Omega$-admissible pair $(\tilde E, \tilde A)$ to the given pair $(E,A)$. We illustrate our results on several data sets and compare with the state of the art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable generation introduces uncertainty into power systems, challenging traditional deterministic optimization methods. Chance-constrained optimization offers an approach to balancing cost and risk; however, incorporating joint chance constraints introduces computational challenges. This paper presents an ensemble support vector machine surrogate for joint chance constraint optimal power flow, where multiple linear classifiers are trained on simulated optimal power flow data and embedded as tractable hyperplane constraints via Big--M reformulations. The surrogate yields a polyhedral approximation of probabilistic line flow limits that preserves interpretability and scalability. Numerical experiments on the IEEE 118-bus system show that the proposed method achieves near-optimal costs with a negligible average error of $0.03\%$. These results demonstrate the promise of ensemble surrogates as efficient and transparent tools for risk-aware optimization of power systems.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Over-Approximation Errors as Preview Information for Nonlinear Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the control of nonlinear constrained systems via over-approximations. Our key observation is that the over-approximation error, rather than being an unknown disturbance, can be exploited as input-dependent preview information. This leads to the notion of informed policies, which depend on both the state and the error. We formulate the concretization problem -- recovering a valid input for the true system from a preview-based policy -- as a fixed-point equation. Existence of solutions follows from the Brouwer fixed-point theorem, while efficient computation is enabled through closed-form, linear, or convex programs for input-affine systems, and through an iterative method based on the Banach fixed-point theorem for nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Manifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Learning for Decentralized Multi-Agent Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe multi-agent motion planning (MAMP) under task-induced constraints is a critical challenge in robotics. Many real-world scenarios require robots to navigate dynamic environments while adhering to manifold constraints imposed by tasks. For example, service robots must carry cups upright while avoiding collisions with humans or other robots. Despite recent advances in decentralized MAMP for high-dimensional systems, incorporating manifold constraints remains difficult. To address this, we propose a manifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) learning framework for decentralized MAMP. Our method solves HJR problems under manifold constraints to capture task-aware safety conditions, which are then integrated into a decentralized trajectory optimization planner. This enables robots to generate motion plans that are both safe and task-feasible without requiring assumptions about other agents' policies. Our approach generalizes across diverse manifold-constrained tasks and scales effectively to high-dimensional multi-agent manipulation problems. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing constrained motion planners and operates at speeds suitable for real-world applications.

      <title>Tensor-Efficient High-Dimensional Q-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional reinforcement learning faces challenges with complex calculations and low sample efficiency in large state-action spaces. Q-learning algorithms struggle particularly with the curse of dimensionality, where the number of state-action pairs grows exponentially with problem size. While neural network-based approaches like Deep Q-Networks have shown success, recent tensor-based methods using low-rank decomposition offer more parameter-efficient alternatives. Building upon existing tensor-based methods, we propose Tensor-Efficient Q-Learning (TEQL), which enhances low-rank tensor decomposition via improved block coordinate descent on discretized state-action spaces, incorporating novel exploration and regularization mechanisms. The key innovation is an exploration strategy that combines approximation error with visit count-based upper confidence bound to prioritize actions with high uncertainty, avoiding wasteful random exploration. Additionally, we incorporate a frequency-based penalty term in the objective function to encourage exploration of less-visited state-action pairs and reduce overfitting to frequently visited regions. Empirical results on classic control tasks demonstrate that TEQL outperforms conventional matrix-based methods and deep RL approaches in both sample efficiency and total rewards, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications, such as space and healthcare where sampling costs are high.</description>

      <title>Geometrically robust least squares through manifold optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for solving a geometrically robust least squares problem, which arises in various applications where the model is subject to geometric constraints. The problem is formulated as a minimax optimization problem on a product manifold, where one variable is constrained to a ball describing uncertainty. To handle the constraint, an exact penalty method is applied. A first-order gradient descent ascent algorithm is proposed to solve the problem, and its convergence properties are illustrated by an example. The proposed method offers a robust approach to solving a wide range of problems arising in signal processing and data-driven control.</description>

      <title>Flying Robotics Art: ROS-based Drone Draws the Record-Breaking Mural</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the innovative design and successful deployment of a pioneering autonomous unmanned aerial system developed for executing the world's largest mural painted by a drone. Addressing the dual challenges of maintaining artistic precision and operational reliability under adverse outdoor conditions such as wind and direct sunlight, our work introduces a robust system capable of navigating and painting outdoors with unprecedented accuracy. Key to our approach is a novel navigation system that combines an infrared (IR) motion capture camera and LiDAR technology, enabling precise location tracking tailored specifically for largescale artistic applications. We employ a unique control architecture that uses different regulation in tangential and normal directions relative to the planned path, enabling precise trajectory tracking and stable line rendering. We also present algorithms for trajectory planning and path optimization, allowing for complex curve drawing and area filling. The system includes a custom-designed paint spraying mechanism, specifically engineered to function effectively amidst the turbulent airflow generated by the drone's propellers, which also protects the drone's critical components from paint-related damage, ensuring longevity and consistent performance. Experimental results demonstrate the system's robustness and precision in varied conditions, showcasing its potential for autonomous large-scale art creation and expanding the functional applications of robotics in creative fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper integrates a clearing function (CF)-based release planning approach into Material Requirements Planning (MRP) to address its limitations in modeling capacity constraints and dynamic lead times. The proposed optimization model replaces MRP's backward scheduling step while preserving its overall structure. Performance is evaluated through simulation experiments on two flow shop systems that explore a range of demand uncertainties and utilization levels. Computational results show that the proposed approach is capable of yielding significant improvements over the conventional backward scheduling approach, due to its ability to compute planned lead times for individual production orders as opposed to BOM items.</description>

      <title>Reactive power flow optimization in AC drive systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores a limit avoidance approach in the case of input (modulation) and output (current) constraints with the aim of enhancing system availability of AC drives. Drawing on the observation that, in a certain range of reactive power, there exists a trade-off between current and modulation magnitude, we exploit this freedom and define a constrained optimization problem. We propose two approaches, one in the form of an activation-function which drives the reactive power set-point towards safety, and an approach which uses online feedback optimization to set the reactive power dynamically. Both methods compromise reactive power tracking accuracy for increased system robustness. Through a high fidelity simulation, we compare the benefits of the two methods, highlighting their effectiveness in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Bayes approach to ARX Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical Bayes inference is based on estimation of the parameters of an a priori distribution from the observed data. The estimation technique of the parameters of the prior, called hyperparameters, is based on the marginal distribution obtained by integrating the joint density of the model with respect to the prior. This is a key step which needs to be properly adapted to the problem at hand. In this paper we study Empirical Bayes inference of linear autoregressive models with inputs (ARX models) for time series and compare the performance of the marginal parametric estimator with that a full Empirical Bayesian analysis based on the estimated prior. Such a comparison, can only make sense for a (realistic) finite data length. In this setting, we propose a new estimation technique of the hyperparameters by a sequential Bayes procedure which is essentially a backward Kalman filter. It turns out that for finite data length the marginal Bayes tends to behave slightly better than the full Empirical Bayesian parameter estimator and so also in the case of slowly varying random parameters.</description>

      <title>Recurrent neural network-based robust control systems with closed-loop regional incremental ISS and application to MPC design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the design of output-feedback schemes for systems described by a class of recurrent neural networks. We propose a procedure based on linear matrix inequalities for designing an observer and a static state-feedback controller. The algorithm leverages global and regional incremental input-to-state stability (incremental ISS) and enables the tracking of constant setpoints, ensuring robustness to disturbances and state estimation uncertainty. To address the potential limitations of regional incremental ISS, we introduce an alternative scheme in which the static law is replaced with a tube-based nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) that exploits regional incremental ISS properties. We show that these conditions enable the formulation of a robust NMPC law with guarantees of convergence and recursive feasibility, leading to an enlarged region of attraction. Theoretical results are validated through numerical simulations on the pH-neutralisation process benchmark.</description>

      <title>Accounting for Subsystem Aging Variability in Battery Energy Storage System Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a degradation-cost-aware optimization framework for multi-string battery energy storage systems, emphasizing the impact of inhomogeneous subsystem-level aging in operational decision-making. We evaluate four scenarios for an energy arbitrage scenario, that vary in model precision and treatment of aging costs. Key performance metrics include operational revenue, power schedule mismatch, missed revenues, capacity losses, and revenue generated per unit of capacity loss. Our analysis reveals that ignoring heterogeneity of subunits may lead to infeasible dispatch plans and reduced revenues. In contrast, combining accurate representation of degraded subsystems and the consideration of aging costs in the objective function improves operational accuracy and economic efficiency of BESS with heterogeneous aged subunits. The fully informed scenario, which combines aging-cost-aware optimization with precise string-level modeling, achieves 21% higher revenue per unit of SOH loss compared to the baseline scenario. These findings highlight that modeling aging heterogeneity is not just a technical refinement but may become a crucial enabler for maximizing both short-term profitability and long-term asset value in particular for long BESS usage scenarios.</description>

      <title>PGD-based optimization of 3D bobsleigh track centerlines from 2D centerlines for simulation applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The centerline of a bobsleigh track defines its geometry and is essential for simulation modeling. To reduce bBobsleigh training costs, leveraging the centerline of the bobsleigh track to construct a virtual environment that closely replicates real competitive settings presents a promising solution. However, publicly available centerline data are typically limited and it is imprecise to construct a training system solely based on 2-dimensional (2D) centerline. To address this practical issue, this paper proposes a method for generating a 3-dimensional (3D) track centerline based on 2D centerline data. Incorporating international track design regulations, the method formulates an optimization problem that considers total track length, height difference, slope constraints, and geometric continuity. A Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. The generated 3D centerlines are compared with real track data, and the results show that the method can reproduce realistic centerline trends from original or scaled 2D data. For the selected track segment, the relative errors in total length, height difference, and average slope are within 1.7%, 3.2% and 4.1%, respectively, for real 2D data and within 1.1%, 3.5% and 4.3% respectively for scaled data. All slope values remain within the allowable limits. Moreover, by adjusting the segmentation or modifying the weight of height difference in the cost function, various centerline styles applicable to different competitions can be generated. Under different segmentation and weight factors, the maximum errors reach up to 4.4%, 4.8%, and 9.8%, and 4.4%, 4.8%, and 10.0%, respectively. The proposed method provides a flexible and efficient tool for supporting bobsleigh track centerline design.</description>

      <title>Improving the Accuracy of DC Optimal Power Flow Formulations via Parameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) problems optimize the generators' active power setpoints while satisfying constraints based on the DC power flow linearization. The computational tractability advantages of DC-OPF problems come at the expense of inaccuracies relative to AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problems that accurately model the nonlinear steady-state behavior of power grids. This paper proposes an algorithm that significantly improves the accuracy of the generators' active power setpoints from DC-OPF problems with respect to the corresponding AC-OPF problems over a specified range of operating conditions. Using sensitivity information in a machine learning-inspired methodology, this algorithm tunes coefficient and bias parameters in the DC power flow approximation to improve the accuracy of the resulting DC-OPF solutions. Employing the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) method -- a Quasi-Newton optimization technique -- this parameter tuning occurs during an offline training phase, with the resulting parameters then used in online computations. Numerical results underscore the algorithm's efficacy with accuracy improvements in squared two-norm and $\infty$-norm losses of up to $90\%$ and $79\%$, respectively, relative to traditional DC-OPF formulations.</description>

      <title>Proximal Gradient Dynamics and Feedback Control for Equality-Constrained Composite Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies equality-constrained composite minimization problems. This class of problems, capturing regularization terms and inequality constraints, naturally arises in a wide range of engineering and machine learning applications. To tackle these optimization problems, inspired by recent results, we introduce the \emph{proportional--integral proximal gradient dynamics} (PI--PGD): a closed-loop system where the Lagrange multipliers are control inputs and states are the problem decision variables. First, we establish the equivalence between the stationary points of the minimization problem and the equilibria of the PI--PGD. Then for the case of affine constraints, by leveraging tools from contraction theory we give a comprehensive convergence analysis for the dynamics, showing linear--exponential convergence towards the equilibrium. That is, the distance between each solution and the equilibrium is upper bounded by a function that first decreases linearly and then exponentially. Our findings are illustrated numerically on a set of representative examples, which include an exploratory application to nonlinear equality constraints.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Push-sum Dual Gradient Algorithm in Distributed Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the distributed model predictive control (DMPC) problem for distributed discrete-time linear systems with both local and global constraints over directed communication networks. We establish an optimization problem to formulate the DMPC policy, including the design of terminal ingredients. To cope with the global constraint, we transform the primal optimization problem into its dual problem. Then, we propose a novel asynchronous push-sum dual gradient (APDG) algorithm with an adaptive step-size scheme to solve this dual problem in a fully asynchronous distributed manner. The proposed algorithm does not require synchronous waiting and any form of coordination, which greatly improves solving efficiency. We prove that the APDG algorithm converges at an R-linear rate as long as the step-size does not exceed the designed upper bound. Furthermore, we develop a distributed termination criterion to terminate the APDG algorithm when its output solution satisfies the specified suboptimality and the global constraint, thereby avoiding an infinite number of iterations. The recursive feasibility and the stability of the closed-loop system are also established. Finally, a numerical example is provided to clarify and validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Human-Exoskeleton Kinematic Calibration to Improve Hand Tracking for Dexterous Teleoperation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hand exoskeletons are critical tools for dexterous teleoperation and immersive manipulation interfaces, but achieving accurate hand tracking remains a challenge due to user-specific anatomical variability and donning inconsistencies. These issues lead to kinematic misalignments that degrade tracking performance and limit applicability in precision tasks. We propose a subject-specific calibration framework for exoskeleton-based hand tracking that estimates virtual link parameters through residual-weighted optimization. A data-driven approach is introduced to empirically tune cost function weights using motion capture ground truth, enabling accurate and consistent calibration across users. Implemented on the Maestro hand exoskeleton with seven healthy participants, the method achieved substantial reductions in joint and fingertip tracking errors across diverse hand geometries. Qualitative visualizations using a Unity-based virtual hand further demonstrate improved motion fidelity. The proposed framework generalizes to exoskeletons with closed-loop kinematics and minimal sensing, laying the foundation for high-fidelity teleoperation and robot learning applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become integral enablers for the Internet of Things (IoT) by offering enhanced coverage, improved connectivity and access to remote areas. A critical challenge limiting their operational capacity lies in the energy constraints of both aerial platforms and ground-based sensors. This paper explores WLPT as a transformative solution for sustainable energy provisioning in UAV-assisted IoT networks. We first systematically investigate the fundamental principles of WLPT and analysis the comparative advantages. Then, we introduce three operational paradigms for system integration, identify key challenges, and discuss corresponding potential solutions. In case study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to address the coordination and optimization challenges in WLPT-enabled UAV-assisted IoT data collection. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves energy sustainability and data freshness. Finally, we discuss some future directions.</description>

      <title>On Improvisation and Open-Endedness: Insights for Experiential AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improvisation-the art of spontaneous creation that unfolds moment-to-moment without a scripted outcome-requires practitioners to continuously sense, adapt, and create anew. It is a fundamental mode of human creativity spanning music, dance, and everyday life. The open-ended nature of improvisation produces a stream of novel, unrepeatable moments-an aspect highly valued in artistic creativity. In parallel, open-endedness (OE)-a system's capacity for unbounded novelty and endless "interestingness"-is exemplified in natural or cultural evolution and has been considered "the last grand challenge" in artificial life (ALife). The rise of generative AI now raises the question in computational creativity (CC) research: What makes a "good" improvisation for AI? Can AI learn to improvise in a genuinely open-ended way? In this work-in-progress paper, we report insights from in-depth interviews with 6 experts in improvisation across dance, music, and contact improvisation. We draw systemic connections between human improvisational arts and the design of future experiential AI agents that could improvise alone or alongside humans-or even with other AI agents-embodying qualities of improvisation drawn from practice: active listening (umwelt and awareness), being in the time (mindfulness and ephemerality), embracing the unknown (source of randomness and serendipity), non-judgmental flow (acceptance and dynamical stability, balancing structure and surprise (unpredictable criticality at edge of chaos), imaginative metaphor (synaesthesia and planning), empathy, trust, boundary, and care (mutual theory of mind), and playfulness and intrinsic motivation (maintaining interestingness).</description>
