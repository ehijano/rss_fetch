      <title>Using simulation based inference on tidally perturbed dwarf galaxies: the dynamics of NGC205</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach to performing precision inference on tidally perturbed dwarf galaxies. We use a Bayesian inference framework of implicit likelihood inference, previously applied mainly in the field of cosmology, based on forward simulation, data compression, and likelihood emulation with neural density estimators. We consider the case of NGC205, a satellite of M31. NGC205 exhibits an S-shape in the mean line-of-sight velocity along its semi-major spatial axis, suggestive of tidal perturbation. We demonstrate that this velocity profile can be qualitatively reproduced even if NGC205 was in a spherically symmetric and isotropic state before its most recent pericenter passage. We apply our inference method to mock data and show that the precise shape of a perturbed satellite's sky-projected internal velocity field can be highly informative of both its orbit and total mass density profile, even in the absence of proper motion information. For the actual NGC205, our method is hampered because the available data only covers a line along its semi-major axis, rather than the full sky-projected field. This shortcoming could be addressed with another round of observations.</description>

      <title>Galaxy infall models for arbitrary velocity directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For most galaxies in the cosmos, our knowledge of their motion is limited to line-of-sight velocities from redshift observations. Peculiar motions on the sky are only measured for a few cases. With increasingly detailed observations, the assumption that line-of-sight velocities suffice for an accurate and precise reconstruction of galaxy kinematics needs to be re-investigated and the impact of perpendicular velocities to be quantified. We analyse the motion of two galaxies with arbitrary velocities, determine their mutual velocity on an arbitrary background, and compare this general relative velocity to the one from line-of-sight components only. The latter are known as ``minor and major infall models'' established by Karachentsev and Kashibadze (2006). Our derivations reveal that the infall models approximate the radial velocity between two galaxies by two different projections employing different information about the system. For galaxies with small angular separations, all infall models agree that the radial velocity is the difference of their line-of-sight velocities. For larger angles, the minor infall model is mostly suitable when perpendicular velocity components are negligible and there is no information about the tangential velocity of the binary. The major infall model is best suitable when the motion is mainly radial and symmetry assumptions cancel the tangential and one perpendicular component. The latter often requires to transition from galaxy binaries to groups or clusters, as we show quantitatively. We give an encompassing overview how the infall models over- and under-estimate general binary or $N$-body motions. We quantify the impact of perpendicular velocity components, sparse sampling, and deviations of the tracer-galaxies from the motion in an embedding gravitational potential which are related to the angular momentum of the structure.

      <title>The Hubble Space Telescope Survey of M31 Satellite Galaxies IV. Survey Overview and Lifetime Star Formation Histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From $&gt;1000$ orbits of HST imaging, we present deep homogeneous resolved star color-magnitude diagrams that reach the oldest main sequence turnoff and uniformly measured star formation histories (SFHs) of 36 dwarf galaxies ($-6 \ge M_V \ge -17$) associated with the M31 halo, and for 10 additional fields in M31, M33, and the Giant Stellar Stream. From our SFHs we find: i) the median stellar age and quenching epoch of M31 satellites correlate with galaxy luminosity and galactocentric distance. Satellite luminosity and present-day distance from M31 predict the satellite quenching epoch to within $1.8$ Gyr at all epochs. This tight relationship highlights the fundamental connection between satellite halo mass, environmental history, and star formation duration. ii) There is no difference between the median SFH of galaxies on and off the great plane of Andromeda satellites. iii) $\sim50$\% of our M31 satellites show prominent ancient star formation ($&gt;12$ Gyr ago) followed by delayed quenching ($8-10$ Gyr ago), which is not commonly observed among the MW satellites. iv) A comparison with TNG50 and FIRE-2 simulated satellite dwarfs around M31-like hosts show that some of these trends (dependence of SFH on satellite luminosity) are reproduced in the simulations while others (dependence of SFH on galactocentric distance, presence of the delayed-quenching population) are weaker or absent. We provide all photometric catalogs and SFHs as High-Level Science Products on MAST.</description>

      <title>The Environmental Quenching Mechanisms of Field Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field dwarf galaxies not actively forming stars are relatively rare in the local Universe, but are present in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We use the TNG50 simulation to investigate their origin and find that they all result from environmental effects that have removed or reduced their gas content. Quenched field dwarfs consist of either backsplash objects ejected from a massive host or of systems that have lost their gas after crossing overdense regions such as filaments or sheets (``cosmic web stripping''). Quenched fractions rise steeply with decreasing stellar mass, with quenched systems making up roughly $\sim 15\%$ of all field dwarfs (i.e., excluding satellites) with stellar masses $10^{7}&lt;M_{\star}/M_{\odot}&lt;10^{9}$. This fraction drops to only $\sim1\%$ when a strict isolation criterion that requires no neighbours with $M_{\star}&gt;10^9\, M_{\odot}$ within {$1.5$} Mpc is applied. Of these isolated dwarfs, $\sim 6\%$ are backsplash, while the other $\sim 94\%$ have been affected by the cosmic web. Backsplash systems are more deficient in dark matter, have retained less or no gas, and have stopped forming stars earlier than cosmic web-stripped systems. The discovery of deeply isolated dwarf galaxies which were quenched relatively recently would lend observational support to the prediction that the cosmic web is capable of inducing the cessation of star formation in dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium ionization in the multiphase circumgalactic medium -- impact on quasar absorption-line analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an updated framework for studying the ionizing conditions and elemental abundances of photoionized, metal-enriched quasar absorption systems. The standard assumption of ionization equilibrium invoked in absorption line analyses requires gas to cool on longer timescales than ionic recombination (t_cool &gt;&gt; t_rec). However, this assumption may not be valid at high metallicities due to enhanced cooling losses. This work presents a suite of time-dependent photoionization (TDP) models that self-consistently solve for the ionization state of rapidly cooling gas irradiated by the extragalactic ultraviolet background (UVB). The updated framework explores various revised UVBs from recent studies, a range of initial temperatures, and different elemental abundance patterns to quantify the effects of TDP on the observed ion fractions. A metal-enriched ($\mathrm{[\alpha/H]}=0.6_{-0.1}^{+0.2}$) C IV absorption system at z ~ 1 previously studied using photoionization equilibrium (PIE) models is re-examined under the TDP framework. The main findings are as follows: (1) varying prescriptions for the underlying UVB or adopting initial temperatures T_0 &lt; 1e6 K change TDP ion fractions by up to a factor of three, but the adopted relative elemental abundance pattern affects ion fractions by at most 40%; (2) the inferred gas densities are consistent between PIE and TDP, but under TDP solar metallicity cannot be ruled out at more than 2-$\sigma$ significance and a modest non-solar $\mathrm{[C/\alpha]} = 0.2$ is needed to explain the observed relative ion abundances. Extending the TDP analyses to a larger sample of super-solar absorption components with high signal-to-noise absorption spectra is needed to quantify the fraction of metal absorbers originating in rapid cooling gas.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Look at a Trio of Changing-Look Quasars: Spectral Energy Distributions and the Dust Extinction Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changing-look quasars exhibit dramatic variability in broad emission-line fluxes on short timescales. This behavior is challenging to many models of the quasar broad line region, due in large part to the short transition times between high and low states. In order to constrain the cause of the dramatic variability, we obtained contemporaneous Hubble Space Telescope UV and Hobby Eberly Telescope optical spectra of three changing-look quasars caught in their low state. We use these spectra, along with archival spectra taken during both the high and low states, to investigate potential scenarios for the change in state. Our data strongly disfavor a variable dust obscuration scenario for these three CLQs, and instead suggest that the observed transformation reflects a change in the intrinsic luminosity of the central engine. We also find that the low-state spectral energy distributions of all three quasars are reminiscent of those of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, which suggests that the transition may result from a change in accretion flow structure caused by a reduced Eddington ratio.</description>

      <title>Resolution Dependence of Cloud-Wind Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a set of wind-tunnel simulations, we investigate the effect that numerical resolution has on cloud evolution and acceleration. We also consider the role of wind speed in both the subsonic and supersonic regimes, using adiabatic simulations with wind speeds of 100 km/s and 1000 km/s, respectively. For each setup, we explore five numerical resolutions. We find that the fate of the cloud is significantly affected by the resolution, but the trend is surprisingly non-monotonic. In the subsonic case, we find that a resolution of 16 cells per cloud radius is a turning point in the cloud evolution. In the supersonic case the trend is more monotonic, consistent with the difference in timescales for which ram pressure acceleration dominates over mixing in the early acceleration.</description>

      <title>A New Measure of Assembly Bias: The Environment Dependence of the Luminosity Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assembly bias is the variation of clustering induced by correlations between the assembly history of dark matter halos and the large-scale environment at fixed halo mass. In this work, we use the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG300 to investigate how assembly bias affects the environment-dependent galaxy luminosity function. We measure the luminosity functions in bins of large-scale environment for the original simulated galaxy sample and for a shuffled sample, where the galaxies are randomly reassigned among halos of similar mass to remove assembly bias. By comparing them, we find distinct signatures, showing variations in the number of galaxies at the $\sim10\%$ level across all luminosities. Assembly bias increases the tendency of galaxies to reside in denser environments and further dilutes underdense regions, beyond the trends governed by halo mass. When separating by color, we see that assembly bias has a much bigger effect on red galaxies fainter than $\mathrm{M_r} - 5 \log{h} = -18.5$, which accounts for a $\sim20\%$ increase in the number of galaxies in the densest environment and a remarkable $50\%$ decrease in the least dense regions. The ratio of these measurements for the densest and least dense regions provides a robust assembly bias signal for the faint red galaxies, larger than a factor of two. Overall, our results provide a novel sensitive measure of assembly bias, offering valuable insight for modeling the effect and a potential new route to detect it in observations.</description>

      <title>Simulations of the accreted stellar halos of low-mass field galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the properties of stellar halos in galaxies of present-day virial mass $10^8 &lt; M_{200} &lt; 10^{12} {\rm M_\odot}$ by combining the GALFORM semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, the COCO cosmological N-body simulation, and the STINGS particle tagging technique. Galaxies in low mass halos have a wide range of stellar halo properties. Their diversity is much greater at fixed stellar mass than fixed virial mass. In the least massive DM halos capable of supporting galaxy formation, accreted mass fractions are &lt; 10 per cent, and the typical density profile of accreted stars is similar to that of stars formed in situ. In low mass galaxies, the radial scale lengths of accreted stellar halos are smaller than those of stellar disks formed in situ, but the accreted component is still diffuse, not bulge-like. At the scale of galaxies like M33, the surface density of accreted stars exceeds that of the in situ component at ~15kpc; the accreted surface density at this radius is $3.5\lesssim \log_{10} M_\star/{\rm M_\odot} \mathrm{kpc^{-2}} \lesssim 6$, varying systematically with virial mass. We compare our predictions to observations and other cosmological simulations. A small but significant number of $\sim 10^{12} {\rm M_\odot}$ halos with exceptionally inefficient star formation -- "failed Milky Ways" -- are more prominent in our model than others; the true abundance of this population is a potential constraint on galaxy formation physics and could be measured by low surface brightness surveys targeting field galaxies with M33-like stellar mass. The stellar particle data for our simulation is publicly available.</description>

      <title>What is Inside the Double-Double Structure of the Radio Galaxy J0028+0035?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radio source J0028+0035 is a recently discovered double--double radio galaxy at redshift z=0.398. Its relic outer lobes are separated by about 3' in the sky, corresponding to ~1 Mpc projected linear size. Inside this large-scale structure, the inner pair of collinear lobes span about 100 kpc. In the arcsec-resolution radio images of J0028+0035, there is a central radio feature that offers the intriguing possibility of being resolved into a pc-scale, third pair of innermost lobes. This would make this radio galaxy a rare triple-double source where traces of three distinct episodes of radio activity could be observed. To reveal the compact radio structure of the central component, we conducted observation with the European Very Long Baseline Interferometer Network and the enhanced Multi Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network. Our 1.66 GHz image with high (~5 milliarcsec) resolution shows a compact central radio core with no indication of a third, innermost double feature. The observation performed in multi-phase-centre mode also revealed that the physically unrelated but in projection closely separated background source 5BZU J0028+0035 has a single weak, somewhat resolved radio feature, at odds with its blazar classification.</description>

      <title>Alpha-element abundance patterns in star-forming regions of the local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) We reassess the alpha-element abundance ratios (Ne/O, S/O, Ar/O) with respect to metallicity in ~1000 spectra of Galactic and extragalactic HII regions and star-forming galaxies (SFGs) of the local Universe. Using the DEep Spectra of Ionised REgions Database (DESIRED) Extended project (DESIRED-E), which includes spectra with direct electron temperature determinations, we homogeneously derive physical conditions and chemical abundances for all objects. Various ionisation correction factor (ICF) schemes are analyzed for Ne, S, and Ar to identify the most reliable abundance estimates. Our findings indicate that the ICF scheme by Izotov et al. (2006) better reproduces the Ne/O, S/O, and Ar/O trends. Ne/O ratios in HII regions display large dispersion and no clear dependence on O/H, suggesting that current ICF(Ne) schemes fail for these objects. However, SFGs show consistent linear relations with slightly positive slopes for log(Ne/O) vs. 12+log(O/H) or 12+log(Ne/H), likely influenced by metallicity-dependent O dust depletion and ICF effects. The log(S/O) vs. 12+log(O/H) distribution is largely constant, especially for HII regions or combined samples (SFGs + HII regions). Conversely, log(S/O) vs. 12+log(S/H) shows a tight linear fit with a positive slope, flattening at 12+log(S/H) &lt; 6.0, suggesting S contributions from SNe Ia. For log(Ar/O) vs. 12+log(O/H), similar trends emerge for HII regions and SFGs, independent of ionisation degree or ICF(Ar). A slight log(Ar/O) decrease with increasing 12+log(O/H) contrasts with log(Ar/O) vs. 12+log(Ar/H), which shows a small positive slope, indicating a possible minor Ar contribution from SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>ATLASGAL-selected high-mass clumps in the inner Galaxy: XI. Morphology and kinematics of warm inner envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) Massive stellar embryos are embedded in warm envelopes that provide mass reservoirs for the accretion process onto final stars. Feedback from star formation activities in return impacts the properties of the envelopes, offering us a unique opportunity to investigate star formation processes. We aim to characterise the warm envelopes of proto- or young stellar objects in different evolutionary stages based on the morphology and kinematics of the $^{13}$CO(6-5) emission and to examine their relations with star formation processes. Using the APEX telescope, we obtained maps of the mid-$J$ $^{13}$CO emission with an angular size of 80" x 80" towards 99 massive clumps from the ATLASGAL survey. Our maps are classified based on morphological complexities, and the radial structure of the emission is characterised for simple single-core sources. The velocity centroids of the emission are compared to small- and large-scale gas kinematics, aiming to shed light on the origin of envelope kinematics. $^{13}$CO(6-5) emission is detected towards sources in all stages of high-mass star formation, with a detection rate of 83% for the whole sample. The detection rate, line width, and line peak increase with evolution, and the line luminosity is strongly correlated with $L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ and $M_{\mathrm{clump}}$, indicating that the excitation of $^{13}$CO(6-5) emission is closely related to star formation processes. In addition, the radial distributions of the emission for single-core sources can be well fitted by power-law functions, suggesting a relatively simple envelope structure for many sources. As for the envelope kinematics, linear velocity gradients are common among the single-core sources. Our comparison of kinematics on different scales suggests that the origin of the linear velocity gradients in the warm envelopes is complex and unclear for many sources.</description>

      <title>Considerations on the Origin of IRAS 19312+1950 Based on Long-Term Maser Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IRAS source 19312+1950 (hereafter I19312) is an infrared point source with maser emissions of SiO, H$_2$O, and OH molecules. Although initial observations suggested that I19312 might be an evolved star, its characteristics are not fully consistent with this classification. This study aims to further investigate the nature of I19312 by conducting long-term monitoring of its maser emissions and comparing the results with other known astrophysical objects. We conducted long-term monitoring of SiO, H$_2$O, and OH maser emissions using single-dish radio telescopes. The results were then compared with historical maser data and the characteristics of similar objects to infer the possible origin of I19312. The SiO maser emissions from I19312 were detected over a wide velocity range and exhibited significant time variability. The OH maser lines suggest characteristics of an evolved star, while the H$_2$O maser lines indicate molecular outflows. These features suggest that I19312 could be a candidate for a Water Fountain (WF) star, though there are inconsistencies, such as the large molecular gas mass, that challenge this hypothesis. The possibility of I19312 being a Red Nova Remnant (RNR) is also considered, but this remains speculative due to the lack of direct evidence. The evolutionary stage of I19312 remains unclear, but it shares multiple characteristics with both evolved stars with peculiar properties and RNRs. Further long-term monitoring and high-resolution interferometric observations are required to better constrain the nature of this object.</description>

      <title>Cold dark gas in Cygnus X: The first large-scale mapping of low-frequency carbon recombination lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the transition from atomic gas to molecular gas is critical to explain the formation and evolution of molecular clouds. However, the gas phases involved, cold HI and CO-dark molecular gas, are challenging to directly observe and physically characterize. We observed the Cygnus X star-forming complex in carbon radio recombination lines (CRRLs) at 274--399 MHz with the Green Bank Telescope at 21 pc (48') resolution. Of the 30 deg^2 surveyed, we detect line-synthesized C273alpha emission from 24 deg^2 and produce the first large-area maps of low-frequency CRRLs. The morphology of the C273alpha emission reveals arcs, ridges, and extended possibly sheet-like gas which are often on the outskirts of CO emission and likely transitioning from HI-to-H_2. The typical angular separation of C273alpha and 13CO emission is 12 pc, and we estimate C273alpha gas densities of n_H ~ 40 - 400 cm^3. The C273alpha line profiles are Gaussian and likely turbulent broadened, spanning a large range of FWHM from 2 to 20 km/s with a median of 10.6 km/s. Mach numbers fall within 10--30. The turbulent timescale is relatively short, 2.6 Myr, and we deduce that the turbulent pressure likely dominates the evolution of the C273alpha gas. Velocity offsets between C273alpha and 13CO components are apparent throughout the region and have a typical value of 2.9 km/s. Two regimes have emerged from the data: one regime in which C273alpha and 13CO are strongly related (at N_H ~ 4 x 10^21 cm^-2), and a second, in which C273alpha emits independently of the 13CO intensity. In the former regime, C273alpha may arise from the the envelopes of massive clouds (filaments), and in the latter, C273alpha emits from cold clumps in a more-diffuse mix of HI and H_2 gas.</description>

      <title>Exploring Various Dark Matter Halo Profiles in Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxies within the Framework of Standard Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the rotation curves of the Milky Way galaxy (MW) and Andromeda galaxy (M31) by considering its bulge, disk, and halo components. We model the bulge region by the widely accepted de Vaucouleur's law and the disk region by the well established exponential profile. In order to understand the distribution of dark matter in the halo region, we consider three different dark matter profiles in the framework of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model namely, Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), Hernquist and Einasto profiles. We use recent datasets of rotation curves of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxy. The data consist of rotation velocities of the stars and gas in the galaxy as a function of the radial distance from the center. Using Bayesian statistics, we perform an overall fit including all the components, i.e., bulge, disk and halo with the data. Our results indicate that the NFW and Hernquist profiles are in concordance with the observational data points. However, the Einasto profile poorly explains the behaviour of dark matter in both the galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Pitfalls of Using Lyman Alpha Damping Wings in High-z Galaxy Spectra to Measure the Intergalactic Neutral Hydrogen Fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyman Alpha damping wing is seen in absorption against the spectra of high-redshift galaxies. Modeling of this wing is a way to measure the volume neutral hydrogen fraction of the Universe, as well as to measure the strength of HI absorption in the form of a damped Ly{\alpha} absorber (DLA). We use very high-quality ultraviolet spectra of low-z galaxies to create mock high-redshift, low-resolution spectra complete with a damping wing resulting from the IGM and HI absorption from local, dense gas to mimic current James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the early universe. The simulated spectra are used to test the ability to recover the "true" values of the column density of the DLA (N_DLA) and the volume neutral hydrogen fraction (x_HI) of the IGM through modified stellar continuum fitting. We find that the ability to recover the true values of N_DLA and x_HI simultaneously is compromised by degeneracies between these two parameters, and the spectral shape itself at low-resolution (R~100). The root mean squared error between the recovered and true column density of the DLAs is on the order of 1 dex. This error somewhat decreases with improved resolution (R~1000), but systematically underestimates N_DLA when Ly{\alpha} emission is present in the mock spectra. The recovered values of x_HI are poorly constrained and do not improve substantially with the higher resolution. We recommend accounting for these sources of uncertainty and biases when using galaxies' Ly{\alpha} damping wings to measure the intergalactic neutral hydrogen fraction.</description>

      <title>HP2 Survey V. Ophiuchus: Filament formation in a dispersing cloud complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for potential ``birthmarks'' left from the formation of filamentary molecular clouds in the Ophiuchus complex. We use high dynamic-range column density and temperature maps derived from \textit{Herschel}, \textit{Planck}, and \textit{2MASS/NICEST} extinction data. We find two distinct types of filaments based on their orientation relative to nearby massive stars: radial (R-type) and tangential (T-type). R-type filaments exhibit decreasing mass profiles away from massive stars, while T-type filaments show flat but structured profiles. We propose a scenario where both filament types originate from the dynamic interplay of compression and stretching forces exerted by a fast outflow emanating from the OB association. The two formation mechanisms leave distinct observable ``birthmarks'' (namely, filament orientation, mass distribution, and star formation location) on each filament type. Our results illustrate a complex phase in molecular cloud evolution with two simultaneous yet contrasting processes: the formation of filaments and stars via the dispersal of residual gas from a previous massive star formation event. Our approach highlights the importance of taking into account the wider context of a star-forming complex, rather than concentrating exclusively on particular subregions.</description>

      <title>Two decades of optical variability of Small Magellanic Cloud high-mass X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the long-term optical/IR behavior of 111 high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud based on data from the OGLE collaboration. Most systems exhibit variability on a range of time scales. This variability regulates the mass transfer to the compact object, while the compact object can, in turn, affect the donor star's behavior. To better understand this complex interaction and the resulting X-ray properties in these systems, we define a new taxonomy for the observed super-orbital variability. This taxonomy connects to the color changes, orbital periods, and X-ray behavior of the sources. In most cases, these properties can be explained by differences between the flux of the disk around the Be star and the flux from the star itself. We also refine and present new potential orbital periods and sub-orbital variability in the sources.</description>

      <title>COOL Research DAO Whitepaper -- Towards community-owned astrophysics for everyone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysics forms a cornerstone of human curiosity and has revolutionised our understanding of the Universe. However, conventional academic structures often hinder collaboration, transparency, and discovery. We present COOL Research DAO, a next-generation framework for cosmic origins astrophysics research that uses decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) principles to make astrophysics research globally accessible, economically fair, and intellectually open. COOL Research DAO is designed to address four key systemic problems and their manifestations in traditional academic research: general inaccessibility, hierarchical organisation, unfair economic structures, and inefficient knowledge transfer. We describe how these inefficiencies can be addressed using blockchain-based tools and token systems. By fostering bottom-up governance, open-access knowledge networks, and transparent rewards, COOL Research DAO reshapes economic, organisational, and educational paradigms in astrophysics research. Our approach leverages the data-rich and inherently international nature of astrophysics, ensuring a scalable, collaborative platform that welcomes contributions ranging from computational analyses to public outreach. In doing so, we highlight a path toward realising our vision of a truly open research ecosystem, driven by community ownership, intellectual freedom, and shared fascination with our cosmic origins.</description>

      <title>Properties of Free Floating Planets Ejected through Planet-Planet Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple studies have shown that planet-planet scattering plays an important role in the dynamical evolution of planetary systems. For instance, it has been shown that planet-planet scattering can reproduce the eccentricity distribution of exoplanets. It can also contribute to the current census of free floating planets. In this work we run an ensemble of N-body simulations of planetary systems, and record the properties of planets which are ejected from the system. In our simulations we sample a wide range of orbital and physical properties of the planets. We find that in general $40-80\%$ of the planets are ejected from the system depending on the number of planets initially in the system. Most of the planets are ejected over a timescale of $\sim 10^8-10^9$ years. The ejected planets have a mean excess velocity in the range of 2-6 km/sec with respect to the host star. The excess velocities of the planets ejected from the system strongly depends on the semi-major axis of the inner most planet. We find that irrespective of their initial location in the planetary system, all planets are equally likely to be ejected from the system. Also, bound and ejected planets have distinct mass distributions, with bound planets being more massive than ejected planets. In addition, increasing the radii of the planets reduces the ejection fraction. The properties of the ejected planets do not strongly depend on the initial spacing between the planets. The timescale over which ejections happen does increase with the initial separation between the planets. We also find that the ejection fraction does not strongly depend on the distance from the host star beyond which the planets are considered unbound. Finally, we compared our results with observed populations of free floating planets. We conclude that on average 5-10 planets should form around each star to reproduce the observations.</description>

      <title>Testing tidal theory using Gaia binaries: the red giant branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal interaction is a major ingredient in the theory of binary evolution. Here, we study tidal circularization in binaries with red giant primaries. We compute the tidal evolution for binaries as their primary stars evolve along the red giant branch, under dissipation of dynamical tides in the convective envelope. We then compare this evolution with a sample of $\sim30,000$ red giant binaries reported by Gaia DR3. These binaries clearly show the expected gradual advance of tidal circularization, as the primary expands. But some tension with theory remains. While our calculations always predict a critical separation for tidal circularization at about $3-4$ times the stellar radii, binaries with less evolved giants are observed to be circularized out to about twice as far. They also exhibit an overly extended `cool island', a collection of circular orbits that reach a couple times beyond the circularization limit. These discrepancies are reminiscent of, but less severe than, the situation for main-sequence binaries. We also find that tides can spin giant stars up to rotation rates that should affect their mass-loss. Additionally, many binaries may begin mass transfer while still eccentric.</description>

      <title>The Nature and Evolution of Early Massive Quenched Galaxies in the Simba-C Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the nature, origin, and fate of early ($z\geq 2$) massive ($M_\star&gt;10^{10}M_\odot$) quenched galaxies (EQGs) in a new $(100h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}^3)$ run of the Simba-C galaxy formation model. We define ``quenched'' to be $&gt;4\sigma$ below an iterative polynomial fit to the star-forming sequence (SFS), and find that Simba-C produces EQGs as early as $z\sim 5$ and number densities agreeing with observations at $z\leq 3$ (though slightly low at $z\geq 4$). Using a photometric-based EQG selection or a fixed sSFR cut of $10^{-10}$yr$^{-1}$ yields similar results. EQGs predominantly arise in central galaxies with stellar mass $M_\star\sim 10^{10.5-11.3}M_\odot$, not necessarily the most massive systems. A UMAP projection shows that quenched galaxies have notably large black hole-to-stellar mass ratios, lower rotational support, and less dust, but are not atypical versus similar-mass non-EQGs in their environments, halo mass, or halo gas temperatures at the time of quenching. However, via galaxy tracking we show that the progenitor environments of EQGs are significantly more overdense than that of non-EQGs, which drives higher black hole mass fractions and stellar-to-halo mass ratios. This results in the Eddington ratio dropping sufficiently low for Simba-C's jet mode feedback to turn on, which quickly quenches the host galaxies. EQGs thus seem to be galaxies that grow their black holes quickly within highly dense environments, but end up in moderately-dense environments where black hole feedback can quench effectively. We find that $\geq 30\%$ of EQGs rejuvenate, but the rejuvenating fraction drops quickly at $z\leq 2$. By $z=0$ it is difficult to distinguish the descendants of EQGs vs. non-EQGs.</description>

      <title>Chemical enrichment by collapsars as the origin of the unusually high [Ba/Fe] in a massive star cluster of the dwarf galaxy NGC 1569</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The super star cluster NGC1569-B has recently been observed to have an extremely high [Ba/Fe]. We consider that the observed high [Ba/Fe] ($\sim$ 1.3) is due to the chemical enrichment of giant molecular clouds by either collapsars, neutron star mergers, or magneto-rotational supernovae, and thereby investigate which of the three polluters can best reproduce the observed [Ba/Fe]. Since it is found that collapsars can best reproduce such an extremely high Ba abundance, we numerically investigate the star cluster formation in NGC1569 using chemodynamical simulations of merging dwarf galaxies with chemical enrichment by collapsars. The principal results are as follows. First, a cluster of the same scale as NGC1569-B was found to match both the observed [Ba/Fe] and [Fe/H] values, the best cluster having [Ba/Fe]= 1.3 $\pm$ 0.2 and [Fe/H] = $-$0.7 $\pm$ 0.2. This simulation used a core-collapse supernova per collapsar rate of 70, a standard initial mass function and an initial metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.5. Second, a prediction of the Eu abundance of NGC1569-B is made: [Eu/Fe]= 1.9 $\pm$ 0.2. These results are shown to be invariant under a change in the orbit parameters used for the merger. The need for a merger to promote the star formation that leads to the synthesis of the Ba and the star cluster formation is confirmed. Collapsars can not only better explain [Ba/Fe] but also be consistent with the observed star formation rate and stellar mass of the dwarf galaxy.</description>

      <title>The JWST EXCELS survey: an extremely metal-poor galaxy at $z=8.271$ hosting an unusual population of massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical ($\lambda \simeq 3100-5600 \,$\r{A}) spectrum of a $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}) = 8.6$ star-forming galaxy at $z=8.271$ (EXCELS-63107) from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. EXCELS-63107 is a compact object consistent with the size of local star-forming cluster complexes ($r_e &lt; 200 \, \rm{pc}$) and has an extremely steep UV continuum measured from JWST/NIRCam photometry ($\beta=-3.3\pm0.3$). The JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectrum of EXCELS-63107 is notable for its strong [OIII]$\lambda4363$ auroral-line emission relative to the [OIII]$\lambda5007$ forbidden line. Via a detailed emission-line and photoionization-modelling analysis, we find that the the observed properties of EXCELS-63107 are consistent with the presence of an ionizing source with an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff} \gtrsim 80 \, 000\,\rm{K}$ heating ionized gas with a density of $n_e &lt; 10^4 \, \rm{cm}^{-3}$ to a volume-averaged electron temperature of $T_e \simeq 34 \, 000\,\rm{K}$. Crucially, we find that stellar population models assuming a standard IMF are not capable of producing the required heating. We determine an oxygen abundance of ${12+\mathrm{log(O/H)}= 6.89^{+0.26}_{-0.21}}$ which is one of the lowest directly constrained oxygen abundances measured in any galaxy to date, and $\simeq 10 \times$ lower than is typical for $z\simeq8$ galaxies with the same stellar mass. The extremely low metallicity of EXCELS-63107 places it in a regime in which theoretical models expect a transition to a top-heavy IMF, and we speculate that a $\simeq 10-30 \, \times$ excess of $M &gt; 50 \, \rm{M}_{\odot}$ stars is one plausible explanation for its observed properties. However, more exotic scenarios, such as Pop III star formation within a mildly enriched halo, are also consistent with the observations.</description>

      <title>GLIMPSE: An ultra-faint $\simeq$ 10$^{5}$ $M_{\odot}$ Pop III Galaxy Candidate and First Constraints on the Pop III UV Luminosity Function at $z\simeq6-7$</title>

Abstract: Detecting the first generation of stars, Population III (PopIII), has been a long-standing goal in astrophysics, yet they remain elusive even in the JWST era. Here we present a novel NIRCam-based selection method for PopIII galaxies, and carefully validate it through completeness and contamination simulations. We systematically search ~500 arcmin$^{2}$ across JWST legacy fields for PopIII candidates, including GLIMPSE which, assisted by gravitational lensing, has produced JWST's deepest NIRCam imaging thus far. We discover one promising PopIII galaxy candidate (GLIMPSE-16043) at $z=6.50^{+0.03}_{-0.24}$, a moderately lensed galaxy (mu=2.9) with an intrinsic UV magnitude of $M_{UV}$=-15.89. It exhibits key PopIII features: strong H$\alpha$ emission (rest-frame EW $2810\pm550$\AA); a Balmer jump; no dust (UV slope $\beta=-2.34\pm0.36$); and undetectable metal lines (e.g., [OIII]; [OIII]/H$\beta$&lt;0.44) implying a gas-phase metallicity of Zgas/Zsun&lt;0.5%. These properties indicate the presence of a nascent, metal-deficient young stellar population (&lt;5Myr) with a stellar mass of $\simeq10^{5}M_{\odot}$. Intriguingly, this source deviates significantly from the extrapolated UV-metallicity relation derived from recent JWST observations at $z=4-10$, consistent with UV enhancement by a top-heavy PopIII initial mass function or the presence of an extremely metal-poor AGN. We also derive the first observational constraints on the PopIII UV luminosity function at z~6-7. The volume density of GLIMPSE-16043 ($\approx10^{-4}$ cMpc$^{-3}$) is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, independently reinforcing its plausibility. This study demonstrates the power of our novel NIRCam method to finally reveal distant galaxies even more pristine than the Milky Way's most metal-poor satellites, thereby promising to bring us closer to the first generation of stars than we have ever been before.</description>

      <title>Direct N-body simulations of NGC 6397 and its tidal tails</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have performed a series of direct N-body simulations that study the evolution of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6397 under the combined influence of two-body relaxation, stellar evolution and the Milky Way's tidal field. Our simulations follow the evolution of the cluster over the last several Gyr up to its present-day position in the Milky Way in order to allow us to derive present-day cluster parameters and the distribution of its extra-tidal stars. We have also determined a new density profile of NGC 6397 by selecting stars from Gaia DR3 using Gaia DR3 proper motions, parallaxes and photometry to discriminate cluster members from non-members. This allows us to derive the surface density profile of NGC 6397 and the location of its tidal tails up to 10 degrees of the cluster centre, well beyond the tidal radius of NGC 6397. Our results show that the current state of NGC 6397 in terms of surface density, velocity dispersion profile and stellar mass function can be matched by a cluster model evolving from a standard initial mass function and does not require an additional central cluster of dark remnants. We also find good agreement in the location and absolute number of the extra-tidal stars between our simulations and the observations, making it unlikely that NGC 6397 is surrounded by a dark matter halo.</description>

      <title>Many Roads Lead to Lithium: Formation Pathways For Lithium-Rich Red Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar models predict that lithium (Li) inside a star is destroyed during the first dredge-up phase, yet 1.2% of red giant stars are Li-rich. We aim to uncover possible origins of this population, by analysing 1155 Li-rich giants (A(Li) $\geq$ 1.5) in GALAH DR3. To expose peculiar traits of Li-rich stars, we construct a reference sample of Li-normal (doppelg\"anger) stars with matched evolutionary state and fiducial supernova abundances. Comparing Li-rich and doppelg\"anger spectra reveals systematic differences in the H-$\alpha$ and Ca-triplet line profiles associated with the velocity broadening measurement. We also find twice as many Li-rich stars appear to be fast rotators (2% with $v_\textrm{broad} \gtrsim 20$ km s$^{-1}$) compared to doppelg\"angers. On average, Li-rich stars have higher abundances than their doppelg\"angers, for a subset of elements, and Li-rich stars at the base of RGB have higher mean $s-$process abundances ($\geq 0.05$ dex for Ba, Y, Zr), relative to their doppelg\"angers. External mass-transfer from intermediate-mass AGB companions could explain this signature. Additional companion analysis excludes binaries with mass ratios $\gtrsim$ 0.5 at $\gtrsim$ 7 AU. We also discover that highly Ba-enriched stars are missing from the Li-rich population, possibly due to low-mass AGB companions which preclude Li-enrichment. Finally, we confirm a prevalence of Li-rich stars on the red clump that increases with lithium, which supports an evolutionary state mechanism for Li-enhancement. Multiple culprits, including binary spin-up and mass-transfer, are therefore likely mechanisms of Li-enrichment.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Lyman-$\alpha$ emissions from reionization fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During reionization, intergalactic ionization fronts (I-fronts) are sources of Ly$\alpha$ line radiation produced by collisional excitation of hydrogen atoms within the fronts. In principle, detecting this emission could provide direct evidence for a reionizing intergalactic medium (IGM). In this paper, we use a suite of high-resolution one-dimensional radiative transfer simulations run on cosmological density fields to quantify the parameter space of I-front Ly$\alpha$ emission. We find that the Ly$\alpha$ production efficiency -- the ratio of emitted Ly$\alpha$ flux to incident ionizing flux driving the front -- depends mainly on the I-front speed and the spectral index of the ionizing radiation. IGM density fluctuations on scales smaller than the typical I-front width produce scatter in the efficiency, but they do not significantly boost its mean value. The Ly$\alpha$ flux emitted by an I-front is largest if 3 conditions are met simultaneously: (1) the incident ionizing flux is large; (2) the incident spectrum is hard, consisting of more energetic photons; (3) the I-front is traveling through a cosmological over-density, which causes it to propagate more slowly. We present a convenient parameterization of the efficiency in terms of I-front speed and incident spectral index. We make these results publicly available as an interpolation table and we provide a simple fitting function for a representative ionizing background spectrum. Our results can be applied as a sub-grid model for I-front Ly$\alpha$ emissions in reionization simulations with spatial and/or temporal resolutions too coarse to resolve I-front structure. In a companion paper, we use our results to explore the possibility of directly imaging Ly$\alpha$ emission around neutral islands during the last phases of reionization.</description>

      <title>Imaging reionization's last phases with I-front Lyman-$\alpha$ emissions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long troughs observed in the $z &gt; 5.5$ Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ forests are thought to be caused by the last remaining neutral patches during the end phases of reionization -- termed neutral islands. If this is true, then the longest troughs mark locations where we are most likely to observe the reionizing intergalactic medium (IGM). A key feature of the neutral islands is that they are bounded by ionization fronts (I-fronts) which emit Lyman series lines. In this paper, we explore the possibility of directly imaging the outline of neutral islands with a narrowband survey targeting Ly$\alpha$. In a companion paper, we quantified the intensity of I-front Ly$\alpha$ emissions during reionization and its dependence on the spectrum of incident ionizing radiation and I-front speed. Here we apply those results to reionization simulations to model the emissions from neutral islands. We find that neutral islands would appear as diffuse structures that are tens of comoving Mpc across, with surface brightnesses in the range $\approx 1 - 5\times 10^{-21}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$. The islands are brighter if the spectrum of ionizing radiation driving the I-fronts is harder, and/or if the I-fronts are moving faster. We develop mock observations for current and futuristic observatories and find that, while extremely challenging, detecting neutral islands is potentially within reach of an ambitious observing program with wide-field narrowband imaging. Our results demonstrate the potentially high impact of low-surface brightness observations for studying reionization.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Alignments and Spin Correlations of [OII] Emitters at $z=1.2$ and $z=1.5$ from HSC Narrow-band Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxies are known to be aligned toward specific directions within the large-scale structure. Such alignment signals become important for controlling the systematics of weak lensing surveys and for constraining galaxy formation and evolution scenarios. We measure the galaxy-ellipticity and ellipticity-ellipticity correlation functions for blue star-forming galaxies at $z=1.19$ and $z=1.47$ that are selected by detecting [OII] emission lines in narrow-band filters of the Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. Assuming that disk galaxies are thin and rotation-supported, we also measure the spin correlation function by estimating spin directions with ellipticities and position angles. Above $1 \; h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, we do not find significant signals for galaxy-ellipticity, ellipticity-ellipticity, or spin correlations at both redshifts. Below $1 \; h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, a weak deviation from zero is seen at $z=1.47$, implying weak spin-filament correlations, but it is not verified by the direct comparison between angles of spins and filaments. The linear alignment model fit yields the amplitude parameter $A_{\rm NLA}=1.38\pm2.32$ at $z=1.19$ and $0.45\pm2.09$ at $z=1.47$ ($95\%$ confidence levels). We discuss various observational and physical origins that affect the search for alignments of disk galaxies at high redshifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10314v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blue straggler stars are unique main-sequence stars that appear more luminous, hotter, and therefore younger, than their coeval counterparts. In star clusters, these stars are located above the cluster turn-off in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram or color-magnitude diagram. First identified in the 1950s, these stars are found across diverse environments, from sparse galactic fields to dense star clusters. They are crucial for understanding stellar and binary evolution and star cluster dynamics. Despite extensive research, many challenges concerning their properties and origin mechanisms remain unresolved. This chapter delves into the properties and origins of blue stragglers, examining how theoretical tools are employed to study them and the implications of each proposed formation mechanism. We assess how contemporary observational data either support or challenge these theoretical predictions. Continued theoretical and observational efforts are essential for advancing our understanding of these enigmatic stars.</description>

      <title>Gaia Data Release 3: spectroscopic binary-star orbital solutions. The SB1 processing chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaia is an astrometric space experiment that is measuring positions, proper motions as well as parallaxes for a huge number of stars. It operates a medium-dispersion spectrometer, the RVS, that provides spectra and thus radial velocity time-series. The paper is centred on the analysis of the RV time-series. We try to fit orbital and trend models and restrict ourselves to the objects of spectral types F-G-K brighter than magnitude 12 presenting only one single spectrum (SB1). Suitable time-series are processed and analysed object per object, providing orbital or trend solutions. The results of the various fits are further filtered on the basis of several quality measures in order to discard spurious solutions. The objects only having a spectroscopic solution are classified in one of the three classes SB1 (eccentric model), SB1C (circular model) or TrendSB1 (mere trend model). We detail the methods used and describe the derived parameters and results. After a description of the models considered, and of the related quality tests of the fit, we detail the internal filtering that is intended to reject bad solutions. We also present a full validation of the pipeline. A description of the current content of the catalogue is provided. We present the SB1, SB1C and the TrendSB1 spectroscopic solutions contained in the SB-subcatalogue which is part of the DR3 catalogue. We delivered some 181327 orbital solutions in the class SB1, 202 in the class SB1C and 56808 in the associated class TrendSB1. This is a first release and the delivered SB-subcatalogue could be tuned and refined. However the majority of the entries are correct; this data set constitutes by far the largest set of spectroscopic orbital solutions ever constituted.</description>

      <title>Multi-Point Hermite Methods for the N-Body Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical integration methods are central to the study of self-gravitating systems, particularly those comprised of many bodies or otherwise beyond the reach of analytical methods. Predictor-corrector schemes, both multi-step methods and those based on 2-point Hermite interpolation, have found great success in the simulation of star clusters and other collisional systems. Higher-order methods, such as those based on Gaussian quadratures and Richardson extrapolation, have also proven popular for high-accuracy integrations of few-body systems, particularly those that may undergo close encounters. This work presents a family of high-order schemes based on multi-point Hermite interpolation. When applied as a multi-step multi-derivative schemes, these can be seen as generalizing both Adams-Bashforth-Moulton methods and 2-point Hermite methods; I present results for the 6th-, 9th-, and 12th-order 3-point schemes applied in this manner using variable time steps. In a cluster-like test problem, the 3-point 6th-order predictor-corrector scheme matches or outperforms the standard 2-point 4th-order Hermite scheme at negligible O(N) cost. I also present a number of high-order time-symmetric schemes up to 18th order, which have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of long-duration simulations.</description>

      <title>The Lense-Thirring effect at work in M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08686v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the temporal evolution of the angles characterizing the spatial configuration of the jet in the supermassive black hole M87$^\ast$ was measured exhibiting a precessional pattern around the hole's spin axis. It would be due to the dragging induced by the fact that the hole's external spacetime is described by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense-Thirring orbital precessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object, calculated perturbatively to the first post-Newtonian order, are able to fully reproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87$^\ast$. In particular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of the accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular orbit, the condition that the absolute value of the predicted Lense-Thirring precessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of $0.56\pm 0.02$ radians per year of the jet's one is satisfied for a range of physically meaningful values of the hole's spin parameter, close to unity, and of the effective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii. Relying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the angle between the hole's spin axis and the jet's one stays constant over the years amounting to $1.16^\circ$, in agreement with its measured value of $1.25^\circ\pm 0.18^\circ$. Furthermore, also the temporal pattern and the amplitudes of the time series of the jet's angles are reproduced by the aforementioned Lense-Thirring precessional model.</description>

      <title>Shaping Outflows and Jets by Ambient Pressure: a Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical outflows are ubiquitous across cosmic scales, from stellar to galactic systems. While diverse launching mechanisms have been proposed, we demonstrate that these outflows share a fundamental commonality: their morphology follows the physics of pressure-confined supersonic flows. By extending classical deLaval nozzle theory to account for ambient pressure gradients, we present a unified framework that successfully describes outflows from young stellar objects to active galactic nuclei. Our model reveals a remarkable consistency in pressure profiles, characterized by a power-law exponent near minus two, independent of the internal characteristics of the outflow or the nature of central engine. This discovery suggests a universal mechanism for outflow collimation and acceleration, bridging the gap between theoretical models and observational features across a wide range of astronomical scales.</description>

      <title>3D Localization of FRB 20190425A for Its Potential Host Galaxy and Implications</title>

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are high-energy, short-duration phenomena in radio astronomy. Identifying their host galaxies can provide insights into their mysterious origins. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to identifying potential host galaxies in three-dimensional space. We use FRB 20190425A and GW190425 as an example to illustrate our method. Recently, due to spatial and temporal proximity, the potential association of GW190425 with FRB 20190425A has drawn attention, leading to the identification of a likely host galaxy, UGC 10667, albeit without confirmed kilonova emissions. We search for the host galaxy of FRB 20190425A with a full CHIME localization map. Regardless of the validity of the association between GW190425 and FRB 20190425A, we identify an additional potential host galaxy (SDSS J171046.84+212732.9) from the updated GLADE galaxy catalog, supplementing the importance of exploring the new volume. We employed various methodologies to determine the most probable host galaxy of GW190424 and FRB 20190425A, including a comparison of galaxy properties and constraints on their reported observation limits using various Kilonova models. Our analysis suggests that current observations do not definitively identify the true host galaxy. Additionally, the Kilonova models characterized by a gradual approach to their peak are contradicted by the observational upper limits of both galaxies. Although the absence of optical emission detection raises doubts, it does not definitively disprove the connection between GW and FRB.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a likely Type II SN at $z$=3.6 with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transient astronomy in the early, high-redshift (z &gt; 3) Universe is an unexplored regime that offers the possibility of probing the first stars and the Epoch of Reionization. During Cycles 1 and 2 of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program enabled one of the first searches for transients in deep images (~30 AB mag) over a relatively wide area (25 arcmin^2). One transient, AT 2023adsv, was discovered with an F200W magnitude of 28.04 AB mag, and subsequent JWST observations revealed that the transient is a likely supernova (SN) in a host with z_spec = 3.613 +/- 0.001 and an inferred metallicity at the position of the SN of Z_* = 0.3 +/- 0.1 Z_{\odot}. At this redshift, the first detections in F115W and F150W show that AT 2023adsv had bright rest-frame ultraviolet flux at the time of discovery. The multi-band light curve of AT 2023adsv is best matched by a template of an SN IIP with a peak absolute magnitude of M_B ~ -18.3 AB mag. We find a good match to a 20 M_{\odot} red supergiant progenitor star with an explosion energy of 2.0x10^51 ergs, likely higher than normally observed in the local Universe, but consistent with SNe IIP drawn from local, lower metallicity environments. AT 2023adsv is the most distant photometrically classified SN IIP yet discovered with a spectroscopic redshift measurement, and may represent a global shift in SNe IIP properties as a function of redshift.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach to Inferring Accretion Signatures in Young Stellar Objects: A Case Study with VIRUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10500</link>

Abstract: The mass accretion rates of young stellar objects (YSOs) are key to understanding how stars form, how their circumstellar disks evolve, and even how planets form. We develop a Bayesian framework to determine the accretion rates of a sample of 15 YSOs using archival data from the VIRUS spectrograph ($R \sim 800$, 3500-5500\r{A}) on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. We are publicly releasing our developed tool, dubbed nuts-for-ysos, as a Python package which can also be applied to other spectroscopic datasets. The nuts-for-ysos code fits a simple accretion model to the near-UV and optical continuum of each VIRUS spectrum. Our Bayesian approach aims to identify correlations between model parameters using the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). Moreover, this approach self-consistently incorporates all parameter uncertainties, allowing for a thorough estimation of the probability distribution for accretion rate not accomplished in previous works. Using nuts-for-ysos, we derive accretion rates of each YSO. We then verify the reliability of our method by comparing to results separately derived from only the spectral emission lines, and to results from earlier studies of the Lupus, Chamaeleon I, and NGC1333 regions. Finally, we discuss what qualitative trends, covariances, and degeneracies were found among model parameters. The technique developed in this paper is a useful improvement that can be applied in the future to larger samples of YSOs observed by VIRUS or other spectrographs.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary tracks, ejecta, and ionizing photons from intermediate-mass to very massive stars with PARSEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in stellar evolution modeling offer unprecedented accuracy in predicting the evolution and deaths of stars. We present new stellar evolutionary models computed with the updated PARSEC V2.0 code for a comprehensive and homogeneous grid of metallicities and initial masses. Nuclear reaction networks, mass loss prescriptions, and the treatment of elemental mixing have all been updated in PARSEC V2.0. We computed models for thirteen initial metallicities spanning $Z = 10^{-11}$ to $Z = 0.03$, with masses ranging from 2.0 M$_{\odot}$ to 2000 M$_{\odot}$, consisting of a library of over 1,100 ($\sim 2100$ tracks including pure-He models) full stellar evolution tracks. For each track, the evolution is followed from the pre-main-sequence to the most advanced early-asymptotic-giant-branch or the pre-supernova phases, depending on the stellar mass. Here, we describe the properties of the tracks and their chemical and structural evolution. We computed the final fates and the remnant masses and built the mass spectrum for each metallicity, finding that the combined black hole (BH) pair-instability mass gap spans just between 100 and 130 M$_{\odot}$. Moreover, the remnant masses provide models consistent with observed BH masses, such as those from the primaries of GW190521, Cygnus X-1, and $\textit{Gaia}$ BH3 binary systems. We computed and provided the chemical ejecta from stellar winds and explosive final fates, along with the ionizing photon rates. Our results show strong overall consistency with other tracks computed with different codes. A comparison with a large sample of observed massive stars in the Tarantula Nebula of the Large Magellanic Cloud shows that our tracks nicely reproduce the majority of stars that lie on the main sequence. All the models are publicly available and can be retrieved on the PARSEC database.</description>
