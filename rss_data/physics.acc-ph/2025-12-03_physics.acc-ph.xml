      <title>Observation of Electromagnetic Transients in a Nb3Sn 4-layer Dipole Mirror Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During testing of the Stress Managed Cosine-Theta dipole mirror magnet SMCTM1, magnet quenches were observed following large voltage spikes in the half-coil voltage taps which preceded normal quench initiation. Following some recent work at CERN measuring power current converter transients in relation to flux jumps, an additional differential current probe was added to the magnet instrumentation. Measurements of this probe, as well as the half coil voltage taps show a fast and substantial current change preceding the quench, hinting at coil motion. A simple model based on relative shift of the inner and outer layer coils was developed which suggests the magnitude of coil shift events is on the estimated relative coil shift from the magnet constraint conditions. The behavior is shown to be reversible and characteristic of stick-slip.</description>

      <title>Proton Dynamics Scenarios in the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) at Fermilab provides a versatile platform for studying the interplay of space-charge, impedance, and non-linear optics in high-intensity hadron beams within synchrotrons and storage rings. This report examines the parameters and dynamics of 2.5~MeV proton beam operations in two configurations of the bare IOTA lattice: one for demonstrating Non-linear Integrable Optics with the Danilov-Nagaitsev magnet, and the other for use with electron cooling. We offer order-of-magnitude estimates of the transverse emittance growth rate as a function of beam intensity, highlighting contributions from residual gas scattering, intra-beam scattering, and space-charge effects. Under nominal conditions, the beam lifetime is projected to be less than 7~minutes at low intensity with the current vacuum quality, and fewer than 100,000~turns at high intensity due to strong space-charge effects. The calculations presented here will guide strategies to mitigate emittance growth and inform future IOTA experiments.</description>

      <title>Study of fully coupled 3D envelope instability using automatic differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auto-differentiation is a powerful tool for computing derivatives of simulation results with respect to given parameters. In this letter, we have applied this tool to investigate the instability of a dynamics system that is governed by 21 ordinary differential equations. This second-order instability (named envelope instability) is driven by space-charge effects and has significant impact on the operational regimes of particle accelerators. Our study delves into the three-dimensional envelope instability, incorporating both transverse and longitudinal coupling. Conventionally, analyzing this complex system would necessitate solving 441 ordinary differential equations, which is computationally intractable. However, by employing auto-differentiation, we were able to track only 21 equations. This approach allowed us to uncover an additional instability stopband, which arises from space-charge-induced coupling and has not been reported in previous studies. This research highlights the significant advantages of auto-differentiation in analyzing complicated dynamical systems involving a large number of ordinary differential equations.</description>

      <title>IOTA Experiment for Proton Pulse Compression at Extreme Space-Charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The longitudinal compression of high-intensity, space-charge-dominated proton bunches is a critical requirement for future proton-driven muon colliders. We propose a proton bunch compression experiment at the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) storage ring at Fermilab to investigate optimal radio-frequency (RF) cavity parameters and lattice configurations. IOTA is a compact, fixed-energy storage ring dedicated to beam physics Research and Development and capable of circulating a 2.5 MeV proton beam under extreme space-charge conditions. Using the ImpactX code with its 3D space-charge solver, simulations indicate that the bunch length can be rapidly reduced by at least a factor of two without appreciable degradation of transverse beam quality--even in the strong space-charge regime. However, longitudinal defocusing due to the space-charge remains a significant challenge in short-pulsed intense proton bunches, and the optimization of compression under these conditions is discussed.</description>

      <title>Tailored Three Dimensional Betatron Dynamics in UltraStable Hybrid Laser Plasma RF Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detailed theoretical and numerical investigation of hybrid laser plasma RF accelerators, elucidating the mechanisms governing transverse beam dynamics, betatron polarization, and radiation reaction in ultra-relativistic electron bunches is presented. This framework combines analytical models of spatiotemporal plasma wakefield modulation, phase-dependent RF-driven oscillations, and quantum-corrected Landau Lifshitz radiation reaction with fully self-consistent 3D particle in cell simulations using EPOCH. The results demonstrate that RF amplitude, frequency, and phase enable precise control over transverse focusing strengths, betatron oscillation amplitudes, and polarization states. Resonant alignment between RF fields and natural betatron frequencies amplifies transverse excursions while damping parasitic oscillations through enhanced focusing gradients and radiation reaction, yielding reductions in emittance and mitigation of synchrotron-like energy losses. Stability maps and 3D force landscapes reveal strong phase sensitivity, where initial conditions and RF component ratios govern the temporal evolution of betatron amplitudes, and longitudinal field gradients modulate {\gamma} growth rates. These findings provide a comprehensive picture of nonlinear, resonant, and damping phenomena in hybrid laser plasma RF systems, highlighting the full spectrum of controllable transverse, longitudinal, and polarization dynamics in ultra relativistic electron beams.</description>
