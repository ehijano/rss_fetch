      <title>Estimating Energy Release in Metallized Composite Explosives Using the Taylor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential for reactive metal fuels to enhance the energetic output of high explosives has generated an enduring interest in the study of composite explosives. It has typically been demonstrated that added metal fuels can have little or even deleterious impact on the accelerating ability of composite military explosives relative to baseline performance. Often this has led to the assumption of limited reaction of the metal fuel over microsecond timescales. The widespread availability of Photonic Doppler Velocimetry has enabled time resolved measurement of accelerated confinement, ultimately demonstrating prompt reaction of metal fuels. Motivated by this observation, hydrocode modelling studies, and prior author's modifications of Taylor's tubular bomb model, we developed a differential equation form of Taylor's model in a manner where it is straightforward to add sources or phases. An afterburning version of the JWL equation of state was used to add energy to the gaseous products at a linear, time-dependent rate. The metal particles are assumed to remain in velocity equilibrium with the gaseous products and do not transfer heat or influence chemical composition. We focus exclusively on added aluminum as it remains the most ubiquitous choice of metal fuel. The model is initialized with a CJ state calculated from Cheetah 2.0 assuming the Al particles are inert in the detonation. JWL coefficients for the baseline explosive are also used. Qualitative agreement is observed between the model and previously published experiments.</description>

      <title>Motional representation; the ability to predict odor characters using molecular vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of odor characters is still impossible based on the odorant molecular structure. We designed a CNN-based regressor for computed parameters in molecular vibrations (CNN\_vib), in order to investigate the ability to predict odor characters of molecular vibrations. In this study, we explored following three approaches for the predictability; (i) CNN with molecular vibrational parameters, (ii) logistic regression based on vibrational spectra, and (iii) logistic regression with molecular fingerprint(FP). Our investigation demonstrates that both (i) and (ii) provide predictablity, and also that the vibrations as an explanatory variable (i and ii) and logistic regression with fingerprints (iii) show nearly identical tendencies. The predictabilities of (i) and (ii), depending on odor descriptors, are comparable to those of (iii). Our research shows that odor is predictable by odorant molecular vibration as well as their shapes alone. Our findings provide insight into the representation of molecular motional features beyond molecular structures.</description>

      <title>Low-energy proton impact dynamics on hydrocarbons: Dependence on kinetic energy and incident site</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of low-energy proton collisions with hydrocarbon with hydrocarbon molecules are investigated using real-time time-dependent density functional theory. Through systematic variation of proton kinetic energy and impact site on the molecular surface, the resulting scattering, proton capture, and bond dissociation pathways are analyzed. The simulations reveal a strong dependence of reaction outcomes on both incident energy and collision geometry, with the interplay between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom highlighted as governing molecular fragmentation and reaction mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Method of Planes - Local Pressure Definitions for Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stress or Pressure is a central quantity in engineering, and remains vital in molecular modelling. However, the commonly used virial stress tensor is not valid away from thermodynamic equilibrium, a common state required in fluid dynamics and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation. This is solved by using the method of planes (MoP), a mechanical form of pressure, simply interpreted as the force divided by area but derived from the firm foundations of statistical mechanics. We present an extension of MoP stress to the MACE potential, a particular form of machine learning (ML) potentials allowing quantum mechanical (QM) physics in classical simulation. We present the derivation of the MoP stress for the MACE potential using the theoretical framework set out by Irving &amp; Kirkwood (1950). For the testcase of an interface between water and Zirconium Oxide, we show the MoP measures the correct force balance while the virial form fails. Further, we demonstrate the MoP is valid arbitrarily far from equilibrium, showing exact conservation every timestep in a control volume bounded by MoP planes. This links the stress directly to the conservation equations and demonstrates the validity in non equilibrium molecular dynamics systems. All code to reproduce these validations for any MACE system, together with ASE accelerated code to calculate the MoP are provided as open source. This work helps build the foundation to extend the ML revolution in materials to NEMD and molecular fluid dynamics modelling.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Fingerprints of Strained Polymers: A Spectroscopic Pathway to Mechanical State Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vibrational response of polymer networks under load provides a sensitive probe of molecular deformation and a route to non-destructive diagnostics. Here we show that machine-learned force fields reproduce these spectroscopic fingerprints with quantum-level fidelity in realistic epoxy thermosets. Using MACE-OFF23 molecular dynamics, we capture the experimentally observed redshifts of para-phenylene stretching modes under tensile load, in contrast to the harmonic OPLS-AA model. These shifts correlate with molecular elongation and alignment, consistent with Badger's rule, directly linking vibrational features to local stress. To capture IR intensities, we trained a symmetry-adapted dipole moment model on representative epoxy fragments, enabling validation of strain responses. Together, these approaches provide chemically accurate and computationally accessible predictions of strain-dependent vibrational spectra. Our results establish vibrational fingerprints as predictive markers of mechanical state in polymer networks, pointing to new strategies for stress mapping and structural-health diagnostics in advanced materials.</description>

      <title>Efficient All-Electron Periodic Fourier-Transformed Coulomb Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient algorithm for the all-electron periodic Coulomb matrix based on the Ewald summation combined with the Fourier-transformed Coulomb method. The short-range contributions involving compact densities are evaluated in real space using the standard Gaussian density fitting method. For the long-range contributions, we introduce an integral-direct planewave density fitting, applicable to both compact and diffuse densities. The resulting method achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups for prototypical solid-state systems compared to a closely related approach, the range-separated density fitting method. Using dispersion-corrected PBE functional and all-electron Dunning and Karlsruhe basis sets, we apply our method to compute the cohesive energy of the benzene crystal and the adsorption energy of CO on the MgO(001) surface. These results are in good agreement with existing literature. Our approach enables efficient Gaussian-based semi-local density functional calculations using dense $\mathbf {k}$-point meshes and traditional molecular Gaussian basis sets.</description>

      <title>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Atomistic Learning for "Clusters-to-Bulk" Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) on total energies of molecular clusters using differential or transfer learning is becoming a popular route to extend the accuracy of correlated wave-function theory to condensed phases. A key challenge, however, lies in validation, as reference observables in finite-temperature ensembles are not available at the reference level. Here, we construct synthetic reference data from pretrained MLIPs and evaluate the generalizability of cluster-trained models on ice-Ih, considering scenarios where both energies and forces and where only energies are available for training. We study the accuracy and data-efficiency of differential, single-fidelity transfer, and multi-fidelity transfer learning against ground-truth thermodynamic observables. We find that transferring accuracy from clusters to bulk requires regularization, which is best achieved through multi-fidelity transfer learning when training on both energies and forces. By contrast, training only on energies introduces artefacts: stable trajectories and low energy errors conceal large force errors, leading to inaccurate microscopic observables. More broadly, we show that accurate reproduction of microscopic structure correlates strongly with low force errors but only weakly with energy errors, whereas global properties such as energies and densities correlate with low energy errors. This highlights the need to incorporate forces during training or to apply careful validation before production. Our results highlight the promise and pitfalls of cluster-trained MLIPs for condensed phases and provide guidelines for developing - and critically, validating - robust and data-efficient MLIPs.</description>

      <title>DeepEOSNet: Capturing the dependency on thermodynamic state in property prediction tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning (ML) architecture to better capture the dependency of thermodynamic properties on the independent states. When predicting state-dependent thermodynamic properties, ML models need to account for both molecular structure and the thermodynamic state, described by independent variables, typically temperature, pressure, and composition. Modern molecular ML models typically include state information by adding it to molecular fingerprint vectors or by embedding explicit (semi-empirical) thermodynamic relations. Here, we propose to rather split the information processing on the molecular structure and the dependency on states into two separate network channels: a graph neural network and a multilayer perceptron, whose output is combined by a dot product. We refer to our approach as DeepEOSNet, as this idea is based on the DeepONet architecture [Lu et al. (2021), Nat. Mach. Intell.]: instead of operators, we learn state dependencies, with the possibility to predict equation of states (EOS). We investigate the predictive performance of DeepEOSNet by means of three case studies, which include the prediction of vapor pressure as a function of temperature, and mixture molar volume as a function of composition, temperature, and pressure. Our results show superior performance of DeepEOSNet for predicting vapor pressure and comparable performance for predicting mixture molar volume compared to state-of-research graph-based thermodynamic prediction models from our earlier works. In fact, we see large potential of DeepEOSNet in cases where data is sparse in the state domain and the output function is structurally similar across different molecules. The concept of DeepEOSNet can easily be transferred to other ML architectures in molecular context, and thus provides a viable option for property prediction.</description>

      <title>First principles simulation of the collective rovibronic ground state in a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong light-matter coupling in Fabry-Perot cavities can modify ground-state molecular reactivity, charge and energy transport, while modifications to single-molecule properties have not been observed experimentally. The mechanisms and reproducibility of such effects remain contested, with conflicting theoretical predictions driven by differences in Hamiltonian choice and quantum state representation. Here, we resolve these ambiguities with numerically exact quantum simulations of cavity-coupled molecular ensembles based on the ab initio light-matter Hamiltonian, treating electrons, nuclei, and cavity photons on equal footing. We investigate ensembles of the rotational-vibrational-electronic Shin-Metiu model using variational tree-tensor-network quantum dynamics, capturing rovibronic couplings and anharmonicity. Embedding ensembles in a cavity induces local modifications of rotational, nuclear, and --more weakly-- electronic observables in individual molecules. The extent of these modifications depends only on the per-molecule coupling strength up until each molecule reaches the ultrastrong coupling regime, which remains unattainable in practical Fabry-Perot setups. Increasing ensemble size toward the thermodynamic limit causes these local modifications to vanish regardless of dipole self-energy inclusion. Nonetheless, global ground-state observables, such as light-matter coupling energy contributions (affecting overall polarizability) and cavity field displacement fluctuations, depend crucially on proper treatment of intermolecular and light-matter correlations, whereas intramolecular observables remain largely insensitive. These insights are crucial for guiding future investigations using approximate quantum treatments, and for the interpretation of experimental results in polaritonic chemistry.</description>

      <title>Quantum Molecular Dynamics Calculations on H + H$_2$, H$_2$ + H$_2$, H$_2$O/Cu(111), and Anthracene with Various Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a theoretical scheme on quantum molecular dynamics in curved Schwarzschild spacetime is developed. To this end, the gravitational field is introduced by revising the kinetics energy operator (KEO) rather than by adding Newtonian gravitational interaction in the potential energy surface (PES) due to the important role of the metric tensor in deriving the KEO. To test the present Schr{\"o}dinger-type framework, spherically symmetric Schwarzschild spacetime is chosen to explore (1) the H + H$_2$ reaction dynamics, (2) the H$_2$ + H$_2$ scattering dynamics, (3) dynamics of dissociative chemsorption of H$_2$O on Cu(111), and (4) the spectrum band of anthracene cation. Extensive numerical calculations in curved space predict that reaction or scattering probability and spectrum band decrease abruptly to zero as the gravitational strength increases, indicating the remarkable role of gravitational field in chemical dynamics and naturally leading to effects of gravitational time dilation of the molecular systems. However, it is noteworthy that moderate gravitational field can significantly enhance dynamical resonance in the low-energy region, if such resonance exists in flat space. Finally, based on the present numerical results discussions on the quantum molecular dynamics in curved space are given.</description>

      <title>Modeling Interfacial Electron Transfer using Path Integral Molecular Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outer sphere electron transfer rates can be calculated from simulation data by sampling the equilibrium statistics of the canonical reaction coordinate -- the vertical energy gap. For these calculations, electron transfer is typically represented by an instantaneous change in the atomic partial charges. In this manuscript, we present an implementation of this procedure that utilizes an explicit path-integral representation of the transferring electron. We demonstrate our methodology by combining path integral molecular dynamics and Marcus-Hush-Chidsey theory to calculate the rate of electron transfer from a Ferrocyanide complex to a gold electrode. We consider the dependence of this rate on electron transfer distance and applied potential. We find that when the electron is represented explicitly via path integral molecular dynamics, as opposed to implicitly via fixed atomic partial charges, the rates and thermodynamics are more consistent with experimental findings. We then apply our methodology to explore the role of bridging spectator cations in modifying electron transfer rates. We find, once again, that the path integral approach produces specific cation effects that are more consistent with experiment than those in which the transferring electron is represented implicitly.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium state during proton-deuteron exchange at a liquid-liquid interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exchange of protons and deuterons is a very fast process, even on macroscopic length scales. Here we directly measure quantitatively the formation of HDO within the first 100 microseconds of the reaction at the liquid-liquid interface between D$_2$O and H$_2$O using a fast-flowing liquid flat jet and infrared spectroscopic imaging. During early stages of the reaction, the rate of HDO formation is limited by the availability of hydroxide and hydronium ions mediating the reaction, rather than simply by diffusion. This reveals a non-equilibrium state of the interface, being fully mixed diffusely yet with HDO concentrations well below equilibrium. We extract the reaction rate constant for the HDO formation in good agreement with picosecond timescales of the elementary proton-deuteron exchange reaction. Quantitative analysis of educt and product concentrations by infrared imaging at well-defined liquid-liquid interfaces as introduced here will enable studying fast kinetics for a wide range of chemical reactions.</description>

      <title>MesoNet: A Fundamental Principle for Multi-Representation Learning in Complex Chemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of molecular properties in complex chemical systems is crucial for accelerating material discovery and chemical innovation.However,current computational methods often struggle to capture the intricate compositional interplay across complex chemical systems,from intramolecular bonds to intermolecular forces.In this work,we introduce MesoNet,a novel framework founded on the principle of multi-representation learning and specifically designed for multi-molecule modeling.The core innovation of MesoNet lies in the construction of context-aware representation-dynamically enriched atomic descriptors generated via Neural Circuit Policies. These parameters efficiently capture both intrinsic atomic properties and their dynamic compositional context through a cross-attention mechanism spanning both intramolecular and intermolecular message passing. Driven by this mechanism,the influence of the mixed system is progressively applied to each molecule and atom, making message passing both efficient and meaningful.Comprehensive evaluations across diverse public datasets, spanning both pure components and mixtures,demonstrate that MesoNet achieves superior accuracy and enhanced chemical interpretability for molecular properties.This work establishes a powerful,interpretable approach for modeling compositional complexity,aiming to advance chemical simulation and design.</description>

      <title>Nuclear-electronic orbital second-order coupled cluster for excited states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited-state methods within the nuclear--electronic orbital (NEO) framework have the potential to capture vibrational, electronic, and vibronic transitions in a single calculation. In the NEO approach, specified nuclei, typically protons, are treated quantum mechanically at the same level of theory as the electrons. Affordable excited-state NEO methods such as time-dependent density functional theory are limited to capturing the subset of excitations with single-excitation character, whereas existing methods that capture the full spectrum are limited in applicability due to their high computational cost. Herein, we introduce the excited-state variant of NEO coupled cluster with approximate second-order doubles (NEO-CC2) and its scaled-opposite-spin variant with electron-proton correlation scaling (NEO-SOS'-CC2). We benchmark this method for positronium hydride, where the electrons and positron are treated quantum mechanically, and find that NEO-CC2 deviates from exact results, but NEO-SOS'-CC2 can achieve near-quantitative accuracy by increasing the electron-positron correlation. Benchmarking NEO-CC2 and NEO-SOS'-CC2 on four different triatomic molecules with a quantum proton, we find that NEO-CC2 captures the correct vibrational features such as overtones and combination bands, as well as mixed electron-proton double excitations. Electron-proton correlation scaling that increases the excited-state correlation relative to the ground-state correlation improves the accuracy across all the molecular systems tested. NEO-SOS'-CC2 can describe single and mixed protonic and electronic excitations with accuracy approaching that of much more computationally intensive methods.</description>

      <title>Subtleties in the pseudomodes formalism</title>

Abstract: The pseudomode method for open quantum systems, also known as the mesoscopic leads approach, consists in replacing a structured environment by a set of auxiliary "pseudomodes" subject to local damping that approximate the environment's spectral density. Determining what parameters and geometry to use for the auxiliary modes, however, is non-trivial and involves many subtleties. In this paper we revisit this problem of pseudomode design and investigate some of these subtleties. In particular, we examine the scenario in which pseudomodes couple to each other, resulting in an effective spectral density that is no longer a sum of Lorentzians. We show that non-diagonalizability of the pseudomodes' effective single-particle non-Hermitian Hamiltonian can lead to terms in the effective spectral density which cannot be obtained by diagonalizable non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We also present a method for constructing the pseudomode parameters to exactly match a fit to a spectral density, and in doing so illuminate the enormous freedom in this process. The case of many uncoupled pseudomodes is explored, and we show how, contrary to conventional assumption, the effective spectral density does not necessarily converge in the limit of an infinite number of pseudomodes; we attribute this to the non-completeness of Lorentzians as basis functions. Finally, we discuss how the notion of effective spectral densities can also emerge in the context of scattering theory for non-interacting systems.</description>

      <title>From Coated to Uncoated: Scanning Electron Microscopy Corrections to Estimate True Surface Pore Size in Nanoporous Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16471</link>

Abstract: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is the premier method for characterizing the nanoscale surface pores in ultrafiltration (UF) membranes and the support layers of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Based on SEM, the conventional understanding is that membranes typically have low surface porosities of &lt;10%. We hypothesized that high acceleration voltage during SEM imaging and sputter metal coatings required for SEM have led to systematic underestimations of porosity and pore size. We showed that imaging a commercial UF membrane at 1, 5, and 10 kV reduced measured porosity from 10.3% (1 kV) to 6.3% (10 kV), while increasing Pt coating thickness from 1.5 to 5 nm lowered porosity by 54% for the UF membrane (12.9% to 5.8%) and 46% for an RO support (13.1% to 7.0%). To account for coating thickness, we developed a digital correction method that simulates pore dilation, enabling the pore structure to be estimated for uncoated membranes. Dilation yielded uncoated porosity values of 23% for the UF membrane and 20% for the RO support, about 3-fold greater than values observed with a 4 nm coating. Mean pore diameters were 2-fold greater for the UF membrane and 1.5-fold greater for the RO support. Critically, dilation-derived pore-size distributions agreed with low-flux dextran-retention data fitted with the Bungay-Brenner model. Our results suggest that surface porosities and pore sizes of nanoporous membranes are much larger than previously understood, with major implications for structure/transport relationships. For future nanoscale pore analysis of membranes (and other nanoporous materials), we recommend low acceleration voltage (1 kV), minimal coatings (1-2 nm), and digital dilation to account for coating artifacts</description>

      <title>Investigating the influence of hydrophobicity and electrostatics on the particle-scale dynamics and rheology of dense microgel suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidal microgel particles such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) undergo a reversible volume phase transition at a volume phase transition temperature, VPTT, in aqueous media. Although the particles shrink in size as the temperature is raised beyond the VPTT, Romeo et al. [Adv. Mater. 2010, 22, 3441-3445] had previously shown that dense aqueous PNIPAM suspensions transform from one viscoelastic solid-like phase to another, with an intermediate viscoelastic liquid-like phase near the VPTT, due to a change in the inter-particle interaction from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Here, we show using a combination of experimental techniques that particle hydrophobicity can be significant even below the VPTT and can result in the emergence of attractive gel-like phases. We achieve this by incorporating polar salts such as sodium chloride and potassium chloride, or non-polar additives such as sucrose, to the aqueous medium. Above the VPTT, we observe that suspension rigidity is the highest in the presence of polar salts because of the combined effects of ionic and hydrophobic attractions. In the presence of non-dissociating sucrose, in contrast, the inter-microgel interaction remains hydrophobic across the VPTT. Such easy tunability of interactions by incorporating commonly available chemicals into the suspension medium opens up new avenues for the synthesis of novel metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Thermal History Asymmetry and Dissipation in Dense Colloidal Microgel Glasses</title>

Abstract: Microstructurally arrested matter, from molecular glasses to soft glassy materials, can retain a memory of their thermal or mechanical (shear) histories. Their history-dependent and nonlinear microstructural recoveries have been studied within the Kovacs framework. Here, we applied the temperature ramps of varying magnitudes to dense colloidal suspensions of thermoresponsive, deformable and compressible microgel particles should serve as an effective strategy to probe the nonlinear path-dependent structural recovery of these systems. We synthesised Poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel particles using the free radical precipitation polymerisation method. Using oscillatory rheology, we studied the relaxations of the viscoelastic moduli of dense PNIPAM suspensions that were heated and cooled at various temperature ramp rates. Path-dependent structural recovery was quantified by studying the asymmetric approach of the suspension elastic modulus toward the final temperature during the heating and cooling temperature ramps. The loss modulus peaks, observed at the times of initiation and termination of the temperature ramps, were understood to arise from energy dissipation due to microgel rearrangement events and found to be inversely correlated with the asymmetry in the elastic response. Our work highlights the important role of energy dissipation through microgel rearrangements in eliminating path-dependent asymmetries in the storage moduli of dense PNIPAM glasses subjected to thermal shocks. By tuning the applied temperature ramp rate and particle packing density, therefore, asymmetric storage modulus relaxations in dense systems can be modulated via adjustments of the accessible free volume.</description>

      <title>Selective photocatalyitic CO2 reduction to acetic acid on chiral mesostructured ZnIn2S4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acetic acid, an important industrial chemical, is a key target for CO2 reduction due to its dual role in carbon utilization and chemical feedstock supply.Although acetic acid can be produced by prhotocatalytic CO2 redcution. Among other multicarbon products, it is typically a low-yieleded product due to competing reaction pathways and inefficient C-C coupling. Herein, we report a chiral mesostructured ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst that achieves a remarkable acetic acid yield of 962 umolg-1h-1 with a high selectivity of 97.3%. The yield is ten times higher than the current highest reported value, while attaining state-of-the-art selectivity. The remarkable The remarkable productivity arises from synergistic cooperation between chiral structure and sulfur (S) sites of CMZI. Chirality-induced spin polarization in CMZI stabilizes the key triplet OCCO intermediate, significantly promoting C-C coupling efficiency. Theoretical calculations reveal that the S sites on (102) crystal facets of ZnIn2S4 exhibit thermodynamic and kinetic preferences for acetic acid formation. This work offers critical insights into catalytic strategies for CO2 reduction that could enable the synthesis and scalable production of various multicarbon products.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic H-Atom Scattering Channels on Ge(111) Elucidated by the Hierarchical Equations of Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic and molecular scattering at semiconductor interfaces plays a central role in surface chemistry and catalysis, yet predictive simulations remain challenging due to strong nonadiabatic effects causing the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here, we present fully quantum simulations of H-atom scattering from the Ge(111)c(2x8) rest site using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) with matrix product states (MPS). The system is modeled by mapping a density functional theory (DFT) potential energy surface onto a Newns-Anderson Hamiltonian. Our simulations reproduce the experimentally observed bimodal kinetic energy distributions, capturing both elastic and energy-loss channels. By systematically examining atom-surface coupling, incident energy, and isotope substitution, we identify the strong-coupling regime required to recover the experimental energy-loss profile. This regime suppresses the elastic peak, implying additional site-specific scattering channels in the observed elastic peak. Deuterium substitution further produces a subtle shift in the energy-loss peak, consistent with experiment. These results establish HEOM as a rigorous framework for quantum surface scattering, capable of capturing nonadiabatic dynamics beyond electronic friction and perturbative approaches.</description>

      <title>The Open Catalyst 2025 (OC25) Dataset and Models for Solid-Liquid Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Catalysis at solid-liquid interfaces plays a central role in the advancement of energy storage and sustainable chemical production technologies. By enabling accurate, long-time scale simulations, machine learning (ML) models have the potential to accelerate the discovery of (electro)catalysts. While prior Open Catalyst datasets (OC20 and OC22) have advanced the field by providing large-scale density functional theory (DFT) data of adsorbates on surfaces at solid-gas interfaces, they do not capture the critical role of solvent and electrolyte effects at solid-liquid interfaces. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Open Catalyst 2025 (OC25) dataset, consisting of 7,801,261 calculations across 1,511,270 unique explicit solvent environments. OC25 constitutes the largest and most diverse solid-liquid interface dataset that is currently available and provides configurational and elemental diversity: spanning 88 elements, commonly used solvents/ions, varying solvent layers, and off-equilibrium sampling. State-of-the-art models trained on the OC25 dataset exhibit energy, force, and solvation energy errors as low as 0.1 eV, 0.015 eV/\r{A}, and 0.04 eV, respectively; significantly lower than than the recently released Universal Models for Atoms (UMA-OC20). Additionally, we discuss the impact of the quality of DFT-calculated forces on model training and performance. The dataset and accompanying baseline models are made openly available for the community. We anticipate the dataset to facilitate large length-scale and long-timescale simulations of catalytic transformations at solid-liquid interfaces, advancing molecular-level insights into functional interfaces and enabling the discovery of next-generation energy storage and conversion technologies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Transition State Searches by Freezing String Method with Graph Neural Network Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition state (TS) searches are a critical bottleneck in computational studies of chemical reactivity, as accurately capturing complex phenomena like bond breaking and formation events requires repeated evaluations of expensive ab-initio potential energy surfaces (PESs). While numerous algorithms have been developed to locate TSs efficiently, the computational cost of PES evaluations remains a key limitation. In this work, we develop and fine-tune a graph neural network (GNN) PES to accelerate TS searches for organic reactions. Our GNN of choice, SchNet, is first pre-trained on the ANI-1 dataset and subsequently fine-tuned on a small dataset of reactant, product, and TS structures. We integrate this GNN PES into the Freezing String Method (FSM), enabling rapid generation of TS guess geometries. Across a benchmark suite of chemically diverse reactions, our fine-tuned model (GNN-FT) achieves a 100% success rate, locating the reference TSs in all cases while reducing the number of ab-initio calculations by 72% on average compared to conventional DFT-based FSM searches. Fine-tuning reduces GNN-FT errors by orders of magnitude for out-of-distribution cases such as non-covalent interactions, and improves TS-region predictions with comparatively little data. Analysis of transition state geometries and energy errors shows that GNN-FT captures PES along the reaction coordinate with sufficient accuracy to serve as a reliable DFT surrogate. These results demonstrate that modern GNN potentials, when properly trained, can significantly reduce the cost of TS searches and broaden the scope and size of systems considered in chemical reactivity studies.</description>

      <title>Charging dynamics of electric double layer capacitors including beyond-mean-field electrostatic correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric double layer (EDL) formation underlies the functioning of supercapacitors and several other electrochemical technologies. Here, we study how the EDL formation near two flat blocking electrodes separated by $2L$ is affected by beyond-mean-field Coulombic interactions, which can be substantial for electrolytes of high salt concentration or with multivalent ions. Our model combines the Nernst-Planck and Bazant-Storey-Kornyshev (BSK) equations; the latter is a modified Poisson equation with a correlation length $\ell_c$. In response to a voltage step, the system charges exponentially with a characteristic timescale $\tau$ that depends nonmonotonically on $\ell_c$. For small $\ell_c$, $\tau$ is given by the BSK capacitance times a dilute electrolyte's resistance, in line with [Zhao, Phys. Rev. E 84, 051504 (2011)]; here, $\tau$ decreases with increasing $\ell_c$. Increasing the correlation length beyond $\ell_c\approx L^{2/3}\lambda_D^{1/3}$, with $\lambda_D$ the Debye length, $\tau$ reaches a minimum, rises as $\tau\propto \lambda_D\ell_c/D$, and plateaus at $\tau=4L^2/(\pi^2 D)$. Our results imply that strongly correlated, strongly confined electrolytes - ionic liquids in the surface force balance apparatus, say - move slower than predicted so far.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to reduce the computational cost required for quantum dynamics simulations. However, existing quantum algorithms for coupled electron-nuclear dynamics simulation either require fault-tolerant devices, or use the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation and a truncation of the electronic basis. We present the first analog quantum simulation approach for molecular vibronic dynamics in a pre-BO framework, i.e. without the separation of electrons and nuclei, by mapping the molecular Hamiltonian to a device with coupled qubits and bosonic modes. We show that our approach has exponential savings in resource and computational costs compared to the equivalent classical algorithms. The computational cost of our approach is also exponentially lower than existing BO-based quantum algorithms. Furthermore, our approach has a much smaller resource scaling than the existing pre-BO quantum algorithms for chemical dynamics. The low cost of our approach will enable an exact treatment of electron-nuclear dynamics on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity learning for interatomic potentials: Low-level forces and high-level energies are all you need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The promise of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) has led to an abundance of public quantum mechanical (QM) training datasets. The quality of an MLIP is directly limited by the accuracy of the energies and atomic forces in the training dataset. Unfortunately, most of these datasets are computed with relatively low-accuracy QM methods, e.g., density functional theory with a moderate basis set. Due to the increased computational cost of more accurate QM methods, e.g., coupled-cluster theory with a complete basis set extrapolation, most high-accuracy datasets are much smaller and often do not contain atomic forces. The lack of high-accuracy atomic forces is quite troubling, as training with force data greatly improves the stability and quality of the MLIP compared to training to energy alone. Because most datasets are computed with a unique level of theory, traditional single-fidelity learning is not capable of leveraging the vast amounts of published QM data. In this study, we apply multi-fidelity learning to train an MLIP to multiple QM datasets of different levels of accuracy, i.e., levels of fidelity. Specifically, we perform three test cases to demonstrate that multi-fidelity learning with both low-level forces and high-level energies yields an extremely accurate MLIP -- far more accurate than a single-fidelity MLIP trained solely to high-level energies and almost as accurate as a single-fidelity MLIP trained directly to high-level energies and forces. Therefore, multi-fidelity learning greatly alleviates the need for generating large and expensive datasets containing high-accuracy atomic forces and allows for more effective training to existing high-accuracy energy-only datasets. Indeed, low-accuracy atomic forces and high-accuracy energies are all that are needed to achieve a high-accuracy MLIP with multi-fidelity learning.</description>

      <title>Physical spin torques from exactly constrained exchange-correlation torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of capturing physical spin torques in non-collinear magnetic systems has dominated the scene of spin-density functional theory (SDFT) in the last two decades. Progress has been hindered by the fact that the spin torque is directly connected to the divergence of the spin current, a quantity that is {\em extraneous} to SDFT -- thus leading to {\em spurious} exchange-correlation (xc) torques in the spin dynamics. Moreover, SDFT cannot rigorously include vector potentials and spin-orbit couplings. Here, we propose a solution that exploits the U(1)$\times$SU(2)-invariance of the xc energy of SpinCurrent-DFT (SCDFT) -- an exact constraint that is not accessible to SDFT. Non-vanishing xc torques obtained on non-collinear solutions are constrained by the aforementioned exact internal symmetry and do not enter the propagation of the spin magnetization -- i.e., the spin dynamics involve {\em only} the physical currents and physical spin-torques.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine van der Waals repulsion between open-shell polar molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a novel type of interaction between open-shell polar molecules at sub-millikelvin temperatures. This hyperfine van der Waals interaction occurs between two molecules in two rotational states that differ by one quantum. Normally, this induces resonant dipolar interactions that lead to rapid collisional loss. For specific hyperfine states, however, selection rules prevent this. One can effectively turn off the dipolar interaction by merely flipping a nuclear spin. The resulting van der Waals interaction can be repulsive and can suppress collisional loss. We focus on laser-coolable CaF, but show this effect occurs universally for open-shell molecules, including MgF, SrF, BaF and YO. We propose that this effect could be measured by merging molecules in optical tweezers, where flipping a spin in one of the tweezers enables tuning of collision rates by five orders of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Generating large, non-trivial quantum chemistry test problems with known ground-state solutions remains a core challenge for benchmarking electronic structure methods. Inspired by planted-solution techniques from combinatorial optimization, we introduce four classes of Hamiltonians with embedded, retrievable ground states. These Hamiltonians mimic realistic electronic structure problems, support adjustable complexity, and are derived from reference systems. Crucially, their ground-state energies can be computed exactly, provided the construction parameters are known. To obscure this structure and control perceived complexity, we introduce techniques such as killer operators, balance operators, and random orbital rotations. We showcase this framework using examples based on homogeneous catalysts of industrial relevance and validate tunable difficulty through density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) convergence behavior. Beyond enabling scalable, ground-truth benchmark generation, our approach offers a controlled setting to explore the limitations of electronic structure methods and investigate how Hamiltonian structure influences ground state solution difficulty.</description>
