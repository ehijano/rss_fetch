      <title>Probing flavor effects in QCD showers with heavy-flavor jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of jet substructure provide precise tests of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and offer a distinct way to study hadronization mechanisms, compared to measurements of hadrons alone. QCD predicts that jet radiation patterns depend on the mass and color charge of the initiating parton. Parton showers, in particular, are sensitive to the Casimir factors of quarks and gluons, as well as the parton mass due to the dead-cone effect. Three key charm-tagged jet measurements from the ALICE experiment are discussed.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{^{117m}Sn}$ and $\mathrm{^{119m}Te}$ Production via Proton Bombardment on Natural Antimony and Implications for Modeling Charged Particle Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\mathrm{^{117m}Sn}$ and $\mathrm{^{119}Sb}$, the latter of which is produced via a $\mathrm{^{119m}Te}$ generator, are promising radionuclides for the targeted treatment of both osteoarthritis and small mass tumors via Auger therapy. Experiments were conducted at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Brookhaven National Laboratory to measure the $\mathrm{^{nat}Sb}$(p,x)$\mathrm{^{117m}Sn}$ and $\mathrm{^{nat}Sb}$(p,x)$\mathrm{^{119m}Te}$ cross sections for incident proton energies up to 200 MeV. Additional measurements for co-produced isotopes are included as well. In addition to this dataset, this paper investigates improvements for proton-induced reaction modeling capabilities through comparison of these experimental dataset against theoretical models in TALYS 1.95. Parameter adjustments affecting level density, optical model potential, and pre-equilibrium emission were explored, with a goodness-of-fit metric established by the largest independent cross section channels and cross-validated with remaining channels.</description>

      <title>Canadian Contributions to the Search for Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for neutrinoless double beta decay has internationally been recognized as the most promising approach to determine the Majorana nature of neutrinos. This hypothesized decay would, if observed, violate lepton number in weak interactions by two units, hence, prove the existence of physics beyond the Standard Model. Current experiments with sensitivity to neutrinoless double beta decay half lives of $10^{26}$ years did not observe such a decay and worldwide efforts are ongoing to deploy experiments with half-life sensitivities beyond $10^{28}$ years. Canadian groups have been involved in this search for more than four decades. This article summarizes the historical experimental efforts and describes current Canadian contributions to neutrinoless double beta decay searches and their theoretical interpretation.</description>

      <title>Discrimination of neutron-$\gamma$ in the low energy regime using machine learning for an EJ-276D plastic scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present results for discrimination of neutron and $\gamma$ events using a plastic scintillator detector with pulse shape discrimination capabilities. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are used to improve the discriminatory power between neutron and $\gamma$ events at lower energy ranges which otherwise are not addressed by the conventional pulse shape discrimination techniques. The use of a multilayer perceptron with Bayesian inference (MLPBNN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are studied using the recorded waveforms from the detector. Three variables are constructed for the input of ML algorithms, which captures the essence of the differences in the head and tail part of the neutron and $\gamma$ waveforms. The training and the testing of the ML algorithms are done using an AmBe neutron source. In the lower energy region, the results obtained from the ML predictions are compared with the results obtained from a time of flight (ToF) technique to benchmark the overall performance of the ML algorithms. A reasonable agreement is observed between the results obtained from ML algorithm and the ToF experiment in the studied energy range. The MLPBNN gives better discriminatory power for the neutron and $\gamma$ events than the SVM algorithm.</description>

      <title>KHIFC-user friendly program for studying Heavy ion fusion barrier characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed an application for studying heavy ion fusion barrier characteristics such as such as fusion barrier heights ($V_B$), positions ($R_B$) and curvature of the inverted parabola ($\hbar\omega$). We call this application as KHIFC (Kolar Heavy Ion fusion barrier Characteristics). This software application hosted in the domain "https://systematics-of-heavy-ion-fusion.vercel.app/". This KHIFC produces fusion cross-sections with the simple input of projectile, target and center of mass energy. The values produced by the KHIFC is validated with experiments. Efficient tools like KHIFC are essential for researchers in nuclear physics, particularly when dealing with complex systems such as actinide and superheavy nuclei. By providing quick calculations and insights, it can significantly aid in experiment planning and theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Study of neutron response using time of flight technique in ISMRAN detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the measurements of the fast neutron energy response in Indian Scintillator Matrix for Reactor Anti-Neutrinos (ISMRAN) detector consisting of an array of 9$\times$10 Plastic Scintillator Bars (PSBs) at BARC, Mumbai. ISMRAN is an above ground detector setup at $\sim$13 m from the Dhruva reactor core for the detection of reactor anti-neutrinos (${\overline{\ensuremath{\nu}}}_{e}$) via the inverse beta decay (IBD) process. The dominant sources of reactor-related background in the vicinity of the detector are high energy $\gamma$-rays and fast neutrons. Therefore, a good understanding of fast neutron response in PSB is an essential pre-requisite for suppression and discrimination of the fast neutron background from IBD events. Kinetic energies of the fast neutron were determined using the Time-of-Flight (TOF) technique, which is used to get the scintillation light yield due to recoiling proton in PSB. We also measured the fast neutron capture time distribution in ISMRAN array using a novel technique involving TOF of the measured fast neutrons. The observed characteristic neutron capture time ( $\tau$ ) of 68.29 $\pm$ 9.48 $\mu$s is in good agreement with GEANT4 based MC simulation. These experimentally measured results will be useful for discriminating correlated and uncorrelated (accidental) background events from the true IBD events in reactor ON and OFF conditions inside the reactor hall.</description>

      <title>Using krypton-83m to determine the neutrino-mass bias caused by a non-constant electric potential of the KATRIN source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision spectroscopy of the electron spectrum of the tritium $\beta$ decay near the kinematic endpoint is a direct method to determine the effective electron antineutrino mass. The KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment aims to determine this quantity with a sensitivity of better than $0.3\,\mathrm{eV}$ ($90\,\%$~C.L.). An inhomogeneous electric potential in the tritium source of KATRIN leads to a distortion of the $\beta$ spectrum, which directly impacts the neutrino-mass observable. This effect can be quantified through precision spectroscopy of the conversion electrons of co-circulated metastable $^{83\mathrm{m}}Kr$. This work perturbatively describes the effect of the source potential on the recorded spectra, and thus establishes the leading-order observables of this effect.</description>

      <title>Deep-Inelastic Scattering at TeV Energies with LHC Muons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LHC far-forward experiments FASER and SND@LHC have pioneered the detection of TeV-energy neutrinos produced in hard-scattering proton-proton collisions at the LHC. In addition to neutrinos, an intense flux of TeV-energy muons reaches these detectors, representing a dominant background for both neutrino studies and beyond the Standard Model searches. Here we demonstrate that this forward muon flux enables a comprehensive neutral-current deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) program at FASER with a strong kinematical overlap with the Electron Ion Collider. For the Run 3 luminosity of $\mathcal{L}_{\rm pp}=250$~fb$^{-1}$, more than $10^5$ inclusive muon DIS events, of which up to $10^4$ for charm production, are expected at FASER$\nu$. As a representative application, we demonstrate the sensitivity of muon DIS at FASER$\nu$ to probe the (intrinsic) charm content of the proton at large-$x$. We also provide predictions for event yields of muon DIS for future FASER runs and for the proposed Forward Physics Facility.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological approach for introducing three-nucleon-force contributions into $p$-$d$ elastic scattering cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ($p,pd$) reaction is expected to be a powerful tool for probing three-nucleon forces (3NFs) in nuclear medium since it can be essentially regarded as the $p$-$d$ elastic scattering inside nuclei. One of the important points in the theoretical description of the ($p,pd$) reaction is to calculate the $p$-$d$ scattering in a nucleus including both two-nucleon (2N) force and 3NF contributions. This work aims to develop a phenomenological approach to incorporate 3NF contributions into $p$-$d$ elastic scattering in free space. The $p$-$d$ elastic scattering amplitude is decomposed into a 2N part, described using 2N effective interactions, and a residual part, assumed to primarily reflect 3NF contributions. The latter is approximated by a superposition of Legendre polynomials, with coefficients treated as adjustable parameters. These parameters are determined to reproduce experimental $p$-$d$ differential cross-section data at various incident energies. The obtained parameters exhibit smooth energy dependence, which is approximated by quadratic functions. The numerical results with the analytic energy dependence also reproduce the experimental data. The developed approach works well for incorporating the 3NF contributions into the $p$-$d$ elastic scattering cross section in a wide range of incident energies. This work can be regarded as the first step toward the description of ($p,pd$) reactions with taking 3NF effect in nuclear medium into account.</description>

      <title>A simulation model investigation of neutron-oxygen inelastic scattering and subsequent nucleus deexcitation based on experimental data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hadron interaction model for light nuclei plays an important role in understanding the event topology of neutrino-nucleus interaction in a large-scale neutrino detector. In the Super-Kamiokande experiment, the neutral current quasi-elastic interaction induced by atmospheric neutrinos introduces 68-82% uncertainty in the search for diffuse supernova neutrino background. This uncertainty stems from the mismodeling of the interaction between oxygen and fast neutrons generated by the neutral current quasi-elastic interaction, which is a crucial factor in the analysis. Therefore, a simulation study was performed, in which the newly released neutron-oxygen experimental data from the E487 and E525 experiments were compared. The result of comparing combinations of intranuclear cascade and deexcitation models is presented to choose a model that provides a superior prediction based on the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Study of the beyond standard model interaction using Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phenomenological studies are carried out to find the potential reach of a detector to constraints on possible beyond the standard model general neutrino interactions in the neutrino-quark sector, for the proposed Indian Coherent Neutrino-nucleus Scattering Experiment (ICNSE) at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in India. Reactors of different core configuration and power are used as sources of electron antineutrinos. The study has been carried out considering a target mass of 10 kg and an exposure of one year. It has been found that the ICNSE detector has a significant capacity to limit the majority of the Non-standard Interaction(NSI) parameter space. It has also been observed that a combination of results from two different types of detectors such as sapphire and high-purity germanium can significantly improve sensitivity by reducing the degeneracies between some pairs of NSI parameters to a smaller region.</description>

      <title>A New cw-NMR Q-meter for Dynamically Polarized Targets for Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarized solid targets produced via Dynamic Nuclear Polarization rely on Continuous-Wave Nuclear Magnetism Resonance measurements to accurately determine the degree of polarization of bulk samples polarized to nearly 100%. Since the late 1970's phase sensitive detection methods have been utilized to observe the magnetization of a sample as a small change in inductance under RF excitation near the Larmor frequency of the nuclear species of interest, using a device known as a Q-meter. Liverpool Q-meters, produced in the UK in the 80's and 90's, have been the workhorse devices for these targets for decades, however their age and scarcity has meant new systems are needed. We describe a Q-meter system designed and built at Jefferson Lab in the Liverpool style to have comparable electronic performance with several improvements to update and adapt the devices for modern use.</description>
