      <title>Hamiltonian treatment of non-conservative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel extension of Hamiltonian mechanics to nonconservative systems built upon the Schwinger-Keldysh-Galley double-variable action principle. Departing from Galley's initial-value action, we clarify important subtleties regarding boundary conditions, the emergence of the physical-limit trajectory, and the decomposition of the Lagrangian into conservative and dissipative sectors. Importantly, we demonstrate that the redundant doubled configuration space admits a gauge freedom at the level of the canonical momenta that leaves the physical dynamics unchanged. From a Legendre transform, we construct the corresponding family of gauge-related nonconservative Hamiltonians; we show that virtually any classical initial-value problem can be embedded on our enlarged symplectic manifold, supplying the associated Hamiltonian and Lagrangian functions explicitly. As a further contribution, we derive a completely equivalent linear ``Lie'' formulation of the double-variable action and Hamiltonian which streamlines computations and renders transparent many structural properties of the formalism.</description>

      <title>Rubber Friction: Theory, Mechanisms, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rubber friction is of major practical importance in applications such as tires, rubber seals, and footwear. This review article focuses on the theory and experimental studies of rubber friction on substrates with random roughness. We examine both steady sliding and accelerated motion, with particular attention to the origins of the breakloose friction force and the influence of pre-slip, elasticity, and flash temperature on friction dynamics. We further discuss rolling friction for cylinders and spheres, as well as sliding friction for triangular sliders on dry and lubricated rubber surfaces. Theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results obtained using different materials, geometries, and environmental conditions, highlighting the importance of accounting for multiscale roughness. Open challenges, such as the role of adhesion enhancement, energy dissipation due to crack opening, and the physical origin of the short-distance roughness cut-off, are discussed.</description>

      <title>On minimizing cyclists' ascent times: Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate an optimization of a bicycle ascent time under the constraints of the average, maximum, and minimum powers. In contrast to the first part of this study, we do not restrict the departure to flying starts with an initial speed determined by the model and its optimization. We allow for various initial speeds, from a standstill to a launched start. We accomplish this by generalizing the discontinuous piecewise constant speed model to a continuous piecewise linear speed model. Regardless of the initial speed, steepness or profile of the ascent the optimal strategy tends to a constant ground speed, in agreement with the conclusion of the previous, more restricted, formulation. This new formulation allows us to compare various initial-speed strategies and, hence, has a direct application to competitive cycling. Notably, in timetrials composed of flat and steep sections, it helps one decide whether or not to change bicycle, which requires stopping and restarting, from one that is more appropriate for flats to one that is more appropriate for uphills.</description>
