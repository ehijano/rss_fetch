      <title>Modeling electrothermal feedback of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors in SPICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) exhibit complex switching behaviors due to electrothermal feedback during the detection process. Modeling and understanding these behaviors is integral for designing superconducting devices; however, many models often prioritize accuracy over computational speed and intuitive integration for circuit designers. Here, we build upon a growing architecture of SPICE tools for superconducting nanowire devices by capturing complex residual heating effects in a compact thermal model of an SNSPD. We demonstrate that our model is comparable to more complicated thermal models of superconducting nanowire devices, including finite-element simulations, and is applicable for the fast development of SNSPD circuits.</description>

      <title>Observation of cluster magnetic octupole domains in the antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Mn3Sn nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Mn3Sn has attracted wide attention due to their vast anomalous transverse transport properties despite barely net magnetization. So far, the magnetic properties of Mn3Sn have been experimentally investigated on micrometer scale samples but not in nanometers. In this study, we measured the local anomalous Nernst effect of a (0001)-textured Mn3Sn nanowire using a tip-contact-induced temperature gradient with an atomic force microscope. Our approach directly provides the distribution of the cluster magnetic octupole moments in Mn3Sn with 80 nm spatial resolution, providing crucial information for integrating the Mn3Sn nanostructure into a memory device.</description>

      <title>High-Capacity and Real-Time Acoustic Communication by Multiplexing Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic communication is indispensable for underwater networks, deep ocean exploration, and biological monitoring, environments where electromagnetic waves become impractical. However, unlike the latter, whose vector polarization naturally supports multiple information channels, acoustic waves are longitudinal and have traditionally relied almost exclusively on a single scalar pressure channel, posing a fundamental limit on their data-carrying capacity. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the vector velocity of acoustic waves can serve as a polarization-like physical degree of freedom. Using its three components as mutually independent communication channels and demodulating them with a single vector sensor, we achieve reliable, high-capacity, and real-time information transmission. Multiplexing velocity adds a new dimension to acoustic communication. When combined with other physical degrees of freedom (frequency, phase, etc.), this approach can significantly enhance the information capacity, opening new avenues for next-generation acoustic technology.</description>

Abstract: We report a magnetic imaging method using atomic force microscopy to measure the locally induced anomalous Nernst effect. The tip contact creates a local temperature gradient on the sample surface controlled by a neighboring Joule heating wire.

      <title>Pulse Shape Discrimination Algorithms: Survey and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review presents a comprehensive survey and benchmark of pulse shape discrimination (PSD) algorithms for radiation detection, classifying nearly sixty methods into statistical (time-domain, frequency-domain, neural network-based) and prior-knowledge (machine learning, deep learning) paradigms. We implement and evaluate all algorithms on two standardized datasets: an unlabeled set from a 241Am-9Be source and a time-of-flight labeled set from a 238Pu-9Be source, using metrics including Figure of Merit (FOM), F1-score, ROC-AUC, and inter-method correlations. Our analysis reveals that deep learning models, particularly Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and hybrid approaches combining statistical features with neural regression, often outperform traditional methods. We discuss architectural suitabilities, the limitations of FOM, alternative evaluation metrics, and performance across energy thresholds. Accompanying this work, we release an open-source toolbox in Python and MATLAB, along with the datasets, to promote reproducibility and advance PSD research.</description>

      <title>Mixed Precision Photonic Computing with 3D Electronic-Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose advancing photonic in-memory computing through three-dimensional photonic-electronic integrated circuits using phase-change materials (PCM) and AlGaAs-CMOS technology. These circuits offer high precision (greater than 12 bits), scalability (greater than 1024 by 1024), and massive parallelism (greater than 1 million operations) across the wavelength, spatial, and temporal domains at ultra-low power (less than 1 watt per PetaOPS). Monolithically integrated hybrid PCM-AlGaAs memory resonators handle coarse-precision iterations (greater than 5-bit most significant bit precision) through reversible PCM phase transitions. Electro-optic memristive tuning enables fine-precision updates (greater than 8-bit least significant bit precision), resulting in over 12-bit precision for in-memory computing. The use of low-loss PCM (less than 0.01 dB per cm) and electro-optical tuning yields memristive optical resonators with high Q-factors (greater than 1 million), low insertion loss, and low tuning power. A W by W photonic tensor core composed of PCM-AlGaAs memresonators performs general matrix multiplication (GEMM) across W wavelengths from optical frequency combs, with minimal crosstalk and loss. Hierarchical scaling in the wavelength domain (K) and spatial domain (L) enables this system to address high-dimensional (N) scientific partial differential equation (PDE) problems in a single constant-time operation, compared to the conventional quadratic-time (N squared) computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Observation of Anomalous Hall Effect in Bulk Single Crystals of n-type Cr-doped Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of topological Dirac surface states is significant in the realms of condensed matter physics and future technological innovations. Among the materials garnering attention is Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$, a compound that theoretically exhibits topological insulating properties. However, its inherent p-type nature prevents the direct experimental verification of its Dirac surface state due to the Fermi level alignment with the valence band. In this study, by doping Cr atoms into Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$, n-type behavior is observed in the Hall resistance measurements. Remarkably, the Cr-doped Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ not only shows ferromagnetism with a high transition temperature of approximately 170 K but also exhibits an anomalous Hall effect (AHE). The Cr doping also allows for a controlled method for Fermi level tuning into the band gap. These properties spotlight its potential as an n-type magnetic topological insulator (MTI) as well as a material candidate for the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), opening new avenues for applications in spintronics and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence and Generative Models for Materials Discovery -- A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High throughput experimentation tools, machine learning (ML) methods, and open material databases are radically changing the way new materials are discovered. From the experimentally driven approach in the past, we are moving quickly towards the artificial intelligence (AI) driven approach, realizing the 'inverse design' capabilities that allow the discovery of new materials given the desired properties. This review aims to discuss different principles of AI-driven generative models that are applicable for materials discovery, including different materials representations available for this purpose. We will also highlight specific applications of generative models in designing new catalysts, semiconductors, polymers, or crystals while addressing challenges such as data scarcity, computational cost, interpretability, synthesizability, and dataset biases. Emerging approaches to overcome limitations and integrate AI with experimental workflows will be discussed, including multimodal models, physics informed architectures, and closed-loop discovery systems. This review aims to provide insights for researchers aiming to harness AI's transformative potential in accelerating materials discovery for sustainability, healthcare, and energy innovation.</description>

      <title>On-Chip Frequency Noise Cancellation in Nanomechanical Resonators using Cavity Optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and minimizing the sources of frequency noise in nanomechanical resonators is crucial for many sensing applications. In this work, we report an ultracoherent perimeter-mode nanomechanical resonator co-integrated with an on-chip optical cavity. This device combines low thermomechanical force noise and low detector noise, allowing us to study its intrinsic frequency fluctuations in detail. We find that the fluctuations of two mechanical modes are strongly correlated. Moreover, we demonstrate the generation of a signal at the frequency difference between the two modes directly on chip via nonlinear optomechanical transduction. This `difference signal' has vastly reduced intrinsic frequency fluctuations and can be used for frequency tracking with high precision, as we establish in a proof-of-principle experiment.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and Mitigating Flux Crosstalk in Superconducting Qubits-Couplers System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits have achieved exceptional gate fidelities, exceeding the error-correction threshold in recent years. One key ingredient of such improvement is the introduction of tunable couplers to control the qubit-to-qubit coupling through frequency tuning. Moving toward fault-tolerant quantum computation, increasing the number of physical qubits is another step toward effective error correction codes. Under a multiqubit architecture, flux control (Z) lines are crucial in tuning the frequency of the qubits and couplers. However, dense flux lines result in magnetic flux crosstalk, wherein magnetic flux applied to one element inadvertently affects neighboring qubits or couplers. This crosstalk obscures the idle frequency of the qubit when flux bias is applied, which degrades gate performance and calibration accuracy. In this study, we characterize flux crosstalk and suppress it in a multiqubit-coupler chip with multi-Z lines without adding additional readout for couplers. By quantifying the mutual flux-induced frequency shifts of qubits and couplers, we construct a cancellation matrix that enables precise compensation of non-local flux, demonstrating a substantial reduction in Z-line crosstalk from 56.5$\,$permille$\,$to 0.13$\,$permille$\,$ which is close to statistical error. Flux compensation corrects the CZ SWAP measurement, leading to a symmetric map with respect to flux bias. Compared with a crosstalk-free calculated CZ SWAP map, the measured map indicates that our approach provides a near-zero crosstalk for the coupler-transmon system. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing flux crosstalk-free control and supporting its potential for scaling superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Formula-Guided Machine Learning for Ground Vibration Propagation and Attenuation Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the propagation and attenuation patterns of ground vibrations is critical for evaluating the impact of environmental disturbances on large-scale scientific facilities. However, complex site conditions often result in intricate vibration behaviors, limiting the accuracy of traditional predictive methods. This study proposes a hybrid iterative fitting method that integrates machine learning with the Bornitz formula through an intelligent formula generation model. The method enables the automatic derivation of high-precision, interpretable ground vibration attenuation formulas from experimental data. A case study was conducted at the High Energy Photon Source in Beijing, where field tests were performed to collect vibration data. Using the proposed approach, an attenuation formula describing ground vibration propagation was derived. The physical validity of the model was further verified via finite element simulations. A probabilistic analysis was then employed to estimate computational errors. Comparative evaluations with black-box machine learning models and empirical formulas from previous studies demonstrate that the proposed method offers significant advantages in both interpretability and accuracy. These findings provide a valuable framework for vibration impact assessment and mitigation in other large-scale scientific infrastructure projects.</description>

Abstract: Optical computing systems deliver unrivalled processing speeds for scalar operations. Yet, integrated implementations have been constrained to low-dimensional tensor operations that fall short of the vector dimensions required for modern artificial intelligence. We demonstrate an all-optical neuromorphic computing system based on time division multiplexing, capable of processing input vectors exceeding 250,000 elements within a unified framework. The platform harnesses optically driven thermo-optic modulation in standing wave optical fields, with titanium nano-antennas functioning as wavelength-selective absorbers. Counterintuitively, the thermal time dynamics of the system enable simultaneous time integration of ultra-fast (50GHz) signals and the application of programmable, non-linear activation functions, entirely within the optical domain. This unified framework constitutes a leap towards large-scale photonic computing that satisfies the dimensional requirements of AI workloads.</description>

Abstract: Radiation hardness of scintillating nanocomposites consisting of inorganic scintillating nanocrystalline powders dispersed in organic matrices was studied under electron, X-ray and {\gamma}-ray irradiation. Samples including pure press-compacted pellets of powder ZnO:Ga and YSO:Ce, and the nanocomposites of powder ZnO:Ga and YSO:Ce embedded in polystyrene matrix with different fillings were investigated. Effects of radiation on radioluminescence and other optical properties of studied materials were evaluated. Bright burn effect related to nanocrystalline powder scintillators was observed at lower doses. Radiation damage in nanocomposite materials is related to the formation of radicals in polystyrene matrix. Extent of radiation damage decreases with ZnO:Ga filling. Presented results show the importance of systematic and complex study of the radiation stability of composite scintillators.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Light Coupling Control in Ultrathin Photonic Nanomembranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic layer materials have emerged as essential building blocks for next generation quantum and semiconductor technologies, where atomic scale control over light matter interactions is critical. However, their inherently small optical interaction volume poses fundamental challenges for efficient integration into quantum and nanophotonic devices. Addressing this limitation requires the development of photonic platforms that can effectively enhance atomic-scale optical coupling. To this end, air suspended nanomembranes with extreme thinness and minimal radiative loss offer an ideal framework for integrating atomic layer materials into photonic systems. Here, we demonstrate an ultrathin freestanding photonic nanomembrane with a thickness down to 29 nm comparable to that of atomic layer materials enabling atomic scale control of light coupling. This architecture supports strong field confinement at the surface and significantly enhances light matter interaction. Through the integration of atomic layer material, we achieve angstrom level thickness modulation, where a single atomic-layer-deposition cycle corresponding to a thickness increment of 0.65 angstrom results in a 0.09 nm shift in the high Q resonance. High-resolution spatial mapping further confirms uniform and deterministic resonance tuning across the nanomembrane surface. This approach provides a scalable and versatile route for atomic-scale light coupling, effectively overcoming the limitations of conventional photonics and enabling progress in quantum photonics, 2D optoelectronics, and advanced semiconductor technologies.</description>

      <title>A More Convex Ising Formulation of Max-3-Cut Using Higher-Order Spin Interactions</title>

Abstract: Many combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are naturally expressed using variables that take on more than two discrete values. To solve such problems using Ising machines (IMs) - specialized analog or digital devices designed to solve COPs efficiently - these multi-valued integers must be encoded using binary spin variables. A common approach is one-hot encoding, where each variable is represented by a group of spins constrained so that exactly one spin is in the "up" state. However, this encoding introduces energy barriers: changing an integer's value requires flipping two spins and passing through an invalid intermediate state. This creates rugged energy landscapes that may hinder optimization. We propose a higher-order Ising formulation for Max-3-Cut, which is the smallest fundamental COP with multi-valued integer variables. Our formulation preserves valid configurations under single-spin updates. The resulting energy landscapes are smoother, and we show that this remains true even when the binary variables are relaxed to continuous values, making it well-suited for analog IMs as well. Benchmarking on such an IM, we find that the higher-order formulation leads to significantly faster solutions than the Ising baseline. Interestingly, we find that an empirical rescaling of some terms in the Ising formulation - a heuristic proposed in prior work - approaches the performance of the higher-order Ising formulation, underscoring the importance of empirical parameter tuning in COP encodings.</description>

      <title>Large-Area Photonic Membranes Achieving Uniform and Strong Enhancement of Photoluminescence and Second-Harmonic Generation in Monolayer WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit strong excitonic responses, direct bandgaps, and remarkable nonlinear optical properties, making them highly attractive for integrated photonic, optoelectronic, and quantum applications. Here, we present a large area freestanding membrane photonic platform that achieves exceptional enhancement of light matter interactions in monolayer WSe2 via quasi bound states in the continuum. The freestanding architecture effectively suppresses radiative losses and supports high Q optical resonances, leading to enhanced light matter interactions. This results in significant photoluminescence emission and second harmonic generation enhancement factors of 1158 and 378, respectively, with spatial uniformity sustained across a 450 times 450 um2 area. This uniform SHG enhancement further enables polarization resolved mapping of crystal orientation and grain boundaries, offering a practical method for large area structural characterization of 2D materials. Moreover, femtosecond pumped SHG spectra reveal multiple narrowband peaks originating from distinct quasi BIC modes providing direct spectral evidence of resonantly enhanced nonlinear coupling. The combined attributes of strong optical enhancement, spectral selectivity, and wafer scale compatibility establish this platform as a scalable interface for 2D semiconductor integration in next generation optoelectronic, nonlinear, and quantum photonic technologies.</description>
