      <title>Convex iso-Delaunay regions in strata of translation surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strata of translation surfaces are covered by the closures of finitely many iso-Delaunay regions: open subspaces parametrizing surfaces whose Delaunay triangulations are combinatorially equivalent. We prove that the iso-Delaunay regions for triangulations with involutions called triangle matchings are convex with respect to the angle coordinates of the triangles. As a corollary, we show that all iso-Delaunay regions in hyperelliptic stratum components are convex. This work generalizes two directions in the theory of flat surfaces.</description>

      <title>On bifoliated planes, their structure and group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bifoliated planes arise naturally in the study of Anosov flows on $3$-manifolds. To any Anosov flow on a $3$-manifold $M$, one can associate a bifoliated plane equipped with an action of the fundamental group of $M$ which encodes the topology of the flow.
  This thesis begins by showing left-orderability of any group acting faithfully on a bifoliated plane. We then describe the bifoliated planes associated with two families of Anosov flows which are constructed from algebraic and combinatorial data via gluing procedures. For one of these families, we show that all the resulting bifoliated planes are isomorphic. In contrast, for the other family, we show that the defining data can be recovered as a topological invariant of the bifoliated plane.</description>

      <title>The Euler class of the normal bundle of a Seifert fibration and horizontal foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Seifert fibred manifolds with orientable base orbifolds, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the Euler class of the normal bundle of the Seifert fibration to vanish. When the base orbifold is hyperbolic, we also provide a second proof of this condition from the perspective of discrete faithful representations of Fuchsian groups.
  As an application, we present infinitely many Seifert fibred rational homology spheres that admit co-oriented taut foliations but none with vanishing Euler class. In the context of the $L$-space conjecture, these provide examples of rational homology spheres that admit co-oriented taut foliations (and hence are not $L$-spaces) and have left-orderable fundamental groups yet none of the left-orders arise directly from the universal circle actions associated to co-oriented taut foliations.</description>

      <title>Applications of the L-space satellite formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a formula for the $\tau$-invariant of a satellite knot $P(K,n)$ when $P$ is an L-space satellite operator. Our formula holds for general L-space satellite operators $P$ when the companion $K$ satisfies $\epsilon(K)=1$. When $\epsilon(K)$ is $0$ or $-1$, we state a formula which requires some additional assumptions on $P$ or $n$. Our main tool is our algorithm which computes the knot Floer complex of satellite knots constructed using L-space satellite operators, which we developed in a previous paper. Our formula for $\tau$ recovers many existing formulas for the behavior of $\tau$ under satellite operators, including for cables. We apply our formula to questions about the slice genus of satellite knots, showing, e.g., that if $K$ is a knot with $\tau(K)=g_4(K)&gt;0$, then satellites of $K$ by L-space satellite operators have the same property. Another application is a proof that L-space satellite operators satisfy a conjecture of Hedden and Pinz\'on-Caicedo: If $P$ is an L-space satellite operator which acts as a group homomorphism on the smooth concordance group, then $P$ is either the zero operator, the identity operator, or the orientation reversing operator.</description>

      <title>Splitting links by integer homology spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every $n \ge 3$, we construct 2-component links in $S^{n+1}$ that are a split by an integer homology $n$-sphere, but not by $S^n$. In the special case $n=3$, i.e. that of 2-links in $S^4$, we produce an infinite family of links $L_\ell$ and of integer homology spheres $Y_\ell$ such that the link $L_\ell$ is (topologically or smoothly) split by $Y_\ell$ and by no other integer homology sphere in the family.</description>

      <title>A Fast, Strong, Topologically Meaningful and Fun Knot Invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a pair of polynomial knot invariants $\Theta=(\Delta,\theta)$ which is:
  * Theoretically and practically fast: $\Theta$ can be computed in polynomial time. We can compute it in full on random knots with over 300 crossings, and its evaluation at simple rational numbers on random knots with over 600 crossings.
  * Strong: Its separation power is much greater than the hyperbolic volume, the HOMFLY-PT polynomial and Khovanov homology (taken together) on knots with up to 15 crossings (while being computable on much larger knots).
  * Topologically meaningful: It likely gives a genus bound, and there are reasons to hope that it would do more.
  * Fun: Scroll to Figures 1.1-1.4, 3.1, and 6.2.
  $\Delta$ is merely the Alexander polynomial. $\theta$ is almost certainly equal to an invariant that was studied extensively by Ohtsuki, continuing Rozansky, Kricker, and Garoufalidis. Yet our formulas, proofs, and programs are much simpler and enable its computation even on very large knots.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Morse Theory and Witten Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11712v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On symplectic manifolds, we introduce a Morse-type complex with elements generated by pairs of critical points of a Morse function. The differential of the complex consists of gradient flows and an integration of the symplectic structure over spaces of gradient flow lines. Using the Witten deformation method, we prove that the cohomology of this complex is independent of both the Riemannian metric and the Morse function used to define the complex and is in fact isomorphic to the cohomology of differential forms of Tsai, Tseng and Yau (TTY). We also obtain Morse-type inequalities that bound the dimensions of the TTY cohomologies by the number of Morse critical points and the interaction of symplectic structure with the critical points.</description>

      <title>A threshold for relative hyperbolicity in random right-angled Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the random right-angled Coxeter group $W_{\Gamma}$ whose presentation graph $\Gamma\sim \mathcal{G}_{n,p}$ is an Erd{\H o}s--R\'enyi random graph on $n$ vertices with edge probability $p=p(n)$. We establish that $p=1/\sqrt{n}$ is a threshold for relative hyperbolicity of the random group $W_{\Gamma}$. As a key step in the proof, we determine the minimal number of pairs of generators that must commute in a right-angled Coxeter group which is not relatively hyperbolic, a result which is of independent interest.
  We also show that there is an interval of edge probabilities of width $\Omega(1/\sqrt{n})$ in which the random right-angled Coxeter group has precisely cubic divergence. This interval is between the thresholds for relative hyperbolicity (whence exponential divergence) and quadratic divergence. Moreover, a simple random walk on any Cayley graph of the random right-angled Coxeter group for $p$ in this interval satisfies a central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Nucleation via Topological Surgery in Lorentzian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a model for the nucleation of a wormhole within a Lorentzian spacetime by employing techniques from topological surgery and Morse theory. In our framework, a 0-surgery process describes the neighborhood of the nucleation point inside a compact region of spacetime, yielding a singular Lorentzian cobordism that connects two spacelike regions with different topologies. To avoid the singularity at the critical point of the Morse function, we employ the Misner trick of taking a connected sum with a closed 4-manifold -- namely $\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ -- to obtain an everywhere nondegenerate Lorentzian metric. This connected sum replaces the naked singularity with a region containing closed timelike curves. The obtained spacetime is nonsingular, but violates all the standard energy conditions. Our construction, thus, shows that a wormhole can be "created" without singularities in classical general relativity.</description>
