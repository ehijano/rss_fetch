      <title>SenTopX: Benchmark for User Sentiment on Various Topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toxic sentiment analysis on Twitter (X) often focuses on specific topics and events such as politics and elections. Datasets of toxic users in such research are typically gathered through lexicon-based techniques, providing only a cross-sectional view. his approach has a tight confine for studying toxic user behavior and effective platform moderation. To identify users consistently spreading toxicity, a longitudinal analysis of their tweets is essential. However, such datasets currently do not exist.
  This study addresses this gap by collecting a longitudinal dataset from 143K Twitter users, covering the period from 2007 to 2021, amounting to a total of 293 million tweets. Using topic modeling, we extract all topics discussed by each user and categorize users into eight groups based on the predominant topic in their timelines. We then analyze the sentiments of each group using 16 toxic scores. Our research demonstrates that examining users longitudinally reveals a distinct perspective on their comprehensive personality traits and their overall impact on the platform. Our comprehensive dataset is accessible to researchers for additional analysis.</description>

      <title>Patterns of co-occurrent skills in UK job adverts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A job usually involves the application of several complementary or synergistic skills to perform its required tasks. Such relationships are implicitly recognised by employers in the skills they demand when recruiting new employees. Here we construct a skills network based on their co-occurrence in a national level data set of 65 million job postings from the UK spanning 2016 to 2022. We then apply multiscale graph-based community detection to obtain data-driven skill clusters at different levels of resolution that reveal a modular structure across scales. Skill clusters display diverse levels of demand and occupy varying roles within the skills network: some have broad reach across the network (high closeness centrality) while others have higher levels of within-cluster containment, yet with high interconnection across clusters and no skill silos. The skill clusters also display varying levels of semantic similarity, highlighting the difference between co-occurrence in adverts and intrinsic thematic consistency. Clear geographic variation is evident in the demand for each skill cluster across the UK, broadly reflecting the industrial characteristics of each region, e.g., London appears as an outlier as an international hub for finance, education and business. Comparison of data from 2016 and 2022 reveals employers are demanding a broader range of skills over time, with more adverts featuring skills spanning different clusters. We also show that our data-driven clusters differ from expert-authored categorisations of skills, indicating that important relationships between skills are not captured by expert assessment alone.</description>

      <title>Analyzing and Estimating Support for U.S. Presidential Candidates in Twitter Polls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polls posted on social media have emerged in recent years as an important tool for estimating public opinion, e.g., to gauge public support for business decisions and political candidates in national elections. Here, we examine nearly two thousand Twitter polls gauging support for U.S. presidential candidates during the 2016 and 2020 election campaigns. First, we describe the rapidly emerging prevalence of social polls. Second, we characterize social polls in terms of their heterogeneity and response options. Third, leveraging machine learning models for user attribute inference, we describe the demographics, political leanings, and other characteristics of the users who author and interact with social polls. Finally, we study the relationship between social poll results, their attributes, and the characteristics of users interacting with them. Our findings reveal that Twitter polls are biased in various ways, starting from the position of the presidential candidates among the poll options to biases in demographic attributes and poll results. The 2016 and 2020 polls were predominantly crafted by older males and manifested a pronounced bias favoring candidate Donald Trump, in contrast to traditional surveys, which favored Democratic candidates. We further identify and explore the potential reasons for such biases in social polling and discuss their potential repercussions. Finally, we show that biases in social media polls can be corrected via regression and poststratification. The errors of the resulting election estimates can be as low as 1%-2%, suggesting that social media polls can become a promising source of information about public opinion.</description>

      <title>Can Social Media Platforms Transcend Political Labels? An Analysis of Neutral Conservations on Truth Social</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a prevailing perception that content on a social media platform generally have the same political leaning. These platforms are often viewed as ideologically congruent entities, reflecting the majority opinion of their users; a prime example of this is Truth Social. While this perception may exist, it is essential to verify the platform's credibility, acknowledging that such platforms contain meaningful insights with neutral stances. To this end, we examine the dissemination of Wikipedia links on the alt-right platform, Truth Social. Wikipedia is recognized for enforcing content neutrality and serves as a unique lens to analyze the objectivity of user-generated content on Truth Social. By scrutinizing Truths with and without Wikipedia links, identifying toxicity trends &amp; recognizing coordinated networks, we observe a lower level of engagement and a tendency for Truths shared on Truth Social to cover more neutral topics when it includes Wikipedia links (Wiki Truths). Given the significantly different engagement and nature of content shared of Wiki Truths against Non-Wiki Truths, we emphasize that we should not generalize the techno-political affiliation of a social media platform, but rather should investigate the content closely.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Relationship Between User Specialization and Toxicity on Reddit: A Sentiment Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online platforms host a diverse user base, which can be broadly categorized into "specialist users" with focused interests and "generalist users" who engage in a wide range of topics. This study explores the behavioral differences between these two user types on the popular platform Reddit, focusing on the level of toxicity in their posts and the associated sentiment scores across 24 emotional categories and a neutral state. By employing community embeddings to represent users in a high-dimensional space, we measure activity diversity using the GS score. We analyze a dataset of 16,291,992 posts from 4,926,237 users spanning the period from 2019 to 2021, assessing the degree of toxicity and sentiment scores for each post. Our findings indicate that specialist users exhibit higher levels of toxic behavior compared to generalist users. Furthermore, specialist users demonstrate elevated scores for annoyance, sadness, and fear, while generalist users show higher scores for curiosity, admiration, and love. These insights contribute to a better understanding of user behavior on online platforms and can inform strategies for fostering healthier online communities.</description>

      <title>PriME: Privacy-aware Membership profile Estimation in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to estimating community membership probabilities for network vertices generated by the Degree Corrected Mixed Membership Stochastic Block Model while preserving individual edge privacy. Operating within the $\varepsilon$-edge local differential privacy framework, we introduce an optimal private algorithm based on a symmetric edge flip mechanism and spectral clustering for accurate estimation of vertex community memberships. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the estimation risk and establish the optimality of our procedure by providing matching lower bounds to the minimax risk under privacy constraints. To validate our approach, we demonstrate its performance through numerical simulations and its practical application to real-world data. This work represents a significant step forward in balancing accurate community membership estimation with stringent privacy preservation in network data analysis.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguring Participatory Design to Resist AI Realism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing trend of artificial intelligence (AI) as a solution to social and technical problems reinforces AI Realism -- the belief that AI is an inevitable and natural order. In response, this paper argues that participatory design (PD), with its focus on democratic values and processes, can play a role in questioning and resisting AI Realism. I examine three concerning aspects of AI Realism: the facade of democratization that lacks true empowerment, demands for human adaptability in contrast to AI systems' inflexibility, and the obfuscation of essential human labor enabling the AI system. I propose resisting AI Realism by reconfiguring PD to continue engaging with value-centered visions, increasing its exploration of non-AI alternatives, and making the essential human labor underpinning AI systems visible. I position PD as a means to generate friction against AI Realism and open space for alternative futures centered on human needs and values.</description>

      <title>Author, Content or Sharers? Estimating Spread Dynamics with Bayesian Mixture Hawkes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spread of content on social media is shaped by intertwining factors on three levels: the source, the content itself, and the pathways of content spread. At the lowest level, the popularity of the sharing user determines its eventual reach. However, higher-level factors such as the nature of the online item and the credibility of its source also play crucial roles in determining how widely and rapidly the online item spreads. In this work, we propose the Bayesian Mixture Hawkes (BMH) model to jointly learn the influence of source, content and spread. We formulate the BMH model as a hierarchical mixture model of separable Hawkes processes, accommodating different classes of Hawkes dynamics and the influence of feature sets on these classes. We test the BMH model on two learning tasks, cold-start popularity prediction and temporal profile generalization performance, applying to two real-world retweet cascade datasets referencing articles from controversial and traditional media publishers. The BMH model outperforms the state-of-the-art models and predictive baselines on both datasets and utilizes cascade- and item-level information better than the alternatives. Lastly, we perform a counter-factual analysis where we apply the trained publisher-level BMH models to a set of article headlines and show that effectiveness of headline writing style (neutral, clickbait, inflammatory) varies across publishers. The BMH model unveils differences in style effectiveness between controversial and reputable publishers, where we find clickbait to be notably more effective for reputable publishers as opposed to controversial ones, which links to the latter's overuse of clickbait.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.18051v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a method called graph fusion embedding, designed for multi-graph embedding with shared vertex sets. Under the framework of supervised learning, our method exhibits a remarkable and highly desirable synergistic effect: for sufficiently large vertex size, the accuracy of vertex classification consistently benefits from the incorporation of additional graphs. We establish the mathematical foundation for the method, including the asymptotic convergence of the embedding, a sufficient condition for asymptotic optimal classification, and the proof of the synergistic effect for vertex classification. Our comprehensive simulations and real data experiments provide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness of our proposed method, showcasing the pronounced synergistic effect for multiple graphs from disparate sources.</description>

      <title>Finding mixed memberships in categorical data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Latent class analysis, a fundamental problem in categorical data analysis, often encounters overlapping latent classes that introduce further challenges. This paper presents a solution to this problem by focusing on finding latent mixed memberships of subjects in categorical data with polytomous responses. We employ the Grade of Membership (GoM) model, which assigns each subject a membership score in each latent class. To address this, we propose two efficient spectral algorithms for estimating these mixed memberships and other GoM parameters. Our algorithms are based on the singular value decomposition of a regularized Laplacian matrix. We establish their convergence rates under a mild condition on data sparsity. Additionally, we introduce a metric to evaluate the quality of estimated mixed memberships for real-world categorical data and determine the optimal number of latent classes based on this metric. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our methods through experiments on both computer-generated and real-world categorical datasets.</description>

      <title>Robust Ante-hoc Graph Explainer using Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explaining the decisions made by machine learning models for high-stakes applications is critical for increasing transparency and guiding improvements to these decisions. This is particularly true in the case of models for graphs, where decisions often depend on complex patterns combining rich structural and attribute data. While recent work has focused on designing so-called post-hoc explainers, the broader question of what constitutes a good explanation remains open. One intuitive property is that explanations should be sufficiently informative to reproduce the predictions given the data. In other words, a good explainer can be repurposed as a predictor. Post-hoc explainers do not achieve this goal as their explanations are highly dependent on fixed model parameters (e.g., learned GNN weights). To address this challenge, we propose RAGE (Robust Ante-hoc Graph Explainer), a novel and flexible ante-hoc explainer designed to discover explanations for graph neural networks using bilevel optimization, with a focus on the chemical domain. RAGE can effectively identify molecular substructures that contain the full information needed for prediction while enabling users to rank these explanations in terms of relevance. Our experiments on various molecular classification tasks show that RAGE explanations are better than existing post-hoc and ante-hoc approaches.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Can Infer Psychological Dispositions of Social Media Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly human-like abilities across a wide variety of tasks. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs like ChatGPT can accurately infer the psychological dispositions of social media users and whether their ability to do so varies across socio-demographic groups. Specifically, we test whether GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can derive the Big Five personality traits from users' Facebook status updates in a zero-shot learning scenario. Our results show an average correlation of r = .29 (range = [.22, .33]) between LLM-inferred and self-reported trait scores - a level of accuracy that is similar to that of supervised machine learning models specifically trained to infer personality. Our findings also highlight heterogeneity in the accuracy of personality inferences across different age groups and gender categories: predictions were found to be more accurate for women and younger individuals on several traits, suggesting a potential bias stemming from the underlying training data or differences in online self-expression. The ability of LLMs to infer psychological dispositions from user-generated text has the potential to democratize access to cheap and scalable psychometric assessments for both researchers and practitioners. On the one hand, this democratization might facilitate large-scale research of high ecological validity and spark innovation in personalized services. On the other hand, it also raises ethical concerns regarding user privacy and self-determination, highlighting the need for stringent ethical frameworks and regulation.</description>

      <title>Networked Inequality: Preferential Attachment Bias in Graph Neural Network Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) link prediction is increasingly deployed in citation, collaboration, and online social networks to recommend academic literature, collaborators, and friends. While prior research has investigated the dyadic fairness of GNN link prediction, the within-group (e.g., queer women) fairness and "rich get richer" dynamics of link prediction remain underexplored. However, these aspects have significant consequences for degree and power imbalances in networks. In this paper, we shed light on how degree bias in networks affects Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) link prediction. In particular, we theoretically uncover that GCNs with a symmetric normalized graph filter have a within-group preferential attachment bias. We validate our theoretical analysis on real-world citation, collaboration, and online social networks. We further bridge GCN's preferential attachment bias with unfairness in link prediction and propose a new within-group fairness metric. This metric quantifies disparities in link prediction scores within social groups, towards combating the amplification of degree and power disparities. Finally, we propose a simple training-time strategy to alleviate within-group unfairness, and we show that it is effective on citation, social, and credit networks.</description>

      <title>BanglaAutoKG: Automatic Bangla Knowledge Graph Construction with Semantic Neural Graph Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have proven essential in information processing and reasoning applications because they link related entities and give context-rich information, supporting efficient information retrieval and knowledge discovery; presenting information flow in a very effective manner. Despite being widely used globally, Bangla is relatively underrepresented in KGs due to a lack of comprehensive datasets, encoders, NER (named entity recognition) models, POS (part-of-speech) taggers, and lemmatizers, hindering efficient information processing and reasoning applications in the language. Addressing the KG scarcity in Bengali, we propose BanglaAutoKG, a pioneering framework that is able to automatically construct Bengali KGs from any Bangla text. We utilize multilingual LLMs to understand various languages and correlate entities and relations universally. By employing a translation dictionary to identify English equivalents and extracting word features from pre-trained BERT models, we construct the foundational KG. To reduce noise and align word embeddings with our goal, we employ graph-based polynomial filters. Lastly, we implement a GNN-based semantic filter, which elevates contextual understanding and trims unnecessary edges, culminating in the formation of the definitive KG. Empirical findings and case studies demonstrate the universal effectiveness of our model, capable of autonomously constructing semantically enriched KGs from any text.</description>

      <title>Temporal Graph Rewiring with Expander Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolving relations in real-world networks are often modelled by temporal graphs. Graph rewiring techniques have been utilised on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve expressiveness and increase model performance. In this work, we propose Temporal Graph Rewiring (TGR), the first approach for graph rewiring on temporal graphs. TGR enables communication between temporally distant nodes in a continuous time dynamic graph by utilising expander graph propagation to construct a message passing highway for message passing between distant nodes. Expander graphs are suitable candidates for rewiring as they help overcome the oversquashing problem often observed in GNNs. On the public tgbl-wiki benchmark, we show that TGR improves the performance of a widely used TGN model by a significant margin. Our code repository is accessible at https://github.com/kpetrovicc/TGR.git .</description>
