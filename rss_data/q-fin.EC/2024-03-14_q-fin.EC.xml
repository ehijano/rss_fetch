      <title>A vicious cycle along busy bus corridors and how to abate it</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unveil that a previously-unreported vicious cycle can be created when bus queues form at curbside stops along a corridor. Buses caught in this cycle exhibit growing variation in headways as they travel from stop to stop. Bus (and patron) delays accumulate in like fashion and can grow large on long, busy corridors. We show that this damaging cycle can be abated in simple ways. Present solutions entail holding buses at a corridor entrance and releasing them as per various strategies proposed in the literature. We introduce a modest variant to the simplest of these strategies. It releases buses at headways that are slightly less than, or equal to, the scheduled values. It turns out that periodically releasing buses at slightly smaller headways can substantially reduce bus delays caused by holding so that benefits can more readily outweigh costs in corridors that contain a sufficient number of serial bus stops. The simple variant is shown to perform about as well as, or better than, other bus-holding strategies in terms of saving delays, and is more effective than other strategies in regularizing bus headways. We also show that grouping buses from across multiple lines and holding them by group can be effective when patrons have the flexibility to choose buses from across all lines in a group. Findings come by formulating select models of bus-corridor dynamics and using these to simulate part of the Bus Rapid Transit corridor in Guangzhou, China.</description>

      <title>Path-dependency of capital return in periodic growth processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic growth processes are investigated. The expected value of the profit rate, on accrual basis, does not directly depend on divestments, neither on the capitalization path. The expected value of capitalization is path dependent. Because of the path-dependent capitalization, the return rate on capital is path-dependent, and the time-average return rate on capital differs from the expected-value return rate on capital for the growth cycle. In the absence of intermediate divestments, the internal rate of return is path-independent, thereby differing from the expected value of the rate of return on capital. It is shown that the rotation cycle length maximizing the return rate on equity is independent of market interest rate. Leveraging effect enters the microeconomics of the growth processes through a separate leveraging equation, where the leverage coefficient may reach positive or negative values. Correspondingly, from the viewpoint of wealth accumulation, the often-suggested dependency of suitable rotation length on discount rate appears to be a modeling artifact. In other words, the net present value computation is based on maximization of consumption utility, instead of a capital growth objective; borrowing is obligatory, but the leverage effect is absent.</description>
