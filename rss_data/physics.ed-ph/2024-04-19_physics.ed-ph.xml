      <title>Dialogues between Astrobiology and Earth Pedagogy: a proposal to the continued training of science teachers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction and Objective. Assuming the need to rethink Education and its function as an element of social transformation and generator of a profound ethical change and promoter of other ways of being on planet Earth, this study seeks to understand the possible dialogues between Earth Pedagogy and Astrobiology in the construction and proposition of continuing education processes for science teachers. Methodology. A mini-course was promoted aimed at teachers and an attempt was made to report the construction process of the training process and, using Content Analysis, to analyze the contributions pointed out by the participants to their training and teaching practice. Results and Conclusion. The dialogue between knowledge in the continuing education of teachers contributes with fundamental elements to teaching practice, covering cognitive, emotional, individual and collective aspects, as well as highlighting the role of the university in promoting initiatives that bring Education and Complexity together.</description>

      <title>Reflections on the denialism of the Earth's curvature based on the general public participation in the collective reproduction of Eratosthenes' experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the replication of scientific experiments, with the participation of the general public, as one of the possible strategies to confront science deniers. Using the social media of the Federal University of Lavras (UFLA), the project entitled : The Magic of Physics and the Universe, invited the public to reproduce the experiment carried out by the Greek Eratosthenes over 2,100 years ago, which he proved that the Earth is spherical. We present a report of this experience to suggest that it is possible for citizens to experience scientific knowledge and observe the phenomena in a simple way, in order to develop a critical interpretation of false information that circulates in society. This proposal distinctively geeks to deconstruct the denial of the Earth's curvature through direct and collective participation of citizens in Eratosthenes' experiment, which permit more reflection on how the scientific method used to study this subject works.</description>
