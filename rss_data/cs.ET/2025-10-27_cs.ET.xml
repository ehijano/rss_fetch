      <title>The Qey: Implementation and performance study of post quantum cryptography in FIDO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Authentication systems have evolved a lot since the 1960s when Fernando Corbato first proposed the password-based authentication. In 2013, the FIDO Alliance proposed using secure hardware for authentication, thus marking a milestone in the passwordless authentication era [1]. Passwordless authentication with a possession-based factor often relied on hardware-backed cryptographic methods. FIDO2 being one an amalgamation of the W3C Web Authentication and FIDO Alliance Client to Authenticator Protocol is an industry standard for secure passwordless authentication with rising adoption for the same [2]. However, the current FIDO2 standards use ECDSA with SHA-256 (ES256), RSA with SHA-256 (RS256) and similar classical cryptographic signature algorithms. This makes it insecure against attacks involving large-scale quantum computers [3]. This study aims at exploring the usability of Module Lattice based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), based on Crystals Dilithium as a post quantum cryptographic signature standard for FIDO2. The paper highlights the performance and security in comparison to keys with classical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Apollo: Automated Routing-Informed Placement for Large-Scale Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As technology advances, photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are rapidly scaling in size and complexity, with modern designs integrating thousands of components. However, the analog custom layout nature of photonics, the curvy waveguide structures, and single-layer routing resources impose stringent physical constraints, such as minimum bend radii and waveguide crossing penalties, which make manual layout the de facto standard. This manual process takes weeks to complete and is error-prone, which is fundamentally unscalable for large-scale PIC systems. Existing automation solutions have adopted force-directed placement on small benchmarks with tens of components, with limited routability and scalability. To fill this fundamental gap in the electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) toolchain, we present the first GPU-accelerated, routing-informed placement framework. It features an asymmetric bending-aware wirelength function with explicit modeling of waveguide routing congestion and crossings for routability maximization. Meanwhile, conditional projection is employed to gradually enforce a variety of user-defined layout constraints, including alignment, spacing, etc. This constrained optimization is accelerated and stabilized by a custom blockwise adaptive Nesterov-accelerated optimizer, ensuring stable and high-quality convergence. Compared to existing methods, our method can generate high-quality layouts for large-scale PICs with an average routing success rate of 94.79% across all benchmarks within minutes. By tightly coupling placement with physical-aware routing, our method establishes a new paradigm for automated PIC design, bringing intelligent, scalable layout synthesis to the forefront of next-generation EPDA. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/ScopeX-ASU/Apollo.</description>

      <title>LiDAR 2.0: Hierarchical Curvy Waveguide Detailed Routing for Large-Scale Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by innovations in photonic computing and interconnects, photonic integrated circuit (PIC) designs advance and grow in complexity. Traditional manual physical design processes have become increasingly cumbersome. Available PIC layout tools are mostly schematic-driven, which has not alleviated the burden of manual waveguide planning and layout drawing. Previous research in PIC automated routing is largely adapted from electronic design, focusing on high-level planning and overlooking photonic-specific constraints such as curvy waveguides, bending, and port alignment. As a result, they fail to scale and cannot generate DRV-free layouts, highlighting the need for dedicated electronic-photonic design automation tools to streamline PIC physical design. In this work, we present LiDAR, the first automated PIC detailed router for large-scale designs. It features a grid-based, curvy-aware A* engine with adaptive crossing insertion, congestion-aware net ordering, and insertion-loss optimization. To enable routing in more compact and complex designs, we further extend our router to hierarchical routing as LiDAR 2.0. It introduces redundant-bend elimination, crossing space preservation, and routing order refinement for improved conflict resilience. We also develop and open-source a YAML-based PIC intermediate representation and diverse benchmarks, including TeMPO, GWOR, and Bennes, which feature hierarchical structures and high crossing densities. Evaluations across various benchmarks show that LiDAR 2.0 consistently produces DRV-free layouts, achieving up to 16% lower insertion loss and 7.69x speedup over prior methods on spacious cases, and 9% lower insertion loss with 6.95x speedup over LiDAR 1.0 on compact cases. Our codes are open-sourced at https://github.com/ScopeX-ASU/LiDAR.</description>
