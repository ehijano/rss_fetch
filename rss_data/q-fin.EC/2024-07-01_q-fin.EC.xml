      <title>Communication Reliably Improves Individual But Not Group Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior research offers mixed evidence on whether and when communication improves belief accuracy for numeric estimates. Experiments on one-to-one advice suggest that communication between peers usually benefits accuracy, while group experiments indicate that communication networks produce highly variable outcomes. Notably, it is possible for a group's average estimate to become less accurate even as its individual group members -- on average -- become more accurate. However, the conditions under which communication improves group and/or individual outcomes remain poorly characterised. We analyse an empirically supported model of opinion formation to derive these conditions, formally explicating the relationship between group-level effects and individual outcomes. We reanalyze previously published experimental data, finding that empirical dynamics are consistent with theoretical expectations. We show that 3 measures completely describe asymptotic opinion dynamics: the initial crowd bias; the degree of influence centralisation; and the correlation between influence and initial biases. We find analytic expressions for the change in crowd and individual accuracy as a function of the product of these three measures, which we describe as the truth alignment. We show how truth alignment can be decomposed into calibration (influence/accuracy correlation), and herding (influence/averageness correlation), and how these measures relate to changes in accuracy. Overall, we find that individuals can and usually do improve even when groups get worse.</description>

      <title>Crosswashing in Sustainable Investing: Unveiling Strategic Practices Impacting ESG Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and defines a novel concept in sustainable investing, termed crosswashing, and explore its impact on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) ratings through quantitative analysis using a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) model. The study emphasises that this specific form of greenwashing is not currently considered in existing ESG assessments, potentially leading to an inflated perception of corporate ethical practices. Unlike traditional greenwashing, crosswashing involves companies strategically investing in sustainable activities to boost Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores while preserving nonsustainable core operations. By unveiling the nuances of crosswashing, the research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of sustainable investing, offering insights for improved evaluation and regulation of corporate environmental and ethical responsibilities.</description>

      <title>AI-powered Chatbots: Effective Communication Styles for Sustainable Development Goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of two pre-registered experimental studies examining the impact of `Motivational Interviewing' and `Directing Style' on discussions about Sustainable Development Goals. To evaluate the effectiveness of these communication styles in enhancing awareness and motivating action toward the Sustainable Development Goals, we measured the engagement levels of participants, along with their self-reported interest and learning outcomes. Our results indicate that `Motivational Interviewing' is more effective than `Directing Style' for engagement and interest, while no appreciable difference is found on learning.</description>

      <title>Co-benefits of Agricultural Diversification and Technology for Food and Nutrition Security in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: China is the leading crop producer and has successfully implemented sustainable development programs related to agriculture. Sustainable agriculture has been promoted to achieve national food security targets such as food self-sufficiency through the well-facilitated farmland construction (WFFC) approach. The WFFC is introduced in Chinas current national 10-year plan to consolidate farmlands into large and simplified production areas to maximise automation, and improve soil fertility and productivity. However, research suggests that diversified and smaller farms faciliate ecosystem services, can improve yield resilience, defuse human health threats, and increase farm profitability. Currently, WFFC has not considered ecological farmland improvements and it may miss long-term environmental benefits including ecosystem service preservation conducive to yields. Moreover, the nutritional status in China has changed in recent decades with undernutrition being dramatically reduced, but the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and chronic diseases being increased. While a strategic choice and management of crop and livestock species can improve nutrition, the environmental and production benefits of agricultural diversification are currently not well interlinked with Chinas food and nutrition security discussions. Lastly, the role of agricultural technology for socioeconomic benefits and the link with diversified agricultural production may provide vast benefits for food security. Here, we focus on the opportunities and co-benefits of agricultural diversification and technology innovations to advance food and nutrition security in China through ecosystem service and yield benefits. Our applied five-point research agenda can provide evidence-based opportunities to support China in reaching its ambitious food security targets through agricultural diversification with global ramifications.</description>

      <title>Overinference from Weak Signals and Underinference from Strong Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.09871v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When people receive new information, sometimes they revise their beliefs too much, and sometimes too little. In this paper, we show that a key driver of whether people overinfer or underinfer is the strength of the information. Based on a model in which people know which direction to update in, but not exactly how much to update, we hypothesize that people will overinfer from weak signals and underinfer from strong signals. We then test this hypothesis across four different environments: abstract experiments, a naturalistic experiment, sports betting markets, and financial markets. In each environment, our consistent and robust finding is overinference from weak signals and underinference from strong signals. Our framework and findings can help harmonize apparently contradictory results from the experimental and empirical literatures.</description>

      <title>Can Digital Aid Deliver During Humanitarian Crises?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can digital payments systems help reduce extreme hunger? Humanitarian needs are at their highest since 1945, aid budgets are falling behind, and hunger is concentrating in fragile states where repression and aid diversion present major obstacles. In such contexts, partnering with governments is often neither feasible nor desirable, making private digital platforms a potentially useful means of delivering assistance. We experimentally evaluated digital payments to extremely poor, female-headed households in Afghanistan, as part of a partnership between community, nonprofit, and private organizations. The payments led to substantial improvements in food security and mental well-being. Despite beneficiaries' limited tech literacy, 99.75\% used the payments, and stringent checks revealed no evidence of diversion. Before seeing our results, policymakers and experts are uncertain and skeptical about digital aid, consistent with the lack of prior evidence on digital payments for humanitarian response. Delivery costs are under 7 cents per dollar, which is 10 cents per dollar less than the World Food Programme's global figure for cash-based transfers. These savings can help reduce hunger without additional resources, demonstrating how hybrid partnerships utilizing digital platform technologies can help address grand challenges in difficult contexts.</description>

      <title>Bundling Demand in K-12 Broadband Procurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the effects of bundling demand for broadband internet by K-12 schools. In 2014, New Jersey switched from decentralized procurements to a new procurement system that bundled schools into four regional groups. Using an event study approach, we find that, on average, prices for participants decreased by one-third, and the broadband speed purchased increased sixfold. Bounding the change in school expenditures due to the program, we find that participants saved at least as much as their total E-rate subsidy from the federal government. Furthermore, under the assumption of log-concave demand, we show that participating schools experienced large welfare gains.</description>

      <title>From Friendship Networks to Classroom Dynamics: Leveraging Neural Networks, Instrumental Variable and Genetic Algorithms for Optimal Educational Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study uses data from the China Educational Panel Survey (CEPS) to design a classroom assignment policy that maximizes peer effects. Our approach comprises three steps: firstly, we develop a friendship formation discrete choice model and estimate it with an interpretable neural network architecture, PeerNN, generating an adjacency-probability matrix $\Omega$ that reflects friendship formation probabilities. Secondly, we incorporate $\Omega$ into a linear-in-means model to estimate peer effects. The peer effect parameter, $\beta$, has a different interpretation from the conventional linear-in-means model and opens up a strategic scope of mean-maximizing classroom assignment policy. By exploiting the conditional random classroom assignment in many Chinese middle schools, we construct a valid instrument to address the endogeneity issue induced by $\Omega$ and consistently estimate $\beta$. Lastly, utilizing the estimates of $\Omega$ and $\beta$, we employ a genetic algorithm (GA) to search for the mean-maximizing class assignment policy. Though the result is much more efficient (i.e. more positive average peer effect) than random classroom assignment (i.e. the current practice in most Chinese middle schools), GA policy is highly inequitable: a small number of students are predicted to experience severely negative peer effects. To balance students' academic performance with educational equity, we propose a fairness metric and penalize classroom assignment that generates large variances in peer effects. The modified method is called algorithmically fair genetic algorithm (AFGA). AFGA policy is less efficient but much more equitable. We allow user-defined parameters for AFGA such that the school principals can adjust the trade-off between efficiency and equity according to their preferences.</description>

      <title>Integrating solid direct air capture systems with green hydrogen production: Economic synergy of sector coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the global pursuit of sustainable energy solutions, mitigating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions stands as a pivotal challenge. With escalating atmospheric CO2 levels, the imperative of direct air capture (DAC) systems becomes evident. Simultaneously, green hydrogen (GH) emerges as a pivotal medium for renewable energy. Nevertheless, the substantial expenses associated with these technologies impede widespread adoption, primarily due to significant installation costs and underutilized operational advantages when deployed independently. Integration through sector coupling enhances system efficiency and sustainability, while shared power sources and energy storage devices offer additional economic benefits. In this study, we assess the economic viability of polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzers versus alkaline electrolyzers within the context of sector coupling. Our findings indicate that combining GH production with solid DAC systems yields significant economic advantages, with approximately a 10% improvement for PEM electrolyzers and a 20% enhancement for alkaline electrolyzers. These results highlight a substantial opportunity to improve the efficiency and economic viability of renewable energy and green hydrogen initiatives, thereby facilitating the broader adoption of cleaner technologies.</description>

      <title>The Machine Psychology of Cooperation: Can GPT models operationalise prompts for altruism, cooperation, competitiveness and selfishness in economic games?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated the capability of the GPT-3.5 large language model (LLM) to operationalize natural language descriptions of cooperative, competitive, altruistic, and self-interested behavior in two social dilemmas: the repeated Prisoners Dilemma and the one-shot Dictator Game. Using a within-subject experimental design, we used a prompt to describe the task environment using a similar protocol to that used in experimental psychology studies with human subjects. We tested our research question by manipulating the part of our prompt which was used to create a simulated persona with different cooperative and competitive stances. We then assessed the resulting simulacras' level of cooperation in each social dilemma, taking into account the effect of different partner conditions for the repeated game. Our results provide evidence that LLMs can, to some extent, translate natural language descriptions of different cooperative stances into corresponding descriptions of appropriate task behaviour, particularly in the one-shot game. There is some evidence of behaviour resembling conditional reciprocity for the cooperative simulacra in the repeated game, and for the later version of the model there is evidence of altruistic behaviour. Our study has potential implications for using LLM chatbots in task environments that involve cooperation, e.g. using chatbots as mediators and facilitators in public-goods negotiations.</description>
