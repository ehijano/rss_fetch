      <title>Optimal Policy Choices Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policymakers often make changes to policies whose benefits and costs are unknown and must be inferred from statistical estimates in empirical studies. The sample estimates are noisier for some policies than for others, which should be adjusted for when comparing policy changes in decision-making. In this paper I consider the problem of a planner who makes changes to upfront spending on a set of policies to maximize social welfare but faces statistical uncertainty about the impact of those changes. I set up an optimization problem that is tractable under statistical uncertainty and solve for the Bayes risk-minimizing decision rule. I propose an empirical Bayes approach to approximating the optimal decision rule when the planner does not know a prior. I show theoretically that the empirical Bayes decision rule can approximate the optimal decision rule well, including in cases where a sample plug-in rule does not.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Poverty Targeting with Spatial Machine Learning: An application to Indonesia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study leverages spatial machine learning (SML) to enhance the accuracy of Proxy Means Testing (PMT) for poverty targeting in Indonesia. Conventional PMT methodologies are prone to exclusion and inclusion errors due to their inability to account for spatial dependencies and regional heterogeneity. By integrating spatial contiguity matrices, SML models mitigate these limitations, facilitating a more precise identification and comparison of geographical poverty clusters. Utilizing household survey data from the Social Welfare Integrated Data Survey (DTKS) for the periods 2016 to 2020 and 2016 to 2021, this study examines spatial patterns in income distribution and delineates poverty clusters at both provincial and district levels. Empirical findings indicate that the proposed SML approach reduces exclusion errors from 28% to 20% compared to standard machine learning models, underscoring the critical role of spatial analysis in refining machine learning-based poverty targeting. These results highlight the potential of SML to inform the design of more equitable and effective social protection policies, particularly in geographically diverse contexts. Future research can explore the applicability of spatiotemporal models and assess the generalizability of SML approaches across varying socio-economic settings.</description>

      <title>Continuous difference-in-differences with double/debiased machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends difference-in-differences to settings involving continuous treatments. Specifically, the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) at any level of continuous treatment intensity is identified using a conditional parallel trends assumption. In this framework, estimating the ATTs requires first estimating infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters, especially the conditional density of the continuous treatment, which can introduce significant biases. To address this challenge, estimators for the causal parameters are proposed under the double/debiased machine learning framework. We show that these estimators are asymptotically normal and provide consistent variance estimators. To illustrate the effectiveness of our methods, we re-examine the study by Acemoglu and Finkelstein (2008), which assessed the effects of the 1983 Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS) reform. By reinterpreting their research design using a difference-in-differences approach with continuous treatment, we nonparametrically estimate the treatment effects of the 1983 PPS reform, thereby providing a more detailed understanding of its impact.</description>

      <title>Scenario Analysis with Multivariate Bayesian Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an econometric framework that adapts tools for scenario analysis, such as variants of conditional forecasts and impulse response functions, for use with dynamic nonparametric multivariate models. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with simulated data and three real-world applications: (1) scenario-based conditional forecasts aligned with Federal Reserve stress test assumptions, measuring (2) macroeconomic risk under varying financial conditions, and (3) asymmetric effects of US-based financial shocks and their international spillovers. Our results indicate the importance of nonlinearities and asymmetries in dynamic relationships between macroeconomic and financial variables.</description>

      <title>Comparing hundreds of machine learning classifiers and discrete choice models in predicting travel behavior: an empirical benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.01130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous studies have compared machine learning (ML) and discrete choice models (DCMs) in predicting travel demand. However, these studies often lack generalizability as they compare models deterministically without considering contextual variations. To address this limitation, our study develops an empirical benchmark by designing a tournament model, thus efficiently summarizing a large number of experiments, quantifying the randomness in model comparisons, and using formal statistical tests to differentiate between the model and contextual effects. This benchmark study compares two large-scale data sources: a database compiled from literature review summarizing 136 experiments from 35 studies, and our own experiment data, encompassing a total of 6,970 experiments from 105 models and 12 model families. This benchmark study yields two key findings. Firstly, many ML models, particularly the ensemble methods and deep learning, statistically outperform the DCM family (i.e., multinomial, nested, and mixed logit models). However, this study also highlights the crucial role of the contextual factors (i.e., data sources, inputs and choice categories), which can explain models' predictive performance more effectively than the differences in model types alone. Model performance varies significantly with data sources, improving with larger sample sizes and lower dimensional alternative sets. After controlling all the model and contextual factors, significant randomness still remains, implying inherent uncertainty in such model comparisons. Overall, we suggest that future researchers shift more focus from context-specific model comparisons towards examining model transferability across contexts and characterizing the inherent uncertainty in ML, thus creating more robust and generalizable next-generation travel demand models.</description>

      <title>Scalable Estimation of Multinomial Response Models with Random Consideration Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12470v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common assumption in the fitting of unordered multinomial response models for $J$ mutually exclusive categories is that the responses arise from the same set of $J$ categories across subjects. However, when responses measure a choice made by the subject, it is more appropriate to condition the distribution of multinomial responses on a subject-specific consideration set, drawn from the power set of $\{1,2,\ldots,J\}$. This leads to a mixture of multinomial response models governed by a probability distribution over the $J^{\ast} = 2^J -1$ consideration sets. We introduce a novel method for estimating such generalized multinomial response models based on the fundamental result that any mass distribution over $J^{\ast}$ consideration sets can be represented as a mixture of products of $J$ component-specific inclusion-exclusion probabilities. Moreover, under time-invariant consideration sets, the conditional posterior distribution of consideration sets is sparse. These features enable a scalable MCMC algorithm for sampling the posterior distribution of parameters, random effects, and consideration sets. Under regularity conditions, the posterior distributions of the marginal response probabilities and the model parameters satisfy consistency. The methodology is demonstrated in a longitudinal data set on weekly cereal purchases that cover $J = 101$ brands, a dimension substantially beyond the reach of existing methods.</description>
