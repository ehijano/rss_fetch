      <title>Stable Machine-Learning Parameterization of Subgrid Processes with Real Geography and Full-physics Emulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern climate projections often suffer from inadequate spatial and temporal resolution due to computational limitations, resulting in inaccurate representations of sub-resolution processes. A promising technique to address this is the Multiscale Modeling Framework (MMF), which embeds a small-domain, kilometer-resolution cloud-resolving model within each atmospheric column of a host climate model to replace traditional convection and cloud parameterizations. Machine learning (ML) offers a unique opportunity to make MMF more accessible by emulating the embedded cloud-resolving model and thereby reducing its substantial computational cost. Although many studies have demonstrated proof-of-concept success of emulating the MMF model with stable hybrid simulations, it remains a challenge to achieve operational-level success with real geography and comprehensive variable emulation, such as explicit cloud condensate coupling. In this study, we present a stable hybrid model capable of integrating for at least 5 years with near operational-level complexity, including real geography and explicit predictions of cloud condensate and wind tendencies. Our model demonstrates state-of-the-art online performance such as 5-year zonal mean biases when comparing to previous MMF emulation studies. Key factors contributing to this online performance include the use of an expressive U-Net architecture, leveraging input features that includes large-scale forcings and convective memory, and incorporating microphysics constraints. The microphysics constraints mitigate unrealistic cloud formations such as liquid clouds at freezing temperatures or excessive ice clouds in the stratosphere, which would occur in online simulations with an unconstrained ML model.</description>

      <title>Features of the intra-mass buoyancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The buoyancy force is the cause of ordered vertical movements in the atmosphere, therefore, the analysis of the causes and conditions of its formation is important not only for the formation of convective clouds, but also for understanding all atmospheric transport processes. Due to the absence of rigid boundaries inside the gas, a horizontal pressure gradient in a static state cannot exist in the allocated volume. The pressure inside the allocated volume with a different density is equal to the external pressure and the intra-mass buoyancy force, according to its definition, is formally zero. The observed force of intra-mass buoyancy arises due to the difference in vertical pressure gradients in media with different densities. In this case, the buoyancy force is volumetric, and its value corresponds to generally accepted ratios.</description>

      <title>Medium-scale thermospheric gravity waves in the high-resolution Whole Atmosphere Model: Seasonal, local time, and longitudinal variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of the global medium-scale (scales&lt;620 km) gravity wave (GW) activity (in terms of zonal wind variance) and its seasonal, local time and longitudinal variations by employing the enhanced-resolution (~50 km) Whole Atmosphere Model (WAMT254) and space-based observations for geomagnetically quiet conditions. It is found that the GW hotspots produced by WAMT254 in the troposphere and stratosphere agree well with previously well-studied orographic and non-orographic sources. In the ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) region, GWs spread out forming latitudinal band-like hotspots. During solstices, a primary maximum in GW activity is observed in WAMT254 and GOCE over winter mid-high latitudes, likely associated with higher-order waves with primary sources in polar night jet, fronts and polar vortex. During all the seasons, the enhancement of GWs around the geomagnetic poles as observed by GOCE (at ~250 km) is well captured by simulations. WAMT254 GWs in the IT region also show dependence on local time due to their interaction with migrating tides leading to diurnal and semidiurnal variations. The GWs are more likely to propagate up from the MLT region during westward/weakly-eastward phase of thermospheric tides, signifying the dominance of eastward GW momentum flux in the MLT. Additionally, as a novel finding, a wavenumber-4 signature in GW activity is predicted by WAMT254 between 6-12 LT in the tropics at ~250 km, which propagates eastward with local time. This behavior is likely associated with the modulation of GWs by wave-4 signal of non-migrating tides in the lower thermospheric zonal winds.</description>

      <title>Boiling stratified flow: a laboratory analogy for atmospheric moist convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel laboratory experiment, boiling stratified flow, as an analogy for atmospheric moist convection. A layer of diluted syrup is placed below freshwater in a beaker and heated from below. The vertical temperature profile in the experiment is analogous to the vapor mixing ratio in the atmosphere while the vertical profile of freshwater concentration in the experiment is analogous to the potential temperature profile in the atmosphere. Boiling starts when the bottom of the syrup layer reaches the boiling point, producing bubbles and vortex rings that stir the two-layer density interface and bring colder fresh water into the syrup layer. When the syrup layer at the beginning of the experiment is sufficiently thin and diluted, the vortex rings entrain more cold water than needed to remove superheating in the syrup layer, ending the boiling. When the syrup layer is deep and concentrated, the boiling is steady since the entrained colder water instantaneously removes the superheating in the bottom syrup layer. A theory is derived to predict the entrainment rate and the transition between the intermittent and steady boiling regimes, validated by experimental data. We suggest that these dynamics may share similarities with the mixing and lifecycle of cumulus convection.</description>

      <title>Optical turbulence vertical distribution at the Peak Terskol Observatory and Mt. Kurapdag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterization of atmospheric turbulence is essential to understanding image quality of astronomical telescopes and applying adaptive optics systems. In this study, the vertical distributions of optical turbulence at the Peak Terskol Observatory (43.27472N 42.50083E, 3127 m a.s.l.) using the Era-5 re-analysis, scintillation measurements and sonic anemometer data are investigated. For the reanalysis grid node closest to the observatory, vertical profiles of the structural constant of the air refractive index turbulent fluctuations $C^2_n$ were obtained. The calculated $C^2_n(z)$ vertical profiles are compared with the vertical distribution of turbulence intensity obtained from tomographic measurements with Shack-Hartmann sensor. The Fried parameter r0 at the location of Terskol Peak Observatory was estimated. Using combination of atmospheric models and scheme paramaterization of turbulence, $C^2_n(z)$ profiles at Mt. Kurapdag were obtained. The r0 values at the Peak Terskol Observatory are compared with estimated values of this length at the ten astronomical sites including Ali, Lenghu and Daocheng.</description>

      <title>MieAI: A neural network for calculating optical properties of internally mixed aerosol in atmospheric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aerosols influence weather and climate by interacting with radiation through absorption and scattering. These effects heavily rely on the optical properties of aerosols, which are mainly governed by attributes such as morphology, size distribution, and chemical composition. These attributes undergo continuous changes due to chemical reactions and aerosol micro-physics, resulting in significant spatio-temporal variations. Most atmospheric models struggle to incorporate this variability because they use pre-calculated tables to handle aerosol optics. This offline approach often leads to substantial errors in estimating the radiative impacts of aerosols alongwith posing significant computational burdens. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel and computationally efficient machine learning ap proach called MieAI. It allows for online calculation of the optical properties of internally mixed aerosols with a log-normal size distribution. Importantly, MieAI fully incorporates the variability in aerosol chemistry and microphysics. Our evaluation of MieAI against traditional Mie calculations, using number concentrations from ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic model with Aerosol and Reactive Trace gases (ICON-ART) simulations, demonstrates that MieAI exhibits excellent predictive accuracy for aerosol optical properties. MieAI achieves this with errors well within 10%, and it operates more than 1000 times faster than the benchmark approach of Mie calculations. Due to its generalized nature, the MieAI approach can be implemented in any chemistry transport model which represents aerosol size distribution in the form of log-normally distributed internally mixed modes. This advancement has the potential to replace frequently employed lookup tables and play a substantial role in the ongoing attempts to reduce uncertainties in estimating aerosol radiative forcing.</description>

      <title>A continuous data assimilation closure for modeling statistically steady turbulence in large-eddy simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12858v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A closure model is presented for large-eddy simulation (LES) based on the three-dimensional variational data assimilation algorithm. The approach aims at reconstructing high-fidelity kinetic energy spectra in coarse numerical simulations by including feedback control to represent unresolved dynamics interactions in the flow as stochastic processes. The forcing uses statistics obtained from offline high-fidelity data and requires only few parameters compared to the number of degrees of freedom of LES. This modeling strategy is applied to geostrophic turbulence on the sphere and enables simulating indefinitely at reduced costs. It proves to accurately recover the energy spectra and the zonal velocity profiles in the coarse model, for three generic situations.</description>
