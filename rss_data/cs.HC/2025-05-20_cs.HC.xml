      <title>Sight, Sound and Smell in Immersive Experiences of Urban History: Virtual Vauxhall Gardens Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the integration of multisensory elements in virtual reality reconstructions of historical spaces through a case study of the Virtual Vauxhall Gardens project. While visual and auditory components have become standard in digital heritage experiences, the addition of olfactory stimuli remains underexplored, despite its powerful connection to memory and emotional engagement. This research investigates how multisensory experiences involving olfaction can be effectively integrated into VR reconstructions of historical spaces to enhance presence and engagement with cultural heritage. In the context of a VR reconstruction of London's eighteenth-century Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, we developed a networked portable olfactory display capable of synchronizing specific scents with visual and auditory elements at pivotal moments in the virtual experience. Our evaluation methodology assesses both technical implementation and user experience, measuring presence, and usability metrics across diverse participant groups. Our results show that integrating synchronized olfactory stimuli into the VR experience can enhance user engagement and be perceived positively, contributing to a unique and immersive encounter with historical settings. While presence questionnaires indicated a strong sense of auditory presence and control, with other sensory factors rated moderately, user experience of attractiveness was exceptionally high; qualitative feedback suggested heightened sensory awareness and engagement influenced by the inclusion and anticipation of smell. Our results suggest that evaluating multisensory VR heritage experiences requires a nuanced approach, as standard usability metrics may be ill-suited and 'realism' might be less critical than creating an evocative, historically informed, and emotionally resonant experience......</description>

      <title>Conceptual Modeling: Topics, Themes, and Technology Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conceptual modeling is an important part of information systems development and use that involves identifying and representing relevant aspects of reality. Although the past decades have experienced continuous digitalization of services and products that impact business and society, conceptual modeling efforts are still required to support new technologies as they emerge. This paper surveys research on conceptual modeling over the past five decades and shows how its topics and trends continue to evolve to accommodate emerging technologies, while remaining grounded in basic constructs. We survey over 5,300 papers that address conceptual modeling topics from the 1970s to the present, which are collected from 35 multidisciplinary journals and conferences, and use them as the basis from which to analyze the progression of conceptual modeling. The important role that conceptual modeling should play in our evolving digital world is discussed, and future research directions proposed.</description>

      <title>Gaze-Enhanced Multimodal Turn-Taking Prediction in Triadic Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turn-taking prediction is crucial for seamless interactions. This study introduces a novel, lightweight framework for accurate turn-taking prediction in triadic conversations without relying on computationally intensive methods. Unlike prior approaches that either disregard gaze or treat it as a passive signal, our model integrates gaze with speaker localization, structuring it within a spatial constraint to transform it into a reliable predictive cue. Leveraging egocentric behavioral cues, our experiments demonstrate that incorporating gaze data from a single-user significantly improves prediction performance, while gaze data from multiple-users further enhances it by capturing richer conversational dynamics. This study presents a lightweight and privacy-conscious approach to support adaptive, directional sound control, enhancing speech intelligibility in noisy environments, particularly for hearing assistance in smart glasses.</description>

      <title>Human Authenticity and Flourishing in an AI-Driven World: Edmund's Journey and the Call for Mindfulness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans have always dreamed of possessing superpowers, and the rapid development of AI-based features promises to bring these dreams (closer) to reality. However, these advancements come with significant risks. This paper advocates for challenging existing methods and approaches in design and evaluation for more responsible AI. We stimulate reflection through a futuristic user journey illustrating the AI-driven life of Edmund in 2035. Subsequently, we discuss four AI-based superpowers: extended perception, cognitive offloading, externalized memory, and enhanced presence. We then discuss implications for HCI and AI, emphasizing the need for preserving intrinsic human superpowers, identifying meaningful use cases for AI, and evaluating AI's impact on human abilities. This paper advocates for responsible and reflective AI integration and proposes a pathway towards the idea of a Human Flourishing Benchmark.</description>

      <title>Reading.help: Supporting EFL Readers with Proactive and On-Demand Explanation of English Grammar and Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large portion of texts in the world is written in English, but readers who see English as a Foreign Language (EFL) often struggle to read texts written in English accurately and swiftly. In many countries, EFL readers seek help from professional teachers and mentors, which is limited and costly. In this paper, we explore how an intelligent reading tool can assist EFL readers. To support our research agenda, we conducted a case study with EFL readers in South Korea. We at first developed an LLM-based reading tool based on prior literature. We then revised the tool based on the feedback from a study with 15 South Korean EFL readers. The final tool, named Reading.help, helps EFL readers comprehend complex sentences and paragraphs with on-demand and proactive explanations. We finally evaluated the tool with 5 EFL readers and 2 EFL education professionals. Our findings suggest Reading.help could potentially help EFL readers self-learn english when they do not have access to any external support.</description>

      <title>Recreating Neural Activity During Speech Production with Language and Speech Model Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how neural activity encodes speech and language production is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. This study investigates whether embeddings from large-scale, self-supervised language and speech models can effectively reconstruct neural activity recordings captured during speech production. We leverage pre-trained embeddings from deep learning models trained on linguistic and acoustic data to represent high-level speech features and map them onto neural signals. We analyze the extent to which these embeddings preserve the spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity. We evaluate reconstructed neural signals against ground truth recordings using correlation metrics and signal reconstruction quality assessments. The results indicate that neural activity can be effectively reconstructed using embeddings from large language and speech models across all study participants, yielding Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.99.</description>

      <title>The Virtual Reality Koinos Method: Analyzing Virtual Reality Collaboration from the perspective of communication models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding which factors could influence co-presence in Virtual Reality could help develop more qualitative social interactions, or social interactions that generate similar sensations, emotions and feelings than the ones generated during Face-to-Face interactions. Co-presence is studied since the beginning of Virtual Reality (VR); though, no consensus is identified on what factors could influence it, except the consensus on the definition of "being there together" inside the Virtual Environment. In this paper, we introduce the Koinos method to explain social interactions in VR through communication models, (i) theoretically, and (ii) on two VR experiments that change the virtual partner social and physical representations. These analyses lead us to propose an equation to predict and help manage the sense of co-presence in VR.</description>

      <title>Human and Machine as Seen at the Co-Creation Age: A Co-Word Analysis in Human Machine Co-creation (2014-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the evolving landscape of human-machine co-creation, focusing on its development in the context of the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) from 2014 to 2024. We employ co-word analysis to identify emerging trends, central themes, and the intellectual trajectory of this field. The study highlights the shift from viewing machines as mere tools to recognizing them as collaborative partners in creative processes. By understanding these dynamics, we aim to provide insights into the implications of this paradigm shift for creativity, innovation, and societal impact, ultimately fostering a more inclusive and effective approach to human-machine interaction in various domains.</description>

      <title>What Does Success Look Like? Catalyzing Meeting Intentionality with AI-Assisted Prospective Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite decades of HCI and Meeting Science research, complaints about ineffective meetings are still pervasive. We argue that meeting technologies lack support for prospective reflection, that is, thinking about why a meeting is needed and what might happen. To explore this, we designed a Meeting Purpose Assistant (MPA) technology probe to coach users to articulate their meeting's purpose and challenges, and act accordingly. The MPA used Generative AI to support personalized and actionable prospective reflection across the diversity of meeting contexts. Using a participatory prompting methodology, 18 employees of a global technology company reflected with the MPA on upcoming meetings. Observed impacts were: clarifying meeting purposes, challenges, and success conditions; changing perspectives and flexibility; improving preparation and communication; and proposing changed plans. We also identify perceived social, temporal, and technological barriers to using the MPA. We present system and workflow design considerations for developing AI-assisted reflection support for meetings.</description>

      <title>When Bias Backfires: The Modulatory Role of Counterfactual Explanations on the Adoption of Algorithmic Bias in XAI-Supported Human Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into everyday tasks improves efficiency and objectivity, it also risks transmitting bias to human decision-making. In this study, we conducted a controlled experiment that simulated hiring decisions to examine how biased AI recommendations - augmented with or without counterfactual explanations - influence human judgment over time. Participants, acting as hiring managers, completed 60 decision trials divided into a baseline phase without AI, followed by a phase with biased (X)AI recommendations (favoring either male or female candidates), and a final post-interaction phase without AI. Our results indicate that the participants followed the AI recommendations 70% of the time when the qualifications of the given candidates were comparable. Yet, only a fraction of participants detected the gender bias (8 out of 294). Crucially, exposure to biased AI altered participants' inherent preferences: in the post-interaction phase, participants' independent decisions aligned with the bias when no counterfactual explanations were provided before, but reversed the bias when explanations were given. Reported trust did not differ significantly across conditions. Confidence varied throughout the study phases after exposure to male-biased AI, indicating nuanced effects of AI bias on decision certainty. Our findings point to the importance of calibrating XAI to avoid unintended behavioral shifts in order to safeguard equitable decision-making and prevent the adoption of algorithmic bias.</description>

      <title>Two Empirical Studies on Audiovisual Semiotics of Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exists limited theoretical guidance on integrating visualization and sonification. In this paper, we address this gap by investigating audiovisual semiotics for uncertainty representation: joining uncertainty visualization and sonification to combine audiovisual channels for enhancing users' perception of uncertainty. We conducted two preregistered crowd-sourced user studies. First, we assessed suitable audio/visual pairs. Then, we investigated audiovisual mappings of uncertainty. Here, we use probability as it is an easily communicated aspect of uncertainty. We analyzed the participants' preferences and reaction times in both user studies. Additionally, we explored the strategies employed by participants through qualitative analysis. Our results reveal audiovisual mappings that lead to particularly strong preferences and low reaction times. Furthermore, we found that preferred audio/visual pairs are not necessarily suitable audiovisual mappings of uncertainty. For example, while pitch paired with brightness was preferred as a pair, it was not well suited as a mapping for uncertainty. We recommend audiovisual mappings of uncertainty that lead to low reaction times and high preferences in both user studies. This paper presents guidelines to anyone seeking to employ audiovisual representations for uncertainty, contributing to enhancing the perception of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>How Managers Perceive AI-Assisted Conversational Training for Workplace Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective workplace communication is essential for managerial success, yet many managers lack access to tailored and sustained training. Although AI-assisted communication systems may offer scalable training solutions, little is known about how managers envision the role of AI in helping them improve their communication skills. To investigate this, we designed a conversational role-play system, CommCoach, as a functional probe to understand how managers anticipate using AI to practice their communication skills. Through semi-structured interviews, participants emphasized the value of adaptive, low-risk simulations for practicing difficult workplace conversations. They also highlighted opportunities, including human-AI teaming, transparent and context-aware feedback, and greater control over AI-generated personas. AI-assisted communication training should balance personalization, structured learning objectives, and adaptability to different user styles and contexts. However, achieving this requires carefully navigating tensions between adaptive and consistent AI feedback, realism and potential bias, and the open-ended nature of AI conversations versus structured workplace discourse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In parallel to the ever-growing usage of mechanized proofs in diverse areas of mathematics and computer science, proof assistants are used more and more for education. This paper surveys previous work related to the use of proof assistants for (mostly undergraduate) teaching. This includes works where the authors report on their experiments using proof assistants to teach logic, mathematics or computer science, as well as designs or adaptations of proof assistants for teaching. We provide an overview of both tutoring systems that have been designed for teaching proof and proving, or general-purpose proof assistants that have been adapted for education, adding user interfaces and/or dedicated input or output languages.</description>

      <title>Aligning Trustworthy AI with Democracy: A Dual Taxonomy of Opportunities and Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses both significant risks and valuable opportunities for democratic governance. This paper introduces a dual taxonomy to evaluate AI's complex relationship with democracy: the AI Risks to Democracy (AIRD) taxonomy, which identifies how AI can undermine core democratic principles such as autonomy, fairness, and trust; and the AI's Positive Contributions to Democracy (AIPD) taxonomy, which highlights AI's potential to enhance transparency, participation, efficiency, and evidence-based policymaking.
  Grounded in the European Union's approach to ethical AI governance, and particularly the seven Trustworthy AI requirements proposed by the European Commission's High-Level Expert Group on AI, each identified risk is aligned with mitigation strategies based on EU regulatory and normative frameworks. Our analysis underscores the transversal importance of transparency and societal well-being across all risk categories and offers a structured lens for aligning AI systems with democratic values.
  By integrating democratic theory with practical governance tools, this paper offers a normative and actionable framework to guide research, regulation, and institutional design to support trustworthy, democratic AI. It provides scholars with a conceptual foundation to evaluate the democratic implications of AI, equips policymakers with structured criteria for ethical oversight, and helps technologists align system design with democratic principles. In doing so, it bridges the gap between ethical aspirations and operational realities, laying the groundwork for more inclusive, accountable, and resilient democratic systems in the algorithmic age.</description>

      <title>Model Cards for AI Teammates: Comparing Human-AI Team Familiarization Methods for High-Stakes Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare three methods of familiarizing a human with an artificial intelligence (AI) teammate ("agent") prior to operation in a collaborative, fast-paced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) environment. In a between-subjects user study (n=60), participants either read documentation about the agent, trained alongside the agent prior to the mission, or were given no familiarization. Results showed that the most valuable information about the agent included details of its decision-making algorithms and its relative strengths and weaknesses compared to the human. This information allowed the familiarization groups to form sophisticated team strategies more quickly than the control group. Documentation-based familiarization led to the fastest adoption of these strategies, but also biased participants towards risk-averse behavior that prevented high scores. Participants familiarized through direct interaction were able to infer much of the same information through observation, and were more willing to take risks and experiment with different control modes, but reported weaker understanding of the agent's internal processes. Significant differences were seen between individual participants' risk tolerance and methods of AI interaction, which should be considered when designing human-AI control interfaces. Based on our findings, we recommend a human-AI team familiarization method that combines AI documentation, structured in-situ training, and exploratory interaction.</description>

      <title>Sketch Interface for Teleoperation of Mobile Manipulator to Enable Intuitive and Intended Operation: A Proof of Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in robotics have underscored the need for effective collaboration between humans and robots. Traditional interfaces often struggle to balance robot autonomy with human oversight, limiting their practical application in complex tasks like mobile manipulation. This study aims to develop an intuitive interface that enables a mobile manipulator to autonomously interpret user-provided sketches, enhancing user experience while minimizing burden. We implemented a web-based application utilizing machine learning algorithms to process sketches, making the interface accessible on mobile devices for use anytime, anywhere, by anyone. In the first validation, we examined natural sketches drawn by users for 27 selected manipulation and navigation tasks, gaining insights into trends related to sketch instructions. The second validation involved comparative experiments with five grasping tasks, showing that the sketch interface reduces workload and enhances intuitiveness compared to conventional axis control interfaces. These findings suggest that the proposed sketch interface improves the efficiency of mobile manipulators and opens new avenues for integrating intuitive human-robot collaboration in various applications.</description>

      <title>Gender Trouble in Language Models: An Empirical Audit Guided by Gender Performativity Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models encode and subsequently perpetuate harmful gendered stereotypes. Research has succeeded in mitigating some of these harms, e.g. by dissociating non-gendered terms such as occupations from gendered terms such as 'woman' and 'man'. This approach, however, remains superficial given that associations are only one form of prejudice through which gendered harms arise. Critical scholarship on gender, such as gender performativity theory, emphasizes how harms often arise from the construction of gender itself, such as conflating gender with biological sex. In language models, these issues could lead to the erasure of transgender and gender diverse identities and cause harms in downstream applications, from misgendering users to misdiagnosing patients based on wrong assumptions about their anatomy.
  For FAccT research on gendered harms to go beyond superficial linguistic associations, we advocate for a broader definition of 'gender bias' in language models. We operationalize insights on the construction of gender through language from gender studies literature and then empirically test how 16 language models of different architectures, training datasets, and model sizes encode gender. We find that language models tend to encode gender as a binary category tied to biological sex, and that gendered terms that do not neatly fall into one of these binary categories are erased and pathologized. Finally, we show that larger models, which achieve better results on performance benchmarks, learn stronger associations between gender and sex, further reinforcing a narrow understanding of gender. Our findings lead us to call for a re-evaluation of how gendered harms in language models are defined and addressed.</description>

      <title>MAS-KCL: Knowledge component graph structure learning with large language model-based agentic workflow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge components (KCs) are the fundamental units of knowledge in the field of education. A KC graph illustrates the relationships and dependencies between KCs. An accurate KC graph can assist educators in identifying the root causes of learners' poor performance on specific KCs, thereby enabling targeted instructional interventions. To achieve this, we have developed a KC graph structure learning algorithm, named MAS-KCL, which employs a multi-agent system driven by large language models for adaptive modification and optimization of the KC graph. Additionally, a bidirectional feedback mechanism is integrated into the algorithm, where AI agents leverage this mechanism to assess the value of edges within the KC graph and adjust the distribution of generation probabilities for different edges, thereby accelerating the efficiency of structure learning. We applied the proposed algorithm to 5 synthetic datasets and 4 real-world educational datasets, and experimental results validate its effectiveness in learning path recognition. By accurately identifying learners' learning paths, teachers are able to design more comprehensive learning plans, enabling learners to achieve their educational goals more effectively, thus promoting the sustainable development of education.</description>

      <title>Upgrading Democracies with Fairer Voting Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voting methods are instrumental design element of democracies. Citizens use them to express and aggregate their preferences to reach a collective decision. However, voting outcomes can be as sensitive to voting rules as they are to people's voting choices. Despite the significance and inter-disciplinary scientific progress on voting methods, several democracies keep relying on outdated voting methods that do not fit modern, pluralistic societies well, while lacking social innovation. Here, we demonstrate how one can upgrade real-world democracies, namely by using alternative preferential voting methods such as cumulative voting and the method of equal shares designed for a proportional representation of voters' preferences. By rigorously assessing a new participatory budgeting approach applied in the city of Aarau, Switzerland, we unravel the striking voting outcomes of fair voting methods: more winning projects with the same budget and broader geographic and preference representation of citizens by the elected projects, in particular for voters who used to be under-represented, while promoting novel project ideas. We provide profound causal evidence showing that citizens prefer proportional voting methods, which possess strong legitimacy without the need of very technical specialized explanations. We also reveal strong underlying democratic values exhibited by citizens who support fair voting methods such as altruism and compromise. These findings come with a global momentum to unleash a new and long-awaited participation blueprint of how to upgrade democracies.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Hiring and Diversity: Reducing Human-Algorithm Similarity for Better Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic tools are increasingly used in hiring to improve fairness and diversity, often by enforcing constraints such as gender-balanced candidate shortlists. However, we show theoretically and empirically that enforcing equal representation at the shortlist stage does not necessarily translate into more diverse final hires, even when there is no gender bias in the hiring stage. We identify a crucial factor influencing this outcome: the correlation between the algorithm's screening criteria and the human hiring manager's evaluation criteria -- higher correlation leads to lower diversity in final hires. Using a large-scale empirical analysis of nearly 800,000 job applications across multiple technology firms, we find that enforcing equal shortlists yields limited improvements in hire diversity when the algorithmic screening closely mirrors the hiring manager's preferences. We propose a complementary algorithmic approach designed explicitly to diversify shortlists by selecting candidates likely to be overlooked by managers, yet still competitive according to their evaluation criteria. Empirical simulations show that this approach significantly enhances gender diversity in final hires without substantially compromising hire quality. These findings highlight the importance of algorithmic design choices in achieving organizational diversity goals and provide actionable guidance for practitioners implementing fairness-oriented hiring algorithms.</description>

      <title>Spiking Neural Networks with Temporal Attention-Guided Adaptive Fusion for imbalanced Multi-modal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal spiking neural networks (SNNs) hold significant potential for energy-efficient sensory processing but face critical challenges in modality imbalance and temporal misalignment. Current approaches suffer from uncoordinated convergence speeds across modalities and static fusion mechanisms that ignore time-varying cross-modal interactions. We propose the temporal attention-guided adaptive fusion framework for multimodal SNNs with two synergistic innovations: 1) The Temporal Attention-guided Adaptive Fusion (TAAF) module that dynamically assigns importance scores to fused spiking features at each timestep, enabling hierarchical integration of temporally heterogeneous spike-based features; 2) The temporal adaptive balanced fusion loss that modulates learning rates per modality based on the above attention scores, preventing dominant modalities from monopolizing optimization. The proposed framework implements adaptive fusion, especially in the temporal dimension, and alleviates the modality imbalance during multimodal learning, mimicking cortical multisensory integration principles. Evaluations on CREMA-D, AVE, and EAD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance (77.55\%, 70.65\% and 97.5\%accuracy, respectively) with energy efficiency. The system resolves temporal misalignment through learnable time-warping operations and faster modality convergence coordination than baseline SNNs. This work establishes a new paradigm for temporally coherent multimodal learning in neuromorphic systems, bridging the gap between biological sensory processing and efficient machine intelligence.</description>

      <title>Will AI Tell Lies to Save Sick Children? Litmus-Testing AI Values Prioritization with AIRiskDilemmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting AI risks becomes more challenging as stronger models emerge and find novel methods such as Alignment Faking to circumvent these detection attempts. Inspired by how risky behaviors in humans (i.e., illegal activities that may hurt others) are sometimes guided by strongly-held values, we believe that identifying values within AI models can be an early warning system for AI's risky behaviors. We create LitmusValues, an evaluation pipeline to reveal AI models' priorities on a range of AI value classes. Then, we collect AIRiskDilemmas, a diverse collection of dilemmas that pit values against one another in scenarios relevant to AI safety risks such as Power Seeking. By measuring an AI model's value prioritization using its aggregate choices, we obtain a self-consistent set of predicted value priorities that uncover potential risks. We show that values in LitmusValues (including seemingly innocuous ones like Care) can predict for both seen risky behaviors in AIRiskDilemmas and unseen risky behaviors in HarmBench.</description>

      <title>AKRMap: Adaptive Kernel Regression for Trustworthy Visualization of Cross-Modal Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-modal embeddings form the foundation for multi-modal models. However, visualization methods for interpreting cross-modal embeddings have been primarily confined to traditional dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques like PCA and t-SNE. These DR methods primarily focus on feature distributions within a single modality, whilst failing to incorporate metrics (e.g., CLIPScore) across multiple modalities.This paper introduces AKRMap, a new DR technique designed to visualize cross-modal embeddings metric with enhanced accuracy by learning kernel regression of the metric landscape in the projection space. Specifically, AKRMap constructs a supervised projection network guided by a post-projection kernel regression loss, and employs adaptive generalized kernels that can be jointly optimized with the projection. This approach enables AKRMap to efficiently generate visualizations that capture complex metric distributions, while also supporting interactive features such as zoom and overlay for deeper exploration. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that AKRMap outperforms existing DR methods in generating more accurate and trustworthy visualizations. We further showcase the effectiveness of AKRMap in visualizing and comparing cross-modal embeddings for text-to-image models. Code and demo are available at https://github.com/yilinye/AKRMap.</description>

      <title>ContextAgent: Context-Aware Proactive LLM Agents with Open-World Sensory Perceptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled intelligent agents from reactive responses to proactive support. While promising, existing proactive agents either rely exclusively on observations from enclosed environments (e.g., desktop UIs) with direct LLM inference or employ rule-based proactive notifications, leading to suboptimal user intent understanding and limited functionality for proactive service. In this paper, we introduce ContextAgent, the first context-aware proactive agent that incorporates extensive sensory contexts to enhance the proactive capabilities of LLM agents. ContextAgent first extracts multi-dimensional contexts from massive sensory perceptions on wearables (e.g., video and audio) to understand user intentions. ContextAgent then leverages the sensory contexts and the persona contexts from historical data to predict the necessity for proactive services. When proactive assistance is needed, ContextAgent further automatically calls the necessary tools to assist users unobtrusively. To evaluate this new task, we curate ContextAgentBench, the first benchmark for evaluating context-aware proactive LLM agents, covering 1,000 samples across nine daily scenarios and twenty tools. Experiments on ContextAgentBench show that ContextAgent outperforms baselines by achieving up to 8.5% and 6.0% higher accuracy in proactive predictions and tool calling, respectively. We hope our research can inspire the development of more advanced, human-centric, proactive AI assistants.</description>

      <title>NExT-Search: Rebuilding User Feedback Ecosystem for Generative AI Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI search is reshaping information retrieval by offering end-to-end answers to complex queries, reducing users' reliance on manually browsing and summarizing multiple web pages. However, while this paradigm enhances convenience, it disrupts the feedback-driven improvement loop that has historically powered the evolution of traditional Web search. Web search can continuously improve their ranking models by collecting large-scale, fine-grained user feedback (e.g., clicks, dwell time) at the document level. In contrast, generative AI search operates through a much longer search pipeline, spanning query decomposition, document retrieval, and answer generation, yet typically receives only coarse-grained feedback on the final answer. This introduces a feedback loop disconnect, where user feedback for the final output cannot be effectively mapped back to specific system components, making it difficult to improve each intermediate stage and sustain the feedback loop. In this paper, we envision NExT-Search, a next-generation paradigm designed to reintroduce fine-grained, process-level feedback into generative AI search. NExT-Search integrates two complementary modes: User Debug Mode, which allows engaged users to intervene at key stages; and Shadow User Mode, where a personalized user agent simulates user preferences and provides AI-assisted feedback for less interactive users. Furthermore, we envision how these feedback signals can be leveraged through online adaptation, which refines current search outputs in real-time, and offline update, which aggregates interaction logs to periodically fine-tune query decomposition, retrieval, and generation models. By restoring human control over key stages of the generative AI search pipeline, we believe NExT-Search offers a promising direction for building feedback-rich AI search systems that can evolve continuously alongside human feedback.</description>

Abstract: Empathy indicates an individual's ability to understand others. Over the past few years, empathy has drawn attention from various disciplines, including but not limited to Affective Computing, Cognitive Science, and Psychology. Detecting empathy has potential applications in society, healthcare and education. Despite being a broad and overlapping topic, the avenue of empathy detection leveraging Machine Learning remains underexplored from a systematic literature review perspective. We collected 849 papers from 10 well-known academic databases, systematically screened them and analysed the final 82 papers. Our analyses reveal several prominent task formulations - including empathy on localised utterances or overall expressions, unidirectional or parallel empathy, and emotional contagion - in monadic, dyadic and group interactions. Empathy detection methods are summarised based on four input modalities - text, audiovisual, audio and physiological signals - thereby presenting modality-specific network architecture design protocols. We discuss challenges, research gaps and potential applications in the Affective Computing-based empathy domain, which can facilitate new avenues of exploration. We further enlist the public availability of datasets and codes. This paper, therefore, provides a structured overview of recent advancements and remaining challenges towards developing a robust empathy detection system that could meaningfully contribute to enhancing human well-being.</description>

Abstract: High-frequency gaze data contains more user-specific information than low-frequency data, promising for various applications. However, existing gaze modelling methods focus on low-frequency data, ignoring user-specific subtle eye movements in high-frequency eye movements. We present DiffEyeSyn -- the first computational method to synthesise eye movements specific to individual users. The key idea is to consider the user-specific information as a special type of noise in eye movement data. This perspective reshapes eye movement synthesis into the task of injecting this user-specific noise into any given eye movement sequence. We formulate this injection task as a conditional diffusion process in which the synthesis is conditioned on user-specific embeddings extracted from the gaze data using pre-trained models for user authentication. We propose user identity guidance -- a novel loss function that allows our model to preserve user identity while generating human-like eye movements in the spatial domain. Experiments on two public datasets show that our synthetic eye movements preserve user-specific characteristics and are more realistic than baseline approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DiffEyeSyn can synthesise large-scale gaze data and support various downstream tasks, such as gaze-based user identification. As such, our work lays the methodological foundations for personalised eye movement synthesis that has significant application potential, such as for character animation, eye movement biometrics, and gaze data imputation.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Internet's Hidden Values: An Empirical Study of Desirable Behavior Using Highly-Upvoted Content on Reddit</title>

Abstract: A major task for moderators of online spaces is norm-setting, essentially creating shared norms for user behavior in their communities. Platform design principles emphasize the importance of highlighting norm-adhering examples and explicitly stating community norms. However, norms and values vary between communities and go beyond content-level attributes, making it challenging for platforms and researchers to provide automated ways to identify desirable behavior to be highlighted. Current automated approaches to detect desirability are limited to measures of prosocial behavior, but we do not know whether these measures fully capture the spectrum of what communities value. In this paper, we use upvotes, which express community approval, as a proxy for desirability and examine 16,000 highly-upvoted comments across 80 popular sub-communities on Reddit. Using a large language model, we extract values from these comments across two years (2016 and 2022) and compile 64 and 72 $\textit{macro}$, $\textit{meso}$, and $\textit{micro}$ values for 2016 and 2022 respectively, based on their frequency across communities. Furthermore, we find that existing computational models for measuring prosociality were inadequate to capture on average $82\%$ of the values we extracted. Finally, we show that our approach can not only extract most of the qualitatively-identified values from prior taxonomies, but also uncover new values that are actually encouraged in practice. Our findings highlight the need for nuanced models of desirability that go beyond preexisting prosocial measures. This work has implications for improving moderator understanding of their community values and provides a framework that can supplement qualitative approaches with larger-scale content analyses.</description>

      <title>Seismocardiography for Emotion Recognition: A Study on EmoWear with Insights from DEAP</title>

Abstract: Emotions have a profound impact on our daily lives, influencing our thoughts, behaviors, and interactions, but also our physiological reactions. Recent advances in wearable technology have facilitated studying emotions through cardio-respiratory signals. Accelerometers offer a non-invasive, convenient, and cost-effective method for capturing heart- and pulmonary-induced vibrations on the chest wall, specifically Seismocardiography (SCG) and Accelerometry-Derived Respiration (ADR). Their affordability, wide availability, and ability to provide rich contextual data make accelerometers ideal for everyday use. While accelerometers have been used as part of broader modality fusions for Emotion Recognition (ER), their stand-alone potential via SCG and ADR remains unexplored. Bridging this gap could significantly help the embedding of ER into real-world applications, minimizing the hardware, and increasing contextual integration potentials. To address this gap, we introduce SCG and ADR as novel modalities for ER and evaluate their performance using the EmoWear dataset. First, we replicate the single-trial emotion classification pipeline from the DEAP dataset study, achieving similar results. Then we use our validated pipeline to train models that predict affective valence-arousal states using SCG and compare them against established cardiac signals, Electrocardiography (ECG) and Blood Volume Pulse (BVP). Results show that SCG is a viable modality for ER, achieving similar performance to ECG and BVP. By combining ADR with SCG, we achieved a working ER framework that only requires a single chest-worn accelerometer. These findings pave the way for integrating ER into real-world, enabling seamless affective computing in everyday life.</description>

      <title>Building Symbiotic AI: Reviewing the AI Act for a Human-Centred, Principle-Based Framework</title>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) spreads quickly as new technologies and services take over modern society. The need to regulate AI design, development, and use is strictly necessary to avoid unethical and potentially dangerous consequences to humans. The European Union (EU) has released a new legal framework, the AI Act, to regulate AI by undertaking a risk-based approach to safeguard humans during interaction. At the same time, researchers offer a new perspective on AI systems, commonly known as Human-Centred AI (HCAI), highlighting the need for a human-centred approach to their design. In this context, Symbiotic AI (a subtype of HCAI) promises to enhance human capabilities through a deeper and continuous collaboration between human intelligence and AI. This article presents the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that aims to identify principles that characterise the design and development of Symbiotic AI systems while considering humans as the core of the process. Through content analysis, four principles emerged from the review that must be applied to create Human-Centred AI systems that can establish a symbiotic relationship with humans. In addition, current trends and challenges were defined to indicate open questions that may guide future research for the development of SAI systems that comply with the AI Act.</description>

      <title>The GenUI Study: Exploring the Design of Generative UI Tools to Support UX Practitioners and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI can now generate high-fidelity UI mock-up screens from a high-level textual description, promising to support UX practitioners' work. However, it remains unclear how UX practitioners would adopt such Generative UI (GenUI) models in a way that is integral and beneficial to their work. To answer this question, we conducted a formative study with 37 UX-related professionals that consisted of four roles: UX designers, UX researchers, software engineers, and product managers. Using a state-of-the-art GenUI tool, each participant went through a week-long, individual mini-project exercise with role-specific tasks, keeping a daily journal of their usage and experiences with GenUI, followed by a semi-structured interview. We report findings on participants' workflow using the GenUI tool, how GenUI can support all and each specific roles, and existing gaps between GenUI and users' needs and expectations, which lead to design implications to inform future work on GenUI development.</description>

      <title>Scalable Evaluation of Online Facilitation Strategies via Synthetic Simulation of Discussions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Limited large-scale evaluations exist for facilitation strategies of online discussions due to significant costs associated with human involvement. An effective solution is synthetic discussion simulations using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create initial pilot experiments. We propose a simple, generalizable, LLM-driven methodology to prototype the development of LLM facilitators, and produce high-quality synthetic data without human involvement. We use our methodology to test whether current facilitation strategies can improve the performance of LLM facilitators. We find that, while LLM facilitators significantly improve synthetic discussions, there is no evidence that the application of more elaborate facilitation strategies proposed in modern Social Science research lead to further improvements in discussion quality, compared to more basic approaches. Additionally, we find that small LLMs (such as Mistral Nemo 12B) can perform comparably to larger models (such as LLaMa 70B), and that special instructions must be used for instruction-tuned models to induce toxicity in synthetic discussions. We confirm that each component of our methodology contributes substantially to high quality data via an ablation study. We release an open-source framework, "SynDisco" (pip install syndisco), which implements our methodology. We also release the "Virtual Moderation Dataset" (https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/vmd), a large, publicly available dataset containing LLM-generated and LLM-annotated discussions using multiple open-source LLMs.</description>

      <title>Examining Technology Perspectives of Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Scoping Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may affect up to 20% of people over 65. Global incidence of MCI is increasing, and technology is being explored for early intervention. Theories of technology adoption predict useful and easy-to-use solutions will have higher rates of adoption; however, these models do not specifically consider older people with cognitive impairments, or unique human-computer interaction challenges posed by MCI. Older people with MCI opinions about technology solutions were extracted from 83 articles, published between Jan 2014 and May 2024, and found in nine databases. Inductive, thematic analysis of feedback Identified five themes (i) purpose and need, (ii) solution design and ease of use, (iii) self-impression, (iv) lifestyle, and (v) interaction modality. Solutions are perceived as useful, even though gaps in functional support exist, however, they are not perceived as entirely easy to use, due to issues related to ease of use and user experience. Devices which are light, portable, common and have large screens, are preferred, as is multimodal interaction, in particular speech, visual/text and touch. This review recommends future work to (i) improve personalisation, (ii) better understand interaction preferences and effectiveness, (iii) enable options for multimodal interaction, and (iv) more seamlessly integrate solutions into user lifestyles.</description>

      <title>ViMo: A Generative Visual GUI World Model for App Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: App agents, which autonomously operate mobile Apps through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), have gained significant interest in real-world applications. Yet, they often struggle with long-horizon planning, failing to find the optimal actions for complex tasks with longer steps. To address this, world models are used to predict the next GUI observation based on user actions, enabling more effective agent planning. However, existing world models primarily focus on generating only textual descriptions, lacking essential visual details. To fill this gap, we propose ViMo, the first visual world model designed to generate future App observations as images. For the challenge of generating text in image patches, where even minor pixel errors can distort readability, we decompose GUI generation into graphic and text content generation. We propose a novel data representation, the Symbolic Text Representation~(STR) to overlay text content with symbolic placeholders while preserving graphics. With this design, ViMo employs a STR Predictor to predict future GUIs' graphics and a GUI-text Predictor for generating the corresponding text. Moreover, we deploy ViMo to enhance agent-focused tasks by predicting the outcome of different action options. Experiments show ViMo's ability to generate visually plausible and functionally effective GUIs that enable App agents to make more informed decisions.</description>

      <title>On the Utility of Accounting for Human Beliefs about AI Intention in Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To enable effective human-AI collaboration, merely optimizing AI performance without considering human factors is insufficient. Recent research has shown that designing AI agents that take human behavior into account leads to improved performance in human-AI collaboration. However, a limitation of most existing approaches is their assumption that human behavior remains static, regardless of the AI agent's actions. In reality, humans may adjust their actions based on their beliefs about the AI's intentions, specifically, the subtasks they perceive the AI to be attempting to complete based on its behavior. In this paper, we address this limitation by enabling a collaborative AI agent to consider its human partner's beliefs about its intentions, i.e., what the human partner thinks the AI agent is trying to accomplish, and to design its action plan accordingly to facilitate more effective human-AI collaboration. Specifically, we developed a model of human beliefs that captures how humans interpret and reason about their AI partner's intentions. Using this belief model, we created an AI agent that incorporates both human behavior and human beliefs when devising its strategy for interacting with humans. Through extensive real-world human-subject experiments, we demonstrate that our belief model more accurately captures human perceptions of AI intentions. Furthermore, we show that our AI agent, designed to account for human beliefs over its intentions, significantly enhances performance in human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Revealing and Mitigating the Challenge of Detecting Character Knowledge Errors in LLM Role-Playing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) role-playing has gained widespread attention. Authentic character knowledge is crucial for constructing realistic LLM role-playing agents. However, existing works usually overlook the exploration of LLMs' ability to detect characters' known knowledge errors (KKE) and unknown knowledge errors (UKE) while playing roles, which would lead to low-quality automatic construction of character trainable corpus. In this paper, we propose RoleKE-Bench to evaluate LLMs' ability to detect errors in KKE and UKE. The results indicate that even the latest LLMs struggle to detect these two types of errors effectively, especially when it comes to familiar knowledge. We experimented with various reasoning strategies and propose an agent-based reasoning method, Self-Recollection and Self-Doubt (S$^2$RD), to explore further the potential for improving error detection capabilities. Experiments show that our method effectively improves the LLMs' ability to detect error character knowledge, but it remains an issue that requires ongoing attention.</description>

      <title>From Assistants to Adversaries: Exploring the Security Risks of Mobile LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has led to a new paradigm in mobile computing--LLM-powered mobile AI agents--capable of decomposing and automating complex tasks directly on smartphones. However, the security implications of these agents remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of mobile LLM agents, encompassing three representative categories: System-level AI Agents developed by original equipment manufacturers (e.g., YOYO Assistant), Third-party Universal Agents (e.g., Zhipu AI AutoGLM), and Emerging Agent Frameworks (e.g., Alibaba Mobile Agent). We begin by analyzing the general workflow of mobile agents and identifying security threats across three core capability dimensions: language-based reasoning, GUI-based interaction, and system-level execution. Our analysis reveals 11 distinct attack surfaces, all rooted in the unique capabilities and interaction patterns of mobile LLM agents, and spanning their entire operational lifecycle. To investigate these threats in practice, we introduce AgentScan, a semi-automated security analysis framework that systematically evaluates mobile LLM agents across all 11 attack scenarios. Applying AgentScan to nine widely deployed agents, we uncover a concerning trend: every agent is vulnerable to targeted attacks. In the most severe cases, agents exhibit vulnerabilities across eight distinct attack vectors. These attacks can cause behavioral deviations, privacy leakage, or even full execution hijacking. Based on these findings, we propose a set of defensive design principles and practical recommendations for building secure mobile LLM agents. Our disclosures have received positive feedback from two major device vendors. Overall, this work highlights the urgent need for standardized security practices in the fast-evolving landscape of LLM-driven mobile automation.</description>
