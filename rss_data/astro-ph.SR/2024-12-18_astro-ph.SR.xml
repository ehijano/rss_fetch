      <title>ChronoFlow: A Data-Driven Model for Gyrochronology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gyrochronology is a technique for constraining stellar ages using rotation periods, which change over a star's main sequence lifetime due to magnetic braking. This technique shows promise for main sequence FGKM stars, where other methods are imprecise. However, models have historically struggled to capture the observed rotational dispersion in stellar populations. To properly understand this complexity, we have assembled the largest standardized data catalog of rotators in open clusters to date, consisting of ~7,400 stars across 30 open clusters/associations spanning ages of 1.5 Myr to 4 Gyr. We have also developed ChronoFlow: a flexible data-driven model which accurately captures observed rotational dispersion. We show that ChronoFlow can be used to accurately forward model rotational evolution, and to infer both cluster and individual stellar ages. We recover cluster ages with a statistical uncertainty of 0.06 dex ($\approx$ 15%), and individual stellar ages with a statistical uncertainty of 0.7 dex. Additionally, we conducted robust systematic tests to analyze the impact of extinction models, cluster membership, and calibration ages on our model's performance. These contribute an additional $\approx$ 0.06 dex of uncertainty in cluster age estimates, resulting in a total error budget of 0.08 dex. We estimate ages for the NGC 6709 open cluster and the Theia 456 stellar stream, and calculate revised rotational ages for M34, NGC 2516, NGC 1750, and NGC 1647. Our results show that ChronoFlow can precisely estimate the ages of coeval stellar populations, and constrain ages for individual stars. Furthermore, its predictions may be used to inform physical spin down models. ChronoFlow will be publicly available at https://github.com/philvanlane/chronoflow.</description>

      <title>CARMENES input catalogue of M dwarfs IX. Multiplicity from close spectroscopic binaries to ultra-wide systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplicity studies greatly benefit from focusing on M dwarfs because they are often paired in a variety of configurations with both stellar and substellar objects, including exoplanets. We aim to address the observed multiplicity of M dwarfs by conducting a systematic analysis using the latest available astrophotometric data. For every star in a sample of 2214 M dwarfs from the CARMENES catalogue, we investigated the existence of resolved and unresolved physical companions in the literature and in all-sky surveys, especially in Gaia DR3 data products. We covered a very wide range of separations, from known spectroscopic binaries in tight arrangements $\sim$0.01 au to remarkably separated ultra-wide pairs ($\sim$10$^5$ au). We identified 835 M dwarfs in 720 multiple systems, predominantly binaries. Thus, we propose 327 new binary candidates based on Gaia data. If these candidates are finally confirmed, we expect the multiplicity fraction of M dwarfs to be 40.3$^{+2.1}_{-2.0}$ %. When only considering the systems already identified, the multiplicity fraction is reduced to 27.8$^{+1.9}_{-1.8}$ %. This result is in line with most of the values published in the literature. We also identified M-dwarf multiple systems with FGK, white dwarf, ultra-cool dwarf, and exoplanet companions, as well as those in young stellar kinematic groups. We studied their physical separations, orbital periods, binding energies, and mass ratios. We argue that based on reliable astrometric data and spectroscopic investigations from the literature (even when considering detection biases), the multiplicity fraction of M dwarfs could still be significantly underestimated. This calls for further high-resolution follow-up studies to validate these findings.</description>

      <title>Sun-like stars produce superflares roughly once per century</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar superflares are energetic outbursts of electromagnetic radiation, similar to solar flares but releasing more energy, up to $10^{36}$ erg on main sequence stars. It is unknown whether the Sun can generate superflares, and if so, how often they might occur. We used photometry from the Kepler space observatory to investigate superflares on other stars with Sun-like fundamental parameters. We identified 2889 superflares on 2527 Sun-like stars, out of 56450 observed. This detection rate indicates that superflares with energies $&gt;10^{34}$ erg occur roughly once per century on stars with Sun-like temperature and variability. The resulting stellar superflare frequency-energy distribution is consistent with an extrapolation of the Sun's flare distribution to higher energies, so we suggest that both are generated by the same physical mechanism.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Nature of the B[e] Star CI Cam in the Optical Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of 24 years of photometric and spectroscopic monitoring of CI Cam since its outburst in 1998. In the early years of our research, we identified a system component responsible for the emission of the He II 4686 line, which moves in an elliptical orbit with a period of 19.407 days and an eccentricity from 0.44 to 0.49. Variations in optical brightness with the same period were observed, with an average amplitude of 0.04 magnitudes. The total amplitude of the He II radial velocity variations was approximately 380 kilometers per second. The equivalent width of the line varied on timescales of tens of minutes as well as with the orbital period, reaching maximum values when the companion passed the descending node of the orbit. The intensity of the He II 4686 emission has gradually increased over time. Our photometric monitoring revealed pulsations of the main B component of the CI Cam system. Between 2005 and 2009, the B star exhibited multiperiodic pulsations, however, since 2012, it pulsated in a single mode. We interpret the pulsations from 2005 to 2009 as a resonance of radial modes, with the residual stable mode being the first overtone. The pulsations are coherent over several months, with average amplitudes from 0.02 to 0.04 magnitudes in the V band. The pulsation data constrain the spectral type of the primary component of B0 to B2 III, the distance to the system from 2.5 to 4.5 kpc. The classification of the main component of CI Cam as a supergiant is ruled out due to the observed pulsation periods. CI Cam is likely in the stage after the first mass exchange and may belong to the FS CMa-type objects.</description>

      <title>A second candidate magnetic helium core white dwarf and 3 other variable white dwarfs in the globular cluster NGC 6397</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using archival Hubble Space Telescope observations, we report the discovery of four variable low-mass white dwarfs ($0.18 \, M_\odot \leq M \leq 0.5 \,M_\odot$) in the globular cluster NGC 6397. One source exhibits a periodic optical modulation of $5.21 \pm 0.02$ hours, which we interpret as potentially due to the rotation of a magnetic helium core WD (He WD). This makes this candidate the second magnetic He WD in NGC 6397, and one of the few He WDs with a measured rotation period. The other three candidates show aperiodic variability, with a change in magnitude ranging from $\sim 0.11-0.6$. These discoveries highlight the importance of high-cadence photometric surveys in dense stellar environments. Follow-up spectroscopic observations are needed to confirm the nature of the variability of these systems.</description>

      <title>Wolf-Rayet Colliding Wind Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wolf-Rayet stars embody the final stable phase of the most massive stars immediately before their evolution is terminated in a supernova explosion. They are responsible for some of the most extreme and energetic phenomena in stellar physics, driving fast and dense stellar winds that are powered by extraordinarily high mass-loss rates arising from their near Eddington limit luminosity. When found in binary systems comprised of two hot wind-driving components, a colliding wind binary (CWB) is formed, manifesting dramatic observational signatures from the radio to X-rays. Among the wealth of rare and exotic phenomenology associated with CWBs, perhaps the most unexpected is the production of copious amounts of warm dust. A necessary condition seems to be one binary component being a carbon-rich WR star -- providing favorable chemistry for dust nucleation from the wind -- however a detailed understanding of the physics underlying this phenomenon has not been established.</description>

      <title>Laboratory modeling of MHD accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review article summarizes two decades of laboratory research aimed at understanding the dynamics of accretion disks, with particular emphasis on magnetohydrodynamic experiments involving liquid metals and plasmas. First, the Taylor-Couette experiments demonstrated the generation of magnetorotational instability (MRI) in liquid metals, and highlighted how this instability is critically influenced by boundary conditions and the geometry of the applied magnetic field. These experiments also highlight the nonlinear transition to turbulence in accretion disks, and their link with other MHD instabilities in centrifugally-stable flows. A complementary approach, involving laboratory experiments with volumetric fluid driving rather than rotating boundaries, enables a quantitative study of angular momentum transport by Keplerian turbulence. Collectively, these various laboratory studies offer new constraints on the theoretical models designed to explain the dynamics of accretion disks. This is particularly true with regard to the role of Keplerian turbulence in protoplanetary disks, where recent observations from the ALMA telescope have considerably revised previously expected values of the magnitude of the turbulent fluctuations. Finally, the paper discusses outstanding questions and future prospects in laboratory modeling of accretion disks.</description>

      <title>Minute-cadence observations on Galactic plane with Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST): Overview, methodology and early results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the time-domain survey telescope of the highest survey power in the northern hemisphere currently, Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) is scheduled to hourly/daily/semi-weekly scan northern sky up to ~23 mag in four optical (ugri) bands. Unlike the observation cadences in the forthcoming regular survey missions, WFST performed "staring" observations toward Galactic plane in a cadence of $\approx$1 minute for a total on-source time of about 13 hours, during the commissioning and pilot observation phases. Such an observation cadence is well applied in producing densely sampling light curves and hunting for stars exhibiting fast stellar variabilities. Here we introduce the primary methodologies in detecting variability, periodicity, and stellar flares among a half million sources from the minute-cadence observations, and present the WFST g-/r-band light curves generated from periodic variable stars and flaring stars. Benefit from high photometric precisions and deep detection limits of WFST, the observations have captured several rare variable stars, such as a variable hot white dwarf (WD) and an ellipsoidal WD binary candidate. By surveying the almost unexplored parameter spaces for variables, WFST will lead to new opportunities in discovering unique variable stars in the northern sky.</description>

      <title>Detection of Enhanced Germanium in a New Cool Extreme Helium Star A 980: Insights and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12792v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fine abundance analysis of a recently discovered hydrogen-deficient carbon (HdC) star, A 980, is presented. Based on the observed high-resolution optical spectrum, we ascertain that A 980 is a cool extreme helium (EHe) star and not an HdC. Singly-ionized germanium Ge II lines are identified in A 980's optical spectrum. These are the first-ever detections of germanium lines in an EHe's observed spectrum, and provide the first measurements of germanium abundance in an EHe star. The overabundance of germanium in A 980's atmosphere provides us with evidence for the synthesis of germanium in EHe stars. Among the known cool EHe stars, A 980 exhibits a maximum enhancement of the s-process elements based on significant number of transitions. The measured elemental abundances reveal signs of H-burning, He-burning, and specifically the nucleosyntheses of the key elements: Ge, Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba. The nucleosyntheses of these key elements are discussed in light of asymptotic giant branch evolution and the expectation from the accretion of an He white dwarf by a C-O white dwarf or by a neutron star.</description>

      <title>Confirmation of the planetary nebula nature of HaTr 5. Not the remnant of Nova Sco 1437</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of the nebula HaTr 5 with the shell remnant of the historic Nova Sco 1437 around the low-accretion rate cataclysmic variable 2MASS J17022815-4306123 has been used in the framework of the hibernation scenario to set an upper limit of &lt;580 yr to the transition time from a nova-like binary to a dwarf nova. This work aims at clarifying the nature of HaTr 5, which has also previously been proposed to be a possible planetary nebula. Intermediate- and high-dispersion long-slit spectra of HaTr\,5 have been obtained and analyzed in conjunction with archival optical and infrared images to investigate its spectral properties using photoionization models, to derive its H-alpha flux and ionized mass, and to determine its spatio-kinematic by means of 3D models to clarify its true nature. The H-alpha flux of HaTr 5 implies an ionized mass of 0.059 M_Sun at the 0.99 kpc distance of J170228, i.e., about 1000 times the typical ejecta of a nova. If HaTr\,5 were actually an unrelated planetary nebula, its H-alpha flux implies a distance of 2.25 kpc and an ionized mass of 0.47 M_Sun. The expansion velocity of HaTr 5 is found to be of 27 km/s, with a heliocentric radial velocity of -1 km/. The ionized mass of HaTr 5 and its expansion velocity (and associated kinematic age) are clearly inconsistent with those expected for a nova remnant, which all strongly support a planetary nebula nature. The association of J170228 with HaTr 5 is further called into question by their differing radial velocities and almost orthogonal motions on the plane of the sky. It is concluded that HaTr 5 is an old, evolved planetary nebula unrelated to the remnant of Nova Sco 1437 and to the cataclysmic variable J170228, the latter being by chance projected onto HaTr 5.</description>

      <title>Adding TESS to CR\'EME. Light curves and masses of 300+ eclipsing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Comprehensive Research with Echelles on the Most interesting Eclipsing binaries (CR\'EME) projects was aimed to collect high-resolutions spectra of about 380 detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs), which mostly do not have literature RV data. From this vast observational material we were able to estimate masses of components of 325 double-lined system. Since the launch of the TESS mission we have been collecting 2-min cadence photometry for the CR\'EME targets through successful GI proposals. As by Sector 85, we obtained data for $&gt;$330 of them. We are thus now in the process of comprehensively analyzing our targets. This paper presents the recent status of the CR\'EME project and its space photometry counterpart, and describes several sub-projects within CR\'EME that focus on specific classes of targets.</description>

      <title>A prediction for 25th solar cycle using visibility graph and Hathaway function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a complex network approach to analyse the time series of five solar parameters, and propose an strategy to predict the number of sunspots for the next solar maximum, and when will this maximum will occur. The approach is based on the Visibility Graph (VG) algorithm, and a slightly modified version of it, the Horizontal Visibility Graph (HVG), which map a time series into a complex network. Various network metrics exhibit either an exponential or a scale-free behavior, and we find that the evolution of the characteristic decay exponents is consistent with variations of the sunspots number along solar cycles. During solar minimum, the sunspots number and the solar index time series have characteristic decay exponents that correlate well with the next maximum sunspots number, suggesting that they may be good precursors of the intensity of the next solar maximum. Based on this observation, we find that, based on current data, the algorithm predicts a number of 179 sunspots for cycle 25. Combining this with the Hathaway function, adjusted to yield such maximum sunspots number, we find that the maximum for solar cycle 25 will occur in December 2024/January 2025.</description>

      <title>Stellar flare morphology with TESS across the main sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar flares are abundant in space photometric light curves. As they are now available in large enough numbers, the statistical study of their overall temporal morphology is timely. We use light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to study the shapes of stellar flares beyond a simple parameterization by duration and amplitude, and reveal possible connections to astrophysical parameters. We retrain and use the flatwrm2 long-short term memory neural network to find stellar flares in 2-min cadence TESS light curves from the first five years of the mission (sectors 1-69). We scale these flares to a comparable standard shape, and use principal component analysis to describe their temporal morphology in a concise way. We investigate how the flare shapes change along the main sequence, and test whether individual flares hold any information about their host stars. We also apply similar techniques to solar flares, using extreme ultraviolet irradiation time series. Our final catalog contains ~120,000 flares on ~14,000 stars. Due to the strict filtering and the final manual vetting, this sample contains virtually no false positives, although at the expense of reduced completeness. Using this flare catalog, we detect a dependence of the average flare shape on the spectral type. These changes are not apparent for individual flares, only when averaging thousands of events. We find no strong clustering in the flare shape space. We create new analytical flare templates for different types of stars, present a technique to sample realistic flares, and a method to locate flares with similar shapes. The flare catalog, along with the extracted flare shapes, and the data used to train flatwrm2 are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Evolution and final fates of low- and intermediate-mass stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars are unique bodies of the Universe where self-gravity compress matter to such high temperature and density that several nuclear fusion reactions ignite, providing enough feedback against further compression for a time that can be even larger than the age of the universe. The main property of a star is its mass because it determines its structure, evolutionary history, age, and ultimate fate. Depending on this quantity, stars are broadly classified as low-mass stars, like our Sun, intermediate mass stars as the variable star Delta Cephei, and massive stars as Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star in Orion constellation. Here we will introduce the basic notions useful to understand stellar evolution of low- and intermediate- mass stars. This mass range (0.1 M$_{\odot}$ - 10.0 M$_{\odot}$) deserves special attention, as it contains most of the stars in the universe. This chapter will focus on how these stars form, the processes that drive their evolution, and key details regarding their structure. Finally, we will discuss the death of such stars, emphasizing the unique fates associated with low- and intermediate-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Origin of $\alpha$-Poor Very Metal-Poor Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among very metal-poor (VMP) stars, $\alpha$-poor VMP ($\alpha$PVMP) stars that have sub-solar values of ${\rm [X/Fe]}$ for Mg and other $\alpha$ elements are rare and are thought to have been formed from gas polluted by Type 1a supernova (SN 1a). However, recent analyses indicate that pure core-collapse supernova (CCSN) ejecta can also be a likely source. We perform a detailed analysis of 17 $\alpha$PVMP stars by considering six different scenarios relevant to the early Galaxy. We consider a single pair-instability supernova (PISN) and a single CCSN. Additionally, we consider the combination of ejecta from a CCSN with ejecta from another CCSN, a PISN, a near-Chandrasekhar mass (near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) SN 1a, and a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) SN 1a. A clear signature can only be established for sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a with a near-smoking-gun signature in SDSSJ0018-0939 and a reasonably clear signature in ET0381. The majority ($82\%$) of $\alpha$PVMP stars can be explained by pure CCSN ejecta and do not require any SN 1a contribution. However, the combination of CCSN and sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a ejecta can also explain most ($76\%$) of $\alpha$PVMP stars. In contrast, the combination of ejecta from CCSN with near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a and PISN can fit $41\%$ and $29\%$ of the stars, respectively. The single PISN scenario is strongly ruled out for all stars. Our results indicate that $\alpha$PVMP stars are equally compatible with pure CCSN ejecta and a combination of CCSN and SN 1a ejecta, with sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a being roughly twice as frequent as near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a.</description>

      <title>Explorando el impacto de los gradientes qu\'imicos en los procesos de mezcla del interior estelar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the various steps of stellar evolution are formed convectives zones that alter the chemical stratification in stars. Usually, in astrophysics is used the Mixing Length Theory (MLT) for modeling the convective movement and, in general, it is used with the Schwarzschild instability criterion, which neglects the impact of chemical composition gradients in the development of convection. However, towards the end of central helium burning and during the thermal pulses in the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) are produced stratification processes with inversions in the chemical gradient that would produce instabilities beyond the ones predicted by the Schwarzschild criterion. These instabilities would alter the chemical profile in the white dwarfs, with respect to the one predicted by MLT, having observable consequences in the pulsational modes of such objects. In the present work we will explore an extension of MLT in which we will consider the chemical instabilities as generators of convectives and non-convectives instabilities. This theory will be applied in stellar evolution models in comparison with standard MLT and a double diffusive mixing theory, discussing the benefits and shortcomings of each one.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of AT 2016blu's recurring supernova impostor outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spectra of the supernova (SN) impostor AT 2016blu spanning over a decade. This transient exhibits quasiperiodic outbursts with a $\sim$113 d period, likely triggered by periastron encounters in an eccentric binary system where the primary star is a luminous blue variable (LBV). The overall spectrum remains fairly consistent during quiescence and eruptions, with subtle changes in line-profile shapes and other details. Some narrow emission features indicate contamination from a nearby H II region in the host galaxy, NGC 4559. Broader H$\alpha$ profiles exhibit Lorentzian shapes with full width at half-maximum intensity (FWHM) values that vary significantly, showing no correlation with photometric outbursts or the 113 d phase. At some epochs, H$\alpha$ exhibits asymmetric profiles with a stronger redshifted wing, while broad and sometimes multicomponent P Cygni absorption features occasionally appear, but are again uncorrelated with brightness or phase. These P Cygni absorptions have high velocities compared to the FWHM of the H$\alpha$ emission line, perhaps suggesting that the absorption component is not in the LBV's wind, but is instead associated with a companion. The lack of phase dependence in line-profile changes may point to interaction between a companion and a variable or inhomogeneous primary wind, in an orbit with only mild eccentricity. Recent photometric data indicate that AT 2016blu experienced its 20th outburst around May/June 2023, as predicted based on its period. This type of quasiperiodic LBV remains poorly understood, but its spectra and erratic light curve resemble some pre-SN outbursts like those of SN 2009ip.</description>

      <title>Gaia vbroad. Spectral-line Broadening, and binarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia DR3 catalogue includes line-broadening measurements (vbroad) for 3524677 stars. We concentrate here on the low-mass main-sequence sub-sample of the catalogue, with BP-RP in the range 1-1.6, which includes 81371 sources. The colour-magnitude diagram of the sample displays two distinct strips, the brighter of which is probably mostly composed of unresolved binaries with mass ratios close to unity. We show that the suspected binary sub-sample displays a larger vbroad distribution, which we attribute to the unresolved absorption lines of the two components of each binary. A similar effect is seen in the GALAH data.</description>

      <title>The Red Supergiant Progenitor of the Type II Supernova 2024abfl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linkage between core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and their progenitors is not fully understood and ongoing effort of searching and identifying the progenitors is needed. $\mathrm{SN\,2024abfl}$ is a recent Type II supernova exploded in the nearby star-bursting galaxy $\mathrm{NGC\,2146}$, which is also the host galaxy of $\mathrm{SN\,2018zd}$. From archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, we have found a red source ($\mathrm{m_{F814W} \sim 25}$) near the location (angular distance $\leq 0.2"$) of $\mathrm{SN\,2024abfl}$ before its explosion. With F814W and F606W photometry, we found that the properties of this source matched a typical red supergiant (RSG) moderately reddened by interstellar dust at the distance of the host galaxy. We conclude that the $\mathrm{SN\,2024abfl}$ had an RSG progenitor with initial mass of $\mathrm{10M_{\odot}}$--$\mathrm{16\,M_{\odot}}$.</description>

      <title>Binary properties of the globular cluster 47 Tuc (NGC 104). A dearth of short-period binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations of binary stars in globular clusters are essential to shed light on the poorly constrained period, eccentricity, and mass ratio distributions and to develop an understanding of the formation of peculiar stellar objects. 47 Tuc (NGC 104) is one of the most massive Galactic globular clusters, with a large population of blue stragglers and with many predicted but as-yet elusive stellar-mass black holes. This makes it an exciting candidate for binary searches.
  We present a multi-epoch spectroscopic survey of 47 Tuc with the VLT/MUSE integral field spectrograph to determine radial velocity variations for 21,699 stars.
  We find a total binary fraction in the cluster of $(2.4\pm1.0)\%$, consistent with previous photometric estimates, and an increased binary fraction among blue straggler stars, approximately three times higher than the cluster average. We find very few binaries with periods below three days, and none with massive dark companions. A comparison with predictions from state-of-the-art models shows that the absence of such short-period binaries and of binaries with massive companions is surprising, highlighting the need to improve our understanding of stellar and dynamical evolution in binary systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on the radiative capture process of the deuteron on alpha particle leading to the formation of $^6{\textrm{Li}}$ in the two-body formalism through the cluster effective field theory~(CEFT). It was the primitive nuclear reaction to produce ${^6 \textrm{Li}}$ in a few minutes after the Big Bang. In detail, we outline the calculation of the dominant $E1$ and $E2$ electromagnetic transition amplitudes of $d(\alpha,\gamma ){^6\textrm{Li}}$. Then, we obtain the astrophysical S-factor by fitting it to the experimental data. Finally, we compare the obtained CEFT results for the astrophysical S-factor with the other theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A statistical approach for interpreting polarized dust emission of the filamentary molecular clouds toward the estimate of 3D magnetic field structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12545v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we perform 3D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of filamentary molecular clouds. We then generate synthetic observations based on the simulation results. Using these, we investigate how the new polarization data analysis method recently introduced by Doi et al. (2021) reflects the magnetic field structure in turbulent filamentary molecular clouds. Doi et al. (2021) proposed that the $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$, the ratio of the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the polarized intensity ($PI$) to that of the total intensity ($I$) can be used to probe the three-dimensional structure of the magnetic field. We calculate the $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$ from the density and magnetic field structure obtained in the 3D-MHD simulations. We find that the mean and variance of $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$ within a filament are smaller and larger, respectively, with a larger inclination of the magnetic field to the plane-of-sky. We also find that both small-scale ($&lt;0.1~\rm{pc}$) and large-scale ($\gtrsim 0.1~\rm{pc}$) turbulence affect the polarized intensity of the dust thermal emission. We conclude that future extensive observations of $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$ may be able to quantify the inclination of the magnetic field to the plane-of-sky in the filamentary molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>A binary system in the S cluster close to the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-velocity stars and peculiar G objects orbit the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Together, the G objects and high-velocity stars constitute the S cluster. In contrast with theoretical predictions, no binary system near Sgr A* has been identified. Here, we report the detection of a spectroscopic binary system in the S cluster with the masses of the components of 2.80 $\pm$ 0.50 M$_{\odot}$ and 0.73 $\pm$ 0.14 M$_{\odot}$, assuming an edge-on configuration. Based on periodic changes in the radial velocity, we find an orbital period of 372 $\pm$ 3 days for the two components. The binary system is stable against the disruption by Sgr A* due to the semi-major axis of the secondary being 1.59 $\pm$ 0.01 AU, which is well below its tidal disruption radius of approximately 42.4 AU. The system, known as D9, shows similarities to the G objects. We estimate an age for D9 of 2.7$^{+1.9}_{-0.3}$ x 10$^6$ yr that is comparable to the timescale of the SMBH-induced von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycle period of about 10$^6$ yr, causing the system to merge in the near future. Consequently, the population of G objects may consist of pre-merger binaries and post-merger products. The detection of D9 implies that binary systems in the S cluster have the potential to reside in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole Sgr A* for approximately 10$^6$ years.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star Properties and Femtoscopic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the equation of state of hypernuclear matter and study the structure of neutron stars employing a chiral hyperon-nucleon interaction of the J\"{u}lich--Bonn group tuned to femtoscopic $\Lambda p$ data of the ALICE collaboration, and $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $\Xi$N interactions determined from Lattice QCD calculations by the HAL QCD collaboration that reproduce the femtoscopic $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $\Xi^-p$ data. We employ the ab-initio microscopic Brueckner--Hartree--Fock theory extended to the strange baryon sector. A special focus is put on the uncertainties of the hyperon interactions and how they are effectively propagated to the composition, equation of state, and mass-radius relation of neutron stars. To such end, we consider the uncertainty due to the experimental error of the femtoscopic $\Lambda p$ data used to fix the chiral hyperon-nucleon interaction and the theoretical uncertainty, estimated from the residual cut-off dependence of this interaction. We find that the final maximum mass of a neutron star with hyperons is in the range $1.3-1.4$ $M_\odot$, in agreement with previous works. The hyperon puzzle, therefore, remains still an open issue if only two-body hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions are considered.</description>

      <title>The interdependence between density PDF, CMF and IMF and their relation with Mach number in simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12809v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The initial mass function (IMF) of stars and the corresponding cloud mass function (CMF), traditionally considered universal, exhibit variations that are influenced by the local environment. Notably, these variations are apparent in the distribution's tail, indicating a possible relationship between local dynamics and mass distribution. Our study is designed to examine how the gas PDF , the IMF and the CMF depend on the local turbulence within the interstellar medium (ISM). We run hydrodynamical simulations on small star-forming sections of the ISM under varying turbulence conditions, characterized by Mach numbers of 1, 3.5, and 10, and with two distinct mean densities. This approach allowed us to observe the effects of different turbulence levels on the formation of stellar and cloud masses. The study demonstrates a clear correlation between the dynamics of the cloud and the IMF. In environments with lower levels of turbulence likely dominated by gravitational collapse, our simulations showed the formation of more massive structures with a powerlaw gas PDF, leading to a top-heavy IMF and CMF. On the other hand environment dominated by turbulence result in a lognormal PDF and a Salpeter-like CMF and IMF. This indicates that the turbulence level is a critical factor in determining the mass distribution within star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Generation of cosmic ray trajectories by a Diffusion Model trained on test particles in 3D magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>

Abstract: Models for the transport of high energy charged particles through strong magnetic turbulence play a key role in space and astrophysical studies, such as describing the propagation of solar energetic particles and high energy cosmic rays. Inspired by the recent advances in high-performance machine learning techniques, we investigate the application of generative diffusion models to synthesizing test particle trajectories obtained from a turbulent magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We consider velocity increment, spatial transport and curvature statistics, and find excellent agreement with the baseline trajectories for fixed particle energies. Additionally, we consider two synthetic turbulence models for comparison. Finally, challenges towards an application-ready transport model based on our approach are discussed.</description>

      <title>How much earlier would LSST have discovered currently known long-period comets?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among solar system objects, comets coming from the Oort Cloud are an elusive population, intrinsically rare and difficult to detect. Nonetheless, as the more pristine objects we can observe, they encapsulate critical cues on the formation of planetary systems and are the focus of many scientific investigations and science missions. The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which will start to operate from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in 2025, is expected to dramatically improve our detection ability of these comets by performing regular monitoring of the Southern sky deep down to magnitude 24.5 with excellent astrometry. However, making straightforward predictions on future LSST detection rates is challenging due to our biased knowledge of the underlying population. This is because identifications to date have been conducted by various surveys or individual observers, often without detailed information on their respective selection functions. Recent efforts to predict incoming flux of Long Period Comets still suffer of the lack of systematic, well-characterized, homogeneous cometary surveys. Here, we adopt a different point of view by asking how much earlier~on known comets on long-period or hyperbolic orbits would have been discovered by a LSST-like survey if it was already in place 10 years prior to their perihelion epoch. In this case, we are not simulating a real flux of incoming comet, as all comets in our sample reach the perihelion simultaneously, but we can analyze the impact of a LSST-like survey on individual objects. We find that LSST would have found about 40% of comets in our sample at least 5 years prior to their perihelion epoch, and at double (at least) the distance at which they were actually discovered. Based on this approach, we find that LSST has the potentiality to at least twofold the current discovery rate of long-period and hyperbolic comets.</description>

      <title>Do the planets cause the sunspot cycles?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08317v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mainstream dynamo models predict that the sunspot cycle is stochastic. The official Solar Cycle Prediction Panel forecasts only the ongoing sunspot cycle because any forecast beyond one cycle is considered impossible. We analyse the sunspot data using our Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM). This method can detect many periodic signals superimposed on an arbitrary trend. The DCM detects the extremely significant strong 10, 11, and 11.86 years signals. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) cross-check confirms that these signals are certainly real. Our deterministic DCM model predictions are more accurate and longer than the official Solar Cycle Prediction Panel forecast. The DCM models can predict the past prolonged activity minima, like the Maunder minimum, although we do not have data from these periods. Better long-term solar activity predictions can improve the models of climate change on Earth. Better short-term predictions can forewarn us of the catastrophic geomagnetic storms, like the Carrington event in the year 1859. We connect the detected signals to the orbital periods of Mercury, Venus, the Earth and Jupiter. If the planets cause the sunspot cycle, the exoplanets may cause the starspot cycles observed in other chromospherically active stars.</description>

      <title>Catastrophic cooling instability in optically thin plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solar corona is the prototypical example of a low density environment heated to high temperatures by external sources. The plasma cools radiatively, and because it is optically thin to this radiation, it becomes possible to model the density, velocity, and temperature structure of the system by modifying the MHD equations to include energy source terms that approximate the local heating and cooling rates. The solutions can be highly inhomogeneous and even multiphase because the well known linear instability associated with these source terms, thermal instability, leads to a catastrophic heating and cooling of the plasma in the nonlinear regime. Here we show that there is a separate, much simpler instance of catastrophic heating and cooling accompanying these source terms that can rival thermal instability in dynamical importance. The linear stability criterion is the isochoric one identified by Parker (1953), and we demonstrate that cooling functions derived from collisional ionization equilibrium are highly prone to violating this criterion. If catastrophic cooling instability can act locally in global simulations, then it is an alternative mechanism for forming condensations, and due to its nonequilibrium character, it may be relevant to explaining a host of phenomena associated with the production of cooler gas in hot, low density plasmas.</description>

      <title>Can slow pulsars in Milky Way globular clusters form via partial recycling?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alongside the population of several hundred radio millisecond pulsars currently known in Milky Way globular clusters, a subset of six slowly spinning pulsars (spin periods $0.3-4\,$s) are also observed. With inferred magnetic fields $\gtrsim 10^{11}\,$G and characteristic ages $\lesssim10^8\,$yr, explaining the formation of these apparently young pulsars in old stellar populations poses a major challenge. One popular explanation is that these objects are not actually young but instead have been partially spun up via accretion from a binary companion. In this scenario, accretion in a typical low-mass X-ray binary is interrupted by a dynamical encounter with a neighboring object in the cluster. Instead of complete spin up to millisecond spin periods, the accretion is halted prematurely, leaving behind a ''partially recycled'' neutron star. In this Letter, we use a combination of analytic arguments motivated by low-mass X-ray binary evolution and $N$-body simulations to show that this partial-recycling mechanism is not viable. Realistic globular clusters are not sufficiently dense to interrupt mass transfer on the short timescales required to achieve such slow spin periods. We argue that collapse of massive white dwarfs and/or neutron star collisions are more promising ways to form slow pulsars in old globular clusters.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Thorne-\.Zytkow Object Formation: The Fate of X-ray Binary LMC X-4 and Implications for Ultra-long Gamma-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a start-to-end simulation aimed at studying the long-term fate of high-mass X-ray binaries and whether a Thorne-\.Zytkow object (T\.ZO) might ultimately be assembled. We analyze results from a 3D hydrodynamical simulation that models the eventual fate of LMC X-4, a compact high-mass X-ray binary system, after the primary fills its Roche lobe and engulfs the neutron star companion. We discuss the outcome of this engulfment within the standard paradigm of T\.ZO formation. The post-merger angular momentum content of the stellar core is a key ingredient, as even a small amount of rotation can break spherical symmetry and produce a centrifugally supported accretion disk. Our findings suggest the inspiraling neutron star, upon merging with the core, can accrete efficiently via a disk at high rates ($\approx 10^{-2}M_\odot/{\rm s}$), subsequently collapsing into a black hole and triggering a bright transient with a luminosity and duration typical of an ultra-long gamma-ray burst. We propose that the canonical framework for T\.ZO formation via common envelope needs to be revised, as the significant post-merger accretion feedback will unavoidably unbind the vast majority of the surrounding envelope.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flux sensitivity to the next galactic core-collapse supernova in COSINUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09109v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While neutrinos are often treated as a background for many dark matter experiments, these particles offer a new avenue for physics: the detection of core-collapse supernovae. Supernovae are extremely energetic, violent and complex events that mark the death of massive stars. During their collapse stars emit a large number of neutrinos in a short burst. These neutrinos carry 99\% of the emitted energy which makes their detection fundamental in understanding supernovae. This paper illustrates how COSINUS (Cryogenic Observatory for SIgnatures seen in Next-generation Underground Searches), a sodium iodide (NaI) based dark matter search, will be sensitive to the next galactic core-collapse supernova. The experiment is composed of two separate detectors which will be sensitive to far and nearby supernovae. The inner core of the experiment will consist of NaI crystals operating as scintillating calorimeters, mainly sensitive to the Coherent Elastic Scattering of Neutrinos (CE$\nu$NS) against the Na and I nuclei. The low mass of the cryogenic detectors gives the experiment a sensitivity to close supernovae below 1kpc without pileup. They will see up to hundreds of CE$\nu$NS events from a supernova happening at 200pc. The crystals reside at the center of a cylindrical 230T water tank, instrumented with 30 photomultipliers. This tank acts as a passive and active shield able to detect the Cherenkov radiation induced by impinging charged particles from ambient and cosmogenic radioactivity. A supernova near the Milky Way Center (10kpc) will be easily detected inducing $\sim$60 measurable events, and the water tank will have a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity to supernovae up to 22kpc, seeing $\sim$10 events. This paper shows how, even without dedicated optimization, modern dark matter experiments will also play their part in the multi-messenger effort to detect the next galactic core-collapse supernova.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2015-BLG-1609Lb: Sub-jovian planet orbiting a low-mass stellar or brown dwarf host</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of a planetary microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-1609. The planetary anomaly was detected by two survey telescopes, OGLE and MOA. Each of these surveys collected enough data over the planetary anomaly to allow for an unambiguous planet detection. Such survey detections of planetary anomalies are needed to build a robust sample of planets that could improve studies on the microlensing planetary occurrence rate by reducing biases and statistical uncertainties. In this work, we examined different methods for modeling microlensing events using individual datasets, particularly we incorporated a Galactic model prior to better constrain poorly defined microlensing parallax. Ultimately, we fitted a comprehensive model to all available data, identifying three potential typologies, with two showing comparably high Bayesian evidence. Our analysis indicates that the host of the planet is a brown dwarf with a probability of 34%, or a low-mass stellar object (M-dwarf) with the probability of 66%.</description>
