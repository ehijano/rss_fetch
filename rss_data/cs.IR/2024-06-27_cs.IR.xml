      <title>ELCoRec: Enhance Language Understanding with Co-Propagation of Numerical and Categorical Features for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have been flourishing in the natural language processing (NLP) domain, and their potential for recommendation has been paid much attention to. Despite the intelligence shown by the recommendation-oriented finetuned models, LLMs struggle to fully understand the user behavior patterns due to their innate weakness in interpreting numerical features and the overhead for long context, where the temporal relations among user behaviors, subtle quantitative signals among different ratings, and various side features of items are not well explored. Existing works only fine-tune a sole LLM on given text data without introducing that important information to it, leaving these problems unsolved. In this paper, we propose ELCoRec to Enhance Language understanding with CoPropagation of numerical and categorical features for Recommendation. Concretely, we propose to inject the preference understanding capability into LLM via a GAT expert model where the user preference is better encoded by parallelly propagating the temporal relations, and rating signals as well as various side information of historical items. The parallel propagation mechanism could stabilize heterogeneous features and offer an informative user preference encoding, which is then injected into the language models via soft prompting at the cost of a single token embedding. To further obtain the user's recent interests, we proposed a novel Recent interaction Augmented Prompt (RAP) template. Experiment results over three datasets against strong baselines validate the effectiveness of ELCoRec.

      <title>Towards Personalized Federated Multi-scenario Multi-task Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern recommender system applications, such as e-commerce, predicting multiple targets like click-through rate (CTR) and post-view click-through \&amp; conversion rate (CTCVR) is common. Multi-task recommender systems are gaining traction in research and practical use. Existing multi-task recommender systems tackle diverse business scenarios, merging and modeling these scenarios unlocks shared knowledge to boost overall performance. As new and more complex real-world recommendation scenarios have emerged, data privacy issues make it difficult to train a single global multi-task recommendation model that processes multiple separate scenarios.
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework for personalized federated multi-scenario multi-task recommendation, called PF-MSMTrec. We assign each scenario to a dedicated client, with each client utilizing the Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE) structure. Our proposed method aims to tackle the unique challenge posed by multiple optimization conflicts in this setting. We introduce a bottom-up joint learning mechanism. Firstly, we design a parameter template to decouple the parameters of the expert network. Thus, scenario parameters are shared knowledge for federated parameter aggregation, while task-specific parameters are personalized local parameters. Secondly, we conduct personalized federated learning for the parameters of each expert network through a federated communication round, utilizing three modules: federated batch normalization, conflict coordination, and personalized aggregation. Finally, we perform another round of personalized federated parameter aggregation on the task tower network to obtain the prediction results for multiple tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Surprisingly Simple yet Effective Multi-Query Rewriting Method for Conversational Passage Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational passage retrieval is challenging as it often requires the resolution of references to previous utterances and needs to deal with the complexities of natural language, such as coreference and ellipsis. To address these challenges, pre-trained sequence-to-sequence neural query rewriters are commonly used to generate a single de-contextualized query based on conversation history. Previous research shows that combining multiple query rewrites for the same user utterance has a positive effect on retrieval performance. We propose the use of a neural query rewriter to generate multiple queries and show how to integrate those queries in the passage retrieval pipeline efficiently. The main strength of our approach lies in its simplicity: it leverages how the beam search algorithm works and can produce multiple query rewrites at no additional cost. Our contributions further include devising ways to utilize multi-query rewrites in both sparse and dense first-pass retrieval. We demonstrate that applying our approach on top of a standard passage retrieval pipeline delivers state-of-the-art performance without sacrificing efficiency.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Food Recommendation using Clustering and Self-supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Food recommendation systems serve as pivotal components in the realm of digital lifestyle services, designed to assist users in discovering recipes and food items that resonate with their unique dietary predilections. Typically, multi-modal descriptions offer an exhaustive profile for each recipe, thereby ensuring recommendations that are both personalized and accurate. Our preliminary investigation of two datasets indicates that pre-trained multi-modal dense representations might precipitate a deterioration in performance compared to ID features when encapsulating interactive relationships. This observation implies that ID features possess a relative superiority in modeling interactive collaborative signals. Consequently, contemporary cutting-edge methodologies augment ID features with multi-modal information as supplementary features, overlooking the latent semantic relations between recipes. To rectify this, we present CLUSSL, a novel food recommendation framework that employs clustering and self-supervised learning. Specifically, CLUSSL formulates a modality-specific graph tailored to each modality with discrete/continuous features, thereby transforming semantic features into structural representation. Furthermore, CLUSSL procures recipe representations pertinent to different modalities via graph convolutional operations. A self-supervised learning objective is proposed to foster independence between recipe representations derived from different unimodal graphs. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets substantiate that CLUSSL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art recommendation benchmarks in performance.</description>

      <title>Amplify Graph Learning for Recommendation via Sparsity Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph learning models have been widely deployed in collaborative filtering (CF) based recommendation systems. Due to the issue of data sparsity, the graph structure of the original input lacks potential positive preference edges, which significantly reduces the performance of recommendations. In this paper, we study how to enhance the graph structure for CF more effectively, thereby optimizing the representation of graph nodes. Previous works introduced matrix completion techniques into CF, proposing the use of either stochastic completion methods or superficial structure completion to address this issue. However, most of these approaches employ random numerical filling that lack control over noise perturbations and limit the in-depth exploration of higher-order interaction features of nodes, resulting in biased graph representations.
  In this paper, we propose an Amplify Graph Learning framework based on Sparsity Completion (called AGL-SC). First, we utilize graph neural network to mine direct interaction features between user and item nodes, which are used as the inputs of the encoder. Second, we design a factorization-based method to mine higher-order interaction features. These features serve as perturbation factors in the latent space of the hidden layer to facilitate generative enhancement. Finally, by employing the variational inference, the above multi-order features are integrated to implement the completion and enhancement of missing graph structures. We conducted benchmark and strategy experiments on four real-world datasets related to recommendation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that AGL-SC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Towards a Formal Characterization of User Simulation Objectives in Conversational Information Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User simulation is a promising approach for automatically training and evaluating conversational information access agents, enabling the generation of synthetic dialogues and facilitating reproducible experiments at scale. However, the objectives of user simulation for the different uses remain loosely defined, hindering the development of effective simulators. In this work, we formally characterize the distinct objectives for user simulators: training aims to maximize behavioral similarity to real users, while evaluation focuses on the accurate prediction of real-world conversational agent performance. Through an empirical study, we demonstrate that optimizing for one objective does not necessarily lead to improved performance on the other. This finding underscores the need for tailored design considerations depending on the intended use of the simulator. By establishing clear objectives and proposing concrete measures to evaluate user simulators against those objectives, we pave the way for the development of simulators that are specifically tailored to their intended use, ultimately leading to more effective conversational agents.</description>

      <title>Efficient course recommendations with T5-based ranking and summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we implement and evaluate a two-stage retrieval pipeline for a course recommender system that ranks courses for skill-occupation pairs. The in-production recommender system BrightFit provides course recommendations from multiple sources. Some of the course descriptions are long and noisy, while retrieval and ranking in an online system have to be highly efficient. We developed a two-step retrieval pipeline with RankT5 finetuned on MSMARCO as re-ranker. We compare two summarizers for course descriptions: a LongT5 model that we finetuned for the task, and a generative LLM (Vicuna) with in-context learning. We experiment with quantization to reduce the size of the ranking model and increase inference speed. We evaluate our rankers on two newly labelled datasets, with an A/B test, and with a user questionnaire. On the two labelled datasets, our proposed two-stage ranking with automatic summarization achieves a substantial improvement over the in-production (BM25) ranker: nDCG@10 scores improve from 0.482 to 0.684 and from 0.447 to 0.844 on the two datasets. We also achieve a 40% speed-up by using a quantized version of RankT5. The improved quality of the ranking was confirmed by the questionnaire completed by 29 respondents, but not by the A/B test. In the A/B test, a higher clickthrough rate was observed for the BM25-ranking than for the proposed two-stage retrieval. We conclude that T5-based re-ranking and summarization for online course recommendation can obtain much better effectiveness than single-step lexical retrieval, and that quantization has a large effect on RankT5. In the online evaluation, however, other factors than relevance play a role (such as speed and interpretability of the retrieval results), as well as individual preferences.</description>

      <title>Grounded and Transparent Response Generation for Conversational Information-Seeking Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While previous conversational information-seeking (CIS) research has focused on passage retrieval, reranking, and query rewriting, the challenge of synthesizing retrieved information into coherent responses remains. The proposed research delves into the intricacies of response generation in CIS systems. Open-ended information-seeking dialogues introduce multiple challenges that may lead to potential pitfalls in system responses. The study focuses on generating responses grounded in the retrieved passages and being transparent about the system's limitations. Specific research questions revolve around obtaining confidence-enriched information nuggets, automatic detection of incomplete or incorrect responses, generating responses communicating the system's limitations, and evaluating enhanced responses. By addressing these research tasks the study aspires to contribute to the advancement of conversational response generation, fostering more trustworthy interactions in CIS dialogues, and paving the way for grounded and transparent systems to meet users' needs in an information-driven world.</description>

      <title>Which Neurons Matter in IR? Applying Integrated Gradients-based Methods to Understand Cross-Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent addition of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the scope and importance of Information Retrieval (IR) has expanded. As a result, the importance of a deeper understanding of IR models also increases. However, interpretability in IR remains under-explored, especially when it comes to the models' inner mechanisms. In this paper, we explore the possibility of adapting Integrated Gradient-based methods in an IR context to identify the role of individual neurons within the model. In particular, we provide new insights into the role of what we call "relevance" neurons, as well as how they deal with unseen data. Finally, we carry out an in-depth pruning study to validate our findings.</description>

      <title>DRAK: Unlocking Molecular Insights with Domain-Specific Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter challenges with the unique syntax of specific domains, such as biomolecules. Existing fine-tuning or modality alignment techniques struggle to bridge the domain knowledge gap and understand complex molecular data, limiting LLMs' progress in specialized fields. To overcome these limitations, we propose an expandable and adaptable non-parametric knowledge injection framework named Domain-specific Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge (DRAK), aimed at enhancing reasoning capabilities in specific domains. Utilizing knowledge-aware prompts and gold label-induced reasoning, DRAK has developed profound expertise in the molecular domain and the capability to handle a broad spectrum of analysis tasks. We evaluated two distinct forms of DRAK variants, proving that DRAK exceeds previous benchmarks on six molecular tasks within the Mol-Instructions dataset. Extensive experiments have underscored DRAK's formidable performance and its potential to unlock molecular insights, offering a unified paradigm for LLMs to tackle knowledge-intensive tasks in specific domains. Our code will be available soon.</description>

      <title>Hire: Hybrid-modal Interaction with Multiple Relational Enhancements for Image-Text Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image-text matching (ITM) is a fundamental problem in computer vision. The key issue lies in jointly learning the visual and textual representation to estimate their similarity accurately. Most existing methods focus on feature enhancement within modality or feature interaction across modalities, which, however, neglects the contextual information of the object representation based on the inter-object relationships that match the corresponding sentences with rich contextual semantics. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid-modal Interaction with multiple Relational Enhancements (termed \textit{Hire}) for image-text matching, which correlates the intra- and inter-modal semantics between objects and words with implicit and explicit relationship modelling. In particular, the explicit intra-modal spatial-semantic graph-based reasoning network is designed to improve the contextual representation of visual objects with salient spatial and semantic relational connectivities, guided by the explicit relationships of the objects' spatial positions and their scene graph. We use implicit relationship modelling for potential relationship interactions before explicit modelling to improve the fault tolerance of explicit relationship detection. Then the visual and textual semantic representations are refined jointly via inter-modal interactive attention and cross-modal alignment. To correlate the context of objects with the textual context, we further refine the visual semantic representation via cross-level object-sentence and word-image-based interactive attention. Extensive experiments validate that the proposed hybrid-modal interaction with implicit and explicit modelling is more beneficial for image-text matching. And the proposed \textit{Hire} obtains new state-of-the-art results on MS-COCO and Flickr30K benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Re-Ranking Step by Step: Investigating Pre-Filtering for Re-Ranking with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been revolutionizing a myriad of natural language processing tasks with their diverse zero-shot capabilities. Indeed, existing work has shown that LLMs can be used to great effect for many tasks, such as information retrieval (IR), and passage ranking. However, current state-of-the-art results heavily lean on the capabilities of the LLM being used. Currently, proprietary, and very large LLMs such as GPT-4 are the highest performing passage re-rankers. Hence, users without the resources to leverage top of the line LLMs, or ones that are closed source, are at a disadvantage. In this paper, we investigate the use of a pre-filtering step before passage re-ranking in IR. Our experiments show that by using a small number of human generated relevance scores, coupled with LLM relevance scoring, it is effectively possible to filter out irrelevant passages before re-ranking. Our experiments also show that this pre-filtering then allows the LLM to perform significantly better at the re-ranking task. Indeed, our results show that smaller models such as Mixtral can become competitive with much larger proprietary models (e.g., ChatGPT and GPT-4).</description>

      <title>A Stem-Agnostic Single-Decoder System for Music Source Separation Beyond Four Stems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant recent progress across multiple subtasks of audio source separation, few music source separation systems support separation beyond the four-stem vocals, drums, bass, and other (VDBO) setup. Of the very few current systems that support source separation beyond this setup, most continue to rely on an inflexible decoder setup that can only support a fixed pre-defined set of stems. Increasing stem support in these inflexible systems correspondingly requires increasing computational complexity, rendering extensions of these systems computationally infeasible for long-tail instruments. In this work, we propose Banquet, a system that allows source separation of multiple stems using just one decoder. A bandsplit source separation model is extended to work in a query-based setup in tandem with a music instrument recognition PaSST model. On the MoisesDB dataset, Banquet, at only 24.9 M trainable parameters, approached the performance level of the significantly more complex 6-stem Hybrid Transformer Demucs on VDBO stems and outperformed it on guitar and piano. The query-based setup allows for the separation of narrow instrument classes such as clean acoustic guitars, and can be successfully applied to the extraction of less common stems such as reeds and organs. Implementation is available at https://github.com/kwatcharasupat/query-bandit.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval Considering Query-target Relationship Leveraging Masked Image-text Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel zero-shot composed image retrieval (CIR) method considering the query-target relationship by masked image-text pairs. The objective of CIR is to retrieve the target image using a query image and a query text. Existing methods use a textual inversion network to convert the query image into a pseudo word to compose the image and text and use a pre-trained visual-language model to realize the retrieval. However, they do not consider the query-target relationship to train the textual inversion network to acquire information for retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot CIR method that is trained end-to-end using masked image-text pairs. By exploiting the abundant image-text pairs that are convenient to obtain with a masking strategy for learning the query-target relationship, it is expected that accurate zero-shot CIR using a retrieval-focused textual inversion network can be realized. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Statements: Universal Information Extraction from Tables with Large Language Models for ESG KPIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) KPIs assess an organization's performance on issues such as climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, waste management, human rights, diversity, and policies. ESG reports convey this valuable quantitative information through tables. Unfortunately, extracting this information is difficult due to high variability in the table structure as well as content. We propose Statements, a novel domain agnostic data structure for extracting quantitative facts and related information. We propose translating tables to statements as a new supervised deep-learning universal information extraction task. We introduce SemTabNet - a dataset of over 100K annotated tables. Investigating a family of T5-based Statement Extraction Models, our best model generates statements which are 82% similar to the ground-truth (compared to baseline of 21%). We demonstrate the advantages of statements by applying our model to over 2700 tables from ESG reports. The homogeneous nature of statements permits exploratory data analysis on expansive information found in large collections of ESG reports.</description>

      <title>RAVEN: Multitask Retrieval Augmented Vision-Language Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scaling of large language models to encode all the world's knowledge in model parameters is unsustainable and has exacerbated resource barriers. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) presents a potential solution, yet its application to vision-language models (VLMs) is under explored. Existing methods focus on models designed for single tasks. Furthermore, they're limited by the need for resource intensive pre training, additional parameter requirements, unaddressed modality prioritization and lack of clear benefit over non-retrieval baselines. This paper introduces RAVEN, a multitask retrieval augmented VLM framework that enhances base VLMs through efficient, task specific fine-tuning. By integrating retrieval augmented samples without the need for additional retrieval-specific parameters, we show that the model acquires retrieval properties that are effective across multiple tasks. Our results and extensive ablations across retrieved modalities for the image captioning and VQA tasks indicate significant performance improvements compared to non retrieved baselines +1 CIDEr on MSCOCO, +4 CIDEr on NoCaps and nearly a +3\% accuracy on specific VQA question types. This underscores the efficacy of applying RAG approaches to VLMs, marking a stride toward more efficient and accessible multimodal learning.</description>

      <title>FlowVQA: Mapping Multimodal Logic in Visual Question Answering with Flowcharts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for visual question answering lack in visual grounding and complexity, particularly in evaluating spatial reasoning skills. We introduce FlowVQA, a novel benchmark aimed at assessing the capabilities of visual question-answering multimodal language models in reasoning with flowcharts as visual contexts. FlowVQA comprises 2,272 carefully generated and human-verified flowchart images from three distinct content sources, along with 22,413 diverse question-answer pairs, to test a spectrum of reasoning tasks, including information localization, decision-making, and logical progression. We conduct a thorough baseline evaluation on a suite of both open-source and proprietary multimodal language models using various strategies, followed by an analysis of directional bias. The results underscore the benchmark's potential as a vital tool for advancing the field of multimodal modeling, providing a focused and challenging environment for enhancing model performance in visual and logical reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Zero-Shot Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-shot text learning enables text classifiers to handle unseen classes efficiently, alleviating the need for task-specific training data. A simple approach often relies on comparing embeddings of query (text) to those of potential classes. However, the embeddings of a simple query sometimes lack rich contextual information, which hinders the classification performance. Traditionally, this has been addressed by improving the embedding model with expensive training. We introduce QZero, a novel training-free knowledge augmentation approach that reformulates queries by retrieving supporting categories from Wikipedia to improve zero-shot text classification performance. Our experiments across six diverse datasets demonstrate that QZero enhances performance for state-of-the-art static and contextual embedding models without the need for retraining. Notably, in News and medical topic classification tasks, QZero improves the performance of even the largest OpenAI embedding model by at least 5% and 3%, respectively. Acting as a knowledge amplifier, QZero enables small word embedding models to achieve performance levels comparable to those of larger contextual models, offering the potential for significant computational savings. Additionally, QZero offers meaningful insights that illuminate query context and verify topic relevance, aiding in understanding model predictions. Overall, QZero improves embedding-based zero-shot classifiers while maintaining their simplicity. This makes it particularly valuable for resource-constrained environments and domains with constantly evolving information.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds of Supervised Classification from Information-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There remains a list of unanswered research questions on deep learning (DL), including the remarkable generalization power of overparametrized neural networks, the efficient optimization performance despite the non-convexity, and the mechanisms behind flat minima in generalization. In this paper, we adopt an information-theoretic perspective to explore the theoretical foundations of supervised classification using deep neural networks (DNNs). Our analysis introduces the concepts of fitting error and model risk, which, together with generalization error, constitute an upper bound on the expected risk. We demonstrate that the generalization errors are bounded by the complexity, influenced by both the smoothness of distribution and the sample size. Consequently, task complexity serves as a reliable indicator of the dataset's quality, guiding the setting of regularization hyperparameters. Furthermore, the derived upper bound fitting error links the back-propagated gradient, Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), and the model's parameter count with the fitting error. Utilizing the triangle inequality, we establish an upper bound on the expected risk. This bound offers valuable insights into the effects of overparameterization, non-convex optimization, and the flat minima in DNNs.Finally, empirical verification confirms a significant positive correlation between the derived theoretical bounds and the practical expected risk, confirming the practical relevance of the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Complex Disease Treatment through Network Medicine and GenAI: A Case Study on Drug Repurposing for Breast Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The objective of this research is to introduce a network specialized in predicting drugs that can be repurposed by investigating real-world evidence sources, such as clinical trials and biomedical literature. Specifically, it aims to generate drug combination therapies for complex diseases (e.g., cancer, Alzheimer's). We present a multilayered network medicine approach, empowered by a highly configured ChatGPT prompt engineering system, which is constructed on the fly to extract drug mentions in clinical trials. Additionally, we introduce a novel algorithm that connects real-world evidence with disease-specific signaling pathways (e.g., KEGG database). This sheds light on the repurposability of drugs if they are found to bind with one or more protein constituents of a signaling pathway. To demonstrate, we instantiated the framework for breast cancer and found that, out of 46 breast cancer signaling pathways, the framework identified 38 pathways that were covered by at least two drugs. This evidence signals the potential for combining those drugs. Specifically, the most covered signaling pathway, ID hsa:2064, was covered by 108 drugs, some of which can be combined. Conversely, the signaling pathway ID hsa:1499 was covered by only two drugs, indicating a significant gap for further research. Our network medicine framework, empowered by GenAI, shows promise in identifying drug combinations with a high degree of specificity, knowing the exact signaling pathways and proteins that serve as targets. It is noteworthy that ChatGPT successfully accelerated the process of identifying drug mentions in clinical trials, though further investigations are required to determine the relationships among the drug mentions.</description>
