      <title>Compact Sobolev embeddings of radially symmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a complete characterization of compactness of Sobolev embeddings of radially symmetric functions on the entire space $\mathbb{R}^n$ in the general framework of rearrangement-invariant function spaces. We avoid any unnecessary restrictions and cover also embeddings of higher order, providing a complete picture within this framework. To achieve this, we need to develop new techniques because the usual techniques used in the study of compactness of Sobolev embeddings in the general framework of rearrangement-invariant function spaces are limited to domains of finite measure, which is essential for them to work. Furthermore, we also study certain weighted Sobolev embeddings of radially symmetric functions on balls. We completely characterize their compactness and also describe optimal target rearrangement-invariant function spaces in these weighted Sobolev embeddings.</description>

      <title>Isometric classification of the $L^{p}$-spaces of infinite dimensional Lebesgue measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the isometric structure of the $L^p$-spaces associated with an infinite-dimensional analogue of the Lebesgue measure $(\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}, \mu)$. Our primary result establishes that under the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), $L^p(\mu)$ is isometrically isomorphic to $\ell^p(\mathfrak{c}, L^p[0,1])$, where $\mathfrak{c}$ denotes the cardinality of the continuum. In the general case, without assuming CH, we prove that $L^p(\mu)$ contains an isometric and complemented copy of $\ell^p(\mathfrak{c}, L^p[0,1])$. Furthermore, we characterize isometries between $L^p$-spaces and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for an isometric isomorphism of the form $L^p(\nu) \cong \ell^p(\kappa, L^p[0,1])$ for some cardinal $\kappa$. In particular, we classify all possible isometric isomorphisms between such spaces.</description>

      <title>Contractive projections on $H^p$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates contractive projections on closed subspaces $X$ of $L^p$ with $0&lt;p&lt;\infty$. One of the main results states that, subject to certain mild conditions, every contractive projection $P$ on $X$ preserving constants coincides with a conditional expectation on $L^\infty \cap P^{-1}(L^\infty)$. It results in some interesting applications concerning contractive idempotent coefficient multipliers for analytic function spaces and translation-invariant subspaces of $L^p(G),$ where $G$ is a compact Abelian group. Focusing specifically on descriptions of boundedness and contractivity of conditional expectations on the Hardy space $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ with $0&lt;p&lt;1$, we give a complete characterization of contractive idempotent coefficient multipliers for $H^p(\mathbb{T}^d)$ with $0&lt;p&lt;1$, which complements a remarkable result due to Brevig, Ortega-Cerd\`{a}, and Seip characterizing such multipliers on $H^p(\mathbb{T}^d)$ for $1\leq p \leq \infty$.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of Reflexive Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we survey known results of characterizations of reflexive Banach spaces and properties stronger than reflexivity. Characterizations of reflexivity are mainly based on precise descriptions of weakly compact sets, affine sets in a Banach space $X$ or in $X^*$, properties of a Schauder basis of $X$ or $X^*$ and a bi-orthogonal system in $X$. Characterizations of stronger properties are based on the von Neumann-Jordan constant, finite-tree property and (finite-dimensional) representability.</description>

      <title>Two Generalizations of Property (II) and their characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of Property (II) was introduced and characterized by Chen and Lin \cite{CL}. In this work, given a compatiable collection of bounded sets $\mathcal{A}$, we provide a complete characterization of two generalizations of Property (II) : (i) every closed convex set $A\in \mathcal{A}$ is an intersection of closed convex hulls of finitely many balls and (ii) for every closed convex set $A\in \mathcal{A}$ and $\beta \geqslant 0$, $\overline{A+\beta B_X}$ is an intersection of closed convex hulls of finitely many balls.</description>

      <title>An estimate for positive definite functions on finite abelian groups and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concentrates on positive definite functions on finite abelian groups, which are central to harmonic analysis and related fields. By leveraging the group structure and employing Fourier analysis, we establish a lower bound for the second largest value of positive definite functions. For illustrative purposes, we present three applications of our lower bound: (a) We obtain both lower and upper bounds for arbitrary functions on finite abelian groups; (b) We derive lower bounds for the relaxation and mixing times of random walks on finite abelian groups. Notably, our bound for the relaxation time achieves a quadratic improvement over the previously known one; (c) We determine a new lower bound for the size of the sumset of two subsets of finite abelian groups.</description>

      <title>The Faber-Krahn inequality for partial sums of eigenvalues of Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, among all radial subsets $\Omega\subset \mathbb{C}$ of prescribed measure, the ball is the only maximizer of the sum of the first $K$ eigenvalues ($K\geq 1$) of the corresponding Toeplitz operator $T_\Omega$ on the Fock space $\mathcal{F}^2(\mathbb{C})$. As a byproduct, we prove that balls maximize any Schatten $p$-norm of $T_\Omega$ for $p&gt;1$ (and minimize the corresponding quasinorm for $p&lt;1$), and that the second eigenvalue is maximized by a particular annulus. Moreover, we extend some of these results to general radial symbols in $L^p(\mathbb{C})$, with $p &gt; 1$, characterizing those that maximize the sum of the first $K$ eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>A transform for the Grushin operator with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the setting of the Grushin differential operator $G=-\Delta_{x'}-|x'|^2\Delta_{x''}$ with domain ${\rm Dom}\,G=C^\infty_c(\mathbb{R}^d)\subset L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, we define a scalar transform which is a mixture of the partial Fourier transform and a transform based on the scaled Hermite functions. This transform unitarily intertwines $G$ with a multiplication operator by a nonnegative real-valued function on an appropriately associated `dual' space $L^2(\Gamma)$. This allows to construct a self-adjoint extension $\mathbb G$ of $G$ as a simple realization of this multiplication operator. Another self-adjoint extensions of $G$ are defined in terms of sesquilinear forms and then these extensions are compared. Aditionally, a closed formula for the heat kernel that corresponds to the heat semigroup $\{\exp(-t\mathbb G)\}_{t&gt;0}$ is established.</description>

      <title>On Toeplitz operators on $H^1(\mathbb{C}^+)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider Toeplitz operators with anti-analytic symbols on $H^1(\mathbb{C}^+)$. It is well known that there are no bounded Toeplitz operators $T_{\overline{\Theta}}\colon H^1(\mathbb{C}^+) \to H^1(\mathbb{C}^+)$, where $\Theta \in H^\infty(\mathbb{C}^+)$. We consider the subspace $H^1_{\Theta}=\left\lbrace f \in H^1(\mathbb{C}^+)\colon \int_{\mathbb{R}}f \overline{\Theta}=0\right\rbrace$ and show that it is natural to study the boundedness of $T_{\overline{\Theta}}\colon H^1_\Theta \to H^1(\mathbb{C}^+)$. We provide several different conditions equivalent to such boundedness. We prove that when $\Theta=e^{i\tau (\cdot)}$, with $\tau&gt;0$ $T_{\overline{\Theta}}\colon H^1_\Theta \to H^1(\mathbb{C}^+)$ is bounded. Finally, we discuss a number of related open questions.</description>

      <title>$L^p$- Heisenberg--Pauli--Weyl uncertainty inequalities on certain two-step nilpotent Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the $L^p$-Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl uncertainty inequality for the group Fourier transform on a broad class of two-step nilpotent Lie groups, specifically the two-step MW groups. This inequality quantitatively demonstrates that on two-step MW groups, a nonzero function and its group Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized. The proof primarily relies on utilizing the dilation structure inherent to two-step nilpotent Lie groups and estimating the Schatten class norms of the group Fourier transform. The inequality we establish is new even in the simplest case of Heisenberg groups. Our result significantly sharpens all previously known $L^p$-Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl uncertainty inequalities for $1 \leq p &lt; 2$ within the realm of two-step nilpotent Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Functional perturbation theory under axisymmetry: Simplified formulae and their uses for tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In strictly axisymmetric configurations of tokamaks, field-line tracing reduces from a three-dimensional ODE system to a two-dimensional one, where Poincar\'e-Bendixson theorem applies and guarantees the nonexistence of chaos. The formulae of functional perturbation theory (FPT) mostly simplify to compact closed-form expressions to allow the computation to finish instantly, which could improve and accelerate the existing plasma control systems by detangling the plasma dynamics from the magnetic topology change. FPT can conveniently calculate how the key geometric objects of magnetic topology:
  1. the divertor X-point(s) and the magnetic axis,
  2. the last closed flux surface (LCFS)
  3. flux surfaces
  change under perturbation. For example, when the divertor X-point shifts outwards, the LCFS there must expand accordingly, but not necessarily for other places of the LCFS, which could also contract, depending on the perturbation. FPT can not only facilitate adaptive control of plasma, but also enable utilizing as much as possible space in the vacuum vessel by weakening the plasma-wall interaction (PWI) via tuning the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{DP}^m$ of the divertor X-point(s), such that the field line connection lengths in the scrape-off layer (SOL) are long enough to achieve detachment. Increasing flux expansion $f_x$ is another option for detachment and can also be facilitated by FPT.
  Apart from the edge, FPT can also benefit the understanding of the plasma core. Since the magnetic axis O-point would also shift under perturbation and the shift is known by FPT, the O-point can be controlled without full knowledge of the plasma response, which shall not significantly change the tendency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiplicative convolution $\mu \ast \nu$ of two finite signed measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and a related product $\mu \circledast \nu$ on the sphere $S^{n-1}$ are studied. For fixed $\mu$ the injectivity in $\nu$ of both operations is characterised given an arbitrary group of reflections along the coordinate axes. The results for the sphere yield generalised versions of the theorems in Molchanov and Nagel (2021) about convex bodies.</description>

      <title>On the polar of Schneider's difference body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1970, Schneider introduced the $m$th-order extension of the difference body $DK$ of a convex body $K\subset\mathbb R^n$, the convex body $D^m(K)$ in $\mathbb R^{nm}$. He conjectured that its volume is minimized for ellipsoids when the volume of $K$ is fixed.
  In this note we solve a dual version of this problem: we show that the volume of the polar body of $D^m(K)$ is maximized precisely by ellipsoids. For $m=1$ this recovers the symmetric case of the celebrated Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality. We also show that Schneider's conjecture cannot be tackled using standard symmetrization techniques, contrary to this new inequality. As an application for our results, we prove Schneider's conjecture asymptotically \'a la Bourgain-Milman. We also consider a functional version.</description>

      <title>Fatou limits of stochastic integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of stochastic integrals is essential to stochastic analysis, especially in applications to mathematical finance, where they model the gains associated with a self-financing strategy. However, Fatou convergence of $(X^{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ $\unicode{x2014}$a notion introduced for its amenability to compactness principles$\unicode{x2014}$implies little about the sequence of It\^o integrals $\left(\int_{0}^{\cdot}YdX^{n}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ for a fixed integrand $Y$. Under a boundedness condition, we find convex combinations $(\widetilde{X}^{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ of $(X^{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ with Fatou limit $\widetilde{X}$, such that $\left(\int_{0}^{\cdot}Yd\widetilde{X}^{n}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges in a Fatou-like sense to $\int_{0}^{\cdot}Yd\widetilde{X}$ for all continuous semimartingales $Y$. The result is sharp, in the sense that continuity of $Y$ cannot be relaxed to being the left limits process of a semimartingale.</description>

      <title>On the system of $2$-D elastic waves with critical space dependent damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the system of elastic waves with critical space dependent damping $V(x)$. We study the Cauchy problem for this model in the $2$-dimensional Euclidean space ${\bf R}^{2}$, and we obtain faster decay rates of the total energy as time goes to infinity. In the $2$-D case we do not have any suitable Hardy type inequality, so generally one has no idea to establish optimal energy decay. We develope a special type of multiplier method combined with some estimates brought by the $2$-D Newton potential belonging to the usual Laplacian $-\Delta$, not the operator $-a^2\Delta - (b^{2}-a^{2})\nabla {\rm div}$ itself. The property of finite speed propagation is important to get results for this system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that a function on an open set in $\mathbb R^d$ is smooth if and only if it is arc-smooth, i.e., its composites with all smooth curves are smooth. In recent work, we extended this and related results (for instance, a real analytic version) to suitable closed sets, notably, sets with H\"older boundary and fat subanalytic sets satisfying a necessary topological condition. In this paper, we prove that the resulting set-theoretic identities of function spaces are bornological isomorphisms with respect to their natural locally convex topologies. Extending the results to maps with values in convenient vector spaces, we obtain corresponding exponential laws. Additionally, we show analogous results for special ultradifferentiable Braun-Meise-Taylor classes.</description>

      <title>A Klain-Schneider Theorem for Vector-Valued Valuations on Convex Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A functional analog of the Klain-Schneider theorem for vector-valued valuations on convex functions is established, providing a classification of continuous, translation covariant, simple valuations. Under additional rotation equivariance assumptions, an analytic counterpart of the moment vector is characterized alongside a new epi-translation invariant valuation. The former arises as the top-degree operator in a family of functional intrinsic moments, which are linked to functional intrinsic volumes through translations. The latter represents the top-degree operator in a class of Minkowski vectors, which are introduced in this article and which lack classical counterparts on convex bodies, as they vanish due to the Minkowski relations. Additional classification results are obtained for homogeneous valuations of extremal degrees.</description>

      <title>Degenerate parabolic equations in divergence form: fundamental solution and Gaussian bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider second order degenerate parabolic equations with complex, measurable, and time-dependent coefficients. The degenerate ellipticity is dictated by a spatial $A_2$-weight. We prove that having a generalized fundamental solution with upper Gaussian bounds is equivalent to Moser's $L^2$-$L^\infty$ estimates for local weak solutions. In the special case of real coefficients, Moser's $L^2$-$L^\infty$ estimates are known, which provide an easier proof of Gaussian upper bounds, and a known Harnack inequality is then used to derive Gaussian lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Eventually positive semigroups: spectral and asymptotic analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral theory of semigroup generators is a crucial tool for analysing the asymptotic properties of operator semigroups. Typically, Tauberian theorems, such as the ABLV theorem, demand extensive information about the spectrum to derive convergence results. However, the scenario is significantly simplified for positive semigroups on Banach lattices. This observation extends to the broader class of eventually positive semigroups -- a phenomenon observed in various concrete differential equations. In this paper, we investigate the spectral and asymptotic properties of eventually positive semigroups, focusing particularly on the persistently irreducible case. Our findings expand upon the existing theory of eventual positivity, offering new insights into the cyclicity of the peripheral spectrum and asymptotic trends. Notably, several arguments for positive operators and semigroups do not apply in our context, necessitating the use of ultrapower arguments to circumvent these challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic embeddings of finite metric spaces into graph-theoretic trees have proven to be a vital tool for constructing approximation algorithms in theoretical computer science. In the present work, we build out some of the basic theory of stochastic embeddings in the infinite setting with an aim towards applications to Lipschitz free space theory. We prove that proper metric spaces stochastically embedding into $\mathbb{R}$-trees have Lipschitz free spaces isomorphic to $L^1$-spaces. We then undergo a systematic study of stochastic embeddability of Gromov hyperbolic metric spaces into $\mathbb{R}$-trees by way of stochastic embeddability of their boundaries into ultrametric spaces. The following are obtained as our main results: (1) Every snowflake of a compact, finite Nagata-dimensional metric space stochastically embeds into an ultrametric space and has Lipschitz free space isomorphic to $\ell^1$. (2) The Lipschitz free space over hyperbolic $n$-space is isomorphic to the Lipschitz free space over Euclidean $n$-space. (3) Every infinite, finitely generated hyperbolic group stochastically embeds into an $\mathbb{R}$-tree, has Lipschitz free space isomorphic to $\ell^1$, and admits a proper, uniformly Lipschitz affine action on $\ell^1$.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of the present paper is to address multiple aspects of the Fuglede question dealing (Fourier spectra vs geometry) with a variety of $L^2$ contexts where we make precise the interplay between the three sides of the question: (i) existence of orthogonal families of Fourier basis functions (and associated spectra) on the one hand, (ii) extensions of partial derivative operators, and (iii) geometry of the corresponding domains, stressing systems of translation-tiles. We emphasize an account of old and new developments since the original 1974-paper by Bent Fuglede where the co-authors and Steen Pedersen have contributed.</description>

      <title>A several variables Kowalski-S\lodkowski theorem for topological spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a version of the classical result of Kowalski and S\l odkowski that generalizes the famous Gleason-Kahane-$\dot{\rm Z}$elazko (GKZ) theorem by characterizing multiplicative linear functionals amongst all complex-valued functions on a Banach algebra. We first characterize maps on $\mathcal{A}$-valued polynomials of several variables that satisfy some conditions, motivated by the result of Kowalski and S\l odkowski, as a composition of a multiplicative linear functional on $\mathcal{A}$ and a point evaluation on the polynomials, where $\mathcal{A}$ is a complex Banach algebra with identity. We then apply it to prove an analogue of Kowalski and S\l odkowski's result on topological spaces of vector-valued functions of several variables. These results extend our previous work from \cite{jaikishan2024multiplicativity}; however, the techniques used differ from those used in \cite{jaikishan2024multiplicativity}. Furthermore, we characterize weighted composition operators between Hardy spaces over the polydisc amongst the continuous functions between them. Additionally, we register a partial but noteworthy success toward a multiplicative GKZ theorem for Hardy spaces.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of the Crandall--Pazy Class of $C_0$-semigroups on Hilbert Spaces and Their Application to Decay Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate immediately differentiable $C_0$-semigroups $(e^{-tA})_{t \geq 0}$ satisfying $\sup_{0 &lt; t &lt;1} t^{1/\beta}\|Ae^{-tA}\| &lt; \infty$ for some $0 &lt; \beta \leq 1$. Such $C_0$-semigroups are referred to as the Crandall--Pazy class of $C_0$-semigroups. In the Hilbert space setting, we present two characterizations of the Crandall--Pazy class. We then apply these characterizations to estimate decay rates for Crank--Nicolson schemes with smooth initial data when the associated abstract Cauchy problem is governed by an exponentially stable $C_0$-semigroup in the Crandall--Pazy class. The first approach is based on a functional calculus called the $\mathcal{B}$-calculus. The second approach builds upon estimates derived from Lyapunov equations and improves the decay estimate obtained in the first approach, under the additional assumption that $-A^{-1}$ generates a bounded $C_0$-semigroup.</description>

      <title>Dynamical localization and eigenvalue asymptotics: long-range hopping lattice operators with electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for polynomial long-range hopping lattice operators with uniform electric field under any bounded perturbation, the semi-uniform polynomial decay of the eigenfunctions is determined by the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues, and conversely. Consequently, we recover and refine recent results on power-law dynamical localization for this model. In this paper, to prove these results, we develop new arguments to deal with singularities in obtaining the semi-uniform polynomial decay of eigenfunctions, prove an independent result on the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues for discrete operators, revisit a notion of Power-Law SULE, and utilize a known perturbation result on localization, proved through the KAM method. Unlike existing results in the literature, our approach does not rely on the specific form of the eigenfunctions, but rather the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and the potential. It is worth underlining that our general results can be applied to other models such as Maryland-type potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01319v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of double phase systems which contain the singular and mixed nonlinear terms. Unlike the single equation, the mixed nonlinear terms make the problem more complicate. The geometry of the fibering mapping has multiple possibilities. To overcome the difficulties posed by the mixed nonlinear terms, we need to repeatedly construct concave functions, discuss different cases, and use the properties of concave functions and basic inequalities such as H\"{o}lder inequality, Poincar\'{e}'s inequality and Young's inequality. By the use of the Nehari manifold, the existence and multiplicity of positive solutions which have nonnegative energy are obtained.</description>

We improve the existing upper bound for the cardinality of this set.</description>

Abstract: We establish general conditions for stochastic evolution equations with locally monotone drift and degenerate additive L\'evy noise in variational formulation resulting in the existence of a unique invariant probability measure for the associated ergodic Markovian Feller semigroup. We prove improved moment estimates for the solutions and the $e$-property of the semigroup. Examples include the stochastic incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations, shear thickening stochastic power-law fluid equations, the stochastic heat equation, as well as, stochastic semilinear equations such as the 1D stochastic Burgers equation.</description>

      <title>The multilinear fractional sparse operator theory II: refining weighted estimates via multilinear stochastic fractional sparse forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon our study of the sparse bounds of generalized commutators of multilinear fractional singular integral operators in \cite{CenSong2412}, this paper seeks to further refine the main results presented in \cite{CenSong2412} in the following key aspects. Firstly, we replace pointwise domination with ($m+1$)-linear stochastic fractional reducing sparse form ${\mathcal B}_{\alpha(\eta) ,\mathcal{S},\tau,\tau',{\vec r},t}^\mathbf{b,k}$, thus providing a new approach to the vector-valued multilinear stochastic fractional sparse domination principle. Additionally, the conditions required for this result are relaxed from multilinear weak type boundedness in \cite{CenSong2412} to multilinear locally weak type boundedness $W_{\vec{p}, q}(X)$, which allows us to extend the main ideas from Lerner \cite{Lerner2019} (2019) and Lorist et al. \cite{Lorist2024} (2024). Secondly, and more importantly, we move away from the original techniques of quantitatively estimating multilinear stochastic fractional sparse operators ${\mathcal A}_{\alpha(\eta),\mathcal{S},\tau,{\vec{r}},t}^\mathbf{b,k,t}$, and instead employ a more powerful multilinear fractional \( \vec{r} \)-type maximal operator $\mathscr{M}_{\alpha(\eta),\vec{r}}$. This necessitates the development of a new class of multilinear fractional weights $ A_{(\vec{p},q),(\vec{r}, s)}(X)$ to quantitatively characterize this maximal operator, followed by revealing the norm equivalence between this maximal operator and the sparse forms introduced earlier, thereby generalizing part of the ideas of Nieraeth \cite{Nier2019} (2019). ......</description>
