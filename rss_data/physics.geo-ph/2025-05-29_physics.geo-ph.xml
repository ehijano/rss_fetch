      <title>Depth to magnetic source estimation using TDX contour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate depth estimation of magnetic sources plays a crucial role in various geophysical applications, including mineral exploration, resource assessments, regional hydrocarbon exploration, and geological mapping. Thus, this abstract presents a fast and simple method of estimating the depth of a magnetic body using the TDX derivative of the total magnetic field. TDX is a first-order derivative of the magnetic field that, in addition to edge detection, is less affected by noise, allowing for better depth resolution. The reduced sensitivity to noise enables a clearer estimation of depth and enhances the accuracy of the depth determination process. The TDX, as a variant of the phase derivative, is independent of magnetization and can be used to identify the edge of a magnetic body. In addition to excelling at edge detection, they can also estimate the depth of the magnetic source producing the anomalies. In this study, we explore the utilization of contour of the TDX derivative for estimating depth, assuming a vertical contact source. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using a two-prism block model and a simple bishop model with a uniform susceptibility of 0.001 cgs. The results agree with the known depth, providing evidence of the reliability of the method despite the restrictive nature of the assumption, especially for the Bishop model, where there are numerous fault structures.</description>

      <title>Broadband Ground Motion Synthesis by Diffusion Model with Minimal Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shock waves caused by earthquakes can be devastating. Generating realistic earthquake-caused ground motion waveforms help reducing losses in lives and properties, yet generative models for the task tend to generate subpar waveforms. We present High-fidelity Earthquake Groundmotion Generation System (HEGGS) and demonstrate its superior performance using earthquakes from North American, East Asian, and European regions. HEGGS exploits the intrinsic characteristics of earthquake dataset and learns the waveforms using an end-to-end differentiable generator containing conditional latent diffusion model and hi-fidelity waveform construction model. We show the learning efficiency of HEGGS by training it on a single GPU machine and validate its performance using earthquake databases from North America, East Asia, and Europe, using diverse criteria from waveform generation tasks and seismology. Once trained, HEGGS can generate three dimensional E-N-Z seismic waveforms with accurate P/S phase arrivals, envelope correlation, signal-to-noise ratio, GMPE analysis, frequency content analysis, and section plot analysis.</description>

      <title>SHARAD Illuminates Deeper Martian Subsurface Structures with a Boost from Very Large Rolls of the MRO Spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Throughout its mission, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has often rolled about its along-track axis by up to 28{\deg} to partially compensate for the suboptimal location of the Shallow Radar (SHARAD) antenna along an edge of the spacecraft that is opposite the imaging payload deck, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of echoes returned from the surface. After recent modeling work predicted that a much larger roll would improve the S/N by ~10 dB relative to nadir-pointed observing, MRO began a limited series of 120{\deg} roll maneuvers to test the effects on radar sounding. Three such SHARAD very-large-roll (VLR) observations have been acquired since May 2023, and they show dramatic improvements in signal clarity and depth of penetration, with S/N increasing by 9, 11, and 14 dB over that of nearly coincident observations at 0{\deg} roll angle. In low dielectric terrains, the first and second VLR observations enabled basal detections at depths previously unachievable, reaching depths of 800 m in Medusae Fossae materials and 1500 m through the ice of Ultimi Scopuli, respectively. The second VLR observation also obtained enhanced reflections throughout the ice stack. In the higher dielectric terrain of Amazonis Planitia, the third VLR observation improved continuity of a dipping subsurface interface, but it revealed neither an extension of the interface to greater depths nor any deeper interfaces. The MRO mission intends to obtain more SHARAD VLR observations of polar terrains and of midlatitude glacial and ground ices, sediments, and volcanics.</description>
