      <title>The PEAL Method: a mathematical framework to streamline securitization structuring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Securitization is a financial process where the cash flows of income-generating assets are sold to institutional investors as securities, liquidating illiquid assets. This practice presents persistent challenges due to the absence of a comprehensive mathematical framework for structuring asset-backed securities. While existing literature provides technical analysis of credit risk modeling, there remains a need for a definitive framework detailing the allocation of the inbound cash flows to the outbound positions. To fill this gap, we introduce the PEAL Method: a 10-step mathematical framework to streamline the securitization structuring across all time periods.
  The PEAL Method offers a rigorous and versatile approach, allowing practitioners to structure various types of securitizations, including those with complex vertical positions. By employing standardized equations, it facilitates the delineation of payment priorities and enhances risk characterization for both the asset and the liability sides throughout the securitization life cycle.
  In addition to its technical contributions, the PEAL Method aims to elevate industry standards by addressing longstanding challenges in securitization. By providing detailed information to investors and enabling transparent risk profile comparisons, it promotes market transparency and enables stronger regulatory oversight.
  In summary, the PEAL Method represents a significant advancement in securitization literature, offering a standardized framework for precision and efficiency in structuring transactions. Its adoption has the potential to drive innovation and enhance risk management practices in the securitization market.</description>

      <title>Do t-Statistic Hurdles Need to be Raised?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10275v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many scholars have called for raising statistical hurdles to guard against false discoveries in academic publications. I show these calls may be difficult to justify empirically. Published data exhibit bias: results that fail to meet existing hurdles are often unobserved. These unobserved results must be extrapolated, which can lead to weak identification of revised hurdles. In contrast, statistics that can target only published findings (e.g. empirical Bayes shrinkage and the FDR) can be strongly identified, as data on published findings is plentiful. I demonstrate these results theoretically and in an empirical analysis of the cross-sectional return predictability literature.</description>

      <title>Security Issuance, Institutional Investors and Quid Pro Quo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16643v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Security issuance through intermediaries is subject to informational and agency-related frictions. However, separating their effects on securities has been difficult. We estimate those effects separately using SPAC data. To that end, we identify "premium" investors who produce value-relevant information. Their participation is associated with lower liquidation risk and higher returns. In contrast, "non-premium" investors engage only in quid pro quo arrangements. They receive high returns from an intermediary (quid) for participating in weaker future deals initiated by that intermediary (quo). Thus, quid pro quo is not pure agency cost; it includes transfers enabling more firms to go public.</description>

      <title>Economic Complexity Limits Accuracy of Price Probability Predictions by Gaussian Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the economic reasons why the predictions of price and return statistical moments in the coming decades, in the best case, will be limited by their averages and volatilities. That limits the accuracy of the forecasts of price and return probabilities by Gaussian distributions. The economic origin of these restrictions lies in the fact that the predictions of the market-based n-th statistical moments of price and return for n=1,2,.., require the description of the economic variables of the n-th order that are determined by sums of the n-th degrees of values or volumes of market trades. The lack of existing models that describe the evolution of the economic variables determined by the sums of the 2nd degrees of market trades results in the fact that even predictions of the volatilities of price and return are very uncertain. One can ignore existing economic barriers that we highlight but cannot overcome or resolve them. The accuracy of predictions of price and return probabilities substantially determines the reliability of asset pricing models and portfolio theories. The restrictions on the accuracy of predictions of price and return statistical moments reduce the reliability and veracity of modern asset pricing and portfolio theories.</description>

      <title>Growth, Poverty Trap and Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The well-known Solow growth model is the workhorse model of the theory of economic growth, which studies capital accumulation in a model economy as a function of time with capital stock, labour and technology efficiency as the basic ingredients. The capital is assumed to be in the form of manufacturing equipments and materials. Two important parameters of the model are: the saving fraction $s$ of the output of a production function and the technology efficiency parameter $A$, appearing in the production function. The saved fraction of the output is fully invested in the generation of new capital and the rest is consumed. The capital stock also depreciates as a function of time due to the wearing out of old capital and the increase in the size of the labour population. We propose a stochastic Solow growth model assuming the saving fraction to be a sigmoidal function of the per capita capital $k_p$. We derive analytically the steady state probability distribution $P(k_p)$ and demonstrate the existence of a poverty trap, of central concern in development economics. In a parameter regime, $P(k_p)$ is bimodal with the twin peaks corresponding to states of poverty and well-being respectively. The associated potential landscape has two valleys with fluctuation-driven transitions between them. The mean exit times from the valleys are computed and one finds that the escape from a poverty trap is more favourable at higher values of $A$. We identify a critical value of $A_c$ below (above) which the state of poverty (well-being) dominates and propose two early signatures of the regime shift occurring at $A_c$. The economic model, with conceptual foundation in nonlinear dynamics and statistical mechanics, shares universal features with dynamical models from diverse disciplines like ecology and cell biology.</description>

      <title>Non-Atomic Arbitrage in Decentralized Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of maximal extractable value (MEV) in the Ethereum ecosystem has led to a characterization of the latter as a dark forest. Studies of MEV have thus far largely been restricted to purely on-chain MEV, i.e., sandwich attacks, cyclic arbitrage, and liquidations. In this work, we shed light on the prevalence of non-atomic arbitrage on decentralized exchanges (DEXes) on the Ethereum blockchain. Importantly, non-atomic arbitrage exploits price differences between DEXes on the Ethereum blockchain as well as exchanges outside the Ethereum blockchain (i.e., centralized exchanges or DEXes on other blockchains). Thus, non-atomic arbitrage is a type of MEV that involves actions on and off the Ethereum blockchain.
  In our study of non-atomic arbitrage, we uncover that more than a fourth of the volume on Ethereum's biggest five DEXes from the merge until 31 October 2023 can likely be attributed to this type of MEV. We further highlight that only eleven searchers are responsible for more than 80% of the identified non-atomic arbitrage volume sitting at a staggering $132 billion and draw a connection between the centralization of the block construction market and non-atomic arbitrage. Finally, we discuss the security implications of these high-value transactions that account for more than 10% of Ethereum's total block value and outline possible mitigations.</description>
