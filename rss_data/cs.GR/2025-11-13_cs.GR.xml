      <title>A Finite Difference Approximation of Second Order Regularization of Neural-SDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a finite-difference framework for curvature regularization in neural signed distance field (SDF) learning. Existing approaches enforce curvature priors using full Hessian information obtained via second-order automatic differentiation, which is accurate but computationally expensive. Others reduced this overhead by avoiding explicit Hessian assembly, but still required higher-order differentiation. In contrast, our method replaces these operations with lightweight finite-difference stencils that approximate second derivatives using the well known Taylor expansion with a truncation error of O(h^2), and can serve as drop-in replacements for Gaussian curvature and rank-deficiency losses. Experiments demonstrate that our finite-difference variants achieve reconstruction fidelity comparable to their automatic-differentiation counterparts, while reducing GPU memory usage and training time by up to a factor of two. Additional tests on sparse, incomplete, and non-CAD data confirm that the proposed formulation is robust and general, offering an efficient and scalable alternative for curvature-aware SDF learning.</description>

      <title>Computational Caustic Design for Surface Light Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing freeform surfaces to control light based on real-world illumination patterns is challenging, as existing caustic lens designs often assume oversimplified point or parallel light sources. We propose representing surface light sources using an optimized set of point sources, whose parameters are fitted to the real light source's illumination using a novel differentiable rendering framework. Our physically-based rendering approach simulates light transmission using flux, without requiring prior knowledge of the light source's intensity distribution. To efficiently explore the light source parameter space during optimization, we apply a contraction mapping that converts the constrained problem into an unconstrained one. Using the optimized light source model, we then design the freeform lens shape considering flux consistency and normal integrability. Simulations and physical experiments show our method more accurately represents real surface light sources compared to point-source approximations, yielding caustic lenses that produce images closely matching the target light distributions.</description>

      <title>Time-to-Move: Training-Free Motion Controlled Video Generation via Dual-Clock Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

      <title>OUGS: Active View Selection via Object-aware Uncertainty Estimation in 3DGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.</description>

      <title>IFG: Internet-Scale Guidance for Functional Grasping Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision Models trained on internet-scale data have demonstrated strong capabilities in segmenting and semantically understanding object parts, even in cluttered, crowded scenes. However, while these models can direct a robot toward the general region of an object, they lack the geometric understanding required to precisely control dexterous robotic hands for 3D grasping. To overcome this, our key insight is to leverage simulation with a force-closure grasping generation pipeline that understands local geometries of the hand and object in the scene. Because this pipeline is slow and requires ground-truth observations, the resulting data is distilled into a diffusion model that operates in real-time on camera point clouds. By combining the global semantic understanding of internet-scale models with the geometric precision of a simulation-based locally-aware force-closure, \our achieves high-performance semantic grasping without any manually collected training data.

      <title>Crafting Dynamic Virtual Activities with Advanced Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for generating virtual activities, leveraging the integration of vision-language modalities to enable the interpretation of virtual environments. Our approach recognizes and abstracts key scene elements including scene layouts, semantic contexts, and object identities with MLLMs' multimodal reasoning capabilities. By correlating these abstractions with massive knowledge about human activities, MLLMs are capable of generating adaptive and contextually relevant virtual activities. We propose a structured framework to articulate abstract activity descriptions, emphasizing detailed multi-character interactions within virtual spaces. Utilizing the derived high-level contexts, our approach accurately positions virtual characters and ensures that their interactions and behaviors are realistically and contextually appropriate through strategic optimization. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, providing a novel direction for enhancing the realism and context-awareness in simulated virtual environments.</description>

      <title>Chat2SVG: Vector Graphics Generation with Large Language Models and Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) has become the de facto standard for vector graphics in digital design, offering resolution independence and precise control over individual elements. Despite their advantages, creating high-quality SVG content remains challenging, as it demands technical expertise with professional editing software and a considerable time investment to craft complex shapes. Recent text-to-SVG generation methods aim to make vector graphics creation more accessible, but they still encounter limitations in shape regularity, generalization ability, and expressiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce Chat2SVG, a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) and image diffusion models for text-to-SVG generation. Our approach first uses an LLM to generate semantically meaningful SVG templates from basic geometric primitives. Guided by image diffusion models, a dual-stage optimization pipeline refines paths in latent space and adjusts point coordinates to enhance geometric complexity. Extensive experiments show that Chat2SVG outperforms existing methods in visual fidelity, path regularity, and semantic alignment. Additionally, our system enables intuitive editing through natural language instructions, making professional vector graphics creation accessible to all users.</description>

      <title>LayerPeeler: Autoregressive Peeling for Layer-wise Image Vectorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image vectorization is a powerful technique that converts raster images into vector graphics, enabling enhanced flexibility and interactivity. However, popular image vectorization tools struggle with occluded regions, producing incomplete or fragmented shapes that hinder editability. While recent advancements have explored optimization-based and learning-based layer-wise image vectorization, these methods face limitations in vectorization quality and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce LayerPeeler, a novel layer-wise image vectorization approach that addresses these challenges through a progressive simplification paradigm. The key to LayerPeeler's success lies in its autoregressive peeling strategy: by identifying and removing the topmost non-occluded layers while recovering underlying content, we generate vector graphics with complete paths and coherent layer structures. Our method leverages vision-language models to construct a layer graph that captures occlusion relationships among elements, enabling precise detection and description for non-occluded layers. These descriptive captions are used as editing instructions for a finetuned image diffusion model to remove the identified layers. To ensure accurate removal, we employ localized attention control that precisely guides the model to target regions while faithfully preserving the surrounding content. To support this, we contribute a large-scale dataset specifically designed for layer peeling tasks. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LayerPeeler significantly outperforms existing techniques, producing vectorization results with superior path semantics, geometric regularity, and visual fidelity.</description>

      <title>Faithful Contouring: Near-Lossless 3D Voxel Representation Free from Iso-surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04029v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports 2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring, enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\% improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a representation for 3D learning tasks.</description>
