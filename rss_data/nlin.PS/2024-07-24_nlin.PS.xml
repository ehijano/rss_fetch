      <title>Solitary waves in the coupled nonlinear massive Thirring as well as coupled Soler models with arbitrary nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent introduction of an integrable coupled massive Thirring model by Basu-Mallick et al, we introduce a new coupled Soler model. Further we generalize both the coupled massive Thirring and the coupled Soler model to arbitrary nonlinear parameter $\kappa$ and obtain exact solitary wave solutions in both cases. Remarkably, it turns out that in both the models, because of the conservation laws of charge and energy, the exact solutions we find seem to not depend on how we parameterize them, and the charge density of these solutions is related to the charge density of the single field solutions found earlier by a subset of the present authors. In both the models, a nonrelativistic reduction of the equations leads to the same conclusion that the solutions are proportional to those found in the one component field case.</description>

      <title>Defect interactions in the non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a computational study of the pairwise interactions between defects in the recently introduced non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model. The evolution of a defect pair exhibits dependence upon their corresponding topological charges, initial separation, and the non-reciprocity coupling constant $\alpha$. We find that the stability of isolated topologically neutral targets significantly affects the pairwise defect interactions. At large separations, defect interactions are negligible and a defect pair is stable. When positioned in relatively close proximity, a pair of oppositely charged spirals or targets merge to form a single target. At low $\alpha$, like-charged spirals form rotating bound pairs, which are however torn apart by spontaneously formed targets at high $\alpha$. Similar preference for charged or neutral solutions is also seen for a spiral target pair where the spiral dominates at low $\alpha$, but concedes to the target at large $\alpha$. Our work sheds light on the complex phenomenology of non-reciprocal active matter systems when their collective dynamics involves topological defects.</description>
