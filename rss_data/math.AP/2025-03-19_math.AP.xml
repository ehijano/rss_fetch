      <title>The orthonormal Strichartz estimates and convergence problem of density functions related to $\partial_{x}^{3}+\partial_{x}^{-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the orthonormal Strichartz estimates and the convergence
  problem of the density function associated with $\partial_{x}^{3}+\partial_{x}^{-1}$. Firstly,
  when $\gamma_{0}\in\mathfrak{S}^{\beta}(\dot{H}^{s})$ with $\frac{1}{4}\leq s&lt;\frac{1}{2},\,
  0&lt;\alpha\leq 1$, and $1\leq\beta&lt;\frac{\alpha}{1-2s}$, we prove that
  $\lim\limits_{t\longrightarrow0}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{+\infty}\lambda_{j} \left|e^{-t(\partial_{x}^{3}+\partial_{x}^{-1})}f_{j}\right|^{2}=\sum\limits_{j=1}^{+\infty}\lambda_{j} \left|f_{j}\right|^{2}.$
  This extends the Theorem 1.1 of Yan et al. (Indiana Univ. Math. J. 71(2022), 1897-1921.).
  Moreover, we present the Hausdorff
  dimension of the divergence set of the density function related to $\partial_{x}^{3}+\partial_{x}^{-1}$,
  namely ${\rm dim_{H}}D(\gamma_{0})\leq (1-2s)\beta$, which extends the Theorem 1.1 of Zhao et al.
  (Acta Math. Sci. Ser. B (Engl. Ed.) 42(2022), 1607-1620.).
  %
  Secondly, we present the orthonormal Strichartz estimates and the Schatten bounds with space-time norms on $\mathbf{R}$. %
Finally, by using full randomization,
  we establish the probabilistic convergence of the density function related to $\partial_{x}^{3}+\partial_{x}^{-1}$
  on $\R$, which extends the Theorem 1.3 of Yan et al. (Indiana Univ. Math. J. 71(2022), 1897-1921.).</description>

      <title>Fractional Parabolic Theory as a High-Dimensional Limit of Fractional Elliptic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper continues the program that was initiated in \cite{Dav18} and continued in \cite{DSVG24}, where a high-dimensional limiting technique was developed and used to prove certain parabolic theorems from their elliptic counterparts. The articles \cite{Dav18} and \cite{DSVG24} address the constant-coefficient and variable-coefficient settings, respectively. Here, we focus on fractional operators. As shown in \cite{CS07}, \cite{NS16}, \cite{ST17}, fractional operators may be associated with certain degenerate operators via extension problems, so we study the corresponding class of degenerate operators. Our high-dimensional limiting technique is demonstrated through new proofs of three theorems for degenerate parabolic equations. Specifically, we establish the monotonicity of Almgren-type, Weiss-type, and Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman-type functionals in the degenerate parabolic setting. Each new parabolic proof in this article is based on a (new) related elliptic theorem and a careful limiting argument that is reminiscent of those from \cite{Dav18} and \cite{DSVG24}. Our proof of the degenerate parabolic Weiss-type monotonicity formula additionally uses an epiperimetric inequality for weakly $a$-harmonic functions, which we also prove. To the best of our knowledge, our Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman monotonicity result is new.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short paper we provide a new proof of the geometric Forward-Reverse Brascamp-Lieb inequality, using the approach of the heat semigroup, or the heat flow. Furthermore, we characterize all the Forward-Reverse Brascamp-Lieb data such that the initial relation can be preserved by some heat flow.</description>

      <title>Recovering All Coefficients in the Schr\"{o}dinger Equation With Finite Sets of Boundary Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an inverse problem of recovering all spatial dependent coefficients in the time dependent Schr\"odinger equation defined on an open bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq 2$, with smooth enough boundary. We show that by appropriately selecting a finite number of initial conditions and a fixed Dirichlet boundary condition, we may recover all the coefficients in a Lipschitz stable fashion from the corresponding finitely many boundary measurements made on a portion of the boundary. The proof is based on a direct approach, which was introduced in \cite{HIY2020}, to derive the stability estimate directly from the Carleman estimates without any cut-off procedure or compactness-uniqueness argument.</description>

      <title>A Nash-Kuiper theorem for isometric immersions beyond Borisov's exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any given short immersion from an $n$-dimensional bounded domain into $(n+1)$-dimensional Euclidean space and any H\"older exponent $\alpha&lt;(1+n^2-n)^{-1}$, we construct a $C^{1, \alpha}$ isometric immersion within any $C^0$ neighbourhood of the given short immersion using convex integration. This refines the classical Nash--Kuiper theorem and extends the flexibility of $C^{1, \alpha}$ isometric immersion beyond Borisov's exponent. In particular, the regularity threshold aligns with the Onsager exponent $\frac13$ for the incompressible Euler equations in the case $n=2$. The convex integration scheme relies on a new corrugation ansatz, which allows the cancellation of leading order error terms by a novel "integration by parts" technique.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem for the Chern-Simons gauged $O(3)$ sigma model under the Lorenz gauge condition. We prove the local well-posedness of solutions if the initial matter field and gauge field satisfy $(\bm{\phi}_0, \bA_0) \in H^s(\R^2)\times H^{s-\frac12}(\R^2)$, $s&gt;1$, where the critical regularity for $\bm{\phi}_0$ is $s_c=1$. Our proof is based on identifying null forms within the system and utilizing bilinear estimates in wave-Sobolev space.</description>

      <title>Existence and Regularizing Effects of a Nonlinear Diffusion Model for Plasma Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study existence and regularity of weak solutions to a nonlinear parabolic Dirichlet problem $\partial_{t}u - \rho_{\lambda}(x)u\Delta u = \rho_{\lambda}(x)g_{0}(x)u$ on the half line $(0,\infty)$. We find weak solutions from $L^p\ (p &lt; \infty)$ initial data, and by means of a Benilan-Crandall inequality, show solutions are jointly Holder continuous, and locally, spatially Lipschitz on the parabolic interior. We identify special solutions which saturate these bounds. The Benilan-Crandall inequality, derived from time-scaling arguments, is of independent interest for exposing a regularizing effect of the parabolic u$\Delta$u operator. Recently considered in [11], this problem originates in the theory of nonlinear instability damping via wave-particle interactions in plasma physics (see [8, 22]).</description>

      <title>On the magnetic Dirichlet to Neumann operator on the exterior of the disk -- diamagnetism, weak-magnetic field limit and flux effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator (D-to-N map) $\check \Lambda(b,\nu)$ on the exterior of the disk with respect to a magnetic potential $A_{b, \nu}=A^b + A_\nu$ where, for $b\in \mathbb R$ and $\nu \in \mathbb R$, $A^b (x,y)= b\, (-y, x)$ and $A_\nu (x,y)$ is the Aharonov-Bohm potential centered at the origin of flux $2\pi \nu$. First, we show that the limit of $\check \Lambda(b,\nu)$ as $b\rightarrow 0$ is equal to the D-to-N map $\widehat \Lambda (\nu)$ on the interior of the disk associated with the potential $A_\nu (x,y)$. Secondly, we study the ground state energy of the D-to-N map $\check \Lambda(b,\nu)$ and show that the strong diamagnetism property holds. Finally we slightly extend to the exterior case the asymptotic results obtained in the interior case for general domains.</description>

      <title>Coercivity and Gamma-convergence of the $p$-energy of sphere-valued Sobolev maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider sequences of maps from an $(n+m)$-dimensional domain into the $(n-1)$-sphere, which satisfy a natural $p$-energy growth, as $p$ approaches $n$ from below. We prove that, up to subsequences, the Jacobians of such maps converge in the flat topology to an integral $m$-current, and that the $p$-energy Gamma-converges to the mass of the limit current.
  As a corollary, we deduce that the Jacobians of $p$-energy minimizing maps converge to an integral $m$-current that is area-minimizing in a suitable cobordism class, depending on the boundary datum. Moreover, we obtain new estimates for the minimal $p$-energy of maps with prescribed singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the inviscid limit problem to the higher dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the whole space. It was proved in \cite[J. Funct. Anal., 276 (2019)]{GZ} that given initial data $u_0\in B^{s}_{p,r}$ with $1\leq r&lt;\infty$, the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations converge strongly in $B^{s}_{p,r}$ to the Euler equations as the viscosity parameter tends to zero. In the case when $r=\infty$, we prove the failure of the $B^{s}_{p,\infty}$-convergence of the Navier-Stokes equations toward the Euler equations in the inviscid limit.</description>

      <title>The onset of instability for zonal stratospheric flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate some qualitative aspects of the dynamics of the Euler equation on a rotating sphere that are relevant or stratospheric flows. Zonal flow dominates the dynamics of the stratosphere and for most known planetary stratospheres the observed flow pattern is a small perturbation of an n-jet, which corresponds to choosing the Legendre polynomial of degree n as the stream function. Since the 1-jet and the 2-jet are stable, the main interest is the onset of instability for the 3-jet. We confirm long standing conjectures based on numerical simulations by proving that the 3-jet is linearly unstable if and only if the rotation rate belongs to a critical interval. Turning to the nonlinear problem, we prove that linear instability implies nonlinear instability and that, as the rotation rate goes to infinity, nearby traveling waves change gradually from a cat's eyes streamline pattern to a profile with no stagnation points.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the linear stability of Couette flow for 2D compressible Navier-Stokes-Poisson system at high Reynolds number in the domain $\mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{R}$ with initial perturbation in Sobolev spaces. We establish the upper bounds for the solutions of linearized system near Couette flow. In particular, we show that the irrotational component of the perturbation may have a transient growth, after which it decays exponentially.</description>

      <title>Blow-up of radially symmetric solutions for a cubic NLS type system in dimension 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger system modeling the interaction between an optical beam and its third harmonic in a material with Kerr-type nonlinear response. We are mainly interested in the so-called energy-critical case, that is, in dimension four. Our main result states that radially symmetric solutions with initial energy below that of the ground states but with kinetic energy above that of the ground states must blow-up in finite time. The proof of this result is based on the convexity method. As an independent interest we also establish the existence of ground state solutions, that is, solutions that minimize some action functional. In order to obtain our existence results we use the concentration-compactness method combined with variational arguments. As a byproduct, we also obtain the best constant in a vector critical Sobolev-type inequality.</description>

      <title>Rigidity results for the capillary overdetermined problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain rigidity results for bounded positive solutions of the general capillary overdetermined problem \begin{equation}
  \left\{ \begin{array} {ll} \mathrm{div} \left(\frac{\nabla u}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla u|^2}}\right) + f(u) = 0 &amp; \mbox{in }\; \Omega,\\[1mm]
  u= 0 &amp; \mbox{on }\; \partial \Omega,\\[1mm] \partial_{\nu} u=\kappa &amp;\mbox{on }\; \partial \Omega, \end{array}\right. \end{equation} where $f$ is a given $C^1$ function in $\mathbb{R}$, $\nu$ is the exterior unit normal, $\kappa$ is a constant and $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a $C^1$ domain. Our main theorem states that if $n=2, \kappa\neq 0$, $\partial \Omega$ is unbounded and connected, $|\nabla u|$ is bounded and there exists a nonpositive primitive $F$ of $f$ such that $F(0)\geq \left(1+\kappa^2\right)^{-\frac12} -1$, then $\Omega$ must be a half-plane and $u$ is a parallel solution. In other words, under our assumptions, if a capillary graph has the property that its mean curvature depends only on the height, then it is the graph of a one dimensional function. We also prove the boundedness of the gradient of solutions of the above problem when $f'(u) &lt;0$. Moreover we study a Modica type estimate for the above overdetermined problem that allows us to prove that, unless $\Omega$ is a half-space, the mean curvature of $\partial \Omega$ is strictly negative under the assumption that $\kappa\neq 0$ and there exists a nonpositive primitive $F$ of $f$ such that $F(0)\geq \left(1+\kappa^2\right)^{-\frac12} -1$. Our results have an interesting physical application to the classical capillary overdetermined problem, i.e., the case where $f$ is linear.</description>

      <title>On a class of nonlinear BGK-type kinetic equations with density dependent collision rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of nonlinear, spatially inhomogeneous kinetic equations of BGK-type with density dependent collision rates. These equations share the same superlinearity as the Boltzmann equation, and fall into the class of run and tumble equations appearing in mathematical biology. We prove that the Cauchy problem is well-posed, and the solutions propagate Maxwellian bounds over time. Moreover, we show that the solutions approach to equilibrium with an exponential rate, known as a hypocoercivity result. Lastly, we derive a class of nonlinear diffusion equations as the hydrodynamic limit of the kinetic equations in the diffusive scaling, employing both hypocoercivity and relative entropy methods. The limit equations cover a wide range of nonlinear diffusion equations including both the porous medium and the fast diffusion equations.</description>

      <title>Fractional fast diffusion with initial data a Radon measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a complete Widder Theory for the fractional fast diffusion equation. Our work focuses on nonnegative solutions satisfying a certain integral size condition at infinity. We prove that these solutions possess a Radon measure as initial trace, and prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions originating from such initial data. The uniqueness result is the main issue. Most of its difficulty comes from the singular character of the nonlinearity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Boundary Control method, a method for hyperbolic inverse problems, is also capable of dealing directly with certain classes of elliptic and parabolic Inverse Boundary Value Problems; thus pointing towards Boundary Control method potentially constituting a means of unification of Inverse Boundary Value Problems. As an application we show that the Calderon problem can be dealt with directly via Boundary Control method, i.e. without reduction of the elliptic problem to a 'hyperbolized' problem.</description>

      <title>Rods in flows: the PDE theory of immersed elastic filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a family of curve evolution equations approximating the motion of a Kirchhoff rod immersed in a low Reynolds number fluid. The rod is modeled as a framed curve whose energy consists of the bending energy of the curve and the twisting energy of the frame. The equations we consider may be realized as gradient flows of the rod energy under a certain anisotropic metric coming from resistive force theory. Ultimately, our goal is to provide a comprehensive treatment of the PDE theory of immersed rod dynamics. We begin by analyzing the problem without the frame, in which case the evolution is globally well-posed and solutions asymptotically converge to Euler elasticae. Next, in the planar setting, we demonstrate the existence of large time-periodic solutions forced by intrinsic curvature relevant to undulatory swimming. Finally, the majority of the paper is devoted to the evolution of an immersed Kirchhoff rod in 3D, which involves a strong coupling between the curve and frame. Under a physically reasonable assumption on the curvature, solutions exist globally-in-time and asymptotically converge to rod equilibria.</description>

      <title>POD-Galerkin Reduced Order Modeling of the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced order modeling (ROM) aims to mitigate computational complexity by reducing the size of a high-dimensional state space. In this study, we demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and stability of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-Galerkin ROM when applied to the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation model, which integrates coupled atmosphere, ocean, and sea surface temperature (SST) mechanisms in the equatorial Pacific. While POD identifies the most energetic modes of a system from simulation data, the Galerkin projection maps the governing equations onto these reduced modes to derive a simplified dynamical system. Leveraging the unique coupling properties of the model, we propose a novel approach to formulate a reduced order model derived from Galerkin projection. Our approach achieves remarkable computational efficiency, requiring only four POD modes. The results provide highly stable and accurate solutions over 95% compared to the high-dimensional full-order model (FOM), highlighting the potential of POD-Galerkin reduction for efficient and accurate climate simulations.</description>

      <title>A note on Laplacian bounds, deformation properties and isoperimetric sets in metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the setting of length PI spaces satisfying a suitable deformation property, it is known that each isoperimetric set has an open representative. In this paper, we construct an example of a length PI space (without the deformation property) where an isoperimetric set does not have any representative whose topological interior is non-empty. Moreover, we provide a sufficient condition for the validity of the deformation property, consisting in an upper Laplacian bound for the squared distance functions from a point. Our result applies to essentially non-branching ${\sf MCP}(K,N)$ spaces, thus in particular to essentially non-branching ${\sf CD}(K,N)$ spaces and to many Carnot groups and sub-Riemannian manifolds. As a consequence, every isoperimetric set in an essentially non-branching ${\sf MCP}(K,N)$ space has an open representative, which is also bounded whenever a uniform lower bound on the volumes of unit balls is assumed.</description>

Abstract: In this short note, we prove that the restriction conjecture for the (hyperbolic) paraboloid in $\mathbb{R}^d$ implies the $l^p$-decoupling theorem for the (hyperbolic) paraboloid in $\mathbb{R}^{2d-1}$. In particular, this gives a simple proof of the $l^p$ decoupling theorem for the (hyperbolic) paraboloid in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we use results of Number Theory to prove the conjecture on eigenvalue problem of a 2D elliptic PDE proposed by P. Korman in his recent paper \cite{ref}: for any even integer $2k$, one can find an eigenvalue $N$ that can be represented as $N=a^{2}+b^{2}$, with integers $a\neq b$ and multiplicity $2k$, while for any odd integer $2k + 1$, one can find an integer $M$ that can be represented as $M=a^{2}+b^{2}$ with multiplicity $2k+1$. In addition, the manuscript gives the formula to find those $N$'s.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gradient flows of general functionals with linear growth with very weak assumptions. Classical results concerning characterisation of solutions require differentiability of the Lagrangian, as for the time-dependent minimal surface equation, or a special form of the Lagrangian as in the total variation flow. We propose to study this problem using duality techniques, give a general definition of solutions and prove their existence and uniqueness. This approach also allows us to reduce the regularity and structure assumptions on the Lagrangian.</description>

Abstract: We study time averages for the norm of solutions to kinetic Fokker--Planck equations associated with general Hamiltonians. We provide fully explicit and constructive decay estimates for systems subject to a confining potential, allowing fat-tail, sub-exponential and (super-)exponential local equilibria, which also include the classic Maxwellian case. The key step in our estimates is a modified Poincar\'e inequality, obtained via a Lions--Poincar\'e inequality and an averaging lemma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we address some questions about symmetry, radial monotonicity, and uniqueness for a semilinear fourth-order boundary value problem in the ball of $\mathbb R^2$ deriving from the Kirchhoff-Love model of deformations of thin plates. We first show the radial monotonicity for a wide class of biharmonic problems. The proof of uniqueness is based on ODE techniques and applies to the whole range of the boundary parameter. For an unbounded subset of this range we also prove symmetry of the ground states by means of a rearrangement argument which makes use of Talenti's comparison principle. This paper complements the analysis in [G. Romani, Anal. PDE 10 (2017), no. 4, 943-982], where existence and positivity issues have been investigated.</description>

      <title>Classical solutions to the thin-film equation with general mobility in the perfect-wetting regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove well-posedness, partial regularity, and stability of the thin-film equation $h_t + (m(h) h_{zzz})_z = 0$ with general mobility $m(h) = h^n$ and mobility exponent $n\in (1,\tfrac{3}{2})\cup (\tfrac{3}{2},3)$ in the regime of perfect wetting (zero contact angle). After a suitable coordinate transformation to fix the free boundary (the contact line where liquid, air, and solid coalesce), the thin-film equation is rewritten as an abstract Cauchy problem and we obtain maximal $L^{p}_t$-regularity for the linearized evolution. Partial regularity close to the free boundary is obtained by studying the elliptic regularity of the spatial part of the linearization. This yields solutions that are non-smooth in the distance to the free boundary, in line with previous findings for source-type self-similar solutions. In a scaling-wise quasi-minimal norm for the initial data, we obtain a well-posedness and asymptotic stability result for perturbations of traveling waves. The novelty of this work lies in the usage of $L^{p}$-estimates in time, where $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$, while the existing literature mostly deals with $p = 2$ at least for nonlinear mobilities. This turns out to be essential to obtain for the first time a well-posedness result in the perfect-wetting regime for all physical nonlinear slip conditions except for a strongly degenerate case at $n = \tfrac 3 2$ and the well-understood Greenspan-slip case $n = 1$. Furthermore, compared to [J. Differential Equations, 257(1):15-81, 2014] by Giacomelli, the first author of this paper, Kn\"upfer, and Otto, where a PDE approach yields $L^2_t$-estimates, well-posedness, and stability for $1.8384 \approx \tfrac{3}{17}(15-\sqrt{21}) &lt; n &lt; \tfrac{3}{11}(7+\sqrt{5}) \approx 2.5189$, our functional-analytic approach is significantly shorter while at the same time giving a more general result.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Two-scale System with Nonlinear Dispersion: Weak Solvability and Numerical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12251v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a two-scale system featuring an upscaled parabolic dispersion-reaction equation intimately linked to a family of elliptic cell problems. The system is strongly coupled through a dispersion tensor, which depends on the solutions to the cell problems, and via the cell problems themselves, where the solution of the parabolic problem interacts nonlinearly with the drift term. This particular mathematical structure is motivated by a rigorously derived upscaled reaction-diffusion-convection model that describes the evolution of a population of interacting particles pushed by a large drift through an array of periodically placed obstacles (i.e., through a regular porous medium).
  We prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to our system by means of an iterative scheme, where particular care is needed to ensure the uniform positivity of the dispersion tensor. Additionally, we use finite element-based approximations for the same iteration scheme to perform multiple simulation studies. Finally, we highlight how the choice of micro-geometry (building the regular porous medium) and of the nonlinear drift coupling affects the macroscopic dispersion of particles.</description>

      <title>Classification of positive solutions of Hardy-Sobolev equation without the finite volume constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the critical Hardy-Sobolev equation \begin{equation*} -\Delta_{p}u = \frac{u^{p^{*}_s-1}}{|x|^{s}}, \ \ x\in \mathbb{R}^n \end{equation*} where $p^{*}_s = \frac{(n-s)p}{n-p}$ denotes the critical Hardy-Sobolev exponent. We classify the positive solutions of this equation for $0 &lt; s &lt; \frac{p-1}{p}$ and $\frac{(2s+n+1)+\sqrt{(2s+n+1)^2-12s}}{6} \leq p &lt; n$ without finite volume constraints, which extends Ou's result in \cite{9} in the literature. The method is based on constructing suitable vector fields integral inequality and using Newton's type inequality.</description>

      <title>A new mathematical model for cell motility with nonlocal repulsion from saturated areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of this work is the mathematical modelling of large populations of cells under different deterministic interactions among themselves, in balance with naturally random diffusion. We focus on cell-cell adhesion mechanisms for a single population confined to an isolated domain. Our most relevant contribution is to derive a mathematical model including a nonlocal saturation coefficient as part of an appropriate nonlocal drift term, including repulsion effects, depending on the level of saturation of the area. For this purpose, we use two discrete approaches taking into account different perspectives: Eulerian and Lagrangian reference systems.</description>

      <title>Weak and Perron Solutions for Stationary Kramers-Fokker-Planck Equations in Bounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate weak solutions and Perron-Wiener-Brelot solutions to the linear stationary Kramers-Fokker-Planck equation in bounded domains. We establish the existence of weak solutions in product domains by applying the Lions-Lax-Milgram theorem and the vanishing viscosity method. Furthermore, we show that these solutions coincide in well-behaved domains. Building on the existence of weak solutions in product domains, we develop the foundational theory of Perron-Wiener-Brelot solutions in arbitrary bounded domains. Our results rely on recent advancements in the theory of kinetic Fokker-Planck equations with rough coefficients.</description>

      <title>Timelike asymptotics for global solutions to a scalar quasilinear wave equation satisfying the weak null condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the timelike asymptotics for global solutions to a scalar quasilinear wave equation satisfying the weak null condition. Given a global solution $u$ to the scalar wave equation with sufficiently small $C_c^\infty$ initial data, we derive an asymptotic formula for this global solution inside the light cone (i.e. for $|x|&lt;t$). It involves the scattering data obtained in the author's asymptotic completeness result in arXiv:2105.11573. Using this asymptotic formula, we prove that $u$ must vanish under some decaying assumptions on $u$ or its scattering data, provided that the wave equation violates the null condition.</description>

Abstract: Here we give a survey of consequences from the theory of the Beltrami equations in the complex plane $\mathbb C$ to generalized Cauchy-Riemann equations $\nabla v = B \nabla u$ in the real plane $\mathbb R^2$ and clarify the relationships of the latter to the $A-$harmonic equation ${\rm div} A\,{\rm grad}\, u = 0$ with matrix valued coefficients $A$ that is one of the main equations of the potential theory, namely, of the hydro\-mechanics (fluid mechanics) in anisotropic and inhomogeneous media. The survey includes various types of results as theorems on existence, representation and regularity of their solutions, in particular, for the main boundary value problems of Hilbert, Dirichlet, Neumann, Poincare and Riemann.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear bound states with prescribed angular momentum in the mass supercritical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence, orbital stability/instability and regularity of bound state solutions to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with super-quadratic confinement in two and three spatial dimensions for the mass supercritical case. Such solutions, which are given by time-dependent rotations of a non-radially symmetric spatial profile, correspond to critical points of the underlying energy function restricted on the double constraints consisting of the mass and the angular momentum. The study exhibits new pictures for rotating Bose-Einstein condensates within the framework of Gross-Pitaevskii theory. It is proved that there exist two non-radial symmetric solutions, one of which is local minimizer and the other is mountain pass type critical point of the underlying energy function restricted on the constraints. Moreover, we derive conditions that guarantee that local minimizers are regular, the set of those is orbitally stable and mountain pass type solutions are strongly unstable. The results extend and complement the recent ones in \cite{NSS}, where the consideration is undertaken in the mass subcritical case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the radial symmetry, uniqueness and non-degeneracy of solutions to the degenerate nonlinear elliptic equation $$ -\nabla \cdot \left(|x|^{2a} \nabla u\right) + \omega u=|u|^{p-2}u \quad \mbox{in} \,\, \mathbb{R}^d, $$ where $d \geq 2$, $0&lt;a&lt;1$, $\omega&gt;0$ and $2&lt;p&lt;\frac{2d}{d-2(1-a)}$. We proved that any ground state is radially symmetric and strictly decreasing in the radial direction. Moreover, we establish the uniqueness of ground states and derive the non-degeneracy of ground states in the corresponding radially symmetric Sobolev space. This affirms the nature conjectures posed recently in \cite{IS}.</description>

      <title>Positive singular solutions of a certain elliptic PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence of positive singular solutions for a system of partial differential equations on a bounded domain. Our approach is based on analyzing the solution of the equation \begin{equation} \label{base equation} \left\{ \begin{array}{lr} -\Delta w = | \nabla w |^p &amp; \text{in}~~ B_1 \backslash \{0\},\\ w = 0 &amp; \text{on}~~ \partial B_1, \end{array} \right. \end{equation} and using its properties to study positive singular solutions of its perturbations on $ B_1 $, the unit ball centered at the origin in $\mathbb{R}^N$, under the assumptions $N \geq 3$ and $\frac{N}{N-1} &lt; p &lt; 2$ . Specifically, we consider the system \begin{equation} \label{main equation of the thesis} \left\{ \begin{array}{lr} -\Delta u = (1+\kappa_1(x)) | \nabla v |^p &amp; \text{in}~~ B_1 \backslash \{0\},\\ -\Delta v = (1+\kappa_2(x)) | \nabla u |^p &amp; \text{in}~~ B_1 \backslash \{0\},\\ u = v = 0 &amp; \text{on}~~ \partial B_1. \end{array} \right. \end{equation} Here, $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ are non-negative, continuous functions satisfying $\kappa_1(0) = \kappa_2(0) = 0$ . The goal of this work is to establish the existence of positive singular solutions for this equation within the given domain.</description>

      <title>Singular perturbations models in phase transitions for anisotropic higher-order materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a model for phase transitions in which a double-well potential is singularly perturbed by possibly several terms involving different, arbitrarily high orders of derivation. We study by $\Gamma$-convergence the asymptotic behaviour as $\varepsilon\to 0$ of the functionals \begin{equation*}
  F_\varepsilon(u):=\int_\Omega \Bigl[\frac{1}{\varepsilon}W(u)+\sum_{\ell=1}^{k}q_\ell\varepsilon^{2\ell-1}|\nabla^{(\ell)}u|_\ell^2\Bigr]\,dx, \qquad u\in H^k(\Omega), \end{equation*} for fixed $k&gt;1$ integer, addressing also to the case in which the coefficients $q_1,...,q_{k-1}$ are negative and $|\cdot|_\ell$ is any norm on the space of symmetric $\ell$-tensors for each $\ell\in\{1,...,k\}$. The negativity of the coefficients leads to the lack of a priori bounds on the functionals; such issue is overcome by proving a nonlinear interpolation inequality. With this inequality at our disposal, a compactness result is achieved by resorting to the recent paper [10]. A further difficulty is the presence of general tensor norms which carry anisotropies, making standard slicing arguments not suitable. We prove that the $\Gamma$-limit is finite only on sharp interfaces and that it equals an anisotropic perimeter, with a surface energy density described by a cell formula.</description>

      <title>Localized Patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Localized patterns are coherent structures embedded in a quiescent state and occur in both discrete and continuous media across a wide range of applications. While it is well-understood how domain covering patterns (for example stripes and hexagons) emerge from a pattern-forming/Turing instability, analyzing the emergence of their localized counterparts remains a significant challenge. There has been considerable progress in studying localized patterns over the past few decades, often by employing innovative mathematical tools and techniques. In particular, the study of localized pattern formation has benefited greatly from numerical techniques; the continuing advancement in computational power has helped to both identify new types patterns and further our understanding of their behavior. We review recent advances regarding the complex behavior of localized patterns and the mathematical tools that have been developed to understand them, covering various topics from spatial dynamics, exponential asymptotics, and numerical methods. We observe that the mathematical understanding of localized patterns decreases as the spatial dimension increases, thus providing significant open problems that will form the basis for future investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Laplace operator on the half-space with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. We prove that this operator admits a bounded $H^\infty$-calculus on Sobolev spaces with power weights measuring the distance to the boundary. These weights do not necessarily belong to the class of Muckenhoupt $A_p$ weights. We additionally study the corresponding Dirichlet and Neumann heat semigroup. It is shown that these semigroups, in contrast to the $L^p$-case, have polynomial growth. Moreover, maximal regularity results for the heat equation are derived on inhomogeneous and homogeneous weighted Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>The geometric size of the fundamental gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental gap conjecture proved by Andrews and Clutterbuck in 2011 provides the sharp lower bound for the difference between the first two Dirichlet Laplacian eigenvalues in terms of the diameter of a convex set in $\mathbb{R}^N$. The question concerning the rigidity of the inequality, raised by Yau in 1990, was left open. Going beyond rigidity, our main result strengthens Andrews-Clutterbuck inequality, by quantifying geometrically the excess of the gap compared to the diameter in terms of flatness. The proof relies on a localized, variational interpretation of the fundamental gap, allowing a dimension reduction via the use of convex partitions \`a la Payne-Weinberger: the result stems by combining a new sharp result for one dimensional Schr\"odinger eigenvalues with measure potentials, with a thorough analysis of the geometry of the partition into convex cells. As a by-product of our approach, we obtain a quantitative form of Payne-Weinberger inequality for the first nontrivial Neumann eigenvalue of a convex set in $\mathbb{R}^N$, thus proving, in a stronger version, a conjecture from 2007 by Hang-Wang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a general theoretical tool for the establishment of the boundedness of notoriously difficult operators (such as potentials) on certain specific types of rearrangement-invariant function spaces from analogous properties of operators that are easier to handle (such as fractional maximal operators). A principal example of the new results one obtains by our analysis is the following inequality, which generalizes a result of Korobkov and Kristensen (who had treated the case $\mu=\mathcal{L}^n$, the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$): There exists a constant $C&gt;0$ such that \[ \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |I_\alpha^\mu f|^p \;d\nu \leq C \|f\|_{L^{p,1}(\mathbb{R}^n,\mu)}^p \] for all $f$ in the Lorentz space $L^{p,1}(\mathbb{R}^n,\mu)$, where $\mu, \nu$ are Radon measures such that \[ \sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}^n, r&gt;0} \frac{\mu(B(x,r))}{r^{d}} &lt; \infty \quad \text{and} \quad \sup_{\mu(Q)&gt;0} \frac{\nu(Q)}{\quad\mu(Q)^{1-\frac{\alpha p}{d}}} &lt; \infty, \] and $I_\alpha^\mu$ is the Riesz potential defined with respect to $\mu$ of order $\alpha \in (0,d)$. More broadly, we obtain inequalities in this spirit in the context of rearrangement-invariant spaces through a result of independent interest, an extension of an interpolation theorem of Calder\'on where the target space in one endpoint is a space of bounded functions.</description>

      <title>Constrained differential operators, Sobolev inequalities, and Riesz potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inequalities for Riesz potentials are well-known to be equivalent to Sobolev inequalities of the same order for domain norms "far" from $L^1$, but to be weaker otherwise. Recent contributions by Van Schaftingen, by Hernandez, Rai\c{t}\u{a} and Spector, and by Stolyarov proved that this gap can be filled in Riesz potential inequalities for vector-valued functions in $L^1$ fulfilling a co-canceling differential condition. This work demonstrates that such a property is not just peculiar to the space $L^1$. Indeed, under the same differential constraint, a Riesz potential inequality is shown to hold for any domain and target rearrangement-invariant norms that render a Sobolev inequality of the same order true. This is based on a new interpolation inequality, which, via a kind of duality argument, yields a parallel property of Sobolev inequalities for any linear homogeneous elliptic canceling differential operator. Specifically, Sobolev inequalities involving the full gradient of a certain order share the same rearrangement-invariant domain and target spaces as their analogs for any other homogeneous elliptic canceling differential operator of equal order. As a consequence, Riesz potential inequalities under the co-canceling constraint and Sobolev inequalities for homogeneous elliptic canceling differential operators are offered for general families of rearrangement-invariant spaces, such as the Orlicz spaces and the Lorentz-Zygmund spaces. Especially relevant instances of inequalities for domain spaces neighboring $L^1$ are singled out.</description>
