      <title>Dynamic choices, temporal invariance and variational discounting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People often face trade-offs between costs and benefits occurring at various points in time. The predominant discounting approach is to use the exponential form. Central to this approach is the discount rate, a unique parameter that converts a future value into its present equivalent. However, a universally accepted discount rate remains a matter of ongoing debate and lacks consensus. This paper provides a robust solution for resolving conflicts in discount rates, which recommends considering all discount rates but aims to assign varying degrees of importance to these rates. Moreover, a considerable number of economists support a theory that suggests equal consideration of future and present utilities. In response to this debate, we introduce a general criterion capable of accommodating situations where it is feasible not to discount future utilities. This criterion encompasses and extends various existing criteria in the literature.</description>

      <title>Effects of Vote Delegation in Blockchains: Who Wins?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates which alternative benefits from vote delegation in binary collective decisions within blockchains. We begin by examining two extreme cases of voting weight distributions: Equal-Weight (EW), where each voter has equal voting weight, and Dominant-Weight (DW), where a single voter holds a majority of the voting weights before any delegation occurs. We show that vote delegation tends to benefit the ex-ante minority under EW, i.e., the alternative with a lower initial probability of winning. The converse holds under DW distribution. Through numerical simulations, we extend our findings to arbitrary voting weight distributions, showing that vote delegation benefits the ex-ante majority when it leads to a more balanced distribution of voting weights. Finally, in large communities where all agents have equal voting weight, vote delegation has a negligible impact on the outcome. These insights provide practical guidance for governance decisions in blockchains.</description>

      <title>A Generalised $\lambda$-Core Concept for Normal Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we develop a generalisation of the $\lambda$-Core solution for non-cooperative games in normal form. We show that this generalised $\lambda$-Core is non-empty for the class of separable games that admit a socially optimal Nash equilibrium. Examples are provided that indicate that non-emptiness of the generalised $\lambda$-Core cannot be expected for large classes of normal form games.</description>

      <title>Persuaded Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13409v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider sequential search by an agent who cannot observe the quality of goods but can acquire information by buying signals from a profit-maximizing principal with limited commitment power. The principal can charge higher prices for more informative signals in any period, but high prices in the future discourage continued search by the agent, thereby reducing the principal's future profits. A unique stationary equilibrium outcome exists, and we show that the principal $(i)$ induces the socially efficient stopping rule, $(ii)$ extracts the full surplus, and $(iii)$ persuades the agent against settling for marginal goods, extending the duration of surplus extraction. However, introducing an additional, free source of information can lead to inefficiency in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Unbalanced Growth and Land Overvaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Historical trends suggest the decline in importance of land as a production factor but its continued importance as a store of value. Using an overlapping generations model with land and aggregate uncertainty, we theoretically study the long-run behavior of land prices and identify economic conditions under which land becomes overvalued on the long-run trend relative to the fundamentals defined by the present value of land rents. Unbalanced growth together with the elasticity of substitution between production factors plays a critical role. Around the trend, land prices exhibit recurrent stochastic fluctuations, with expansions and contractions in the size of land overvaluation.</description>

      <title>Protected Income and Inequality Aversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imagine that a large increment can be given to an individual in a society. We ask: what is the maximal sacrifice that can be imposed on another individual according to an evaluator for the sake of this increment? We show that the answer can reveal how inequality averse an evaluator is. In particular, all Kolm-Pollak evaluators would sacrifice the full income of the sacrificed individual if their income was low enough and a declining fraction of their income otherwise. Kolm-Atkinson evaluators would sacrifice the full income of the sacrificed individual, for all income levels, if their inequality aversion was no greater than one, and sacrifice a constant fraction of their income otherwise. Motivated by these findings, we propose a class of social preferences that, starting from a baseline level of protection, protect a higher fraction of the sacrificed individual's income the lower their income. In addition to relating levels of protected income to coefficients of inequality, we also characterize the classes of additively separable social welfare functions that guarantee specific (absolute or relative) levels of protection.</description>
