      <title>Quasi-Homogeneous Integrable Systems: Free Parameters, Kovalevskaya Exponents, and the Painlev\'e Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates quasi-homogeneous integrable systems by analyzing their Laurent series solutions near movable singularities, motivated by patterns observed in Kovalevskaya exponents of four-dimensional Painlev\'e-type equations. We introduce a parameter space encoding the free coefficients in these expansions and study its deformation under a commuting quasi-homogeneous vector field.
  Within this framework, we derive lower indicial loci from the principal one and establish an arithmetic resonance condition on Kovalevskaya exponents that governs the emergence of fractional powers and the breakdown of the Painlev\'e property. Moreover, we construct a Frobenius manifold structure on the parameter space via the initial value map, which becomes conformal when all weights coincide.
  In the Hamiltonian context, we demonstrate that the induced flow on the parameter space preserves a symplectic form and yields a natural pairing of Kovalevskaya exponents. These findings unify analytic and geometric aspects of quasi-homogeneous integrable systems and offer new insights into their deformation theory and singularity structures.\\ Our results provide a comprehensive framework applicable to the classification and analysis of Painlev\'e-type equations and related integrable models.</description>

      <title>A system of 2 nonlinearly coupled ODEs which is explicitly solvable and possibly isochronous provided its coefficients are suitably restricted</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss some remarkable properties of the autonomous system of 2 first-order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), which equates the derivatives $\dot{x}_n(t)$ ($n = 1, 2$) of the 2 dependent variables $x_n(t)$ to the ratios of polynomials (with constant coefficients) in the 2 variables $x_n (t)$: each of the 2 (a priori different) polynomials $P_3^{(n)}(x_1, x_2)$ in the 2 numerators is of degree 3; the 2 denominators are instead given by the same polynomial $P_1(x_1, x_2)$ of degree 1. Hence this system features 23 a priori arbitrary input numbers, namely the 23 coefficients defining these 3 polynomials. Our main finding is to show that if these 23 coefficients are given by 23 (explicitly provided) formulas in terms of 15 a priori arbitrary parameters, then the initial values problem (with arbitrary initial data $x_n (0)$) for this dynamical system can be explicitly solved. We also show that it is possible (with the help of Mathematica) to identify 12 explicit constraints on these 23 coefficients, which are sufficient to guarantee that this system belongs to the class of systems we are focusing on. Several such explicitly solvable systems of ODEs are treated (including the subcase with $P_1(x_1, x_2) = 1$, implying that the right-hand sides of the ODEs are just cubic polynomials: no denominators!). Examples of the solutions of several of these systems are reported and displayed, including cases in which the solutions are isochronous.</description>
