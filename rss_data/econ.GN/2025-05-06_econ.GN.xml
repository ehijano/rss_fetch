      <title>Testing Piketty's Hypothesis on the Drivers of Income Inequality: Evidence from Panel VARs with Heterogeneous Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century puts forth a logically consistent explanation for changes in income and wealth inequality patterns. However, while rich in data, the book provides no formal empirical testing for its theorized causal chain. This paper tests the hypothesis that the $r-g$ gap drives income inequality and the increasing capital share of national income. Using panel VAR models with data from 18 advanced economies over 30 years, I find no empirical support for Piketty's predictions. The results suggest that dynamics such as savings-rate adjustments and diminishing returns to capital play critical roles in offsetting the hypothesized effects. These findings challenge the theoretical underpinnings of the growth in inequality and call for alternative explanations.</description>

Abstract: Capital growth, at large scales only, arrives with no help from net saving, and consequently with no help from consumption constraint. Net saving, at large scales, is sacrifice of consumption with nothing in return.</description>

      <title>Integrating earth observation data into the tri-environmental evaluation of the economic cost of natural disasters: a case study of 2025 LA wildfire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildfires in urbanized regions, particularly within the wildland-urban interface, have significantly intensified in frequency and severity, driven by rapid urban expansion and climate change. This study aims to provide a comprehensive, fine-grained evaluation of the recent 2025 Los Angeles wildfire's impacts, through a multi-source, tri-environmental framework in the social, built and natural environmental dimensions. This study employed a spatiotemporal wildfire impact assessment method based on daily satellite fire detections from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), infrastructure data from OpenStreetMap, and high-resolution dasymetric population modeling to capture the dynamic progression of wildfire events in two distinct Los Angeles County regions, Eaton and Palisades, which occurred in January 2025. The modelling result estimated that the total direct economic losses reached approximately 4.86 billion USD with the highest single-day losses recorded on January 8 in both districts. Population exposure reached a daily maximum of 4,342 residents in Eaton and 3,926 residents in Palisades. Our modelling results highlight early, severe ecological and infrastructural damage in Palisades, as well as delayed, intense social and economic disruptions in Eaton. This tri-environmental framework underscores the necessity for tailored, equitable wildfire management strategies, enabling more effective emergency responses, targeted urban planning, and community resilience enhancement. Our study contributes a highly replicable tri-environmental framework for evaluating the natural, built and social environmental costs of natural disasters, which can be applied to future risk profiling, hazard mitigation, and environmental management in the era of climate change.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Trader Responses to Macroeconomic Surprises: Simulating Order Flow Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how market participants react to shocks like scheduled macroeconomic news is crucial for both traders and policymakers. We develop a calibrated data generation process DGP that embeds four stylized trader archetypes retail, pension, institutional, and hedge funds into an extended CAPM augmented by CPI surprises. Each agents order size choice is driven by a softmax discrete choice rule over small, medium, and large trades, where utility depends on risk aversion, surprise magnitude, and liquidity. We aim to analyze each agent's reaction to shocks and Monte Carlo experiments show that higher information, lower aversion agents take systematically larger positions and achieve higher average wealth. Retail investors under react on average, exhibiting smaller allocations and more dispersed outcomes. And ambient liquidity amplifies the sensitivity of order flow to surprise shocks. Our framework offers a transparent benchmark for analyzing order flow dynamics around macro releases and suggests how real time flow data could inform news impact inference.</description>

      <title>Revolutions as Structural Breaks: The Long-Term Economic and Institutional Consequences of the 1979 Iranian Revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines whether major political institutional disruptions produce temporary shocks or structural breaks in long-term development. Using the 1979 Iranian Revolution as a natural experiment, we apply the synthetic control method to estimate its causal effect on economic growth and institutional quality. Drawing on a panel of 66 countries from 1950 to 2015, we construct counterfactual trajectories for Iran in the absence of revolutionary change. Our results show a persistent and statistically significant divergence in per capita GDP, institutional quality, and legal constraints on executive power. We perform in-space and in-time placebo tests to rule out confounding events, such as the Iran-Iraq War and international sanctions, and propose confidence interval estimation to address uncertainty in treatment effects. The findings identify the Iranian Revolution as a structural institutional rupture, with implications for the classification of institutional change more broadly. We contribute a generalizable empirical framework for distinguishing between temporary and structural institutional shocks in long-run development.</description>

      <title>Ethnic Conflicts, Civil War and Economic Growth: Region-Level Evidence from former Yugoslavia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the long-term impact of civil war on subnational economic growth across 78 regions in five former Yugoslav republics from 1950 to 2015. Leveraging the outbreak of ethnic tensions and the onset of conflict, we construct counterfactual growth trajectories using a robust region-level donor pool from 28 conflict-free countries. Applying a hybrid synthetic control and difference-in-differences approach, we find that the war in former Yugoslavia inflicted unprecedented regional per capita GDP losses estimated at 38 percent, with substantial regional heterogeneity. The most war-affected regions suffered prolonged and permanent economic declines, while capital cities experienced more transitory effects. Our results are robust to extensive variety of specification tests, placebo analyses, and falsification exercises. Notably, ethnic tensions between Serbs and Croats explain up to 40 percent of the observed variation in economic losses, underscoring the deep and lasting influence of ethnic divisions on economic impacts of the armed conflicts.</description>

      <title>Ownership Chains in Multinational Enterprises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines how multinational enterprises (MNEs) structure ownership chains to coordinate subsidiaries across multiple national borders. Using a unique global dataset, we first document key stylized facts: 54% of subsidiaries are controlled through indirect ownership, and ownership chains can span up to seven countries. In particular, we find that subsidiaries further down the hierarchy tend to be more geographically distant from the parent and often operate in different time zones. This suggests that the ease of communication along ownership chains is a critical determinant of their structure. Motivated by these findings, we develop a location choice model in which parent firms compete for corporate control of final subsidiaries. When monitoring is costly, they may delegate control to an intermediate affiliate in another jurisdiction. The model generates a two-stage empirical strategy: (i) a trilateral equation that determines the location of an intermediate affiliate conditional on the location of final subsidiaries; and (ii) a bilateral equation that predicts the location of final investment. Our empirical estimates confirm that the ease of communication at the country level significantly influences the location decisions of affiliates along ownership chains. These findings underscore the importance of organizational frictions in shaping global corporate structures and provide new insights into the geography of multinational ownership networks.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models at Work in China's Labor Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential impacts of large language models (LLMs) on the Chinese labor market. We analyze occupational exposure to LLM capabilities by incorporating human expertise and LLM classifications, following the methodology of Eloundou et al. (2023). The results indicate a positive correlation between occupational exposure and both wage levels and experience premiums at the occupation level. This suggests that higher-paying and experience-intensive jobs may face greater exposure risks from LLM-powered software. We then aggregate occupational exposure at the industry level to obtain industrial exposure scores. Both occupational and industrial exposure scores align with expert assessments. Our empirical analysis also demonstrates a distinct impact of LLMs, which deviates from the routinization hypothesis. We present a stylized theoretical framework to better understand this deviation from previous digital technologies. By incorporating entropy-based information theory into the task-based framework, we propose an AI learning theory that reveals a different pattern of LLM impacts compared to the routinization hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Impact of Upstream Mergers with Downstream Complements and Substitutes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I examine how upstream mergers affect negotiated prices when suppliers bargain with a monopoly intermediary selling products to final consumers. Conventional wisdom holds that such transactions lower negotiated prices when the products are complements for consumers and raise them when they are substitutes. The idea is that consumer demand relationships carry over to upstream negotiations, where mergers between complements weaken the suppliers' bargaining leverage, while mergers between substitutes strengthen it. I challenge this view, showing that it breaks down when the intermediary sells products beyond those of the merging suppliers. In such cases, the merging suppliers' products may act as substitutes for the intermediary even if they are complements for consumers, or as complements for the intermediary even if they are substitutes for consumers. These findings show that upstream conglomerate mergers can raise prices without foreclosure or monopolization and help explain buyer-specific price effects resulting from such mergers.</description>

      <title>Strategic Responses to Technological Change: Evidence from Online Labor Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15262v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this project, we examine how freelancers changed their strategic positioning on an online work platform following the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 - a major advance in AI technologies. We document that post-ChatGPT, freelancers bid on fewer jobs and reposition themselves by differentiating their distribution of bids (i.e., job applications) relative to their prior behavior. We disentangle heterogeneity in strategic responses by exploring how exposure to changes in demand or supply shape incumbent repositioning. We find that the launch of ChatGPT was associated with a short-term decrease in labor demand and an increase in labor supply, though these changes vary across work domains. In response to decreases in labor demand, workers changed their horizontal positioning and withdrew from the platform. In response to increases in labor supply, workers were less likely to decrease bidding or reposition horizontally but shifted their vertical position by targeting lower-value jobs. We further show that repositioning is less likely for high-skill freelancers who face greater adjustment costs. This research contributes to our understanding of how and why workers respond to technological change in the context of recent advances in AI technologies.</description>

      <title>When do firms sell high durability products? The case of light bulb industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study empirically investigates firms' incentives on the choice of product durability, and its social optimality, by developing a dynamic structural model of durable goods with forward-looking consumers and oligopolistic multi-product firms. Based on the observations of the light bulb market, it specifies a model where firms produce multiple products with different durability levels and set product prices based on dynamic incentives. It proposes and applies novel estimation algorithms that alleviate the computational burden and data requirement for estimating demand and marginal cost parameters of dynamic demand models. Using light bulb market data in Japan, structural parameters are estimated. This study obtains the following results. First, large firms have incentives to collude to eliminate high durability incandescent lamps, though it is profitable to sell them for each firm. In contrast, when they can collude on prices, they don't have incentives to eliminate high durability bulbs. Second, eliminating high durability incandescent lamps leads to larger producer and total surplus, though it leads to lower consumer surplus.</description>

      <title>RIVCoin: an alternative, integrated, CeFi/DeFi-Vaulted Cryptocurrency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This whitepaper introduces RIVCoin, a cryptocurrency built on Cosmos, fully stabilized by a diversified portfolio of both CeFi and DeFi assets, available in a digital, non-custodial wallet called RIV Wallet, that aims to provide Users an easy way to access the cryptocurrency markets, compliant to the strictest AML laws and regulations up to date. The token is a cryptocurrency at any time stabilized by a basket of assets: reserves are invested in a portfolio composed long term by 50% of CeFi assets, comprised of Fixed Income, Equity, Mutual and Hedge Funds and 50% of diversified strategies focused on digital assets, mainly staking and LP farming on the major, battle tested DeFi protocols. The cryptocurrency, as well as the dollar before Bretton Woods, is always fully stabilized by vaulted proof of assets: it is born and managed as a decentralized token, minted by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, and entirely stabilized by assets evaluated by professional independent third parties. Users will trade, pool, and exchange the token without any intermediary, being able to merge them into a Liquidity Pool whose rewards will be composed by both the trading fees and the liquidity rewards derived from the reserve's seigniorage.
  Users who wish and decide to pool RIVCoin in the Liquidity Pool will receive additional RIVCoin for themselves, and new RIVCoin are minted when the reserves increase in value or in case of purchase of new RIVCoin. The proposed model allows for alignment of incentives: decreasing the risk exposure by wealthier Users, but implicitly increasing that of smaller ones to a level perceived by them as still sustainable. Users indirectly benefit from the access to the rewards of sophisticated cryptocurrency portfolios hitherto precluded to them, without this turning into a disadvantage for the wealthy User.</description>

      <title>Building floorspace and stock measurement: A review of global efforts, knowledge gaps, and research priorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite a substantial body of research-evidenced by our analysis of 2,628 peer-reviewed papers-global building floorspace data remain fragmented, inconsistent, and methodologically diverse. The lack of high-quality and openly accessible datasets poses major challenges to accurately assessing building carbon neutrality. This review focuses on global building floorspace, especially its nexus with energy and emissions. The key research areas include energy modeling, emissions analysis, building retrofits, and life cycle assessments. Each measurement approach-top-down, bottom-up, and hybrid-has its own limitations: top-down methods provide broad estimates but low accuracy, whereas bottom-up approaches are more precise but data intensive. Our simulations reveal a surge in floorspace growth across emerging economies-most notably in India, Indonesia, and Africa-with India's per capita floorspace projected to triple by 2070. We emphasize the need for a high-resolution global floorspace imagery database to compare energy efficiency, track decarbonization progress, and assess renovation impacts while promoting building sufficiency and accelerating the transition to net-zero building systems.</description>
