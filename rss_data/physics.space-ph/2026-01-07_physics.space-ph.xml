      <title>Spectral Properties and Energy Injection in Mercury's Magnetotail Current Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mercury's magnetotail hosts a thin and highly dynamic current sheet (CS), where magnetic reconnection and strong fluctuations frequently occur. Here, we statistically analyze magnetic field power spectra across 370 magnetotail CSs observed by MESSENGER. About 20% of the events are quasi-laminar, showing single power-law spectra, whereas 80% are turbulent, exhibiting a spectral break separating inertial and kinetic ranges. A dawn-dusk asymmetry is identified: inertial-range slopes are systematically shallower on the dawnside, whereas kinetic-range slopes are steeper, indicating more developed turbulence there, consistent with the higher occurrence of reconnection-related processes on the dawnside. Component analysis shows that the transverse components, orthogonal to the tail-aligned principal field (BX), display shallow slopes near -1 in the inertial range, suggesting energy injection at ion scales rather than a classical inertial range. These results demonstrate that Mercury's unique plasma environment fundamentally reshapes the initiation of turbulence and the redistribution of energy in the magnetotail.</description>

      <title>Monitoring the daily variation of Sun-Earth magnetic fields using galactic cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) between the Sun and Earth is an extension of the solar magnetic field carried by the solar wind into interplanetary space. Monitoring variations in the IMF upstream of the Earth would provide very important information for the prediction of space weather effects, such as effects of solar storms and the solar wind, on human activity. In this study, the IMF between the Sun and Earth was measured daily for the first time using a cosmic-ray observatory. Cosmic rays mainly consist of charged particles that are deflected as they pass through a magnetic field.Therefore, the cosmic-ray Sun shadow, caused by high-energy charged cosmic rays blocked by the Sun and deflected by the magnetic field, can be used to explore the transverse IMF between the Sun and Earth. By employing the powerful kilometer-square array at the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory, the cosmic-ray Sun shadows were observed daily with high significance for the first time. The displacement of the Sun shadow measured in 2021 correlates well with the transverse IMF component measured in situ by spacecraft near the Earth, with a time lag of 3:31 $\pm$ 0:12 days. The displacement of the Sun shadow was also simulated using Parker's classic IMF model, yielding a time lag of 2:06 $\pm$ 0:04 days. This deviation may provide valuable insights into the magnetic field structure, which can improve space weather research.</description>

      <title>Turbulence-Driven Corrugation of Collisionless Fast-Magnetosonic Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisionless fast-magnetosonic shocks are often treated as smooth, planar boundaries, yet observations point to organized corrugation of the shock surface. A plausible driver is upstream turbulence. Broadband fluctuations arriving at the front can continually wrinkle it, changing the local shock geometry and, in turn, conditions for particle injection and radiation. We develop a linear-MHD formulation that treats the shock as a moving interface rather than a fixed boundary. In this approach the shock response can be summarized by an effective impedance determined by the Rankine-Hugoniot base state and the shock geometry, while the upstream turbulence enters only through its statistics. This provides a practical mapping from an assumed incident spectrum to the corrugation amplitude, its drift along the surface, and a coherence scale set by weak damping or leakage. The response is largest when the transmitted downstream fast mode propagates nearly parallel to the shock in the shock frame, which produces a Lorentzian-type enhancement controlled by the downstream normal group speed. We examine how compression, plasma $\beta$, and obliquity affect these corrugation properties and discuss implications for fine structure in heliospheric and supernova-remnant shock emission.</description>
