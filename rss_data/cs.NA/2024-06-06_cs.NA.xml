      <title>A Fast Compensated Algorithm for Computing Givens Rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a very simple compensated scheme for computing very accurate Givens rotations. The approach is significantly more straightforward than the one in \cite{borges2021fast}, and the derivation leads to a very satisfying algorithm whereby a naively computed Givens rotation can be used to construct a correction to itself. It is also seen that this scheme continues to provide high accuracy even when built on a hypoteneuse calculation that is of lesser accuracy.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation of linear evolution equations revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain rates of convergence of numerical approximations of abstract linear evolution equations. Our estimates extend known results like Theorem 3.5 in \cite{thomee} to more general equations and accommodate more advanced numerical approximation techniques. As an example, we consider parabolic equations on surfaces, and surface finite element approximations.</description>

      <title>Scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) stabilization of implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integration schemes for nonlinear structural dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integration schemes are well suited for nonlinear structural dynamics because of their low computational cost and high accuracy. However, stability of IMEX schemes cannot be guaranteed for general nonlinear problems. In this article, we present a scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) stabilization of high-order IMEX time integration schemes that leads to unconditional stability. The proposed IMEX-BDFk-SAV schemes treat linear terms implicitly using kth-order backward difference formulas (BDFk) and nonlinear terms explicitly. This eliminates the need for iterations in nonlinear problems and leads to low computational cost. Truncation error analysis of the proposed IMEX-BDFk-SAV schemes confirms that up to kth-order accuracy can be achieved and this is verified through a series of convergence tests. Unlike existing SAV schemes for first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce a novel SAV for the proposed schemes that allows direct solution of the second-order ODEs without transforming them to a system of first-order ODEs. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed schemes by solving several nonlinear problems in structural dynamics and show that the proposed schemes can achieve high accuracy at a low computational cost while maintaining unconditional stability.</description>

      <title>An iterative constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method for contact problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an Iterative Constraint Energy Minimizing Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (ICEM-GMsFEM) for solving the contact problem with high contrast coefficients. The model problem can be characterized by a variational inequality, where we add a penalty term to convert this problem into a non-smooth and non-linear unconstrained minimizing problem. The characterization of the minimizer satisfies the variational form of a mixed Dirilect-Neumann-Robin boundary value problem. So we apply CEM-GMsFEM iteratively and introduce special boundary correctors along with multiscale spaces to achieve an optimal convergence rate. Numerical results are conducted for different highly heterogeneous permeability fields, validating the fast convergence of the CEM-GMsFEM iteration in handling the contact boundary and illustrating the stability of the proposed method with different sets of parameters. We also prove the fast convergence of the proposed iterative CEM-GMsFEM method and provide an error estimate of the multiscale solution under a mild assumption.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation for variable-exponent fractional diffusion-wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents two numerical schemes for the variable-exponent fractional diffusion-wave equation, which describes, e.g. the propagation of mechanical diffusive waves in viscoelastic media with varying material properties. The main difficulty we overcome lies in that the variable-exponent Abel kernel may not be positive definite or monotonic, and the stability and error estimate of both schemes are proved, with $\alpha(0)$-order and second-order accuracy in time, respectively. Numerical experiments are presented to substantiate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>High-order Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for the Monodomain and Bidomain Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims at presenting a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation employing a spectral basis for two important models employed in cardiac electrophysiology, namely the monodomain and bidomain models. The use of DG methods is motivated by the characteristic of the mathematical solution of such equations which often corresponds to a highly steep wavefront. Hence, the built-in flexibility of discontinuous methods in developing adaptive approaches, combined with the high-order accuracy, can well represent the underlying physics. The choice of a semi-implicit time integration allows for a fast solution at each time step. The article includes some numerical tests to verify the convergence properties and the physiological behaviour of the numerical solution. Also, a pseudo-realistic simulation turns out to fully reconstruct the propagation of the electric potential, comprising the phases of depolarization and repolarization, by overcoming the typical issues related to the steepness of the wave front.</description>

      <title>A Priori Estimation of the Approximation, Optimization and Generalization Error of Random Neural Networks for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there are numerous methods involving neural networks for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), such as Physics informed neural networks (PINNs), Deep Ritz method (DRM) and others. However, the optimization problems are typically non-convex, which makes these methods lead to unsatisfactory solutions. With weights sampled from some distribution, applying random neural networks to solve PDEs yields least squares problems that are easily solvable. In this paper, we focus on Barron type functions and demonstrate the approximation, optimization and generalization of random neural networks for solving PDEs.</description>

      <title>Taylor-Fourier integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce an algorithm which provides approximate solutions to semi-linear ordinary differential equations with highly oscillatory solutions that after an appropriate change of variables can be written as a non-autonomous system with $(2\pi/\omega)$-periodic dependence on $t$. The proposed approximate solutions are written in closed form as functions $X(t,\omega\, t)$ where $X(t,\theta)$ is, (i) a truncated Fourier series in $\theta$ for fixed $t$, and (ii) a truncated Taylor series in $t$ for fixed $\theta$ (that is the reason for the name of the proposed integrators). Such approximations are intended to be uniformly accurate in $\omega$ (in the sense that their accuracy is not deteriorated as $\omega\to \infty$). This feature implies that Taylor-Fourier approximations become more efficient than the application of standard numerical integrators for sufficiently high basic frequency $\omega$. The main goal of the paper is to propose a procedure to efficiently compute such approximations by combining power series arithmetic techniques and the FFT algorithm. We present numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approximation method through its application to well-known problems of interest.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Lipschitz Greedy Recombination Interpolation Method (HOLGRIM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the Higher Order Lipschitz Greedy Recombination Interpolation Method (HOLGRIM) for finding sparse approximations of Lip$(\gamma)$ functions, in the sense of Stein, given as a linear combination of a (large) number of simpler Lip$(\gamma)$ functions. HOLGRIM is developed as a refinement of the Greedy Recombination Interpolation Method (GRIM) in the setting of Lip$(\gamma)$ functions. HOLGRIM combines dynamic growth-based interpolation techniques with thinning-based reduction techniques in a data-driven fashion. The dynamic growth is driven by a greedy selection algorithm in which multiple new points may be selected at each step. The thinning reduction is carried out by recombination, the linear algebra technique utilised by GRIM. We establish that the number of non-zero weights for the approximation returned by HOLGRIM is controlled by a particular packing number of the data. The level of data concentration required to guarantee that HOLGRIM returns a good sparse approximation is decreasing with respect to the regularity parameter $\gamma &gt; 0$. Further, we establish complexity cost estimates verifying that implementing HOLGRIM is feasible.</description>

      <title>Relative Entropy for the Numerical Diffusive Limit of the Linear Jin-Xin System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the diffusive limit of the Jin and Xin model and its approximation by an asymptotic preserving finite volume scheme. At the continuous level, we determine a convergence rate to the diffusive limit by means of a relative entropy method. Considering a semi-discrete approximation (discrete in space and continuous in time), we adapt the method to this semi-discrete framework and establish that the approximated solutions converge towards the discrete convection-diffusion limit with the same convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Constructing efficient spatial discretizations of spans of multivariate Chebyshev polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an arbitrary given span of high-dimensional multivariate Chebyshev polynomials, an approach to construct spatial discretizations is presented, i.e., the construction of a sampling set that allows for the unique reconstruction of each polynomial of this span.
  The approach presented here combines three different types of efficiency. First, the construction of the spatial discretization should be efficient with respect to the dimension of the span of the Chebyshev polynomials. Second, the number of sampling nodes within the constructed discretizations should be efficient, i.e., the oversampling factors should be reasonable. Third, there should be an efficient method for the unique reconstruction of a polynomial from given sampling values at the sampling nodes of the discretization.
  The first two mentioned types of efficiency are also present in constructions based on random sampling nodes, but the lack of structure here causes the inefficiency of the reconstruction method. Our approach uses a combination of cosine transformed rank-1 lattices whose structure allows for applications of univariate fast Fourier transforms for the reconstruction algorithm and is thus a priori efficiently realizable.
  Besides the theoretical estimates of numbers of sampling nodes and failure probabilities due to a random draw of the used lattices, we present several improvements of the basic design approach that significantly increases its practical applicability. Numerical tests, which discretize spans of multivariate Chebyshev polynomials depending on up to more than 50 spatial variables, corroborate the theoretical results and the significance of the improvements.</description>

      <title>Multi-Patch Isogeometric Convolution Hierarchical Deep-learning Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A seamless integration of neural networks with Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) was first introduced in [1] under the name of Hierarchical Deep-learning Neural Network (HiDeNN) and has systematically evolved into Isogeometric Convolution HiDeNN (in short, C-IGA) [2]. C-IGA achieves higher order approximations without increasing the degree of freedom. Due to the Kronecker delta property of C-IGA shape functions, one can refine the mesh in the physical domain like standard finite element method (FEM) while maintaining the exact geometrical mapping of IGA. In this article, C-IGA theory is generalized for multi-CAD-patch systems with a mathematical investigation of the compatibility conditions at patch interfaces and convergence of error estimates. Two compatibility conditions (nodal compatibility and G^0 (i.e., global C^0) compatibility) are presented and validated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Fast randomized least-squares solvers can be just as accurate and stable as classical direct solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the greatest success stories of randomized algorithms for linear algebra has been the development of fast, randomized algorithms for highly overdetermined linear least-squares problems. However, none of the existing algorithms is backward stable, preventing them from being deployed as drop-in replacements for existing QR-based solvers. This paper introduces FOSSILS, a fast, provably backward stable randomized least-squares solver. FOSSILS combines iterative refinement with a preconditioned iterative method applied to the normal equations, and it converges at the same rate as existing randomized least-squares solvers. This work offers the promise of incorporating randomized least-squares solvers into existing software libraries while maintaining the same level of accuracy and stability as classical solvers.</description>

      <title>An Open-Source Framework for Efficient Numerically-Tailored Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a versatile open-source framework designed to facilitate efficient, numerically-tailored Matrix-Matrix Multiplications (MMMs). The framework offers two primary contributions: first, a fine-tuned, automated pipeline for arithmetic datapath generation, enabling highly customizable systolic MMM kernels; second, seamless integration of the generated kernels into user code, irrespective of the programming language employed, without necessitating modifications.
  The framework demonstrates a systematic enhancement in accuracy per energy cost across diverse High Performance Computing (HPC) workloads displaying a variety of numerical requirements, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) inference and Sea Surface Height (SSH) computation. For AI inference, we consider a set of state-of-the-art neural network models, namely ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, DenseNet121, DenseNet161, DenseNet169, and VGG11, in conjunction with two datasets, two computer formats, and 27 distinct intermediate arithmetic datapaths. Our approach consistently reduces energy consumption across all cases, with a notable example being the reduction by factors of $3.3\times$ for IEEE754-32 and $1.4\times$ for Bfloat16 during ImageNet inference with ResNet50. This is accomplished while maintaining accuracies of $82.3\%$ and $86\%$, comparable to those achieved with conventional Floating-Point Units (FPUs). In the context of SSH computation, our method achieves fully-reproducible results using double-precision words, surpassing the accuracy of conventional double- and quad-precision arithmetic in FPUs. Our approach enhances SSH computation accuracy by a minimum of $5\times$ and $27\times$ compared to IEEE754-64 and IEEE754-128, respectively, resulting in $5.6\times$ and $15.1\times$ improvements in accuracy per power cost.</description>

      <title>Constrained or Unconstrained? Neural-Network-Based Equation Discovery from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Throughout many fields, practitioners often rely on differential equations to model systems. Yet, for many applications, the theoretical derivation of such equations and/or accurate resolution of their solutions may be intractable. Instead, recently developed methods, including those based on parameter estimation, operator subset selection, and neural networks, allow for the data-driven discovery of both ordinary and partial differential equations (PDEs), on a spectrum of interpretability. The success of these strategies is often contingent upon the correct identification of representative equations from noisy observations of state variables and, as importantly and intertwined with that, the mathematical strategies utilized to enforce those equations. Specifically, the latter has been commonly addressed via unconstrained optimization strategies. Representing the PDE as a neural network, we propose to discover the PDE by solving a constrained optimization problem and using an intermediate state representation similar to a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The objective function of this constrained optimization problem promotes matching the data, while the constraints require that the PDE is satisfied at several spatial collocation points. We present a penalty method and a widely used trust-region barrier method to solve this constrained optimization problem, and we compare these methods on numerical examples. Our results on the Burgers' and the Korteweg-De Vreis equations demonstrate that the latter constrained method outperforms the penalty method, particularly for higher noise levels or fewer collocation points. For both methods, we solve these discovered neural network PDEs with classical methods, such as finite difference methods, as opposed to PINNs-type methods relying on automatic differentiation. We briefly highlight other small, yet crucial, implementation details.</description>

      <title>Astral: training physics-informed neural networks with error majorants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primal approach to physics-informed learning is a residual minimization. We argue that residual is, at best, an indirect measure of the error of approximate solution and propose to train with error majorant instead. Since error majorant provides a direct upper bound on error, one can reliably estimate how close PiNN is to the exact solution and stop the optimization process when the desired accuracy is reached. We call loss function associated with error majorant $\textbf{Astral}$: neur$\textbf{A}$l a po$\textbf{ST}$erio$\textbf{RI}$ function$\textbf{A}$l Loss. To compare Astral and residual loss functions, we illustrate how error majorants can be derived for various PDEs and conduct experiments with diffusion equations (including anisotropic and in the L-shaped domain), convection-diffusion equation, temporal discretization of Maxwell's equation, and magnetostatics problem. The results indicate that Astral loss is competitive to the residual loss, typically leading to faster convergence and lower error (e.g., for Maxwell's equations, we observe an order of magnitude better relative error and training time). We also report that the error estimate obtained with Astral loss is usually tight enough to be informative, e.g., for a highly anisotropic equation, on average, Astral overestimates error by a factor of $1.5$, and for convection-diffusion by a factor of $1.7$.</description>

      <title>Multiphase Flow Simulation of Blow-by and Fuel-in-Oil Dilution via the Piston Ring Pack Using the CFD Level-Set Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern diesel engines temporarily use a very late post-injection in the combustion cycle to either generate heat for a diesel particulate filter regeneration or purge a lean NOx trap. In some configurations, unburned fuel is left at the cylinder walls and is transported via the piston rings toward the lower crankcase region, where fuel may dilute the oil. Reduced oil lubrication shortens the oil service intervals and increases friction. Beside diesel fuel, this problem may also occur for other types of liquid fuels such as alcohols and e-fuels. The exact transport mechanism of the unburned fuel via the piston ring pack grooves and cylinder wall is hard to measure experimentally, motivating numerical flow simulation in early design stages for an in-depth understanding of the involved processes. A new CFD simulation methodology has been developed to investigate the transient, compressible, multiphase flow around the piston ring pack, through the gap between piston and liner, and its impact on fuel or oil transport. The modern level-set approach is used for the multiphase physics, which directly captures the sharp interface between blow-by gas and fuel or oil. Transient blow-by and two-phase flow simulations have been extensively applied to a Ford 2.0L I4 diesel test engine. The results confirm the validity of the flow compressibility assumption and highlight the sensitivity of the fuel leakage regarding piston sealing ring movement and highly resolved meshes for the multiphase flow. Based on the simulation results, design recommendations for piston and piston ring geometry are provided to reduce the fuel transport toward the crankcase.</description>

      <title>Second-order differential operators, stochastic differential equations and Brownian motions on embedded manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We specify the conditions when a manifold M embedded in an inner product space E is an invariant manifold of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) on E, linking it with the notion of second-order differential operators on M. When M is given a Riemannian metric, we derive a simple formula for the Laplace-Beltrami operator in terms of the gradient and Hessian on E and construct the Riemannian Brownian motions on M as solutions of conservative Stratonovich and Ito SDEs on E. We derive explicitly the SDE for Brownian motions on several important manifolds in applications, including left-invariant matrix Lie groups using embedded coordinates. Numerically, we propose three simulation schemes to solve SDEs on manifolds. In addition to the stochastic projection method, to simulate Riemannian Brownian motions, we construct a second-order tangent retraction of the Levi-Civita connection using a given E-tubular retraction. We also propose the retractive Euler-Maruyama method to solve a SDE, taking into account the second-order term of a tangent retraction. We provide software to implement the methods in the paper, including Brownian motions of the manifolds discussed. We verify numerically that on several compact Riemannian manifolds, the long-term limit of Brownian simulation converges to the uniform distributions, suggesting a method to sample Riemannian uniform distributions</description>

      <title>A discrete dislocation analysis of size-dependent plasticity in torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method for solving three dimensional discrete dislocation plasticity boundary-value problems using a monopole representation of the dislocations is presented. At each time step, the displacement, strain and stress fields in a finite body are obtained by superposition of infinite body dislocation fields and an image field that enforces the boundary conditions. The three dimensional infinite body fields are obtained by representing dislocations as being comprised of points, termed monopoles, that carry dislocation line and Burgers vector information. The image fields are obtained from a three dimensional linear elastic finite element calculation. The implementation of the coupling of the monopole representation with the finite element method, including the interaction of curved dislocations with free surfaces, is presented in some detail because it differs significantly from an implementation with a line based dislocation representation. Numerical convergence and the modeling of dislocation loop nucleation for large scale computations are investigated. The monopole discrete dislocation plasticity framework is used to investigate the effect of size and initial dislocation density on the torsion of wires with diameters varying over three orders of magnitude. Depending on the initial dislocation source density and the wire diameter, three regimes of torsion-twist response are obtained: (i) for wires with a sufficiently small diameter, plastic deformation is nucleation controlled and is strongly size dependent; (ii) for wires with larger diameters dislocation plasticity is dislocation interaction controlled, with the emergence of geometrically necessary dislocations and dislocation pile-ups playing a key role, and is strongly size dependent; and (iii) for wires with sufficiently large diameters plastic deformation becomes less heterogeneous and the dependence on size is greatly diminished.</description>

      <title>Solving Poisson Equations using Neural Walk-on-Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Neural Walk-on-Spheres (NWoS), a novel neural PDE solver for the efficient solution of high-dimensional Poisson equations. Leveraging stochastic representations and Walk-on-Spheres methods, we develop novel losses for neural networks based on the recursive solution of Poisson equations on spheres inside the domain. The resulting method is highly parallelizable and does not require spatial gradients for the loss. We provide a comprehensive comparison against competing methods based on PINNs, the Deep Ritz method, and (backward) stochastic differential equations. In several challenging, high-dimensional numerical examples, we demonstrate the superiority of NWoS in accuracy, speed, and computational costs. Compared to commonly used PINNs, our approach can reduce memory usage and errors by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we apply NWoS to problems in PDE-constrained optimization and molecular dynamics to show its efficiency in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Hadamard integrators for wave equations in time and frequency domain: Eulerian formulations via butterfly algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the Kirchhoff-Huygens representation and Duhamel's principle of time-domain wave equations, we propose novel butterfly-compressed Hadamard integrators for self-adjoint wave equations in both time and frequency domain in an inhomogeneous medium. First, we incorporate the leading term of Hadamard's ansatz into the Kirchhoff-Huygens representation to develop a short-time valid propagator. Second, using the Fourier transform in time, we derive the corresponding Eulerian short-time propagator in frequency domain; on top of this propagator, we further develop a time-frequency-time (TFT) method for the Cauchy problem of time-domain wave equations. Third, we further propose the time-frequency-time-frequency (TFTF) method for the corresponding point-source Helmholtz equation, which provides Green's functions of the Helmholtz equation for all angular frequencies within a given frequency band. Fourth, to implement TFT and TFTF methods efficiently, we introduce butterfly algorithms to compress oscillatory integral kernels at different frequencies. As a result, the proposed methods can construct wave field beyond caustics implicitly and advance spatially overturning waves in time naturally with quasi-optimal computational complexity and memory usage. Furthermore, once constructed the Hadamard integrators can be employed to solve both time-domain wave equations with various initial conditions and frequency-domain wave equations with different point sources. Numerical examples for two-dimensional wave equations illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive numerical method for stochastic delay differential equations (SDDEs) with a non-global Lipschitz drift term and a non-constant delay, building upon the work of Wei Fang and others. The method adapts the step size based on the growth of the drift term. Differing slightly from the conventional Euler-Maruyama format, this paper addresses the estimation of the delay term by substituting it with the numerically obtained solution closest to the left endpoint.This approach overcomes the challenge of numerical nodes not falling within the nodes after subtracting the delay. The paper proves the convergence of the numerical method for a class of non-global Lipschitz continuous SDDEs under the assumption that the step size function satisfies certain conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a test problem for Navier-Stokes solvers based on the flow around a cylinder that exhibits chaotic behavior, to examine the behavior of various numerical methods. We choose a range of Reynolds numbers for which the flow is time-dependent but can be characterized as essentially two-dimensional. The problem requires accurate resolution of chaotic dynamics over a long time interval. It also requires the use of a relatively large computational domain, part of which is curved. We review the performance of different finite element methods for the proposed range of Reynolds numbers. These tests indicate that some of the most established methods do not capture the correct behavior. The key requirements identified are pressure-robustness of the method, high resolution, and appropriate numerical dissipation when the smallest scales are under-resolved.</description>

      <title>A High-Order Hybrid-Spectral Incompressible Navier-Stokes Model For Nonlinear Water Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new high-order accurate computational fluid dynamics model based on the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a free surface for the accurate simulation of nonlinear and dispersive water waves in the time domain. The spatial discretization is based on Chebyshev polynomials in the vertical direction and a Fourier basis in the horizontal direction, allowing for the use of the fast Chebyshev and Fourier transforms for the efficient computation of spatial derivatives. The temporal discretization is done through a generalized low-storage explicit 4th order Runge-Kutta, and for the scheme to conserve mass and achieve high-order accuracy, a velocity-pressure coupling needs to be satisfied at all Runge-Kutta stages. This result in the emergence of a Poisson pressure problem that constitute a geometric conservation law for mass conservation. The occurring Poisson problem is proposed to be solved efficiently via an accelerated iterative solver based on a geometric $p$-multigrid scheme, which takes advantage of the high-order polynomial basis in the spatial discretization and hence distinguishes itself from conventional low-order numerical schemes. We present numerical experiments for validation of the scheme in the context of numerical wave tanks demonstrating that the $p$-multigrid accelerated numerical scheme can effectively solve the Poisson problem that constitute the computational bottleneck, that the model can achieve the desired spectral convergence, and is capable of simulating wave-propagation over non-flat bottoms with excellent agreement in comparison to experimental results.</description>

Abstract: We present an algorithm which uses Fujiwara's inequality to bound algebraic functions over ellipses of a certain type, allowing us to concretely implement a rigorous Gauss-Legendre integration method for algebraic functions over a line segment. We consider path splitting strategies to improve convergence of the method and show that these yield significant practical and asymptotic benefits. We implemented these methods to compute period matrices of algebraic Riemann surfaces and these are available in SageMath.</description>

      <title>The alternating simultaneous Halpern-Lions-Wittmann-Bauschke algorithm for finding the best approximation pair for two disjoint intersections of convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two nonempty and disjoint intersections of closed and convex subsets, we look for a best approximation pair relative to them, i.e., a pair of points, one in each intersection, attaining the minimum distance between the disjoint intersections. We propose an iterative process based on projections onto the subsets which generate the intersections. The process is inspired by the Halpern-Lions-Wittmann-Bauschke algorithm and the classical alternating process of Cheney and Goldstein, and its advantage is that there is no need to project onto the intersections themselves, a task which can be rather demanding. We prove that under certain conditions the two interlaced subsequences converge to a best approximation pair. These conditions hold, in particular, when the space is Euclidean and the subsets which generate the intersections are compact and strictly convex. Our result extends the one of Aharoni, Censor and Jiang ["Finding a best approximation pair of points for two polyhedra'', Computational Optimization and Applications 71 (2018), 509--523] who considered the case of finite-dimensional polyhedra.</description>

      <title>Error Feedback Can Accurately Compress Preconditioners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06098v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging second-order information about the loss at the scale of deep networks is one of the main lines of approach for improving the performance of current optimizers for deep learning. Yet, existing approaches for accurate full-matrix preconditioning, such as Full-Matrix Adagrad (GGT) or Matrix-Free Approximate Curvature (M-FAC) suffer from massive storage costs when applied even to small-scale models, as they must store a sliding window of gradients, whose memory requirements are multiplicative in the model dimension. In this paper, we address this issue via a novel and efficient error-feedback technique that can be applied to compress preconditioners by up to two orders of magnitude in practice, without loss of convergence. Specifically, our approach compresses the gradient information via sparsification or low-rank compression \emph{before} it is fed into the preconditioner, feeding the compression error back into future iterations. Experiments on deep neural networks show that this approach can compress full-matrix preconditioners to up to 99\% sparsity without accuracy loss, effectively removing the memory overhead of full-matrix preconditioners such as GGT and M-FAC. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/IST-DASLab/EFCP}.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Power of Neural Operators with Automatically Encoded Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) have emerged as effective tools for modeling complex physical systems in scientific machine learning. In NOs, a central characteristic is to learn the governing physical laws directly from data. In contrast to other machine learning applications, partial knowledge is often known a priori about the physical system at hand whereby quantities such as mass, energy and momentum are exactly conserved. Currently, NOs have to learn these conservation laws from data and can only approximately satisfy them due to finite training data and random noise. In this work, we introduce conservation law-encoded neural operators (clawNOs), a suite of NOs that endow inference with automatic satisfaction of such conservation laws. ClawNOs are built with a divergence-free prediction of the solution field, with which the continuity equation is automatically guaranteed. As a consequence, clawNOs are compliant with the most fundamental and ubiquitous conservation laws essential for correct physical consistency. As demonstrations, we consider a wide variety of scientific applications ranging from constitutive modeling of material deformation, incompressible fluid dynamics, to atmospheric simulation. ClawNOs significantly outperform the state-of-the-art NOs in learning efficacy, especially in small-data regimes.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Preconditioned LoRA for Fine-Tuning Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) emerges as a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, which proposes to freeze pretrained model weights and update an additive low-rank trainable matrix. In this work, we study the enhancement of LoRA training by introducing an $r \times r$ preconditioner in each gradient step where $r$ is the LoRA rank. We theoretically verify that the proposed preconditioner stabilizes feature learning with LoRA under infinite-width NN setting. Empirically, the implementation of this new preconditioner requires a small change to existing optimizer code and creates virtually minuscule storage and runtime overhead. Our experimental results with both large language models and text-to-image diffusion models show that with this new preconditioner, the convergence and reliability of SGD and AdamW can be significantly enhanced. Moreover, the training process becomes much more robust to hyperparameter choices such as learning rate. The new preconditioner can be derived from a novel Riemannian metric in low-rank matrix field. Code can be accessed at https://github.com/pilancilab/Riemannian_Preconditioned_LoRA.</description>
