      <title>Unified Approach for Hedging Impermanent Loss of Liquidity Provision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop static and dynamic approaches for hedging of the impermanent loss (IL) of liquidity provision (LP) staked at Decentralised Exchanges (DEXes) which employ Uniswap V2 and V3 protocols. We provide detailed definitions and formulas for computing the IL to unify different definitions occurring in the existing literature. We show that the IL can be seen a contingent claim with a non-linear payoff for a fixed maturity date. Thus, we introduce the contingent claim termed as IL protection claim which delivers the negative of IL payoff at the maturity date. We apply arbitrage-based methods for valuation and risk management of this claim. First, we develop the static model-independent replication method for the valuation of IL protection claim using traded European vanilla call and put options. We extend and generalize an existing method to show that the IL protection claim can be hedged perfectly with options if there is a liquid options market. Second, we develop the dynamic model-based approach for the valuation and hedging of IL protection claims under a risk-neutral measure. We derive analytic valuation formulas using a wide class of price dynamics for which the characteristic function is available under the risk-neutral measure. As base cases, we derive analytic valuation formulas for IL protection claim under the Black-Scholes-Merton model and the log-normal stochastic volatility model. We finally discuss estimation of risk-reward of LP staking using our results.</description>

      <title>Decentralised Finance and Automated Market Making: Execution and Speculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated market makers (AMMs) are a new prototype of decentralised exchanges which are revolutionising market interactions. The majority of AMMs are constant product markets (CPMs) where exchange rates are set by a trading function. This work studies optimal trading and statistical arbitrage in CPMs where balancing exchange rate risk and execution costs is key. Empirical evidence shows that execution costs are accurately estimated by the convexity of the trading function. These convexity costs are linear in the trade size and are nonlinear in the depth of liquidity and in the exchange rate. We develop models for when exchange rates form in a competing centralised exchange, in a CPM, or in both venues. Finally, we derive computationally efficient strategies that account for stochastic convexity costs and we showcase their out-of-sample performance.</description>
