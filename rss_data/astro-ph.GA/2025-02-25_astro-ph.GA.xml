      <title>EMBER-2: Emulating baryons from dark matter across cosmic time with deep modulation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy formation is a complex problem that connects large scale cosmology with small scale astrophysics over cosmic timescales. Hydrodynamical simulations are the most principled approach to model galaxy formation, but have large computational costs. Recently, emulation techniques based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proposed to predict baryonic properties directly from dark matter simulations. The advantage of these emulators is their ability to capture relevant correlations, but at a fraction of the computational cost compared to simulations. However, training basic CNNs over large redshift ranges is challenging, due to the increasing non-linear interplay between dark matter and baryons paired with the memory inefficiency of CNNs. This work introduces EMBER-2, an improved version of the EMBER (EMulating Baryonic EnRichment) framework, to simultaneously emulate multiple baryon channels including gas density, velocity, temperature and HI density over a large redshift range, from z=6 to z=0. EMBER-2 incorporates a context-based styling network paired with Modulated Convolutions for fast, accurate and memory efficient emulation capable of interpolating the entire redshift range with a single CNN. Although EMBER-2 uses fewer than 1/6 the number of trainable parameters than the previous version, the model improves in every tested summary metric including gas mass conservation and cross-correlation coefficients. The EMBER-2 framework builds the foundation to produce mock catalogues of field level data and derived summary statistics that can directly be incorporated in future analysis pipelines.

      <title>Addressing the core-cusp and diversity problem of dwarf and disk galaxies using cold collisionless DARKexp theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observed dwarf galaxies tend to have linearly rising rotation curves, which indicate flat density cores in their centers. Furthermore, disk galaxies show a wide range of rotation curves shapes. High resolution simulations of cold collisionless dark matter do not reproduce flat central profiles, or the observed diversity of rotation curve shapes; even hydrodynamic simulations incorporating baryonic feedback cannot do that robustly. However, numerical simulations are not the only way to make predictions about density profiles of equilibrium dark matter halos. A theoretical model based on statistical mechanics shows that maximum entropy solutions for cold collisionless self-gravitating dark matter halos can have a range of inner density profiles, including flat density cores. These theoretical profiles, called DARKexp, have only one shape parameter, and are able to fit the observed rotation curves of galaxies with last measured velocities in the range ~20-200 km/s. Here we present fits to 96 SPARC catalog galaxies, and the Milky Way. DARKexp also provides good fits to the projected stellar density distributions of ultrafaint dwarfs that show cores, suggesting that the dark matter halo hosts could have flat density cores. Thus, DARKexp appears to be able to address the core-cusp problem and the diversity of rotation curves with cold collisionless dark matter alone, without baryonic feedback.</description>

      <title>Chemistry and ro-vibrational excitation of HeH$^+$ in the Planetary Nebula NGC 7027</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HeH$^+$ belongs to the class of "reactive" ions that can be destroyed so quickly that chemical formation and destruction rates may compete with inelastic rates and should be considered when solving the statistical equilibrium equations. This so-called chemical "pumping" or "excitation" effect is investigated here for the first time in HeH$^+$. The chemical evolution of HeH$^+$ in NGC 7027 is modeled with the CLOUDY photoionization code using updated reaction rate coefficients. The non-LTE analysis of the three observed HeH$^+$ emission lines is then performed with the CLOUDY and RADEX codes using an extensive set of spectroscopic and inelastic collisional data suitable for the specific high-temperature environment of NGC 7027. In a second approach, chemical formation and destruction rates of HeH$^+$ are implemented in RADEX. This code is combined with MCMC sampling (performed on the RADEX-parameters space) to extract the best-fit HeH$^+$ column density and physical conditions from the observed line fluxes. The CLOUDY and RADEX non-LTE results are found to be in good agreement, and the $\upsilon=1-0 \ P(2)/P(1)$ line ratio is better than 20%. Agreement to better than a factor of 2.3 is obtained when including the reaction between He($2^3S$) and H as an additional source of HeH$^+$. The RADEX/MCMC model with chemical pumping is found to reproduce both the observed line fluxes and the line ratio to 20%. Our results suggest that additional HeH$^+$ lines must be detected in NGC 7027 to better constrain the physical conditions via non-LTE models. Uncertainties in collisional (reactive and inelastic) data of HeH$^+$ have been largely reduced in this work. The three observed lines are not sensitive to chemical pumping while excited "short-lived" levels are significantly overpopulated with respect to a non-LTE model neglecting chemical excitation.</description>

      <title>Application of resolved low-J multi-CO line modeling with RADEX to constrain the molecular gas properties in the starburst M82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution and physical conditions of molecular gas are closely linked to star formation and the subsequent evolution of galaxies. Emission from carbon monoxide (CO) and its isotopologues traces the bulk of molecular gas and provides constraints on the physical conditions through their line ratios. However, comprehensive understanding on how the particular choice of line modeling approach impacts derived molecular properties remain incomplete. Here, we study the nearby starburst galaxy M82, known for its intense star formation and molecular emission, using the large set of available multi-CO line observations. We present high-resolution (${\sim}85$ pc) emission of seven CO isotopologue lines, including $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O from the $J = 1-0$, $2-1$ and $3-2$ transitions. Using \texttt{RADEX} for radiative transfer modeling, we analyze M82\textsc{\char39}s molecular properties with (i) a one-zone model and (ii) a variable density model, comparing observed and simulated emissions via a minimum $\chi^2$ analysis. We find that inferred gas conditions -- kinetic temperature and density -- are consistent across models, with minimal statistical differences. However, due to their low critical densities (${&lt;}10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$), low-$J$ CO isotopologue lines do not effectively probe higher density gas prevalent in starburst environments like that of M82. Our results further imply that this limitation extends to high-redshift ($z{\gtrapprox}1$) galaxies with similar conditions, where low-$J$ CO lines are inadequate for density constraints. Future studies of extreme star-forming regions like M82 will require higher-$J$ CO lines or alternative molecular tracers with higher critical densities.</description>

      <title>TDCOSMO XIX: Measuring stellar velocity dispersion with sub-percent accuracy for cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) of massive elliptical galaxies is a key ingredient to breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy and obtaining precise and accurate cosmography from gravitational time delays. The relative uncertainty on the Hubble constant H$_0$ is double the relative error on $\sigma$. Therefore, time-delay cosmography imposes much more demanding requirements on the precision and accuracy of $\sigma$ than galaxy studies. While precision can be achieved with an adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), accuracy depends critically on factors such as elemental abundances and temperature of stellar templates, flux calibration, and wavelength ranges. We carry out a detailed study of the problem using multiple sets of galaxy spectra of massive elliptical galaxies with SNR$\sim$30-160 \AA$^{-1}$, and state-of-the-art empirical and semi-empirical stellar libraries and stellar population synthesis templates. We show that the choice of stellar library is generally the dominant source of residual systematic error. We propose a general recipe to mitigate and account for residual uncertainties. We show that sub-percent accuracy can be achieved on individual spectra with our data quality. Covariance between velocity dispersions measured for a sample of spectra can also be reduced to sub-percent levels. We recommend this recipe for all applications that require high precision and accurate stellar kinematics, and make all software publicly available to facilitate its implementation. This recipe will be used in future TDCOSMO collaboration papers.</description>

      <title>Multiple stellar populations at less evolved stages. IV. evidence of helium enrichments in four Magellanic globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most globular clusters in the local group show multiple stellar populations, a pattern defined by variations of several light elements, with some also displaying dispersions in heavy elements. Since helium is the most immediate product of hydrogen burning, almost all models suggest that second-generation stars should show different levels of helium enrichment than first-generation stars. Therefore, investigating helium enrichment in stellar populations of globular clusters can constrain different theoretical models. Using the deep photometry carried out by the {\sl Hubble} Space Telescope, we have analyzed the morphologies of the main sequences of four Large Magellanic Cloud globular clusters, Hodge 11, NGC 1841, NGC 2210, and NGC 2257. We aim to constrain the helium distributions among their main sequence stars. We found a clear broadening of main sequences in all four clusters. After excluding the effects of photometric errors, differential reddening, unresolved binaries, and metallicity dispersions, this broadening would suggest a substantial helium enrichment in their star populations, ranging from $\delta{Y}=0.08$ to $\delta{Y}\geq0.12$, depending on the presumed helium distributions. Helium-enriched stars are comparable in number to normal stars within these clusters, and may even dominate, comprising approximately $\sim$40\% to over 80\% of the total stellar population. However, given the great distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud, it is difficult to rule out the significant impact of crowding, so our results may only represent an upper limit.</description>

      <title>Star formation in low brightness galaxies and in the extended gaseous disks of normal galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the available observational data on the radial distribution of gas and young stellar populations in the disks of low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies and in the outer regions or the extended disks of normal brightness (HSB) galaxies. These cases involve star formation under special conditions of low volume and surface gas density. There is no well-defined boundary between these subgroups of galaxies that we consider, but in non-dwarf LSB galaxies the rate of current star formation within the wide range of radial distances appears to be higher compared to the outer disks of most of HSB galaxies at similar values of the surface gas density. The factors that could stimulate the compression of the rarefied gas at the periphery of galaxies are briefly discussed. Attention is drawn to the idea that the densities of LSB disks estimated from their brightness may be underestimated.</description>

      <title>On unveiling Buried Nuclei with JWST: a technique for hunting the most obscured galaxy nuclei from local to high redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze JWST NIRSpec+MIRI/MRS observations of the infrared (IR) Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) features in the central regions ($\sim$0.26'' at 6 micron; $\sim$50-440 pc depending on the source) of local luminous IR galaxies. In this work, we examine the effect of nuclear obscuration on the PAH features of deeply obscured nuclei, predominantly found in local luminous IR galaxies, and we compare these nuclei with ``normal'' star-forming regions. We extend previous work to include shorter wavelength PAH ratios now available with the NIRSpec+MIRI/MRS spectral range. We introduce a new diagnostic diagram for selecting deeply obscured nuclei based on the 3.3 and 6.2 micron PAH features and/or mid-IR continuum ratios at $\sim$3 and 5 micron. We find that the PAH equivalent width (EW) ratio of the brightest PAH features at shorter wavelengths (at 3.3 and 6.2 micron) is impacted by nuclear obscuration. Although the sample of luminous IR galaxies used in this analysis is relatively small, we find that sources exhibiting a high silicate absorption feature cluster tightly in a specific region of the diagram, whereas star-forming regions experiencing lower extinction levels occupy a different area in the diagram. This demonstrates the potential of this technique to identify buried nuclei. To leverage the excellent sensitivity of the MIRI imager onboard JWST, we extend our method of identifying deeply obscured nuclei at higher redshifts using a selection of MIRI filters. Specifically, the combination of various MIRI JWST filters enables the identification of buried sources beyond the local Universe and up to z$\sim$3, where other commonly used obscuration tracers such as the 9.7 micron silicate band, are out of the spectral range of MRS. Our results pave the way for identifying distant deeply obscured nuclei with JWST.</description>

      <title>On the maximal velocity of colliding galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current galaxy formation paradigm, collisions play a crucial role. A fraction of galaxy collisions results in flyby events, and a galaxy that has passed through another galaxy is called a backsplash galaxy. Such flyby events are of particular interest for explaining the quenching of isolated galaxies. One signature of backsplash galaxies is that they have high velocities relative to their environment, since they do not move in the same flow as surrounding galaxies. This feature can be studied in simulations, but it is also useful to have a theory that can predict the velocities of backsplash galaxies. In this paper, we develop such a theory based on the Zel'dovich approximation and use it to determine the maximal expected velocity of a backsplash galaxy in a given volume.</description>

      <title>The Solar System's passage through the Radcliffe wave during the middle Miocene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. As the Solar System orbits the Milky Way, it encounters various Galactic environments, including dense regions of the interstellar medium (ISM). These encounters can compress the heliosphere, exposing parts of the Solar System to the ISM, while also increasing the influx of interstellar dust into the Solar System and Earth's atmosphere. The discovery of new Galactic structures, such as the Radcliffe wave, raises the question of whether the Sun has encountered any of them. Aims. The present study investigates the potential passage of the Solar System through the Radcliffe wave gas structure over the past 30 million years (Myr). Methods. We used a sample of 56 high-quality, young ($\leq$ 30 Myr) open clusters associated with a region of interest of the Radcliffe wave to trace its motion back and investigate a potential crossing with the Solar System's past orbit. Results. We find that the Solar System's trajectory intersected the Radcliffe wave in the Orion region. We have constrained the timing of this event to between 18.2 and 11.5 Myr ago, with the closest approach occurring between 14.8 and 12.4 Myr ago. Notably, this period coincides with the Middle Miocene climate transition on Earth, providing an interdisciplinary link with paleoclimatology. The potential impact of the crossing of the Radcliffe wave on the climate on Earth is estimated. This crossing could also lead to anomalies in radionuclide abundances, which is an important research topic in the field of geology and nuclear astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Dense Cores in IRDC G14.225-0.506 revealed by ALMA Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense cores in massive, parsec-scale molecular clumps are sites that harbor protocluster formation. We present results from observations towards a hub-filament structure of a massive Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G14.225-0.506 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The dense cores are revealed by the 1.3 mm dust continuum emission at an angular resolution of $\sim$ 1.5'' and are identified through the hierarchical Dendrogram technique. Combining with the N$_2$D$^+$ 3-2 spectral line emission and gas temperatures derived from a previous NH$_3$ study, we analyze the thermodynamic properties of the dense cores. The results show transonic and supersonic-dominated turbulent motions. There is an inverse correlation between the virial parameter and the column density, which implies that denser regions may undergo stronger gravitational collapse. Molecular outflows are identified in the CO 2-1 and SiO 5-4 emission, indicating active protostellar activities in some cores. Besides these star formation signatures revealed by molecular outflows in the dense cores, previous studies in the infrared, X-ray, and radio wavelengths also found a rich and wide-spread population of young stellar objects (YSOs), showing active star formation both inside and outside of the dense cloud.</description>

Neutron-capture element abundances are especially interesting. In particular, $s$-process elements can provide a third chemical clock for resolving star formation histories in addition to core collapse and Type Ia supernovae. Likewise, the primary sites of the $r$-process are still areas of extensive research. Until now, the number of stars with neutron-capture element abundances in dSphs has been limited by the need for stars bright enough for high-resolution spectroscopy. We present abundance measurements of the neutron-capture elements Sr, Y, Ba, and Eu with errors $&lt;$ 0.4 dex - as well as new measurements of Mg - in 491 stars in Sculptor, Fornax, Draco, Sextans, and Ursa Minor. The large number of stars in our sample is possible because we used medium-resolution spectra from the DEIMOS spectrograph, assembling the largest homogeneous set of neutron-capture abundances in dwarf spheroidal galaxies to date. By utilizing the abundances of both $s$- and $r$-process elements, we find evidence of an $s$-process contribution at early times in Sculptor from our measurements of [Ba/Fe]. This is a potential signature of $s$-process nucleosynthesis in fast-rotating massive stars. By comparing our measurements of [Eu/Fe] with [Mg/Fe], we show the need for an $r$-process source that has a short delay time to enrich stars in the dSphs. Thus, neutron star mergers are likely not the sole source of $r$-process material in dSphs.</description>

      <title>Galaxy mergers classification using CNNs trained on S\'ersic models, residuals and raw images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers are crucial for understanding galaxy evolution, and with large upcoming datasets, automated methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are needed for efficient detection. It is understood that these networks work by identifying deviations from the regular, expected shapes of galaxies, which are indicative of a merger event. Using images from the IllustrisTNG simulations, we aim to check the importance of faint features, source position and shape information present in galaxy merger images on the performance of a CNN merger vs. non-merger classifier. We fit S\'ersic profiles to each galaxy in mock images from the IllustrisTNG simulations. We subtract the profiles from the original images to create residual images, and we train three identical CNNs on three different datasets -- original images (CNN1), model images (CNN2), and residual images (CNN3). We found that it is possible to conduct galaxy merger classification based only on faint features, source position and shape information present in residual images and model images, respectively. The results show that the CNN1 correctly classifies 74% of images, while CNN2 70%, and CNN3 68%. Source position and shape information is crucial for pre-merger classification, while residual features are important for post-merger classification. CNN3 classifies post-mergers in the latest merger stage the best out of all three classifiers.</description>

      <title>Merging of spiral galaxies: observations and modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the dynamics of multi-component models of spiral galaxies at various stages of grand merging. Numerical models include a self-consistent account of the dynamics of collisionless stellar subsystems and N-body dark matter, as well as gaseous components. Calculation of gas heating and cooling processes allows us to consider a wide temperature range from 80 to 100 thousand degrees. Using the Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics method to solve hydrodynamic equations makes it possible to track the evolution of the gas of each galaxy, calculating the content of gas components of each object in the process of complex interchange of matter. The gravitational interaction is determined in a direct way by summing the contributions according to Newton's law, which minimizes the modeling error. This requires significant computing resources using graphics accelerators on hybrid computing platform CPU + multi-GPUs. The study aims to reconcile theoretical models with the morphology and kinematics of a number of observed systems. In particular, Taffy-type objects are considered, where two galaxies are connected by a gas bridge with a characteristic small-scale gas structure after the disks pass through each other in an approximately flat orientation. Examples of such systems are the observed pairs of galaxies UGC 12914/UGC 12915, NGC 4490/NGC 4485, UGC813/UGC816 etc.</description>

      <title>The MAGPI Survey: the kinematic morphology-density relation (or lack thereof) and the Hubble sequence at $z\sim0.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents visual morphological and dynamical classifications for 637 spatially resolved galaxies, most of which are at intermediate redshift ($z\sim0.3$), in the Middle-Ages Galaxy Properties with Integral field spectroscopy (MAGPI) Survey. For each galaxy, we obtain a minimum of 11 independent visual classifications by knowledgeable classifiers. We use an extension of the standard Dawid-Skene bayesian model introducing classifier-specific confidence parameters and galaxy-specific difficulty parameters to quantify classifier confidence and infer reliable statistical confidence estimates. Selecting sub-samples of 86 bright ($r&lt;20$ mag) high-confidence ($&gt;0.98$) morphological classifications at redshifts ($0.2 \le z \le0.4$), we confirm the full range of morphological types is represented in MAGPI as intended in the survey design. Similarly, with a sub-sample of 82 bright high-confidence stellar kinematic classifications, we find that the rotating and non-rotating galaxies seen at low redshift are already in place at intermediate redshifts. We \textit{do not} find evidence that the kinematic morphology-density relation seen at $z\sim0$ is established at $z\sim0.3$. We suggest that galaxies without obvious stellar rotation are dynamically pre-processed sometime before $z\sim0.3$ within lower mass groups before joining denser environments.</description>

      <title>No Galaxy-Scale [CII] Fast Outflow in the z=6.72 Red Quasar HSC J1205$-$0000</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HSC 120505.09-000027.9 (J1205$-$0000) is one of the highest redshift ($z=6.72$) dust-reddened quasars (red quasars) known to date. We present an improved analysis of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array data of the [CII] $158\ \rm{\mu m}$ line and the underlying rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) continuum emission, previously reported in Izumi et al. (2021a), toward J1205$-$0000. Red quasars are thought to be a transitional phase from an obscured starburst to a luminous blue quasar, in some cases associated with massive outflows driven by the active galactic nucleus (AGN). J1205$-$0000 has a high FIR luminosity, $L_{\mathrm{FIR}}=2.5\times 10^{12}\ L_{\odot}$ and a total IR luminosity of $L_{\mathrm{TIR}}=3.5\times 10^{12}\ L_{\odot}$, corresponding to a star formation rate (SFR) of $\sim 528\ M_{\odot}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. With the [CII]-based dynamical mass of $\sim 1 \times 10^{11}~M_\odot$, we conclude that J1205$-$0000 is hosted by a starburst galaxy. In contradiction to Izumi et al. (2021a), our improved analysis shows no hint of a broad component in the [CII] line spectrum. Thus there is no evidence for a host galaxy-scale fast [CII] outflow, despite the fact that J1205$-$0000 has fast nuclear ionized outflows seen in the rest-frame UV. We explore several scenarios for this discrepancy (e.g., early phase of AGN feedback, reliability of the [CII] line as a tracer of outflows), and we claim that it is still too early to conclude that there is no significant negative AGN feedback on star formation in this red quasar.</description>

      <title>FEASTS Combined with Interferometry (IV): Mapping HI Emission to a limit of $N_{\text{HI}}=10^{17.7} \text{cm}^{-2}$ in Seven Edge-on Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistical study of the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) gas extending into the circumgalactic medium perpendicular to the disk for 7 edge-on galaxies with inclinations above $85^{\circ}$ from the FEASTS program with a $3\sigma$ ($20\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$) column density ($N_{\text{HI}}$) depth of $5\times10^{17} \text{cm}^{-2}$. We develop two photometric methods to separate the extraplanar HI from the disk component, based on existing interferometric data and parametric modeling of the disk flux distribution respectively. With both methods, the FEASTS data exhibit clear extended wings beyond the disk along the minor axis. The extraplanar HI accounts for 5% to 20% of the total HI mass and extends to $20\text{-}50$ kpc at $N_{\text{HI}}=10^{18} \text{cm}^{-2}$. We find a tight positive correlation between vertical extensions of the extraplanar HI and total HI mass $M_\text{HI}$. The iso-density shape of HI at $N_{\text{HI}}=10^{18} \text{cm}^{-2}$ has an average axis ratio of $0.56\pm0.11$. The off-disk $N_{\text{HI}}$ profiles of these edge-on galaxies well represent the lower envelop of previous Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption measurements at low-redshift. Our results suggest that at $N_{\text{HI}}=5\times10^{17} \text{cm}^{-2}$, the HI extends considerably further than the known thin and thick disks in the vertical direction, but still remains much flattener than a spherical distribution, consistent with theoretical expectations that outflow, circulation, and accretion should have different impacts in these two directions. We show the tension of our results with Illustris and TNG predictions, highlighting the constraining power of our results for future simulations.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic shape variation of quiescent galaxies from redshift 2.5 to 0.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the standard inside-out galaxy formation scenario, galaxies first form a dense core and then gradually assemble their outskirts. This implies that galaxies with similar central stellar mass densities might have evolutionary links. We use the UVJ color-color diagram to select quiescent galaxies in the redshift interval from 0.5 to 2.5 and classify them into different subsamples based on their central stellar mass densities, stellar mass, morphological type and redshift. We then infer the intrinsic axis ratios $\mu_{B/A}$ and $\mu_{C/A}$ of different subsamples based on the apparent axis ratio $q$ distributions, where A, B, and C refers to, respectively, the major, intermediate and minor axis of a triaxial ellipsoidal model. We find that 1) massive quiescent galaxies have typical intrinsic shapes similarly close to thick oblate structures, with $\mu_{B/A} \gtrsim 0.9$, regardless of stellar mass, redshift, or central stellar mass densities, and 2) galaxies at higher redshift are systematically thinner than their lower-redshift counterparts, and 3) when splitting the sample into early type and late type with Sersic indices, ETGs at higher redshift are slightly more prolate (smaller average $\mu_{B/A}$) than those at lower redshift. Minor mergers of galaxies may have played important roles in the structural evolution of quiescent galaxies found in this work.</description>

      <title>The extreme starburst J1044+0353 blows kpc-scale bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a kpc-scale lacy filamentary structure in low surface-brightness H$\alpha$ and [OIII]$\lambda5007$ emission around the low-redshift, extremely metal-poor, and compact reionisation-era analogue SDSS J1044+0535. We identify seven elliptical arcs in H$\alpha$ emission at $\mathrm{SB}_\mathrm{H\alpha} \sim 1 - 2 \times 10^{-18}$erg\,s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$arcsec$^{-2}$. These arcs extent 6-9 kpc outwards from the star-forming complexes. We interpret these features as limb-brightened giant-shells that bound egg-shaped kpc-scale bubbles. These shells are five to eight times larger than the known giant-shells around nearby star-forming dwarfs. Kinematic maps reveal a gradient perpendicular to the major-axis and line broadening in the outskirts. The latter, when interpreted due to line-splitting of the expanding shells, provides an estimate of the kinetic energy of the bubbles that can be well reconciled with them being blown by the mass dominating 15-20 Myr old stellar population.</description>

      <title>Where are the earliest stars relics in the simulated Milky Way analogues?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using 6 Milky Way analogues with two different numerical resolutions from the Auriga simulation, we investigate the total mass, spatial distribution and kinematics of the earliest stars relics in the Milky Way at $z=0$. These relics (second generation stars) formed over a wide redshift range, from about $z=22$ to $z=4$, with an average formation redshift of $z \sim 10.0$, and comprise about $2\times10^{-5}$ of the entire galactic stellar population. The disk and bulge components host only a small fraction of these relics, contributing less than $12$ percent in total. The stellar halo, in particular the outer stellar halo of which galactic radius $r&gt;30$ kpc, hosts the largest fraction (about 46 percent on average), with an average of one relic star for per $4,000$ to $10,000$ stars, making it a promising region for observational searches. Additionally, around $18$ percent of the earliest stars relics are found in satellite galaxies, with smaller and older satellite galaxies tending to contain a higher proportion of these stars. Thus, low-mass and early-formed satellite galaxies are also ideal targets for finding such relics, although some satellite galaxies may lack them entirely. The spatial distribution and kinematics of these stars show good numerical convergence across different simulation resolutions. Our results provide valuable guidance for searches of the earliest stars relics and offer insights for interpreting findings from ongoing and future stellar archaeology surveys.</description>

      <title>The Starburst Acceleration of High-Velocity Clouds in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-velocity clouds (HVCs) in the Galactic center have garnered significant attention due to their mysterious formation, potentially linked to starburst events or supermassive black hole activity in the region. However, it remains challenging to explain the observed column density and velocity distribution of HVCs. The discovery of high-velocity molecular clouds (HVMCs), which are denser and more massive, adds to this complexity. To address this, we conduct three-dimensional numerical simulations to explore the origin and magneto-hydrodynamic evolution of HVCs in the context of a starburst in the Galactic center. By incorporating magnetic fields and an initial tangential velocity for the clouds, our simulation results align with the observed properties of HVCs, supporting the notion that these clouds can originate from a starburst process. In addition, ~5% of the total mass of initial clouds can survive after 3.5 Myr, as a result, the following star formation will be more efficient than a feedback process that destroys all cool clouds.</description>

      <title>Multiple stellar populations in MOCCA globular cluster models: Transient spatial over-concentration of pristine red giant stars driven by strong dynamical encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Leitinger et al. (2023) and Cadelano et al (2024}) have shown that, in some Milky Way globular clusters (GCs), pristine red giant branch (RGB) stars are more centrally concentrated than enriched RGB stars. This contradicts most multiple-population formation scenarios, which predict that the enriched population 2p should initially be more concentrated than the pristine population 1P. We analyze a MOCCA GC model that exhibits a higher spatial concentration of 1P RGB stars than 2P RGB stars at 13 Gyr. The MOCCA models assume the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) pollution scenario, where 2P stars are initially more concentrated than 1P stars. Our results indicate that the observed spatial distributions of multiple populations, and possibly their kinematics, are significantly shaped by dynamical interactions. These interactions preferentially eject 2P RGB progenitors from the central regions, leading to a transient over-concentration of 1P RGB stars at late times. This effect is particularly relevant for GCs with present-day of a few $10^5 M_{\odot}$, which have retained only about 10 - 20 percent of their initial mass. Such clusters may appear dynamically young due to heating from a black hole subsystem, even if they have undergone significant mass loss and dynamical evolution. Additionally, the relatively small number of RGB stars in these clusters suggests that interpreting the spatial distributions of multiple populations solely from RGB stars may lead to biased conclusions about the overall distribution of 2P and 1P. The apparent over-concentration of the 1P relative to the 2P is likely a transient effect driven by the preferential removal of 2P RGB progenitors via strong dynamical encounters. MOCCA models of multiple stellar populations based on the AGB scenario may explain anomalous features observed in some Galactic GCs, such as NGC 3201 and NGC 6101.</description>

      <title>Double progenitor origin of the S-star cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the cluster of S-stars located in the Galactic Centre is tied to the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, but exactly how is still debated. In this paper, we investigate whether the Hills mechanism can simultaneously reproduce both the S-star cluster's properties and the observed number of hypervelocity stars. To do so, we forward-model the capture and disruption of binary stars originating from the nuclear star cluster (NSC) and the clockwise disk (CWD). We find that the ratio of evolved to main-sequence S-stars is highly sensitive to the origin of the binaries, and that neither the injection of binaries from the CWD nor from the NSC exclusively can reproduce all observations. However, when considering the injection of binaries from both locations, we are able to reproduce all the observations simultaneously, including the number of observed hypervelocity stars, the evolutionary stage of the S-stars, their luminosity function and the distribution of their semi-major axes. The implications of our findings include that ~90% of hypervelocity stars ejected over the past ~10 Myr should originate from the CWD, that the main-sequence S-stars originated in the CWD, and that the evolved S-stars originated in an old stellar population such as the NSC.</description>

      <title>A Virgo Environmental Survey Tracing Ionised Gas Emission (VESTIGE) XVII. Statistical properties of individual HII regions in unperturbed systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Virgo Environmental Survey Tracing Ionised Gas Emission (VESTIGE) is a blind narrow-band Halpha+[NII] imaging survey of the Virgo cluster carried out with MegaCam at the CFHT telescope. The survey provides deep narrow-band images for 385 galaxies hosting star forming HII regions. We identify individual HII regions and measure their main physical properties such as Halpha luminosity, equivalent diameter, and electron density with the purpose of deriving standard relations as reference for future local and high-z studies of HII regions in star forming systems in different environments. For this purpose we use a complete sample of ~ 13.000 HII regions of luminosity L(Halpha)&gt;= 10^37 erg s^-1 to derive the main statistical properties of HII regions in unperturbed systems, identified as those galaxies with a normal HI gas content (64 objects). These are the composite Halpha luminosity function, equivalent diameter and electron density distribution, and luminosity-size relation. We also derive the main scaling relations between several parameters representative of the HII regions properties (total number, luminosity of the first ranked regions, fraction of the diffuse component, best fit parameters of the Schechter luminosity function measured for individual galaxies) and those characterising the properties of the host galaxies (stellar mass, star formation rate and specific star formation rate, stellar mass and star formation rate surface density, metallicity, molecular-to-atomic gas ratio, total gas-to-dust mass ratio). We briefly discuss the results of this analysis and their implications in the study of the star formation process in galaxy discs.</description>

      <title>A Pristine-UNIONS view on the Galaxy: Kinematics of the distant spur feature of the Sagittarius stream traced by Blue Horizontal Branch stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing a detailed picture of the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream offers important constraints on the build-up of the Galactic halo as well as its gravitational potential at large radii. While several attempts have been made to model the structure of the Sgr stream, no model has yet been able to match all the features observed for the stream. Moreover, for several of these features, observational characterisation of their properties is rather limited, particularly at large distances. The aim of this work is to investigate the kinematics of the Sgr stream outermost spur feature using blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars. Candidate BHB stars were selected by combining two approaches; one capitalising on Pan-STARRS1 3$\Pi$ griz and u photometry taken as part of UNIONS, the other using Pristine Survey CaHK and SDSS ugr photometry. Follow-up optical spectra are obtained using ESO/VLT/FORS2 to confirm their BHB nature and obtain line-of-sight (LOS) velocities. Of our 25 candidates, 20 stars can be confirmed as bona fide BHB stars. Their LOS velocities, together with the 3D positions of these stars qualitatively match well with Sgr model predictions and trace the outer apocentre of the trailing arm and its spur feature very nicely. The quantitative offsets that are found between our data and the different models can be used to provide information about the Galactic gravitational potential at large distances. We present a first, tentative, analysis in this direction, showing that the model of Vasiliev et al. (2021) would provide better agreement with our observations if the enclosed mass of the Milky Way within 100 kpc were lowered to $(5.3\!\pm\!0.4)\!\times\!10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ (versus $(5.6\!\pm\!0.4)\!\times\!10^{11}$ M$_\odot$). Our selection of BHB stars provides a new view on the outermost structure in 3D positions and LOS velocities of the Sgr debris.</description>

      <title>Chemical characterisation of small substructures in the local stellar halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local stellar halo of the Milky Way is known to contain the debris from accreted dwarf galaxies and globular clusters, in the form of stellar streams and over-densities in the space of orbital properties (e.g. integrals of motion). While several over-densities have been uncovered and characterised dynamically using Gaia data, their nature is not always clear. Especially for a full understanding of the smaller halo substructures, the kinematic information from Gaia needs to be coupled with chemical information. In this work, we combine Gaia data with targeted high-resolution UVES spectroscopy of five small substructures that were recently discovered in the local halo, namely the ED-2, 3, 4, 5 and 6; the ED streams. We present the chemical abundances measured from our newly obtained UVES spectra (20 stars) and from archival UVES spectra (9 stars). We compare these with homogeneously derived abundances from archive spectra of 12 Gaia Enceladus (GE) stars. The chemical abundances of all 5 substructures suggest that they are of accreted origin, except for two stars that present a high [{\alpha}/Fe] at high [Fe/H] more in line with an in-situ origin. All but ED-2 present a significant spread in [Fe/H] suggestive of a dwarf galaxy origin. ED-3 and ED-4 tend to exhibit lower [{\alpha}/Fe] compared to GE stars. ED-5 and ED-6 are consistent with the GE chemical track and could be high-energy tails of GE that were lost earlier in the accretion process. We present new elemental abundances for 5 ED-2 stars, including more elements for the Gaia BH3 companion star. Our findings are in line with the picture that ED-2 is a disrupted ancient star cluster.</description>

      <title>The Galactic Magnetic Field and UHECR Deflections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) experience deflections as they traverse the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), which must be accounted for when tracing them back to their sources. After briefly summarizing our results on uncertainties in cosmic-ray deflections from the UF23 ensemble of GMF models (Unger &amp; Farrar, 2024), we report a new preliminary fit of the GMF including foreground emission from the Local Bubble. This fit uses the analytic model of Pelgrims et al. (2024) for the magnetic field in the thick shell Galactic bubbles. We also discuss how variations in toroidal halo field modeling account for the key differences between the Jansson &amp; Farrar (2012) GMF model and the UF23 ensemble.
  We also extend our previous analysis of the origin of the highest-energy "Amaterasu" event observed by the Telescope Array to include the four highest-energy events detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory. Amaterasu and PAO070114 are the UHECR events with the smallest localization uncertainties of 4.7% and 2.4%, respectively. Neither of their back-tracked directions aligns with any compelling candidate for a continuous UHECR accelerator. This strengthens the evidence that at least a fraction of the highest energy events originate from transient sources.</description>

      <title>Entropy Evolution Towards DARKexp of IllustrisTNG Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) halos simulated via N-body techniques are known to exhibit nearly universal profiles at equilibrium; however, their origin remains uncertain despite thorough investigation. This work aims to probe the origin of simulated DM halo structure by testing DARKexp, a first-principles approach that describes the maximum entropy state of collisionless, self-gravitating systems in equilibrium via their energy distributions, and proposes an entropy functional that is expected to increase during evolution. We fit the DARKexp energy distribution to a set of massive equilibrium halos from the cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG. For the first time, we calculate the entropy of these halos as a function of cosmological time by tracking halos that are in equilibrium at z = 0.0, to z = 3.0 and calculating their entropy at various epochs between. We find that DARKexp provides an excellent fit to the energy distributions of equilibrium DM halos and that such halos exhibit an overall increase in entropy during evolution. Our results indicate that DM halos evolve to become their maximum entropy state at equilibrium and that this state is described by DARKexp.</description>

      <title>Sub-Millimeter Variability in the Envelope &amp; Warped Protostellar Disk of the Class 0 Protostar HOPS 358</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The JCMT Transient Survey recently discovered that the Class 0 protostar HOPS 358 decreased in 350 GHz continuum brightness by $\sim25$% over the course of four years before brightening again for the next four. The JCMT lightcurve can be fit by a long timescale dip lasting roughly eight years. A shorter timescale periodicity is also apparent with a period of 1.75 years and a small 3% amplitude. NEOWise monitoring reveals that the mid-IR wavelength brightness of HOPS 358 follows a similar long-term pattern in time. Here, we present a study of nine epochs of ALMA observations of HOPS 358 taken over the course of the decline and subsequent rise in brightness seen with the JCMT to test whether the variation seen on $\sim15"$ scales, covering both disk and envelope, is also observed on smaller, $&lt;1"$ scales that primarily probe HOPS 358's protostellar disk. We detect both HOPS 358 and its southern companion, HOPS 358B, in our ALMA observations, and find that at least one of the two is varying. Assuming that HOPS 358 is the variable, the light curve has the same shape as that found by the JCMT. Additionally, our high resolution ALMA imaging of HOPS 358 reveals that the disk is warped, with a $16^{\circ}$ warp at a disk radius of 35 au, about halfway through the extent of the disk. The physical origin of the warp along with how it relates to the variability seen towards HOPS 358, however, remain unclear.</description>

      <title>New Stellar Parameters, Metallicities, and Elemental Abundance Ratios for 311 Metal-Poor Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present equivalent widths, improved model atmosphere parameters, and revised abundances for 14 species of 11 elements derived from high resolution optical spectroscopy of 311 metal-poor stars. All of these stars had their parameters previously published by Roederer et al. We use color-Teff relationships calibrated for Gaia and 2MASS photometry to calculate improved effective temperatures. We calculate log of surface gravity values using measurements derived from Gaia parallaxes and other fundamental stellar properties. We perform a standard LTE abundance analysis using MARCS model atmospheres and the MOOG line analysis software to rederive microturbulence velocity parameters, metallicities, and abundances based on O I, Na I, Mg I, Si I, K I, Ca I, Ti I, Ti II, Cr I, Cr II, Fe I, Fe II, Ni I, and Zn I lines using the previously measured equivalent widths. On average, the new Teff values are 310 K warmer, the new log g values are higher by 0.64 dex, and the new [Fe/H] values are higher by 0.26 dex. We apply NLTE corrections to the abundances derived from O I, Na I, Mg I, Si I, K I, Fe I, and Fe II lines. Our sample contains 6 stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -3.5, 28 stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -3.0, and 113 stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -2.5. Our revised abundances for these 311 stars are now in better agreement with those derived by previous studies of smaller samples of metal-poor stars in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Free-floating planetary mass objects in LDN 1495 from Euclid Early Release Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Substellar objects, including brown dwarfs and free-floating planetary-mass objects, are a significant product of star formation. Their sensitivity to initial conditions and early dynamical evolution makes them especially valuable for studying both planetary and stellar formation processes. Aims. We search for brown dwarfs and isolated planetary mass objects in a young star forming region to better constrain their formation mechanisms. Methods. We take advantage of Euclid unprecedented sensitivity, spatial resolution and wide-field of view to search for brown dwarfs and free-floating planetary mass objects in the LDN 1495 region of the Taurus molecular clouds. We combine the recent Euclid Early Release Observations with older very deep ground-based images obtained over more than 20 yr to derive proper motions and multi-wavelength photometry, and select members based on their morphology and their position in a proper motion diagram and in 9 color-magnitude diagrams. Results. We identify 15 point sources with proper motions, colors, and luminosity consistent with being members of LDN 1495. Six of these objects were already known M9-L1 members. The remaining nine are newly identified sources that could have spectral types ranging from late-M to early-T with masses potentially as low as 1-2 MJup based on their luminosity and according to evolutionary models. However, follow-up observations are needed to confirm their nature, spectral type and membership. If extrapolated to theentire Taurus star forming region, this result suggests the potential presence of several dozen free-floating planetary mass objects.</description>

      <title>The visibility of the \={O}tautahi-Oxford interstellar object population model in LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a new probabilistic technique for sampling interstellar object (ISO) orbits with high efficiency, we assess the observability of ISOs under a realistic cadence for the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Using the \={O}tautahi-Oxford population model, we show that there will be complex on-sky structure in the pattern of direction and velocity revealed by the detected ISO population, with the expected enhanced northern flux complicating efforts to derive population parameters from the LSST's predominately southern footprint. For luminosity functions with slopes of $2.5\leq q_s\leq 4.0$, the most discoverable ISOs have $H_r\simeq 14.6-20.7$; for previously estimated spatial densities, between 6 and 51 total ISOs are expected. The slope of the luminosity function of ISOs will be relatively quickly constrained. Discoveries are evenly split around their perihelion passage and are biased to lower velocities. After their discovery by LSST, it will be rare for ISOs to be visible for less than a month; most will have $m_r \leq 23$ for months, and the window for spectroscopic characterization could be as long as two years. These probabilistic assessments are robust against model or spatial density refinements that change the absolute numbers of ISO discoveries.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a Disk-wind Origin for Fluorescent H$_2$ in Classical T Tauri Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use FUV spectra of 36 T Tauri stars, predominately from $\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$'s ULLYSES program, to examine the kinematic properties of fluorescent H$_2$ emission lines for evidence of disk outflows. Leveraging improvements to the $\textit{HST}$-COS wavelength solution, we co-add isolated lines within four fluorescent progressions ([$\textit{v'}$,$\textit{J'}$] = [1,4], [1,7], [0,2], and [3,16]) to improve signal-to-noise, and we fit each co-added line profile with one or two Gaussian components. Of the high S/N line profiles (S/N $\geq$ 12 at the peak of the profile), over half are best fit with a combination of a broad and narrow Gaussian component. For profiles of the [1,4] and [1,7] progressions, we find a systematic blue-shift of a few km s$^{-1}$ between the broad and narrow centroid velocities and stellar radial velocities. For the [0,2] progression, we find centroid velocities consistently blueshifted with respect to stellar radial velocities on the order of -5 km s$^{-1}$ for the single and narrow components, and -10 km s$^{-1}$ for the broad components. Overall, the blueshifts observed in our sample suggest that the molecular gas traces an outflow from a disk wind in some sources, and not solely disk gas in Keplerian rotation. The low-velocity systematic blue-shifts, and emitting radii as inferred from line FWHMs, observed in our sample are similar to those observed with optical [O I] surveys of T Tauri stars. We estimate H$_2$ mass-loss rates of 10$^{-9}$ to 10$^{-11}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, but incomplete knowledge of wind parameters limits comparisons to global models.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays from Active Galactic Nuclei Jets: The Role of Supermassive Black Hole Growth and Accretion States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jets emanating from active galactic nuclei (AGN) represent some of the most formidable particle accelerators in the universe, thereby emerging as viable candidates responsible for the detection of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). If AGN jets indeed serve as origins of UHECRs, then the diffuse flux of these cosmic rays would be dependent on the power and duty cycle of these jets, which are inherently connected to the nature of black hole accretion flows. In this article, we present our cosmological semi-analytic framework, JET(Jets from Early Times), designed to trace the evolution of jetted AGN populations. This framework serves as a valuable tool for predictive analyses of cosmic ray energy density and, potentially, neutrino energy density. By using JET, we model the formation and evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) from z = 20 to z = 1, incorporating jet formation and feedback mechanisms and distinguishing between various accretion states determined by the SMBH Eddington ratios. The implications of different SMBH growth models on predicting cosmic ray flux are investigated. We provide illustrative examples demonstrating how the associated diffuse UHECR fluxes at the source may vary in relation to the jet production efficiencies and the selected SMBH growth model, linking cosmological models of SMBH growth with astroparticle backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Accretion bursts in young intermediate-mass stars make planet formation challenging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the occurrence of accretion bursts, dust accumulation, and the prospects for planetesimal formation in a gravitationally unstable magnetized protoplanetary disk with globally suppressed but episodically triggered magnetorotational instability (MRI), particularly in young intermediate-mass stars (YIMSs) but with a brief comparison to low-mass counterparts. We use numerical magnetohydrodynamics simulations in the thin-disk limit (FEOSAD code) to model the formation and long-term evolution of a gravitationally unstable magnetized protoplanetary disk, including dust dynamics and growth, since the collapse of a massive slowly-rotating prestellar cloud core. Massive gas concentrations and dust rings form within the inner disk region owing to the radially varying efficiency of mass transport by gravitational instability (GI). These rings are initially susceptible to streaming instability (SI). However, gradual warming of the dust rings, thanks to high opacity and GI-induced influx of matter increases the gas temperature above a threshold for the MRI to develop via thermal ionization of alkaline metals. The ensuing MRI bursts destroy the dust rings, making planetesimal formation via SI problematic. In the later evolution phase, when the burst activity starts to diminish, SI becomes inefficient because of growing dust drift velocity and more extended inner dead zone, both acting to reduce the dust concentration below the threshold for SI to develop. Low-mass objects appear to be less affected by these adverse effects. Our results suggest that disks around young intermediate-mass stars may be challenging environments for planetesimal formation via SI. This may explain the dearth of planets around stars with $M_\ast &gt; 3.0 \,$$M_\odot$.</description>

Abstract: Using direct numerical simulations of forced rotating turbulence, we study the effect of rotation on the growth rate and the saturation level of the small-scale dynamo. For slow rotation rates, increasing the rotation rate reduces both the growth rate and the saturation level. Once the rotation rate crosses a threshold, large-scale vortices are formed which enhance the growth rate and the saturation level. Below this threshold, the suppression of the small-scale dynamo with increasing rotation is explained by the fact that at scales close to, but smaller than, the forcing scale, rotating turbulence is one-dimensionalized, with the velocity component along the rotation axis being larger than the other two components. This is due to the rotational destabilization of vortices produced by the forcing function. While the rotational effect on the growth rate becomes small at high Re, the ratio of the steady-state magnetic to kinetic energies remains suppressed by up to 35% as compared to the non-rotating case.</description>

Abstract: How much energy is required to unbind baryons from the cosmological structures that originally bind them? This tutorial article explains why trying to answer this question using just a halo model can be misleading. Instead, it recommends parsing the universe into ``bound domains,'' which are the gravitationally bound structures that ultimately become widely separated islands as the universe evolves. It explains why a bound domain's potential well was about as deep ~1 Gyr after the Big Bang as it is now, and it outlines how future research might take advantage of a bound-domain approach to make progress on some open questions about the baryon distributions in and around galaxy groups and clusters.</description>

      <title>Playing with lepton asymmetry at the resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the sterile neutrino dark matter production in the primordial plasma with lepton asymmetry unequally distributed over different neutrino flavors. We argue that with the specific flavor fractions, one can mitigate limits from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis on the sterile-active neutrino mixing angle and sterile neutrino mass. It happens due to cancellation of the neutrino flavor asymmetries in active neutrino oscillations, which is more efficient in the case of inverse hierarchy of active neutrino masses and does not depend on the value of CP-phase. This finding opens a window of lower sterile-active mixing angles. Likewise, we show that, with lepton asymmetry disappearing from the plasma at certain intermediate stages of the sterile neutrino production, the spectrum of produced neutrinos becomes much colder, which weakens the limits on the model parameter space from observations of cosmic small-scale structures (Ly-$\alpha$ forest, galaxy counts, etc.). This finding reopens the region of lighter sterile neutrinos. The new region may be explored with the next generation of X-ray telescopes searching for the inherent peak signature provided by the dark matter sterile neutrino radiative decays in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Measuring anisotropies in the PTA band with cross-correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical gravitational wave background in the nanohertz (nHz) band is expected to be primarily composed of the superposition of signals from binaries of supermassive black holes. The spatial discreteness of these sources introduces shot noise, which, in certain regimes, would overwhelm efforts to measure the anisotropy of the gravitational wave background. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate, starting from first principles, that cross-correlating a gravitational wave background map with a sufficiently dense galaxy survey can mitigate this issue. This approach could potentially reveal underlying properties of the gravitational wave background that would otherwise remain obscured. We quantify the shot noise level and show that cross-correlating the gravitational wave background with a galaxy catalog improves by more than two orders of magnitude the prospects for a first detection of the background anisotropy by a gravitational wave observatory operating in the nHz frequency range, provided it has sufficient sensitivity.</description>

      <title>The Legacy of Henrietta Leavitt: A Re-analysis of the First Cepheid Period-Luminosity Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Henrietta Swan Leavitt's discovery of the relationship between the period and luminosity (hereafter the Leavitt Law) of 25 variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, published in 1912, revolutionized cosmology. These variables, eventually identified as Cepheids, became the first known "standard candles" for measuring extragalactic distances and remain the gold standard for this task today. Leavitt measured light curves, periods, and minimum and maximum magnitudes from painstaking visual inspection of photographic plates. Her work paved the way for the first precise series of distance measurements that helped set the scale of the Universe, and later the discovery of its expansion by Edwin Hubble in 1929. Here, we re-analyze Leavitt's first Period-Luminosity relation using observations of the same set of stars but with modern data and methods of Cepheid analysis. Using only data from Leavitt's notebooks, we assess the quality of her light curves, measured periods, and the slope and scatter of her Period-Luminosity relations. We show that modern data and methods, for the same objects, reduce the scatter of the Period-Luminosity relation by a factor of two. We also find a bias brightward at the short period end, due to the non-linearity of the plates and environmental crowding. Overall, Leavitt's results are in excellent agreement with contemporary measurements, reinforcing the value of Cepheids in cosmology today, a testament to the enduring quality of her work.</description>

Abstract: Voids possess a very complex internal structure and dynamics. Using $N$-body simulations we study the hierarchical nature of sub-structures present in the cosmic web (CW). We use the SpineWeb method which provides a complete characterization of the CW into its primary constituents: voids, walls, filaments, and nodes. We aim to characterize the inner compositions of voids by detecting their internal filamentary structure and explore the impact of this on the properties of void galaxies. Using a semi-analytical galaxy evolution model we explore the impact of the CW on several galaxies' properties. We find the fraction of haloes living in various CW components to be a function of their mass, with the majority of the haloes of mass below $10^{12}M_{\odot}/h$, residing in voids and haloes of higher masses distributed mostly in walls. Similarly, in the Stellar-to-Halo mass relationship, we observe an environmental dependence for haloes of masses below $10^{12}M_{\odot}/h$, showing an increased stellar mass fraction for the densest environments.
  The spin is lower for galaxies in the densest environments for the mass range of $10^{10}-10^{12}M_{\odot}/h$. Finally, we found a strong trend of higher metallicity fractions for filaments and node galaxies, with respect to the full sample, in the range of $M_*&lt;10^{10}M_{\odot}/h$.
  Our results show that cosmic voids possess an intricate internal network of substructures. This in turn makes them a complex environment for galaxy formation, impacting in an unique way the properties and evolution of the chosen few galaxies that form inside them.</description>

      <title>The evolution of molecular clouds: turbulence-regulated global radial collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The star formation efficiency (SFE) measures the proportion of molecular gas converted into stars, while the star formation rate (SFR) indicates the rate at which gas is transformed into stars. Here we propose such a model in the framework of a global radial collapse of molecular clouds, where the collapse velocity depends on the density profile and the initial mass-to-radius ratio of molecular clouds, with the collapse velocity accelerating during the collapse process. This simplified analytical model allows us to estimate a lifetime of giant molecular clouds of approximately $0.44-7.36 \times 10^7\, \rm{yr}$, and a star formation timescale of approximately $0.5-5.88 \times 10^6\, \rm{yr}$. Additionally, we can predict an SFE of approximately $1.59\, \%$, and an SFR of roughly $1.85\, \rm{M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}}$ for the Milky Way in agreement with observations.</description>

      <title>Ageing and Quenching: Influence of Galaxy Environment and Nuclear Activity in Transition Stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to investigate whether the environment and the nuclear activity of a particular galaxy influence the ageing and quenching at the transition stage of the galaxy evolution using the volume-limited sample constructed from the twelve release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. To this end, the galaxies were classified into isolated and non-isolated environments and then each subsample was further classified according to their nuclear activity using the WHAN diagnostic diagram, and ageing diagram to obtain ageing and quenching galaxies. The ageing and quenching galaxies at the transition stage were selected for the rest of the analysis. Using the star formation rate and the $u-r$ colour-stellar mass diagrams, the study revealed a significant change of $0.03$ dex in slope and $0.30$ dex in intercept for ageing galaxies and an insignificant change of $0.02$ dex in slope and $0.12$ dex in intercept of the star formation main sequence between isolated and non-isolated quenching galaxies. Further, a more significant change in the number of ageing galaxies above, within and below the main sequence and the green valley was observed. On the other hand, an insignificant change in the number of quenching galaxies above, within and below the main sequence and the green valley was observed. The study concludes that ageing depends on the environment and the dependence is influenced by the nuclear activity of a particular galaxy while quenching does not depend on the environment and this independence is not influenced by the nuclear activity.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Goldilocks Zone: Identifying Critical Features in Massive Black Hole Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most galaxies, including the Milky Way, host a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center. These SMBHs can be observed out to high redshifts (z&gt;=6) if the accretion rate is sufficiently large. However, we do not fully understand the mechanism through which these black holes form at early times. The heavy (or direct collapse) seeding mechanism has emerged as a probable contender in which the core of an atomic cooling halo directly collapses into a dense stellar cluster that could host supermassive stars that proceed to form a BH seed of mass ~10^5 M_sun. We use the Renaissance simulations to investigate the properties of 35 DCBH candidate host halos at z=15-24 and compare them to non-candidate halos. We aim to understand what features differentiate halos capable of hosting a DCBH from the general halo population with the use of statistical analysis and machine learning methods. We examine 18 halo, central, and environmental properties. We find that DCBH candidacy is more dependent on a halo's core internal properties than on exterior factors such as Lyman-Werner flux and distance to closest galaxy; our analysis selects density and radial mass influx as the most important features (outside candidacy establishing features). Our results concur with the recent suggestion that DCBH host halos neither need to lie within a "Goldilocks zone" nor have a significant amount of Lyman-Werner flux to suppress cooling. This paper presents insight to the dynamics possibly occurring in potential DCBH host halos and seeks to provide guidance to DCBH subgrid formation models.</description>

Abstract: Primordial supernovae were the first, great nucleosynthetic engines in the Universe, forging the elements required for the later formation of planets and life. Here we show that planetesimals, the precursors of terrestrial planets, formed around low-mass stars in the debris of the first cosmic explosions 200 Myr after the Big Bang, before the first galaxies and far earlier than previously thought. A dense core in one of these explosions collapsed to a protoplanetary disk in which several Earth masses of planetesimals formed 0.46 - 1.66 AU from their parent 0.7 M$_{\odot}$ star, where equilibrium temperatures varied from 269 K to 186 K, in water mass fractions that were only a factor of a few less than in the Solar System today. Habitable worlds thus formed among the first generation of stars in the Universe, before the advent of the first galaxies.</description>

      <title>Giant Molecular Clouds in RCW 106 (G333): Galactic Mini-starbursts and Massive Star Formation Induced by Supersonic Cloud-Cloud Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To reveal the origin of the mini-starbursts in the Milky Way, we carried out large-scale CO observations toward the RCW 106 giant molecular cloud (GMC) complex using the NANTEN2 4-m radio telescope operated by Nagoya University. We also analyzed the Mopra Southern Galactic plane CO survey and Herschel infrared continuum archival data. The RCW 106 GMC complex contains the radial velocity components of $-68$ km s$^{-1}$ and $-50$ km s$^{-1}$ reported by Nguyen et al. (2015). Focusing on the RCW 106 East and West region with the massive star formation having the bright infrared dust emission, we found that these regions have three different velocity components with $\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$ differences. The two out of three velocity components show morphological correspondence with the infrared cold dust emission and connect with the bridge feature on a position-velocity diagram. Therefore, two molecular clouds (MCs) with $\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$ differences are likely to be physically associated with massive star-forming regions in the GMC complex. Based on these observational results, we argue that mini-starbursts and massive star/cluster formation in the RCW 106 GMC complex are induced by supersonic cloud-cloud collisions in an agglomerate of molecular gas on the Scutum-Centaurus arm.</description>

      <title>2D Surface Brightness Modelling of Large 2MASS Galaxies II: The Role of Classical Bulges and Pseudobulges on Galaxy Scaling Relations and its implication for Supermassive Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have generated 2D-multicomponent surface brightness (SB) modelling for 100 galaxies in the Large Galaxy Atlas (LGA) together with 19 nearby cD galaxies using the near-infrared (NIR) images from 2MASS (J, H and Ks ). Our final sample of 119 galaxies includes cD galaxies, Virgo cluster galaxies, group galaxies, and field galaxies. We revisited known scaling relations (SRs) involving structural parameters, as well as those involving supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and ultramassive black holes (UMBHs). Refining the SRs, we also revisited the bulge classification and considered the Fundamental Plane (FP) and its projections, as well as other SRs, such as the colour-magnitude relation (CMR), Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) and luminosity concentration relation (LCR). Classical bulges follow the same relations as elliptical galaxies, while pseudobulges are usually outliers. The NIR colours of classical bulges and pseudobulges indicate that their ages are not radically different despite their spread in luminosity, but we noticed that classical bulges are more luminous than pseudobulges, therefore, this property provides a complementary bulge classification criterion. We included pseudobulges from other studies to strengthen the tendencies seen for pseudobulges in our sample. From the SRs for BHs, we found that pseudobulges do not follow SRs for early-type galaxies and classical bulges. Additionally, the lack of correlation between BHs and discs may indicate these structures have not coevolved. From the revision of SRs, we present a sample of galaxies likely to host SMBHs or UMBHs, which are suitable for dynamical BH mass determination from the ground.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed a wealth of new galaxies just a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang. Some of these galaxies exhibit unusual elemental abundances that are difficult to explain with stellar populations today. While Wolf-Rayet stars in multiple-burst populations, very massive or rapidly-rotating primordial stars, general relativistic explosions of metal-enriched supermassive stars, or the precursors of globular clusters can in principle account for the supersolar nitrogen to oxygen ratios in the galaxies GN-z11 and CEERS 1019, no known stars or supernovae can explain the far higher N/O ratio of 0.46 in GS 3073 at redshift $z =$ 5.55. Here we show that the extreme nitrogen abundances in GS 3073 can be produced by 1000 - 10,000 M$_{\odot}$ primordial (Pop III) stars. We find that these are the only candidates that can account for its large N/O ratios and its C/O and Ne/O ratios. GS 3073 is thus the first conclusive evidence in the fossil abundance record of the existence of supermassive Pop III stars at cosmic Dawn.</description>

Abstract: Cold and cool gas (T $\leq 10^4$ K) in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and its interaction with galaxies remain poorly understood. Simulations predict that cold gas flows into galaxies through cosmic filaments, determining the disk formation and galaxy evolution. The cold gas accretion modes in the CGM and their dependence on dark matter halo mass and redshift remain puzzling. Resolving the kiloparsec-scale kinematics and dynamics of cold gas interacting with the disk, dust, and metals in different environments is particularly lacking at z &gt; 2. Here we report two disturbed cold gas structures traced by ultra-strong MgII absorbers (rest-frame equivalent width Wr &gt; 2 \AA) exhibiting high kinematic velocities (&gt; 500 km/s) and their environments at z ~ 4.9 and z ~ 2.6. Observations were conducted with VLT/MUSE, JWST/NIRCam, and ALMA to detect Lya and nebular emission lines, as well as dust continuum emission in the vicinity of these two absorbing gas structures. We identify two Lya emitters associated with a strong MgII absorber pair separated by ~1000 km/s at z~ 4.87. The pair exhibits relative differences in metallicity, dust content, and ionization states, suggesting internal metal and dust exchange within the ultra-large cold gas structure. For the strong MgII absorber at z = 2.5652, we detect a dusty star-forming galaxy at a projected distance of $D = 38$ kpc. This galaxy exhibits prominent HeI, [SIII], and Paschen$\gamma$ lines, along with significant dust continuum. It has a star formation rate of ~ 121 +/- 33 $M_{\odot}$/yr and likely harbors a rotating disk. These findings tentatively suggest that cold gas at high redshifts plays a critical role in driving disk formation and actively participates in the transfer of metals and dust within the overdense regions of the CGM.</description>

      <title>Simulating realistic self-interacting dark matter models including small and large-angle scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) self-interactions alter the matter distribution on galactic scales and alleviate tensions with observations. A feature of the self-interaction cross section is its angular dependence, influencing offsets between galaxies and DM halos in merging galaxy clusters. While algorithms for modelling mostly forward-dominated or mostly large-angle scatterings exist, incorporating realistic angular dependencies, such as light mediator models, within $N$-body simulations remains challenging. We develop, validate and apply a novel and efficient method, combining existing approaches to describe small- and large-angle scattering regimes within a hybrid scheme. Below a critical angle the effective description via a drag force combined with transverse momentum diffusion is used, while above the angle dependence is sampled explicitly. First, we verify the scheme using a test set-up with known analytical solutions, and check that our results are insensitive to the choice of the critical angle within an expected range. Next, we demonstrate that our scheme speeds up the computations by multiple orders of magnitude for realistic light mediator models. Finally, we apply the method to galaxy cluster mergers and discuss the sensitivity of the offset between galaxies and DM to the angle dependence of the cross section. Our scheme ensures accurate offsets for mediator mass $m_\phi$ and DM mass $m_\chi$ within the range $0.1v/c\lesssim m_\phi/m_\chi\lesssim v/c$, while for larger (smaller) mass ratios the offsets obtained for isotropic (forward-dominated) self-scattering are approached. Here $v$ is the typical velocity scale. Equivalently, the upper condition can be expressed as $1.1\lesssim \sigma_{\rm tot}/\sigma_{\mathrm{\widetilde{T}}}\lesssim 10$ for the ratio of the total and momentum transfer cross sections, with the ratio being $1$ ($\infty$) in the isotropic (forward-dominated) limits.</description>

      <title>A distance measurement of galaxies from JWST using star formation rate-stellar mass relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the star formation rate-stellar mass relation ($SFR - {M_ * }$) of galaxies to measure their luminosity distances as well as estimate cosmological parameters. We compile a sample of 341 high-redshift galaxies at $5 &lt; z &lt; 14$ and an additional 51 galaxies at $1.8 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$ from the JWST observations, which can be used to investigate the correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass, and determine their cosmological distance. The relation $SFR \propto {\kern 1pt} {({M_ * }/{M_ \odot })^\gamma }$ can be applied to check the nonlinear correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass ${M_ * }$ of galaxies and give their distance. Additionally, it also can be used to test if the $SFR - {M_ * }$ relation depends on redshift, and the data suggest that the $SFR $ is positively correlated with stellar mass, the $SFR - {M_ * }$ relation of the high-redshift galaxies has a redshift dependence. Finally, we combine the galaxy sample with Type Ia supernova (SNIa) data from the Pantheon compilation to test the property of dark energy, specifically addressing whether its density deviates from the constant, and give the statistical analysis results.</description>

      <title>Velocity Structure of Circumstellar Environment around Class 0/I Protostars: Uncertainty in the Protostellar Mass Estimation Using Circumstellar Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution observations have enabled detailed investigations of the circumstellar environments around Class 0/I protostars. Several studies have reported that the infall velocity of the envelope is a few times smaller than the free-fall velocity inferred from protostellar masses estimated via the observed rotational velocity of their Keplerian disks. To explore the physical origins of the slow infall, we perform a set of three-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the star formation process, extending to $10^5$ yr after protostar formation. Our simulations show that the infall velocity decreases markedly at the outer edge of the pseudo-disk (at radii of $\sim\!100-1000$ au) and is much slower than the expected free-fall velocity. The degree of this reduction depends on (1) the initial magnetic field strength, (2) the alignment between the initial field and the rotation axis, and (3) the evolutionary stage of the system. Across our parameter space, the ratio of the infall velocity to the free-fall velocity is as small as $0.2-0.5$, which is consistent with the observations. We further examine the reliability of protostellar mass estimates derived from infall and rotational velocities. While the mass derived from disk rotation closely matches the true value, deviation by a factor of $0.3-2$ is found for the estimates using the infall velocity; it is underestimated due to slow infall, but could also be overestimated due to the contribution of disk mass. These findings underscore the critical role of magnetic fields in shaping star formation dynamics and highlight the uncertainties associated with protostellar mass estimates.</description>

      <title>Resonant Locking Between Binary Systems Induced by Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of gravitational waves (GWs) with matter is thought to be typically negligible in the Universe. We identify a possible exception in the case of resonant interactions, where GWs emitted by a background binary system such as an inspiraling supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary causes a resonant response in a stellar-mass foreground binary and the frequencies of the two systems become, and remain, synchronized. We point out that such locking is not only possible, but can significantly reduce the binaries' merger time for $\mathcal{O}(1-10^4)$ binaries in the host galaxy of the merging SMBHs of $10^{9-11}M_{\odot}$ for standard general relativity and even more either in ``wet'' SMBH mergers or in certain modified theories of gravity where the inspiral rate is reduced. This could leave an imprint on the period distribution of stellar mass binaries in post-merger galaxies which could be detectable by future GW detectors, such as LISA.</description>
