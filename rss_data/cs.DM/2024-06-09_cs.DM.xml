      <title>Hulls of Projective Reed-Muller Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projective Reed-Muller codes are constructed from the family of projective hypersurfaces of a fixed degree over a finite field $\F_q$. We consider the relationship between projective Reed-Muller codes and their duals. We determine when these codes are self-dual, when they are self-orthogonal, and when they are LCD. We then show that when $q$ is sufficiently large, the dimension of the hull of a projective Reed-Muller code is 1 less than the dimension of the code. We determine the dimension of the hull for a wider range of parameters and describe how this leads to a new proof of a recent result of Ruano and San Jos\'e (2024).</description>

      <title>2-distance 4-coloring of planar subcubic graphs with girth at least 21</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.03587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $2$-distance $k$-coloring of a graph is a proper vertex $k$-coloring where vertices at distance at most 2 cannot share the same color. We prove the existence of a $2$-distance $4$-coloring for planar subcubic graphs with girth at least 21. We also show a construction of a planar subcubic graph of girth 11 that is not $2$-distance $4$-colorable.</description>

      <title>Unbalanced penalization: A new approach to encode inequality constraints of combinatorial problems for quantum optimization algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13914v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving combinatorial optimization problems of the kind that can be codified by quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) is a promising application of quantum computation. Some problems of this class suitable for practical applications such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP), the bin packing problem (BPP), or the knapsack problem (KP) have inequality constraints that require a particular cost function encoding. The common approach is the use of slack variables to represent the inequality constraints in the cost function. However, the use of slack variables considerably increases the number of qubits and operations required to solve these problems using quantum devices. In this work, we present an alternative method that does not require extra slack variables and consists of using an unbalanced penalization function to represent the inequality constraints in the QUBO. This function is characterized by larger penalization when the inequality constraint is not achieved than when it is. We evaluate our approach on the TSP, BPP, and KP, successfully encoding the optimal solution of the original optimization problem near the ground state cost Hamiltonian. Additionally, we employ D-Wave Advantage and D-Wave hybrid solvers to solve the BPP, surpassing the performance of the slack variables approach by achieving solutions for up to 29 items, whereas the slack variables approach only handles up to 11 items. This new approach can be used to solve combinatorial problems with inequality constraints with a reduced number of resources compared to the slack variables approach using quantum annealing or variational quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Uniform density in matroids, matrices and graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give new characterizations for the class of uniformly dense matroids and study applications of these characterizations to graphic and real representable matroids. We show that a matroid is uniformly dense if and only if its base polytope contains a point with constant coordinates. As a main application, we derive new spectral, structural and classification results for uniformly dense graphs. In particular, we show that connected regular uniformly dense graphs are $1$-tough and thus contain a (near-)perfect matching. As a second application, we show that uniform density can be recognized in polynomial time for real representable matroids, which includes graphs. Finally, we show that strictly uniformly dense real represented matroids can be represented by projection matrices with a constant diagonal and that they are parametrized by a subvariety of the Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Note on Min-k-Planar Drawings of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11610v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The k-planar graphs, which are (usually with small values of k such as 1, 2, 3) subject to recent intense research, admit a drawing in which edges are allowed to cross, but each one edge is allowed to carry at most k crossings. In recently introduced [Binucci et al., GD 2023] min-k-planar drawings of graphs, edges may possibly carry more than k crossings, but in any two crossing edges, at least one of the two must have at most k crossings. In both concepts, one may consider general drawings or a popular restricted concept of drawings called simple. In a simple drawing, every two edges are allowed to cross at most once, and any two edges which share a vertex are forbidden to cross. While, regarding the former concept, it is for k&lt;=3 known (but perhaps not widely known) that every general k-planar graph admits a simple k-planar drawing and this ceases to be true for any k&gt;=4, the difference between general and simple drawings in the latter concept is more striking. We prove that there exist graphs with a min-2-planar drawing, or with a min-3-planar drawing avoiding crossings of adjacent edges, which have no simple min-k-planar drawings for arbitrarily large fixed k.</description>

      <title>On Minimal Depth in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A characterization of the representability of neural networks is relevant to comprehend their success in artificial intelligence. This study investigate two topics on ReLU neural network expressivity and their connection with a conjecture related to the minimum depth required for representing any continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) function. The topics are the minimal depth representation of the sum and max operations, as well as the exploration of polytope neural networks. For the sum operation, we establish a sufficient condition on the minimal depth of the operands to find the minimal depth of the operation. In contrast, regarding the max operation, a comprehensive set of examples is presented, demonstrating that no sufficient conditions, depending solely on the depth of the operands, would imply a minimal depth for the operation. The study also examine the minimal depth relationship between convex CPWL functions. On polytope neural networks, we investigate basic depth properties from Minkowski sums, convex hulls, number of vertices, faces, affine transformations, and indecomposable polytopes. More significant findings include depth characterization of polygons; identification of polytopes with an increasing number of vertices, exhibiting small depth and others with arbitrary large depth; and most notably, the minimal depth of simplices, which is strictly related to the minimal depth conjecture in ReLU networks.</description>
