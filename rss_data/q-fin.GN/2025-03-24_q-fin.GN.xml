      <title>Heterogeneity of household stock portfolios in a national market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long term dynamics of the stock portfolios owned by single Finnish legal entities in the Helsinki venue of the Nasdaq Nordic between 2001 and 2021. Using the Herfindahl-Hirschman index as a measure of concentration for the composition of stock portfolios, we investigate the concentration of Finnish household portfolios both at the level of each individual household and tracking the time evolution of an aggregated Finnish household portfolio. We also consider aggregated portfolios of two other macro categories of investors one comprising Finnish institutional investors and the other comprising foreign investors. Different macro categories of investors present a different degree of concentration of aggregated stock portfolios with highest concentration observed for foreign investors. For individual Finnish retail investors, portfolio concentration estimated by the Herfindahl-Hirschman index presents high values for more than half of the total number of retail investors. In spite of the observation that retail stock portfolios are often composed by just a few stocks, the concentration of the aggregated stock portfolio for Finnish retail investors has a portfolio concentration comparable with the one of Finnish institutional investors. Within retail investors, stock portfolios of women present a similar pattern of portfolios of men but with a systematic higher level of concentration observed for women both at individual and at aggregated level.</description>

      <title>Corporate Finance in the Age of Fintech: Scenarios and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain is a technological innovation that has the potential to radically change our financial markets by providing an alternative management approach to the "promise market", which is the foundation of our financial systems. Its disruptive potential also extends to corporate finance, where blockchain is beginning to influence valuation methods and capital allocation strategies, offering new perspectives on how companies are assessed and financed. However, for a new financial architecture based on blockchain and advancements in technology -- what is commonly referred to as Fintech -- to replace, in whole or in part, traditional finance, it will need to overcome significant challenges such as regulation, environmental sustainability, its association with illegal activities, and achieving greater efficiency in cryptocurrency markets. For this reason, the future of Fintech is likely to be more conventional -- yet also more transparent, efficient, and regulated -- ultimately evolving to resemble the traditional finance we know.</description>

      <title>On the Characteristics of the Free Market in a Cooperative Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:1506.03917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The key characteristic of a true free market economy is that exchanges are entirely voluntary. When there is a monopoly in the creation of currency as we have in today's markets, you no longer have a true free market. Features of the current economic system such as central banking and taxation would be nonexistent in a free market. This paper examines how currency monopoly leads to the instabilities and imbalances that we see in today's economy. It also proposes that currencies should emerge from the voluntary exchange of goods and services, and studies economic interaction across all scales, by considering economic action in cases where the self-interests of individuals are coincident. By examining the voluntary exchange of goods and services at the scale of an entire society, it is shown that a new currency system, which resolves a lot of the problems caused by the current fiat currency system, emerges naturally from the free market. The new currency system is robust and efficient, and provides a way for public goods and services to be provided, and its providers compensated, without the need for direct taxation.</description>
