      <title>Rheological properties of acid-induced carboxymethylcellulose hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellulose ethers represent a class of water-soluble polymers widely utilized across diverse sectors, spanning from healthcare to the construction industry. This experimental study specifically delves into aqueous suspensions of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), a polymer that undergoes gel formation in acidic environments due to attractive interactions between hydrophobic patches along its molecular chain. We use rheometry to determine the linear viscoelastic properties of both CMC suspensions and acid-induced gels at various temperatures. Then, applying the time-temperature superposition principle, we construct master curves for the viscoelastic spectra, effectively described by fractional models. The horizontal shift factors exhibit an Arrhenius-like temperature dependence, allowing us to extract activation energies compatible with hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, we show that acid-induced CMC gels are physical gels that display a reversible yielding transition under external shear. In particular, we discuss the influence of pH on the non-linear viscoelastic response under large-amplitude oscillatory shear. Overall, our results offer a comprehensive description of the linear and non-linear rheological properties of a compelling case of physical hydrogel involving hydrophobic interactions.</description>

      <title>Exceptionally Large Fluctuations in Orientational Order: The Lessons of Large-Deviation Theory for Liquid Crystalline Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fact that simulations of condensed matter problems are limited to sizes far smaller than the macroscopic systems being emulated does have one redeeming feature: The specific dependence on N, the number of molecules being simulated, is sometimes itself a valuable piece of information. The isotropic phase of liquid crystals provides a case in point. Light scattering and 2d-IR experiments on isotropic-phase samples display increasingly large orientational fluctuations as the samples approach their nematic phase. The growing length scale of those locally ordered domains is readily seen in simulation as an ever slower convergence of the distribution of orientational order parameters with N. The rare-event character of the largest fluctuations make them difficult to sample accurately. We show in this paper how taking a large deviation theory perspective enables us to leverage simulation-derived information more effectively. A key insight of large deviation theory is that extracting the desired measurable, in our case, the extent of orientational order, is completely equivalent to finding the size of the conjugate field required to equilibrate that amount of order - and that knowing the relationship between the two gives us the relative free energy. Indeed, a variety of thermodynamic integration strategies used to evaluate free energy differences in simulation are essentially founded on this idea. However, rather than applying an artificially imposed external field, we use a priori statistical mechanical insights into the small and large-field limits of the equation of state to construct a simulation-guided, interpolated, equation of state. The free energies that result turn out to need simulation information derived mostly from the most probable configurations, rather than from the infrequent events, and therefore use simulation information far more efficiently than conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Destabilization of Alzheimers Amyloid-beta Protofibrils by Bai-calein: Mechanistic Insights from All-atom Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder; it is the most common form of de-mentia and the fifth leading cause of death globally. Aggregation and deposition of neurotoxic A-beta fibrils in the neural tissues of the brain is a key hallmark in the pathogenesis of AD. Desta-bilisation studies of the amyloid-peptide by various natural molecules are of the utmost rele-vance due to their enormous potential as neuroprotective and therapeutic agents for AD. We performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation on the U-shaped pentamers of amyloidogenic protofilament intermediates to investigate the destabilisation mechanism in the presence of Bai-calein (BCL), a naturally occurring flavonoid. We found that the BCL molecule formed strong hydrophobic contacts with non-polar residues of the protofibril. Upon binding, it competed with the native hydrophobic contacts of the A-beta protein. BCL loosened the tight packing of the hydrophobic core of the protofibril by disrupting the inter-chain salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. The decrease in the structural stability of A-beta protofibrils was confirmed through the en-hanced root mean square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration and solvent accessible surface area (SASA), and reduced beta-sheet content. PCA indicated that the presence of the BCL mole-cule intensified protofibril motions, particularly affecting residues in Chain A and B regions. Our findings propose that BCL would be a potent destabiliser of A-beta protofilament, and may be considered as a therapeutic agent in treating AD.</description>

      <title>Freezing, melting and the onset of glassiness in binary mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify the relationship between freezing, melting and the onset of glassy dynamics in the prototypical glass-forming Kob-Andersen mixture. Our starting point is a precise definition of the onset of glassiness, as expressed by the emergence of an inflection in the time-dependent correlation functions. By scanning the temperature-composition phase diagram of the model, we find that the onset temperature barely varies with concentration, unlike the freezing temperature, which shows a marked drop at the eutectic point. We observe, however, a surprising correspondence between the onset of glassiness and the solidus line, along which the underlying crystalline phases melt. At fixed concentration, the freezing and onset temperatures display similar pressure dependencies, which are very well predicted by the isomorph theory and are encoded in the variation of the excess entropy. While our results rule out a general connection between thermodynamic metastability and glassiness, they call for a careful assessment of the role of crystalline precursors in glass-forming liquids.</description>

      <title>Predicting Polymer Properties Based on Multimodal Multitask Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past few decades, polymers, high-molecular-weight compounds formed by bonding numerous identical or similar monomers covalently, have played an essential role in various scientific fields. In this context, accurate prediction of their properties is becoming increasingly crucial. Typically, the properties of a polymer, such as plasticity, conductivity, bio-compatibility, and so on, are highly correlated with its 3D structure. However, current methods for predicting polymer properties heavily rely on information from polymer SMILES sequences (P-SMILES strings) while ignoring crucial 3D structural information, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we propose MMPolymer, a novel multimodal multitask pretraining framework incorporating both polymer 1D sequential information and 3D structural information to enhance downstream polymer property prediction tasks. Besides, to overcome the limited availability of polymer 3D data, we further propose the "Star Substitution" strategy to extract 3D structural information effectively. During pretraining, MMPolymer not only predicts masked tokens and recovers 3D coordinates but also achieves the cross-modal alignment of latent representation. Subsequently, we further fine-tune the pretrained MMPolymer for downstream polymer property prediction tasks in the supervised learning paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that MMPolymer achieves state-of-the-art performance in various polymer property prediction tasks. Moreover, leveraging the pretrained MMPolymer and using only one modality (either P-SMILES string or 3D conformation) during fine-tuning can also surpass existing polymer property prediction methods, highlighting the exceptional capability of MMPolymer in polymer feature extraction and utilization. Our online platform for polymer property prediction is available at https://app.bohrium.dp.tech/mmpolymer.</description>

      <title>Defects induce phase transition from dynamic to static rippling in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many of graphene's remarkable properties are intrinsically linked to its inherent ripples. Defects, whether naturally present or artificially introduced, are known to have a strong impact on the rippling of graphene. However, how defects alter ripple dynamics in two-dimensional (2D) materials in general, and graphene in particular, remains largely unexplored. Here, using machine learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal a fundamental connection between defect concentration and ripple dynamics in freestanding graphene sheets. Specifically, we find that at a critical concentration of approximately 0.1%, dynamic rippling undergoes a transition from freely propagating to static ripples. This is in quantitative alignment with the experimentally observed turning point in the non-monotonic scaling of the Young's modulus and emphasises the critical interplay between defects and material dynamics. Our work not only unveils the significant impact of defects on rippling dynamics in graphene but also paves the way to design two-dimensional devices with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Fast Brownian cluster dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient method to perform overdamped Brownian dynamics simulations in external force fields and for particle interactions that include a hardcore part. The method applies to particle motion in one dimension, where it is possible to update particle positions by repositioning particle clusters as a whole. These clusters consist of several particles in contact. They form because particle collisions are treated as completely inelastic rather than elastic ones. Updating of cluster positions in time steps is carried out by cluster fragmentation and merging procedures. The presented method is particularly powerful at high collision rates in densely crowded systems, where collective movements of particle assemblies is governing the dynamics. As an application, we simulate the single-file diffusion of sticky hard spheres in a periodic potential.</description>

      <title>Critical phenomena of RNA-like polymers -- a synopsis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work examines field theories for RNA-like polymers with single strand and double strand polymers and a periodic base sequence. These field theories originate from lattice models, describe polymers in a good solvent, and in principle exactly describe the critical behavior. A central role is played by the conventional one-component branched polymer and the mapping of the corresponding field theory to the Lee-Yang field theory in two less dimensions. Critical phenomena in the context of polymers as well as the Lee-Yang model entail pecularities, which we derive in detail. A new result is that the critical point of RNA-like branched polymers (with periodic base sequence) looks like the critical point of the classical one-component branched polymer, but with one more critical exponent for the single strand polymer. A random base sequence generates additional relevant interactions, and invalidates the simple picture.</description>

      <title>Emergence of odd elasticity in a microswimmer using deep reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Deep Q-Network with reinforcement learning to investigate the emergence of odd elasticity in an elastic microswimmer model. For an elastic microswimmer, it is challenging to obtain the optimized dynamics due to the intricate elastohydrodynamic interactions. However, our machine-trained model adopts a novel transition strategy (the waiting behavior) to optimize the locomotion. For the trained microswimmers, we evaluate the performance of the cycles by the product of the loop area (called non-reciprocality) and the loop frequency, and show that the average swimming velocity is proportional to the performance. By calculating the force-displacement correlations, we obtain the effective odd elasticity of the microswimmer to characterize its non-reciprocal dynamics. This emergent odd elasticity is shown to be closely related to the loop frequency of the cyclic deformation. Our work demonstrates the utility of machine learning in achieving optimal dynamics for elastic microswimmers and introduces post-analysis methods to extract crucial physical quantities such as non-reciprocality and odd elasticity.</description>

      <title>Superadiabatic dynamical density functional theory for colloidal suspensions under homogeneous steady-shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superadiabatic dynamical density functional theory (superadiabatic-DDFT) is a promising new method for the study of colloidal systems out-of-equilibrium. Within this approach the viscous forces arising from interparticle interactions are accounted for in a natural way by treating explicitly the dynamics of the two-body correlations. For bulk systems subject to spatially homogeneous shear we use the superadiabatic-DDFT framework to calculate the steady-state pair distribution function and the corresponding viscosity for low values of the shear-rate. We then consider a variant of the central approximation underlying this superadiabatic theory and obtain an inhomogeneous generalization of a rheological bulk theory due to Russel and Gast. This paper thus establishes for the first time a connection between DDFT approaches, formulated to treat inhomogeneous systems, and existing work addressing nonequilibrium microstructure and rheology in bulk colloidal suspensions.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Impact of Organic Molecules and Phosphate Ions on Biosilica Pattern Formation in Diatoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid and complex patterning of biosilica in diatom frustules is of great interest in nanotechnology, although it remains incompletely understood. Specific organic molecules, including long-chain polyamines, silaffins, and silacidins are essential in this process. The molecular structure of the synthesized polyamines significantly affects the quantity, size, and shape of silica precipitates. Experimental findings show that silica precipitation occurs at specific phosphate ion concentrations. We focus on the hypothesis that pattern formation in diatom valve structures is driven by phase separation of species-specific organic molecules. The resulting organic structures serve as templates for silica precipitation. We investigate the role of phosphate ions in self-assembly of organic molecules and analyze how the reaction between them affects the morphology of the organic template. Using mathematical and computational techniques, we gain an understanding of the range of patterns that can arise in a phase-separating system. By varying the degree of dissociation and the initial concentrations of reacting components we demonstrate that the resulting geometric features are highly dependent on these factors. This approach provides insights into the parameters controlling patterning. Additionally, we consider the effects of prepatterns, mimicking silica ribs that preexist the pores, on the final patterns.</description>
