      <title>Shear Viscosity of an $N$-Component Gas Mixture using the Chapman--Enskog Method under Anisotropic Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytical Chapman--Enskog formula for calculating the shear viscosity $\eta$ of a relativistic ideal gas, such as a massless quark-gluon plasma, has consistently demonstrated good agreement with the numerical results obtained using the Green--Kubo relation under both isotropic and anisotropic two-body scatterings. However, past analyses of massless, multicomponent quark-gluon plasma have focused on an effective single-component ``gluon gas." The Chapman--Enskog formula for multicomponent mixtures with nonzero yet adjustable masses was previously developed for simpler cases of isotropic scatterings. This study aims to obtain the Chapman--Enskog shear viscosity formula for a massless, multicomponent mixture under general anisotropic scatterings. Since the shear viscosity depends on a linearized collision kernel, an approximation formula for the linearized collision kernel is derived under elastic and anisotropic $l+k\rightarrow l+k$ scatterings. This derived approximation agrees very well with the isotropic two-body kernels provided in previous works for both like and different species. Furthermore, for multicomponent mixtures beyond two species types, an alternative expansion method of the $N$-component Chapman--Enskog viscosity is presented. This is applied to a two-component ``binary" mixture and compared with the conventional formula for binary viscosity. The agreement between the two, for interacting and noninteracting binary mixtures, varies from moderate to well.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculations with a new local chiral N3LO nucleon-nucleon force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio calculations have achieved remarkable success in nuclear structure studies. Numerous works highlight the pivotal role of three-body forces in nuclear ab initio calculations. Concurrently, efforts have been made to replicate these calculations using only realistic nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions. A novel local chiral next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO) NN interaction, distinct due to its weaker tensor force, has recently been established. This paper applies this local NN interaction in ab initio frameworks to calculate the low-lying spectra of p-shell light nuclei, particularly 10B, ground-state energies and shell evolution in oxygen isotopes. Results are compared with calculations utilizing nonlocal chiral N3LO NN and chiral NN +3N interactions. The ab initio calculations with the local N N potential accurately describe the spectra of p-shell nuclei, notably the 10B. Additionally, the neutron drip line for oxygen isotopes, with 24O as the drip line nucleus, is accurately reproduced in ab initio calculations with the local NN interaction. Calculations with the local NN interaction also reproduce the subshell closure at N = 14 and 16, albeit with a stronger shell gap compared to experimental data. However, the calculated charge radii based on the local NN interaction are underestimated compared with experimental data, which is similar to results from the nonlocal NN interaction. Consequently, the present ab initio calculations further indicate significant spin-orbit splitting effects with the new local NN potential, suggesting that 3N forces remain an important consideration.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified description of isotopic fragment properties in spontaneous and fusion-induced fission within a 4D dynamical Langevin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous fission of 252Cf and fusion-induced fission of 250Cf are investigated within a multi-dimensional Langevin model. The potential-energy surface is calculated in the macroscopic-microscopic LSD+Yukawa-folded approach using the four-dimensional Fourier-over-Spheroid shape parametrization. The dynamical evolution described by the Langevin equation is coupled to neutron evaporation, thereby allowing for the possibility of multi-chance fission. Charge equilibration and excitation-energy sharing between the fragments emerging at scission are evaluated, and their de-excitation is finally computed. The correlation between various observables, particularly the isotopic properties of the fragments, is discussed and compared with the experiment whenever available. The theoretical predictions are generally in good agreement with the data.</description>

      <title>Unveiling potential neutron halos in intermediate-mass nuclei: an \textit{ab initio} study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halos epitomize the fascinating interplay between weak binding, shell evolution, and deformation effects, especially in nuclei near the drip line. In this Letter, we apply the state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group approach to predict potential candidates for one- and two-neutron halo in the intermediate-mass region. Notably, we use spectroscopic factors (SF) and two-nucleon amplitudes (TNA) as criteria for suggesting one- and two-neutron halo candidates, respectively. This approach is not only theoretically sound but also amenable to experimental validation. Our research focuses on Mg, Al, Si, P, and S neutron-drip-line nuclei, offering systematic predictions of neutron halo candidates in terms of separation energies, SF (TNA), and average occupation. The calculation suggests the ground states of $^{40,42,44,46}$Al, $^{41,43,45,47}$Si, $^{46,48}$P, and $^{47,49}$S are promising candidates for one-neutron halos, while $^{40,42,44,46}$Mg, $^{45,47}$Al, $^{46,48}$Si, $^{49}$P, and $^{50}$S may harbor two-neutron halos. In addition, the relative mean-square neutron radius between halo nuclei and \textit{inner core} is calculated for suggested potential neutron halos. Finally, the relations of halo formations and shell evolution are discussed.</description>

      <title>Jet quenching in the glasma phase: medium-induced radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent considerations of parton momentum broadening in the glasma phase, we study the medium-induced soft gluon radiation of jet partons at early times in heavy-ion collisions. The glasma state is assumed to be comprised of independent color domains with homogenous longitudinal fields that vary event by event, and we further complete this model with an event-averaging procedure accounting for the finite correlation length. Using this description, we evaluate the rate of medium-induced radiation from an energetic parton at midrapidity in the glasma phase. We mainly focus on SU(2) color fields for simplicity, also referring to the U(1) case and comparing with the BDMPS-Z rate to gain further insight. Our results show that there is an intricate interplay of the synchrotron-like radiation in a single color domain with the destructive interference between different color domains, after the medium averaging is performed. Thus, we find that the emission rate is sensitive to the matter structure, decreasing for a glasma state populated by smaller color domains, i.e. for a glasma with a larger characteristic saturation scale. Our approach can be applied to more realistic backgrounds, and sets the stage for the modelling of jet evolution in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Semi-Analytical Fokker Planck Models for Nuclear Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of nuclear star clusters, the dense stellar environments surrounding massive black holes in the centers of galaxies. We consider angular momentum diffusion due to two-body scatterings among stellar objects and energy advection due to gravitational wave emission upon interaction with the central massive black hole. Such dynamics is described by a two-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation in energy-angular momentum space. Focusing on the transition between the diffusion-dominated region and the advection-dominated one, we utilize self-similarity to obtain a full solution for the Fokker-Planck equation. This solution provides the density and flux of the stellar objects in nuclear star clusters. This improves the rate estimates for extreme mass-ratio inspirals, and has interesting implications for a new class of galactic center transients called quasi-periodic eruptions.</description>

      <title>Lighting up the Photon Wigner Distribution via Dilepton Productions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of lepton pair production through photon-photon fusion processes in heavy-ion collisions. It is demonstrated that the dilepton production at a given impact parameter ($b_\perp$) with a fixed transverse momentum imbalance ($q_\perp$) can be factorized into a unified formula in terms of the Wigner photon distribution of heavy nuclei. We show that this framework provides a comprehensive description of all the relevant data from RHIC to the LHC, with a strong evidence that the quasi-real photon can be radiated not only from the nucleus as a whole, standing for the coherent contribution, but also from the sub-structures inside the nucleus, representing the incoherent contribution. Further predictions are made for the anisotropies in the correlations between $q_\perp$, $b_\perp$, and the dilepton transverse momentum ($P_\perp$). This will help us to constrain the photon Wigner distribution which plays a crucial role to study the gluonic matter of nucleus at small-$x$ through the diffractive photoproduction processes in heavy ion collision.</description>

      <title>Off-shell pion properties: electromagnetic form factors and light-front wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The off-shell pion electromagnetic form factors are explored with corresponding off-shell light-front wave functions modeled by constituent quark and anti-quark. We apply the Mandelstam approach for the microscopic computation of the form factors relating the model parameters with the pion decay constant and charge radius. Analyzing the existing data on the cross-sections for the Sullivan process, $^1$H$(e,e',\pi^+)n$, we extract the off-shell pion form factor using the relation derived from the generalized Ward-Takahashi identity for the pion electromagnetic current. They are compared with our previous results from exactly solvable manifestly covariant model of a (3+1)-dimensional fermion field theory. We find that the adopted constituent quark model reproduces the extracted off-shell form factor $F_1(Q^2,t)$ from the experimental data within a few percent difference and matches well with our previous theoretical simulation which exhibits a variation of about 10 % for the extracted off-shell pion form factor g(Q^2,t). We also identify the pion valence parton distribution function (PDF) and transverse momentum distribution (TMD) in terms of the light-front wave function and discuss their off-shell properties.</description>

      <title>Weak interaction axial form factors of the octet baryons in nuclear medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the axial-vector and the induced pseudoscalar form factors associated with the weak transitions between the octet baryon members in nuclear medium, using a covariant constituent quark model. We extend previous calculations of the axial transition form factors from the vacuum (free space) to the nuclear medium (symmetric nuclear matter). The extension of the model to the nuclear medium takes into account the modifications of the properties of hadrons in the medium (masses and coupling constants), as determined by the quark-meson coupling model. The axial-vector ($G_A$) and the induced pseudoscalar ($G_P$) form factors are evaluated for different values of the nuclear density $\rho$ in terms of the square transfer momentum $q^2= -Q^2$. We conclude that in general the $G_A$ and $G_P$ form factors are reduced in the nuclear medium. The reduction is stronger for light baryons and high densities. The medium modifications are milder for the heavier octet baryons, particularly at large $Q^2$. The calculations presented here can be used to estimate the cross sections of neutrino and antineutrino scattering with nucleus, and neutrino and antineutrino scattering with hyperons bound to a nucleus, as well as those in the cores of compact stars.</description>

      <title>Constraining the axial-vector X17 interpretation with ${}^{12}$C data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent findings of an unexpected, narrow resonance in the $e^+e^-$ decay spectra of excited states of $^8$Be, $^4$He and $^{12}$C by the ATOMKI collaboration have received considerable experimental and theoretical attention, whereby a new, 17-MeV vector-like or axial-vector-like boson termed X17 was conjectured as an explanation of the anomaly. Further analysis of all existing constraints disfavors a vector X17 scenario. For a similar analysis of the axial-vector scenario, a calculation of the reduced matrix element of a spin-dipole operator between the excited nuclear state ${}^{12}$C(17.23) and the carbon ground state is required. In the present work, we compute the aforementioned reduced matrix element under the assumption that the state ${}^{12}$C(17.23) is well represented by the $2s_{1/2}1p^{-1}_{3/2}$ particle-hole shell-model excitation of the ground state, as supported by experimental data. Within such a framework, our results indicate that, like the vector scenario, the axial-vector interpretation of X17 shows strong tensions with the other existing constraints on the nucleon coupling of a conjectured X17.</description>

      <title>Sliding Dumbbell Method to search for the CME in heavy ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.15282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The CME, observed as back-to-back charge separation along the magnetic field axis, is investigated using the newly developed Sliding Dumbbell Method (SDM) applied to Au+Au events at a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}_{\mathrm{NN}}$ = 200 GeV generated by the AMPT model with string melting configuration. The CME-like signal is externally injected in events by flipping charges of pairs of the particles perpendicular to the reaction plane. The study reports a significant enhancement of the CME-sensitive 3-particle $\gamma$ correlator in events with high back-to-back charge separation, in a given collision centrality. Additionally, a linear relationship is observed between the $\sqrt{|\gamma|}$ correlator for same-sign charge pairs and positive charge asymmetry ($\langle A{^+}\rangle$) across the dumbbell in CME-enriched sub-samples. Furthermore, the fraction of CME in $\Delta\gamma$ (difference between opposite and same sign $\gamma$ correlators) is presented across different collision centralities having different percentages of externally injected CME-like signal. Overall, the research aims to understand and detect the Chiral Magnetic Effect through innovative experimental method and detailed analysis of event structure.</description>

      <title>Momentum dependent measures of correlations between mean transverse momentum and harmonic flow in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correlation between the mean transverse momentum and the harmonic flow coefficients is an observable which is of great interest; it is sensitive to shape fluctuations in the initial state of a relativistic nuclear collision. The measurement of that correlation coefficient in central collisions allows one to infer about the intrinsic deformation of the colliding nuclei. We propose to study the momentum dependent covariance and correlation coefficient between the mean transverse momentum and the harmonic flow in a given transverse momentum bin. Two possible constructions of such observables are provided and predictions are obtained from a viscous hydrodynamic model. We find that such momentum dependent correlation coefficients between the mean transverse momentum and the harmonic flow show a strong and nontrivial momentum dependence. We also explore the effects of granularity (nucleon width) in the initial state, the nuclear deformation, and the shear viscosity on this momentum dependent correlation coefficient. The shape of the momentum dependence of the correlation coefficient for the triangular flow is found to be sensitive to the size of small scale fluctuations in the initial state. On the other hand, the shape of the momentum dependence of the covariance between the mean transverse momentum and the harmonic flow coefficients is found to be sensitive to the value of the shear viscosity and to the granularity of the initial state.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive review of the theoretical and experimental progress in the investigation of novel high-temperature quantum chromodynamics phenomena in small systems at both the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider. We highlight the challenges and opportunities associated with studying small systems, by which we generally mean collision systems that involve at least one light ion or even a photon projectile. We discuss perspectives on possible future research directions to better understand the underlying physics at work in the collisions of small systems.</description>

      <title>Finite density QCD equation of state: critical point and lattice-based $T'$-expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel construction of the QCD equation of state (EoS) at finite baryon density. Our work combines a recently proposed resummation scheme for lattice QCD results with the universal critical behavior at the QCD critical point. This allows us to obtain a family of equations of state in the range $0 \leq \mu_B \leq 700$ MeV and 25 MeV $\leq T \leq 800$ MeV, which match lattice QCD results near $\mu_B=0$ while featuring a critical point in the 3D Ising model universality class. The position of the critical point can be chosen within the range accessible to beam-energy scan heavy-ion collision experiments. The strength of the singularity and the shape of the critical region are parameterized using a standard parameter set. We impose stability and causality constraints and discuss the available ranges of critical point parameter choices, finding that they extend beyond earlier parametric QCD EoS proposals. We present thermodynamic observables, including baryon density, pressure, entropy density, energy density, baryon susceptibility and speed of sound, that cover a wide range in the QCD phase diagram relevant for experimental exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A relativistic microscopic optical model potential for nucleon-nucleus scattering is developed based on the \emph{ab initio} relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) theory with the improved local density approximation, which is abbreviated as the RBOM potential. Both real and imaginary parts of the single-particle potentials in symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter at various densities are determined uniquely in the full Dirac space. The density distributions of the target nuclei are calculated by the covariant energy density functional theory with the density functional PC-PK1. The central and spin-orbit terms of the optical potentials are quantitatively consistent with the relativistic phenomenological optical potentials. The performance of the RBOM potential is evaluated by considering proton scattering with incident energy $E\leq 200$ MeV on five target nuclei, $\prescript{208}{}{\text{Pb}}$, $\prescript{120}{}{\text{Sn}}$, $\prescript{90}{}{\text{Zr}}$, $\prescript{48}{}{\text{Ca}}$, and $\prescript{40}{}{\text{Ca}}$. Scattering observables including the elastic scattering angular distributions, analyzing powers, spin rotation functions, and reaction cross sections are analyzed. Theoretical predictions show good agreements with the experimental data and the results derived from phenomenological optical potentials. We anticipate that the RBOM potential can provide reference for other phenomenological and microscopic optical model potentials, as well as reliable descriptions for nucleon scattering on exotic nuclei in the era of rare-isotope beams.</description>

Abstract: Within a 2+1 flavor Nambu\textendash Jona-Lasinio model, we calculate the curvature coefficients and check them against available lattice QCD estimations. With the observation that the flavor mixing due to the `t Hooft determinant term significantly affects the $\kappa_{2}^{S}$, we explore the effect of $\mu_{S}$ on the $T-\mu_{B}$ crossover lines. With the novel determination of negative $\kappa_{2}^{B}$ at large $\mu_{S}$, we advocate the importance of studying the same in lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Nuclear rainbow of the symmetric nucleus-nucleus system: Interchange of the nearside and farside scattering</title>

Abstract: Extensive elastic scattering data measured at energies around 10 to 20 MeV/nucleon for some identical systems, like 12C+12C and 16O+16O, exhibit the nuclear rainbow pattern of broad Airy oscillations of the cross section at medium and large angles. Due to the identity of the scattered projectile and recoiled target, the rainbow pattern at angles around and beyond $\theta_{\rm c.m.}\approx 90^\circ$ is strongly deteriorated by the boson exchange. The nuclear rainbow features in the identical-particles elastic scattering discussed so far are based on the nearside-farside (NF) decomposition of the scattering amplitude given by an optical model calculation neglecting the projectile-target exchange symmetry. Moreover, the NF decomposition method was developed in the 70s by Fuller for nonidentical systems only, and the details of how the exchange symmetry of an identical system affects the evolution of nuclear rainbow remain unexplored. Therefore, the Fuller method is generalized in this work for the elastic scattering of two identical (spin-zero) nuclei, with the projectile-target exchange symmetry taken explicitly into account. The results obtained for elastic 12C+12C and 16O+16O scattering at low energies show the exchange symmetry results in a symmetric interchange of the nearside and farside patterns at angles passing $\theta_{\rm c.m.}=90^\circ$, which requires a more subtle interpretation of nuclear rainbow. We also found that a similar NF interchange occurs in a nonidentical nucleus-nucleus system with the core-core symmetry, where the elastic cross section at backward angles is due mainly to the elastic transfer of cluster or nucleon between two identical cores. This interesting effect is illustrated in the elastic 16O+12C scattering at low energies where the elastic $\alpha$ transfer between two 12C cores has been proven to enhance the elastic cross section at backward angles.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Relativistic Hartree-Fock model with spherical symmetry</title>

Abstract: This work establishes the time-dependent relativistic Hartree-Fock (TD-RHF) model with spherical symmetry for the first time. The time-dependent integro-differential Dirac equations are solved by expanding Dirac spinors on the spherical Dirac Woods-Saxon (DWS) basis. The numerical verification demonstrates the high conservation qualities for both the total binding energy and the particle number, as well as the time-reversal invariance of the system, which ensures the precision and reliability of the newly developed TD-RHF model. Subsequently, the isoscalar giant monopole resonance (ISGMR) mode of $^{208}$Pb is investigated using the RHF Lagrangian PKO1. The constrained energy of the ISGMR calculated by PKO1 is found to be in close agreement with the experimental data, and the strength function is similar to the results given by the relativistic Hartree-Fock plus random phase approximation. Based on the advantage of the TD-RHF model in avoiding complicated calculations of the residual interactions, the ISGMR mode of $^{208}$Pb is calculated by twelve relativistic effective Lagrangians. The results indicate that the value of the incompressibility of nuclear matter $K_\infty$ constrained by relativistic effective Lagrangians is in the range of $237\sim246$ MeV, which is lower than the previous investigations based on the relativistic models.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Asymptotic Behavior of S-matrix Elements from their Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The asymptotic kinematic limits of S-matrices are dominated by large logarithms which, roughly speaking, fall into two categories: those which are controlled by a renormalization group (RG) scale, which we may think of as logs involving ratios of invariant mass scales, and those which are functions of ratios of rapidities, so called "rapidity logs". It has been pointed out by Caron-Huot and Wilhlem [1] that RG anomalous dimension can be extracted from the phase of the S-matrix, which can greatly simplify calculations via unitarity methods. In this paper we generalize the results of [1] to show that the phase can be used to reconstruct rapidity anomalous dimensions, by performing a complex boost. The methodology introduced here also allows one to calculate without the need for a rapidity regulator. We demonstrate the use of this method to derive the rapidity anomalous dimensions in the Sudakov form factor, the two parton soft function and the Regge trajectory in QCD.</description>
