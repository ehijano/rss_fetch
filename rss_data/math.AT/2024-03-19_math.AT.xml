      <title>Homotopy BV-algebras in Hermitian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the de Rham complex of any almost Hermitian manifold carries a natural commutative $BV_\infty$-algebra structure satisfying the degeneration property. In the almost K\"ahler case, this recovers Koszul's BV-algebra, defined for any Poisson manifold. As a consequence, both the Dolbeault and the de Rham cohomologies of any compact Hermitian manifold are canonically endowed with homotopy hypercommutative algebra structures, also known as formal homotopy Frobenius manifolds. Similar results are developed for (almost) symplectic manifolds with Lagrangian subbundles.</description>

      <title>Some geometric and topological data-driven methods in robot motion path planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion path planning is an intrinsically geometric problem which is central for design of robot systems. Since the early years of AI, robotics together with computer vision have been the areas of computer science that drove its development. Many questions that arise, such as existence, optimality, and diversity of motion paths in the configuration space that describes feasible robot configurations, are of topological nature. The recent advances in topological data analysis and related metric geometry, topology and combinatorics have provided new tools to address these engineering tasks. We will survey some questions, issues, recent work and promising directions in data-driven geometric and topological methods with some emphasis on the use of discrete Morse theory.</description>

      <title>Structural Validation Of Synthetic Power Distribution Networks Using The Multiscale Flat Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of comparing a pair of geometric networks that may not be similarly defined, i.e., when they do not have one-to-one correspondences between their nodes and edges. Our motivating application is to compare power distribution networks of a region. Due to the lack of openly available power network datasets, researchers synthesize realistic networks resembling their actual counterparts. But the synthetic digital twins may vary significantly from one another and from actual networks due to varying underlying assumptions and approaches. Hence the user wants to evaluate the quality of networks in terms of their structural similarity to actual power networks. But the lack of correspondence between the networks renders most standard approaches, e.g., subgraph isomorphism and edit distance, unsuitable.
  We propose an approach based on the multiscale flat norm, a notion of distance between objects defined in the field of geometric measure theory, to compute the distance between a pair of planar geometric networks. Using a triangulation of the domain containing the input networks, the flat norm distance between two networks at a given scale can be computed by solving a linear program. In addition, this computation automatically identifies the 2D regions (patches) that capture where the two networks are different. We demonstrate through 2D examples that the flat norm distance can capture the variations of inputs more accurately than the commonly used Hausdorff distance. As a notion of stability, we also derive upper bounds on the flat norm distance between a simple 1D curve and its perturbed version as a function of the radius of perturbation for a restricted class of perturbations. We demonstrate our approach on a set of actual power networks from a county in the USA.</description>

      <title>Morse Theory for the k-NN Distance Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $k$-th nearest neighbor distance function from a finite point-set in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We provide a Morse theoretic framework to analyze the sub-level set topology. In particular, we present a simple combinatorial-geometric characterization for critical points and their indices, along with detailed information about the possible changes in homology at the critical levels. We conclude by computing the expected number of critical points for a homogeneous Poisson process. Our results deliver significant insights and tools for the analysis of persistent homology in order-$k$ Delaunay mosaics, and random $k$-fold coverage.</description>

      <title>On the Universal Coefficient Formula and Derived $\varprojlim ^{(i)} $ Functor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.00468v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that homology and inverse limit functors do not commute. In the paper we consider this very problem and find its application for various homology theories. In particular, on the category of general topological spaces, there are defined exact homology functors induced by different non-free cochain complexes. Relation between them and other classical homology theories are given. In addition, for the defined homology functors the tautness and the continuous properties are obtained.</description>

      <title>Algebraic $K$-theory of the two-periodic first Morava $K$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the root adjunction formalism developed in an earlier work and logarithmic THH, we obtain a simplified computation of $T(2)_*\text{K}(ku)$ for $p&gt;3$. Through this, we also produce a new algebraic $K$-theory computation; namely we obtain $T(2)_*\text{K}(ku/p)$, where $ku/p$ is the $2$-periodic Morava $K$-theory spectrum of height $1$.</description>

      <title>Soft random simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$ can be obtained from the random geometric graph $G(n,r)$ by keeping every edge in $G(n,r)$ with probability $p$. This random graph is a particular case of the soft random graph model introduced by Penrose, in which the probability between 2 vertices is a function that depends on the distance between them. In this article, we define models for random simplicial complexes built over the soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$, which also present randomness in all other dimensions. Furthermore, we study the homology of those random simplicial complexes in different regimes of $n,r$, and $p$ by giving asymptotic formulas for the expectation of the Betti numbers in the sparser regimes, and bounds in the denser regimes.</description>

      <title>Operations on the Hochschild Bicomplex of a Diagram of Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.00886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A diagram of algebras is a functor valued in a category of associative algebras. I construct an operad acting on the Hochschild bicomplex of a diagram of algebras. Using this operad, I give a direct proof that the Hochschild cohomology of a diagram of algebras is a Gerstenhaber algebra. I also show that the total complex is an $L_\infty$-algebra. The same results are true for the reduced and asimplicial subcomplexes and asimplicial cohomology. This structure governs deformations of diagrams of algebras through the Maurer-Cartan equation.</description>

      <title>The Brasselet-Sch\"urmann-Yokura conjecture on $L$-classes of singular varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.11537v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2010, Brasselet, Sch\"urmann and Yokura conjectured an equality of characteristic classes of singular varieties between the Goresky-MacPherson $L$-class $L_*(X)$ and the Hirzebruch homology class $T_{1*}(X)$ for a compact complex algebraic variety $X$ that is a rational homology manifold. In this note we give a proof of this conjecture for projective varieties based on cubical hyperresolutions, the Decomposition Theorem, and Hodge theory. The crucial step of the proof is a new characterization of rational homology manifolds in terms of cubical hyperresolutions which we find of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.16614v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that both the local and global $\mathbb{A}^1$-degree of an endomorphism of affine space can be computed in terms of the multivariate B\'ezoutian. In particular, we show that the B\'ezoutian bilinear form, the Scheja--Storch form, and the $\mathbb{A}^1$-degree for complete intersections are isomorphic. Our global theorem generalizes Cazanave's theorem in the univariate case, and our local theorem generalizes Kass--Wickelgren's theorem on EKL forms and the local degree. This result provides an algebraic formula for local and global degrees in motivic homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>The Shift-Dimension of Multipersistence Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.06509v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the shift-dimension of multipersistence modules and investigate its algebraic properties. This gives rise to a new invariant of multigraded modules over the multivariate polynomial ring arising from the hierarchical stabilization of the zeroth total multigraded Betti number. We give a fast algorithm for the computation of the shift-dimension of interval modules in the bivariate case. We construct multipersistence contours that are parameterized by multivariate functions and hence provide a large class of feature maps for machine learning tasks.</description>
