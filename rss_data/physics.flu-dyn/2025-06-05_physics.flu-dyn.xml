      <title>Thermodynamics and Statistical Equilibrium of Large-Scale Hydroelastic Wave Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how statistical equilibrium can occur in out-of-equilibrium systems is of paramount interest, as it would enable the use of statistical mechanics tools to these systems. Here, we report the first experimental evidence of statistical equilibrium of the large scales of hydroelastic turbulent waves driven by small-scale random forcing. The wave field statistics at scales larger than the forcing scale, resolved in space and time, align well with the predictions of Rayleigh-Jeans equilibrium spectra over more than a decade. We measure zero net energy flux in this regime, as expected. We also determine the effective temperature, entropy, and heat capacity of this nonequilibrium system, demonstrating that classical thermodynamic concepts apply to describe large scales in statistical equilibrium of turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>Technical report on a quantum-inspired solver for simulating compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document presents a quantum-inspired solver for 2D Euler equations, accepted at the final phase of the Airbus-BWM Group Quantum Computing Challenge (ABQCC) 2024. We tackle the case study of Quantum Solvers for Predictive Aeroacoustic and Aerodynamic modeling tasks. We propose a tensor network based solver that scales polylogarithmically with the mesh size, in both runtime and memory. This provides a promising avenue for tackling the curse of dimensionality that plagues the direct numerical simulations in the field of computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>An integrated multi-size collision model for flotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy obtained with CFD and process simulations of flotation critically depends on the quality and robustness of the underlying models for the non-resolved sub-processes. An important issue in flotation is the collision between particles and air bubbles. Many models have been developed, but their accuracy for applications in flotation is limited. In particular, the significant size difference between particles and bubbles and their intricate coupling to the turbulent flow field pose severe challenges. The present paper first reviews presently employed collision models, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages when applied to flotation. On this basis, the "Integrated Multi-Size Collision model" (IMSC) is proposed. After a detailed evaluation, it combines existing approaches from various sources and introduces new developments designed to address present shortcomings. The model is validated by own DNS data as well as data from the literature. It is shown that, overall, the IMSC provides better predictions for the collision rate in typical flotation conditions than presently employed collision models and covers the entire parameter range of the flotation process very well. Using the available data, some of the underlying modelling assumptions are validated. Finally, a comprehensive overview of the model is provided for further use in Euler-Euler frameworks or process simulations.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann wall boundary conditions for RANS-based simulations with wall functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate wall boundary condition schemes for Lattice Boltzmann simulations of turbulent flows modeled using RANS equations with wall functions. Two alternative schemes are formulated and assessed: a hybrid regularized boundary condition and a slip-velocity bounce-back scheme. Their performance is evaluated using two canonical turbulent flow cases, a fully developed channel flow and a zero-pressure-gradient flat plate boundary layer (BL), selected specifically to isolate and analyze the impact of wall boundary condition treatments on turbulence modeling. The comparative analysis reveals that the slip-velocity bounce-back approach, which has received relatively little attention within the context of LBM-RANS with wall functions, consistently outperforms the regularized-based method in terms of both accuracy and sensitivity to mesh resolution. Moreover, the regularized-based approach is shown to be highly sensitive to the reconstruction of the wall-normal velocity gradient, even in simple geometries such as flat walls where no interpolation is required. This dependency necessitates the use of specialized, ad-hoc gradient reconstruction techniques, requirements that are not present in the slip-velocity bounce-back method.</description>

      <title>Simulating fluid vortex interactions on a superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex interactions are commonly observed in atmospheric turbulence, plasma dynamics, and collective behaviors in biological systems. However, accurately simulating these complex interactions is highly challenging due to the need to capture fine-scale details over extended timescales, which places computational burdens on traditional methods. In this study, we introduce a quantum vortex method, reformulating the Navier--Stokes (NS) equations within a quantum mechanical framework to enable the simulation of multi-vortex interactions on a quantum computer. We construct the effective Hamiltonian for the vortex system and implement a spatiotemporal evolution circuit to simulate its dynamics over prolonged periods. By leveraging eight qubits on a superconducting quantum processor with gate fidelities of 99.97\% for single-qubit gates and 99.76\% for two-qubit gates, we successfully reproduce natural vortex interactions. This method bridges classical fluid dynamics and quantum computing, offering a novel computational platform for studying vortex dynamics. Our results demonstrate the potential of quantum computing to tackle longstanding challenges in fluid dynamics and broaden applications across both natural and engineering systems.</description>

      <title>Melting of floating ice cylinders in fresh and saline environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally investigated the melting of floating ice cylinders. Experiments were carried out in a tank, with ice cylinders with radii between 5 cm and 12 cm, floating horizontally with their axis perpendicular to gravity. The water in the tank was at room temperature, with salinities ranging from 0 g/L to 35 g/L. These conditions correspond to Rayleigh numbers in the range $10^5 \lesssim \mathrm{Ra} \lesssim 10^9$. The relative density and thus the floating behaviour was varied by employing ice made of H$_2$O-D$_2$O mixtures. In addition, we explored a two-layer stable stratification. We studied the morphological evolution of the cross-section of the cylinders and interpreted our observations in the context of their interaction with the convective flow. The cylinders only capsize in fresh water but not when the ambient is saline. This behaviour can be explained by the balance between the torques exerted by buoyancy and drag, which change as the cylinder melts and rotates. We modelled the oscillatory motion of the cylinders after a capsize as a damped non-linear oscillator. The downward plume of the ice cylinders follows the expected scalings for a line-source plume. The plume's Reynolds number scales with Rayleigh number in two regimes, namely $\mathrm{Re} \propto \mathrm{Ra}^{1/2}$ for $\mathrm{Ra} &lt; O(10^7)$ and $\mathrm{Re} \propto \mathrm{Ra}^{1/3}$ for $\mathrm{Ra} &gt; O(10^7)$, and the heat transfer (nondimensional as Nusselt number) scales as $\mathrm{Nu} \propto \mathrm{Ra}^{1/3}$. Although the addition of salt substantially alters the solutal, thermal and momentum boundary layers, these scaling relations hold irrespectively of the initial size or the water salinity. While important differences exist between our experiments and real icebergs, our results can qualitatively be connected to natural phenomena occurring in fjords and around isolated icebergs.</description>

      <title>Analysis of In-cylinder Flow Structures and Turbulence in a Laboratory Scale Engine using Direct Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-cylinder flow structures and turbulence characteristics are investigated using direct numerical simulations (DNS) in a laboratory-scale engine at technically relevant engine speeds (1500 and 2500 rpm at full load). The data is computed for 12 compression-expansion cycles at each engine speed with initial conditions derived from precursor large eddy simulations (LES) validated against experimental data. Analysis of the tumble ratio indicates significant cycle-to-cycle variation, with lower variability found at higher engine speed. The process of tumble breakdown, quantified by the evolution of mean and turbulent kinetic energy, reveals distinct features between operating conditions, with delayed turbulence peaks observed at lower engine speed. Analysis of the Reynolds stress tensor demonstrates higher stress values at higher engine speed, with pronounced anisotropy near the walls and higher values around the tumble vortex core. Examination of the anisotropic Reynolds stress invariants through Lumley triangles reveals predominantly isotropic turbulence during mid-compression, transitioning to distinct anisotropic states near top dead center (TDC). The lower engine speed exhibits a stronger tendency toward one-component turbulence due to partial tumble dissipation, while the higher speed maintains a more balanced anisotropy. These findings extend previous numerical and experimental studies on turbulence development and in-cylinder flow structures during the compression stroke, providing insights for improving turbulence modeling in practical engine simulations.</description>

      <title>UniFoil: A Universal Dataset of Airfoils in Transitional and Turbulent Regimes for Subsonic and Transonic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present UniFoil, a large publicly available universal airfoil dataset based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations. It contains over 500,000 samples spanning a wide range of Reynolds and Mach numbers, capturing both transitional and fully turbulent flows across incompressible to compressible regimes. UniFoil is designed to support machine learning research in fluid dynamics, particularly for modeling complex aerodynamic phenomena. Most existing datasets are limited to incompressible, fully turbulent flows with smooth field characteristics, overlooking the critical physics of laminar\-turbulent transition and shock\-wave interactions\-features that exhibit strong nonlinearity and sharp gradients. UniFoil addresses this limitation by offering a broad spectrum of realistic flow conditions. Turbulent simulations utilize the Spalart\-Allmaras (SA) model, while transitional flows are modeled using an e^N\-based transition prediction method coupled with the SA model. The dataset includes a comprehensive geometry set comprising over 4,800 natural laminar flow (NLF) airfoils and 30,000 fully turbulent (FT) airfoils, covering a diverse range of airfoil designs relevant to aerospace, wind energy, and marine applications. This dataset is also valuable for scientific machine learning, enabling the development of data-driven models that more accurately capture the transport processes associated with laminar-turbulent transition. UniFoil is freely available under a permissive CC\-BY\-SA license.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Solid-Fluid Interaction Scheme in Lattice Boltzmann Immiscible Pseudopotential Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pseudopotential model within the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) framework has emerged as a prominent approach in computational fluid dynamics due to its dual strengths in physical intuitiveness and computational tractability. However, when modeling wettability phenomenon, existing solid-fluid interaction schemes exhibit persistent challenges in multi-component immiscible fluid systems, notably manifested through spurious velocity artifacts and unphysical mass-transfer boundary layers. This study presents an improved interaction scheme that preserves implementation simplicity while effectively mitigating these numerical artifacts. Furthermore, leveraging the enhanced isotropy characteristics of eighth-order discrete schemes, we develop a novel boundary treatment methodology addressing second-layer lattice data reconstruction at complex interfaces. To verify the universality of the proposed optimization scheme, four benchmark scenarios, including static contact angle measurement on cylindrical surface, droplet dynamics through confined geometries, immiscible displacement processes, and co-current flow in microchannels, are simulated to demonstrate the proposed scheme's capability. The results show that the improved scheme can well simulate various complex immiscible multiphase flows.</description>

      <title>Extracting dominant dynamics about unsteady base flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wide range of techniques exist for extracting the dominant flow dynamics and features about steady, or periodic base flows. However, there have been limited efforts in extracting the dominant dynamics about unsteady, aperiodic base flow. These flows appear in many applications such as when there is a sudden change in the flow rate through a pipe, when an airfoil experiences stall, or when a vortex forms. For these unsteady flows, it is valuable to know not only the dynamics of the base flow but also the features that form around this base flow. Here, we discuss the current state of research on extracting important flow structures and their dynamics in such cases with time-varying base flows. In particular, we consider data-driven decompositions, operator-based methods, causality analysis, and some other approaches. We also offer an outlook and call attention to key areas that require future efforts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01494v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue study of equilibrium of two species of 2d coulomb charges (or point vortices in 2d ideal fluid) started in (Igor Loutsenko, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 37, 1309, 2004). Although for two species of vortices with circulation ratio -1 the relationship between the equilibria and the factorization/Darboux transformation of the Schrodinger operator was established a long ago, the question about similar relationship for the ratio -2 remained unanswered. Here we present the answer: One has to consider Darboux-type transformations of third order differential operators rather than second order Schrodinger operators. Furthermore, we show that such transformations can also generate equilibrium configurations where an additional charge of a third specie is present. Relationship with integrable hierarchies is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation for the linear theory of relativistic Rayleigh Taylor instability in magnetized medium revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) arises at the interface between two fluids of different densities, notably when a heavier fluid lies above a lighter one in an effective gravitational field. In astrophysical systems with high velocities, relativistic corrections are necessary. We investigate the linear theory of relativistic Rayleigh-Taylor instability (R-RTI) in a magnetized medium, where fluids can move parallel to the interface at relativistic velocities. We chose an "intermediate frame" where fluids on each side of the interface move in opposite directions with identical Lorentz factors gamma_*. This symmetry facilitates analytical derivations and the study of relativistic effects on the instability's dynamics. We derive the correct version of the R-RTI. We find that the instability is activated when the Atwood number A = (rho1 h1 - rho2 h2) / (rho1 h1 + rho2 h2) &gt; 0, where rho1 and rho2 are densities measured in the rest frame of the fluids, and that this criterion does not contain relativistic corrections. The relativistic effect is mostly contained in the Lorentz transformation of the gravitational acceleration g' = g / (gamma_*)^2, which, combined with time dilation, leads to a much slower growth of instability (omega' = omega0 / gamma_*), and a slightly elongated length of the unstable patch, due to weaker g in the intermediate frame. Taking time dilation into account, when viewed in the rest frame of the medium, we expect the instability to grow at a much reduced rate. The analytical results should guide further explorations of instability in systems such as microquasars (muQSOs), active galactic nuclei (AGNs), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and radio pulsars (PSRs), where the apparent stability of the jet can be attributed to either the intrinsic stability (e.g. the Atwood number) or the much prolonged duration through which R-RTI can grow.</description>

      <title>Large charge operators at large spin from relativistically rotating vortices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the ground states of CFTs with a global $U(1)$ symmetry on $\mathbb{R}\times S^2$ in the regime of large charge $Q$ and large angular momentum $J$, using large charge EFT. We find that in the range $Q \ll J \ll Q^2$, the ground state solution is a superfluid densely populated with vortices rotating at a constant angular velocity $\Omega$. This is a relativistic generalization of the known (non-relativistic) rigid rotation phase, which corresponds to the small $\Omega$ limit of our solution. In the regime $Q^{3/2}\ll J\ll Q^2$, our solution achieves lower energy than previously identified states. In this regime, most of the vortices move near the speed of light, and we obtain the chiral fluctuation modes propagating at the speed of light. Interestingly, we find that our ground state can be interpreted as a zero temperature charged normal fluid rotating at a constant angular velocity $\Omega$. We rederive this solution purely from the fluid dynamics. Based on the (already established) applicability of fluid description to large non-supersymmetric extremal AdS black holes, we find that the boundary stress tensor and $U(1)$ current of extremal AdS Kerr-Newman black hole align with those of our solution.</description>

Abstract: The remarkable cohesion and coordination observed in moving animal groups and their collective responsiveness to threats are thought to be mediated by scale-free correlations, where changes in the behavior of one animal influence others in the group, regardless of the distance between them. But are these features independent of group size? Here, we investigate group cohesiveness and collective responsiveness in computational models of massive schools of fish of up to 50,000 individuals. We show that as the number of swimmers increases, flow interactions destabilize the school, creating clusters that constantly fragment, disperse, and regroup, similar to their biological counterparts. We calculate the spatial correlation and speed of information propagation in these dynamic clusters. Spatial correlations in cohesive and polarized clusters are indeed scale free, much like in natural animal groups, but fragmentation events are preceded by a decrease in correlation length, thus diminishing the group's collective responsiveness, leaving it more vulnerable to predation events. Importantly, in groups undergoing collective turns, the information about the change in direction propagates linearly in time among group members, thanks to the non-reciprocal nature of the visual interactions between individuals. Merging speeds up the transfer of information within each cluster by several fold, while fragmentation slows it down. Our findings suggest that flow interactions may have played an important role in group size regulation, behavioral adaptations, and dispersion in living animal groups.</description>
