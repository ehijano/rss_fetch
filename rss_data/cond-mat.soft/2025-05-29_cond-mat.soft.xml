      <title>Rolling, sliding and trapping of driven particles in square obstacle lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport phenomena in complex and dynamic microscopic environments are fundamentally shaped by hydrodynamic interactions. In particular, microparticle transport in porous media is governed by the delicate interplay between particle-substrate friction and pressure forces. Here, we systematically investigate the motion of externally driven rotating magnetic microparticles near a substrate patterned with a square lattice of cylindrical obstacles, a model porous medium. Remarkably, we observe a reversal in the direction of particle translation as obstacle spacing decreases, highlighting a sensitive competition between shear-induced forward rolling and pressure-driven backward sliding due to flow-field symmetry breaking. These results demonstrate the crucial role of structured environments in determining microscale active particle transport, offering novel strategies for microfluidic design, targeted cargo delivery, and tunable active materials.</description>

      <title>Viscoelasticity of biomimetic scale beams from trapped complex fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of a biomimetic scale-covered beam in which shear-dependent complex fluids are trapped between overlapping scales under bending loads. These fluids mimic biological mucus and slime layers commonly enveloping the skins found in nature. An energy-based analytical model is developed to quantify the interplay between substrate elasticity, scale geometry, and fluid rheology at multiple length scales. Constant strain rate and oscillatory bending are examined for Newtonian, shear-thinning, and shear-thickening fluids. The analysis reveals unique, geometry- and rate-dependent viscoelastic response, distinct from classical mechanisms such as material dissipation, frictional resistance, or air drag. Energy dissipation is shown to emerge from a nonlinear coupling of tribological parameters, fluid rheology, and system kinematics, exhibiting distinct regime-differentiated characteristics. The model captures the competitions and cooperations between elastic and geometrical parameters to influence the viscoelastic behavior and lead to geometry and rheology scaling laws for relative energy dissipation. The pronounced nonlinearity in the moment-curvature relationships, along with the geometry-controlled regimes of performance, highlights the potential for using tailored and engineered complex inks for soft robotics and smart damping systems.</description>

      <title>Active Hyperuniform Networks of Chiral Magnetic Micro-Robotic Spinners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder hyperuniform (DHU) systems possess a hidden long-range order manifested as the complete suppression of normalized large-scale density fluctuations like crystals, which endows them with many unique properties. Here, we demonstrate a new organization mechanism for achieving stable DHU structures in active-particle systems via investigating the self-assembly of robotic spinners with three-fold symmetric magnetic binding sites up to a heretofore experimentally unattained system size, i.e., with $\sim 1000$ robots. The spinners can self-organize into a wide spectrum of actively rotating three-coordinated network structures, among which a set of stable DHU networks robustly emerge. These DHU networks are topological transformations of a honeycomb network by continuously introducing the Stone-Wales defects, which are resulted from the competition between tunable magnetic binding and local twist due to active rotation of the robots. Our results reveal novel mechanisms for emergent DHU states in active systems and achieving novel DHU materials with desirable properties.</description>

      <title>Stress distribution in elastic disks with a hole under uniaxial compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stress and displacement distribution in a two-dimensional elastic hollow disk subjected to distributed diametric loading, extending our previous analysis of concentrated loading [Okamura et al. Strength Mater. 57, 102-114 (2025)]. The study provides deeper insights into the mechanical behavior of materials such as concrete and rock by examining the effects of load distribution on stress localization and displacement patterns. Using elastodynamic theory, we derive the static stress distributions and identify key differences from the concentrated loading case, particularly in the locations and magnitudes of stress extrema. This work contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of stress behavior in elastic disks under realistic loading conditions.</description>

      <title>Softness and Hydrodynamic Interactions Regulate Lipoprotein Transport in Crowded Yolk Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) serve as nutrient reservoirs in egg yolk for embryonic development and as promising drug carriers. Both roles critically depend on their mobility in densely crowded biological environments. Under these crowded conditions, diffusion is hindered by transient confinement within dynamic cages formed by neighboring particles, driven by solvent-mediated hydrodynamic interactions and memory effects -- phenomena that have remained challenging to characterize computationally and experimentally. Here, we employ megahertz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy to directly probe the cage dynamics of LDLs in yolk-plasma across various concentrations. We find that LDLs undergo anomalous diffusion, experiencing $\approx$ 100-fold reduction in self-diffusion at high concentrations compared to dilute solutions. This drastic slowing-down is attributed to a combination of hydrodynamic interactions, direct particle-particle interactions, and the inherent softness of LDL particles. Despite reduced dynamics, yolk-plasma remains as a liquid, yet sluggish, balancing dense packing, structural stability, and fluidity essential for controlled lipid release during embryogenesis.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Guided Mechanics and Design of Spinodal and Shell-Based Architected Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Additively manufactured (AM) architected materials have enabled unprecedented control over mechanical properties of engineered materials. While lattice architectures have played a key role in these advances, they suffer from stress concentrations at sharp joints and bending-dominated behavior at high relative densities, limiting their mechanical efficiency. Additionally, high-resolution AM techniques often result in low-throughput or costly fabrication, restricting manufacturing scalability of these materials. Aperiodic spinodal architected materials offer a promising alternative by leveraging low-curvature architectures that can be fabricated through techniques beyond AM. Enabled by phase separation processes, these architectures exhibit tunable mechanical properties and enhanced defect tolerance by tailoring their curvature distributions. However, the relation between curvature and their anisotropic mechanical behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to quantify the role of curvature in governing the anisotropic stiffness and strength of shell-based spinodal architected materials. We introduce geometric metrics that predict the distribution of stretching and bending energies under different loading conditions, bridging the gap between curvature in doubly curved shell-based morphologies and their mechanical anisotropy. We validate our framework through finite element simulations and microscale experiments, demonstrating its utility in designing mechanically robust spinodal architectures. This study provides fundamental insights into curvature-driven mechanics, guiding the optimization of next-generation architected materials for engineering applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To express the capillary stress in the diffuse interface method, there are two different formulations in the literature: one formulation is proportional to the density and the other is to the density gradient. In the present study, we theoretically show that only the latter represents the capillary stress in one-component fluids and the former represents the stress related to the osmotic pressure.</description>

      <title>Multi-phase-field Models of Biological Tissues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of complex multicellular organisms from a single parent cell is a highly orchestrated process that cells conduct collectively without central guidance, creating intricate dynamic patterns essential for development and regeneration. Despite significant advances in imaging spatiotemporal dynamics of cell collectives and mechanical characterization techniques, the role of physical forces in biological functions remains poorly understood. Physics-based models are crucial in complementing experiments, providing high-resolution spatiotemporal fields in three dimensions. This review focuses on dense, soft multicellular systems, such as tissues, where mechanical deformation of one cell necessitates the re-organization of neighboring cells. The multi-phase-field model offers a rich physics-based framework to advance our understanding of biological systems and provides a robust playground for non-equilibrium physics of active matter. We discuss the foundational aspects of the multi-phase-field model and their applications in understanding physics of active matter. We also explore the integration of biological physics with experimental data, covering cell migration, heterogeneous cell populations, and confined systems. Finally, we highlight current trends, the importance of multi-phase-field models in biological and physics research, and future challenges.</description>

      <title>Adhesion differentials control the rheology of biomimetic emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Animal morphogenesis involves complex tissue deformation processes, which require tight control over tissue rheology. Yet, it remains insufficiently understood how tissue rheology results from the interplay between cellular packing and cellular forces, such as cortical tension, cell pressure, and cell-cell adhesion. Here, we follow a biomimetic approach to study this interplay, focusing on the cellular adhesion hierarchy. We mimic adhesive cells with oil droplets whose adhesion strength and specificity can be flexibly tuned. Using microfluidics, we expose 2D emulsions to an oscillatory shear, and we develop a geometric method to quantify their rheology using only imaging data. We find that emulsions made of two droplet types with a high adhesion differential progressively change their yielding behavior across subsequent shear cycles. Combining this with vertex model simulations, we show that the observed drift in yielding behavior is due to a progressive compaction, which only occurs in emulsions with a high adhesion differential and only when exposed to oscillatory shear. Gradients of cell compaction have been observed during animal development. Our work demonstrates how such gradients can be used to control gradients of tissue rheological properties. Moreover, the progressive compaction suggests the emergence of a pumping mechanism, which potentially acts in many cellular materials, from tissues to foams.</description>

      <title>Wave front propagation in the Active Coagulation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spreading processes on top of active dynamics provide a novel theoretical framework for capturing emerging collective behavior in living systems. I consider run-and-tumble dynamics coupled with coagulation/decoagulation reactions that lead to an absorbing state phase transition. While the active dynamics does not change the location of the transition point, the relaxation toward the stationary state depends on motility parameters. Because of the competition between spreading dynamics and active motion, the system can support long-living currents whose typical time scale is a nontrivial function of motility and reaction rates. Because of this interplay between time-scales, the wave front propagation qualitatively changes from traveling to diffusive waves. Moving beyond the mean-field regime, instability at finite length scales regulates a crossover from periodic to diffusive modes. Finally, it is possible to individuate different mechanisms of pattern formation on a large time scale, ranging from the Fisher-Kolmogorov to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.</description>

      <title>Hydrogel-to-Aerogel Transitions in Polymer-Particle Hydrogels Expand the Wildfire Defense Window</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2025 Los Angeles wildfires caused widespread urban destruction and displacement, and severe economic losses, highlighting the urgent need for better fire retardants. Current fire suppression strategies rely heavily on water, chemical fire retardants, and water-enhancing gels, which use superabsorbent polymers to retain water and adhere to substrates, offering extended fire protection compared to water alone. However, their effectiveness is limited by evaporation and degradation under extreme heat and wind conditions. This study investigates the thermal properties, evaporation dynamics, and fire retardancy mechanisms of a novel polymer-particle (PP) hydrogel with aerogel-forming capabilities. The boiling-induced water vapor expansion and bubble nucleation drive the transformation of the hydrogel into a highly porous, foam-like fire-retardant coating upon rapid heat desiccation, enhancing thermal insulation. By evaluating the retardancy window across different evaporation stages under high heat and wind conditions, this study aims to determine the duration, effectiveness, and governing physical mechanisms of this unique retardant system. These findings provide a framework for designing the next generation of fire retardants with optimized thermal stability and extended protection for wildfire mitigation.</description>
