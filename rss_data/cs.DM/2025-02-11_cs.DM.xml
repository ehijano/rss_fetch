      <title>Counting Tree-Like Multigraphs with a Given Number of Vertices and Multiple Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enumeration of chemical graphs is an important topic in cheminformatics and bioinformatics, particularly in the discovery of novel drugs. These graphs are typically either tree-like multigraphs or composed of tree-like multigraphs connected to a core structure. In both cases, the tree-like components play a significant role in determining the properties and activities of chemical compounds. This paper introduces a method based on dynamic programming to efficiently count tree-like multigraphs with a given number $n$ of vertices and $\Delta$ multiple edges. The idea of our method is to consider multigraphs as rooted multigraphs by selecting their unicentroid or bicentroid as the root, and define their canonical representation based on maximal subgraphs rooted at the children of the root. This representation guarantees that our proposed method will not repeat a multigraph in the counting process. Finally, recursive relations are derived based on the number of vertices and multiple edges in the maximal subgraphs rooted at the children of roots. These relations lead to an algorithm with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^2(n + \Delta (n + \Delta^2 \cdot \min\{n, \Delta\})))$ and a space complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^2(\Delta^3+1))$. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm efficiently counts the desired multigraphs with up to 170 vertices and 50 multiple edges in approximately 930 seconds, confirming its effectiveness and potential as a valuable tool for exploring the chemical graph space in novel drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Verified Certificates via SAT and Computer Algebra Systems for the Ramsey R(3, 8) and R(3, 9) Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ramsey problem R(3, k) seeks to determine the smallest value of n such that any red/blue edge coloring of the complete graph on n vertices must either contain a blue triangle (3-clique) or a red clique of size k. Despite its significance, many previous computational results for the Ramsey R(3, k) problem such as R(3, 8) and R(3, 9) lack formal verification. To address this issue, we use the software MATHCHECK to generate certificates for Ramsey problems R(3, 8) and R(3, 9) (and symmetrically R(8, 3) and R(9, 3)) by integrating a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver with a computer algebra system (CAS). Our SAT+CAS approach significantly outperforms traditional SAT-only methods, demonstrating a significant improvement in runtime. For instance, our SAT+CAS approach solves R(8, 3) sequentially in 18.5 hours, while a SAT-only approach using the state-of-the-art CaDiCaL solver times out after 7 days. Additionally, in order to be able to scale to harder Ramsey problem like R(9, 3) we further optimized our SAT+CAS tool using a parallelized cube-and-conquer approach. Our results provide the first independently verifiable certificates for these Ramsey numbers, ensuring both correctness and completeness of the exhaustive search process of our SAT+CAS tool.</description>

      <title>Induced Disjoint Paths Without an Induced Minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exhibit a new obstacle to the nascent algorithmic theory for classes excluding an induced minor. We indeed show that on the class of string graphs -- which avoids the 1-subdivision of, say, $K_5$ as an induced minor -- Induced 2-Disjoint Paths is NP-complete. So, while $k$-Disjoint Paths, for a fixed $k$, is polynomial-time solvable in general graphs, the absence of a graph as an induced minor does not make its induced variant tractable, even for $k=2$. This answers a question of Korhonen and Lokshtanov [SODA '24], and complements a polynomial-time algorithm for Induced $k$-Disjoint Paths in classes of bounded genus by Kobayashi and Kawarabayashi [SODA '09]. In addition to being string graphs, our produced hard instances are subgraphs of a constant power of bounded-degree planar graphs, hence have bounded twin-width and bounded maximum degree.
  We also leverage our new result to show that there is a fixed subcubic graph $H$ such that deciding if an input graph contains $H$ as an induced subdivision is NP-complete. Until now, all the graphs $H$ for which such a statement was known had a vertex of degree at least 4. This answers a question by Chudnovsky, Seymour, and the fourth author [JCTB '13], and by Le [JGT '19]. Finally we resolve another question of Korhonen and Lokshtanov by exhibiting a subcubic graph $H$ without two adjacent degree-3 vertices and such that deciding if an input $n$-vertex graph contains $H$ as an induced minor is NP-complete, and unless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis fails, requires time $2^{\Omega(\sqrt n)}$. This complements an algorithm running in subexponential time $2^{O(n^{2/3} \log n)}$ by these authors [SODA '24] under the same technical condition.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Blocking All Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the general problem of blocking all solutions of some given combinatorial problem with only few elements. For example, the problem of destroying all maximum cliques of a given graph by forbidding only few vertices. Problems of this kind are so fundamental that they have been studied under many different names in many different disjoint research communities already since the 90s. Depending on the context, they have been called the interdiction, most vital vertex, most vital edge, blocker, or vertex deletion problem. Despite their apparent popularity, surprisingly little is known about the computational complexity of interdiction problems in the case where the original problem is already NP-complete. In this paper, we fill that gap of knowledge by showing that a large amount of interdiction problems are even harder than NP-hard. Namely, they are complete for the second stage of Stockmeyer's polynomial hierarchy, the complexity class $\Sigma^p_2$. Such complexity insights are important because they imply that all these problems can not be modelled by a compact integer program (unless the unlikely conjecture NP $= \Sigma_2^p$ holds). Concretely, we prove $\Sigma^p_2$-completeness of the following interdiction problems: satisfiability, 3satisfiability, dominating set, set cover, hitting set, feedback vertex set, feedback arc set, uncapacitated facility location, $p$-center, $p$-median, independent set, clique, subset sum, knapsack, Hamiltonian path/cycle (directed/undirected), TSP, $k$ directed vertex disjoint path ($k \geq 2$), Steiner tree. We show that all of these problems share an abstract property which implies that their interdiction counterpart is $\Sigma_2^p$-complete. Thus, all of these problems are $\Sigma_2^p$-complete \enquote{for the same reason}. Our result extends a recent framework by Gr\"une and Wulf.</description>

      <title>Sink-free orientations: a local sampler with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For sink-free orientations in graphs of minimum degree at least $3$, we show that there is a deterministic approximate counting algorithm that runs in time $O((n^{73}/\varepsilon^{72})\log(n/\varepsilon))$, a near-linear time sampling algorithm, and a randomised approximate counting algorithm that runs in time $O((n/\varepsilon)^2\log(n/\varepsilon))$, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices of the input graph and $0&lt;\varepsilon&lt;1$ is the desired accuracy. All three algorithms are based on a local implementation of the sink popping method (Cohn, Pemantle, Propp, 2002) under the partial rejection sampling framework (Guo, Jerrum, Liu, 2019).</description>

      <title>Amnesiac Flooding: Easy to break, hard to escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broadcast is a central problem in distributed computing. Recently, Hussak and Trehan [PODC'19/DC'23] proposed a stateless broadcasting protocol (Amnesiac Flooding), which was surprisingly proven to terminate in asymptotically optimal time (linear in the diameter of the network). However, it remains unclear: (i) Are there other stateless terminating broadcast algorithms with the desirable properties of Amnesiac Flooding, (ii) How robust is Amnesiac Flooding with respect to \emph{faults}?
  In this paper we make progress on both of these fronts. Under a reasonable restriction (obliviousness to message content) additional to the fault-free synchronous model, we prove that Amnesiac Flooding is the \emph{only} strictly stateless deterministic protocol that can achieve terminating broadcast. We identify four natural properties of a terminating broadcast protocol that Amnesiac Flooding uniquely satisfies. In contrast, we prove that even minor relaxations of \textit{any} of these four criteria allow the construction of other terminating broadcast protocols.
  On the other hand, we prove that Amnesiac Flooding can become non-terminating or non-broadcasting, even if we allow just one node to drop a single message on a single edge in a single round. As a tool for proving this, we focus on the set of all \textit{configurations} of transmissions between nodes in the network, and obtain a \textit{dichotomy} characterizing the configurations, starting from which, Amnesiac Flooding terminates.
  Additionally, we characterise the structure of sets of Byzantine agents capable of forcing non-termination or non-broadcast of the protocol on arbitrary networks.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for congestion dynamics and related generalized exclusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider congestion dynamics with $n$ players and $Q$ resources under the constraint that the number of each resource is $\kappa$ and that $n&lt;\kappa Q$ in the regime that $n$ and $\kappa$ diverge but $Q$ is fixed with $n=\lfloor{\rho \kappa Q\rfloor}$ for a fixed constant $\rho \in (0, 1/2]$. We show that the Glauber dynamics and its unlabeled version exhibit cutoff at time $(1/2)n \log n$ and $(1/2)(1-\rho)n\log n$ in total variation respectively. The unlabeled version is a special case of natural Markov chains for sampling from log M-concave distributions. We also show that a family of Markov chains for uniform sampling on M-convex sets does not necessarily exhibit cutoff.</description>

      <title>On the Expressiveness of Rational ReLU Neural Networks With Bounded Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To confirm that the expressive power of ReLU neural networks grows with their depth, the function $F_n = \max \{0,x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ has been considered in the literature. A conjecture by Hertrich, Basu, Di Summa, and Skutella [NeurIPS 2021] states that any ReLU network that exactly represents $F_n$ has at least $\lceil\log_2 (n+1)\rceil$ hidden layers. The conjecture has recently been confirmed for networks with integer weights by Haase, Hertrich, and Loho [ICLR 2023].
  We follow up on this line of research and show that, within ReLU networks whose weights are decimal fractions, $F_n$ can only be represented by networks with at least $\lceil\log_3 (n+1)\rceil$ hidden layers. Moreover, if all weights are $N$-ary fractions, then $F_n$ can only be represented by networks with at least $\Omega( \frac{\ln n}{\ln \ln N})$ layers. These results are a partial confirmation of the above conjecture for rational ReLU networks, and provide the first non-constant lower bound on the depth of practically relevant ReLU networks.</description>

      <title>Complete Compositional Syntax for Finite Transducers on Finite and Bi-Infinite Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimizing finite automata, proving trace equivalence of labelled transition systems or representing sofic subshifts involve very similar arguments, which suggests the possibility of a unified formalism. We propose finite states non-deterministic transducer as a lingua franca for automata theory, transition systems, and sofic subshifts. We introduce a compositional diagrammatical syntax for transducers in form of string diagrams interpreted as relations. This syntax comes with sound rewriting rules allowing diagrammatical reasoning. Our main result is the completeness of our equational theory, ensuring that language-equivalence, trace-equivalence, or subshift equivalence can always be proved using our rewriting rules.</description>

      <title>Approximation Algorithms for Optimal Hopsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given graph $G$, a "hopset" $H$ with hopbound $\beta$ and stretch $\alpha$ is a set of edges such that between every pair of vertices $u$ and $v$, there is a path with at most $\beta$ hops in $G \cup H$ that approximates the distance between $u$ and $v$ up to a multiplicative stretch of $\alpha$. Hopsets have found a wide range of applications for distance-based problems in various computational models since the 90s. More recently, there has been significant interest in understanding these fundamental objects from an existential and structural perspective. But all of this work takes a worst-case (or existential) point of view: How many edges do we need to add to satisfy a given hopbound and stretch requirement for any input graph?
  We initiate the study of the natural optimization variant of this problem: given a specific graph instance, what is the minimum number of edges that satisfy the hopbound and stretch requirements? We give approximation algorithms for a generalized hopset problem which, when combined with known existential bounds, lead to different approximation guarantees for various regimes depending on hopbound, stretch, and directed vs. undirected inputs. We complement our upper bounds with a lower bound that implies Label Cover hardness for directed hopsets and shortcut sets with hopbound at least $3$.</description>

      <title>Deciding Local Unitary Equivalence of Graph States in Quasi-Polynomial Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe an algorithm with quasi-polynomial runtime $n^{\log_2(n)+O(1)}$ for deciding local unitary (LU) equivalence of graph states. The algorithm builds on a recent graphical characterisation of LU-equivalence via generalised local complementation. By first transforming the corresponding graphs into a standard form using usual local complementations, LU-equivalence reduces to the existence of a single generalised local complementation that maps one graph to the other. We crucially demonstrate that this reduces to solving a system of quasi-polynomially many linear equations, avoiding an exponential blow-up. As a byproduct, we generalise Bouchet's algorithm for deciding local Clifford (LC) equivalence of graph states by allowing the addition of arbitrary linear constraints. We also improve existing bounds on the size of graph states that are LU- but not LC-equivalent. While the smallest known examples involve 27 qubits, and it is established that no such examples exist for up to 8 qubits, we refine this bound by proving that LU- and LC-equivalence coincide for graph states involving up to 19 qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a family $\mathcal F$ define $\nu(\mathcal F,t)$ as the largest $s$ for which there exist $A_1,\ldots, A_{s}\in \mathcal F$ such that for $i\ne j$ we have $|A_i\cap A_j|&lt; t$. What is the largest family $\mathcal F\subset{[n]\choose k}$ with $\nu(\mathcal F,t)\le s$? This question goes back to a paper Hajnal and Rothschild from 1973. We show that, for some absolute $C$ and $n&gt;2k+Ct^{4/5}s^{1/5}(k-t)\log_2^4n$, $n&gt;2k+Cs(k-t)\log_2^4 n$ the largest family with $\nu(\mathcal F,t)\le s$ has the following structure: there are sets $X_1,\ldots, X_s$ of sizes $t+2x_1,\ldots, t+2x_s$, such that for any $A\in \mathcal F$ there is $i\in [s]$ such that $|A\cap X_i|\ge t+x_i$. That is, the extremal constructions are unions of the extremal constructions in the Complete $t$-Intersection Theorem. For the proof, we enhance the spread approximation technique of Zakharov and the second author. In particular, we introduce the idea of iterative spread approximation.</description>

      <title>Neural Lattice Reduction: A Self-Supervised Geometric Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice reduction is a combinatorial optimization problem aimed at finding the most orthogonal basis in a given lattice. The Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov\'asz (LLL) algorithm is the best algorithm in the literature for solving this problem. In light of recent research on algorithm discovery, in this work, we would like to answer this question: is it possible to parametrize the algorithm space for lattice reduction problem with neural networks and find an algorithm without supervised data? Our strategy is to use equivariant and invariant parametrizations and train in a self-supervised way. We design a deep neural model outputting factorized unimodular matrices and train it in a self-supervised manner by penalizing non-orthogonal lattice bases. We incorporate the symmetries of lattice reduction into the model by making it invariant to isometries and scaling of the ambient space and equivariant with respect to the hyperocrahedral group permuting and flipping the lattice basis elements. We show that this approach yields an algorithm with comparable complexity and performance to the LLL algorithm on a set of benchmarks. Additionally, motivated by certain applications for wireless communication, we extend our method to a convolutional architecture which performs joint reduction of spatially-correlated lattices arranged in a grid, thereby amortizing its cost over multiple lattices.</description>

Abstract: Not every directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying undirected graph is planar admits an upward planar drawing. We are interested in pushing the notion of upward drawings beyond planarity by considering upward $k$-planar drawings of DAGs in which the edges are monotonically increasing in a common direction and every edge is crossed at most $k$ times for some integer $k \ge 1$. We show that the number of crossings per edge in a monotone drawing is in general unbounded for the class of bipartite outerplanar, cubic, or bounded pathwidth DAGs. However, it is at most two for outerpaths and it is at most quadratic in the bandwidth in general. From the computational point of view, we prove that upward-$k$-planarity testing is NP-complete already for $k =1$ and even for restricted instances for which upward planarity testing is polynomial. On the positive side, we can decide in linear time whether a single-source DAG admits an upward $1$-planar drawing in which all vertices are incident to the outer face.</description>

      <title>($P_2+P_4$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs are nearly $\omega$-colorable</title>

Abstract: For a graph $G$, $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ respectively denote the chromatic number and clique number of $G$. In this paper, we show that if $G$ is a ($P_2+P_4$, $K_4-e$)-free graph with $\omega(G)\geq 3$, then $\chi(G)\leq \max\{6, \omega(G)\}$, and that the bound is tight for each $\omega(G)\notin \{4,5\}$. This extends the results known for the class of ($P_2+P_3$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs, improves the bound of Chen and Zhang [arXiv:2412.14524[math.CO], 2024] given for the class of ($P_2+P_4$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs, partially answers a question of Ju and the third author [Theor. Comp. Sci. 993 (2024) Article No.: 114465] on `near optimal colorable graphs', and partially answers a question of Schiermeyer (unpublished) on the chromatic bound for ($P_7$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs.</description>
