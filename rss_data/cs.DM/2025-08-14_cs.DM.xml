      <title>The connectivity dimension of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the connectivity dimension of a graph. We introduce this concept in analogy to the metric dimension of a graph, providing a graph parameter that measures the heterogeneity of the connectivity structure of a graph. We fully characterize extremal examples and present explicit constructions of infinitely many graphs realizing any prescribed non-extremal connectivity dimension. We also establish a general lower bound in terms of the graph's block structure, linking the parameter to classical notions from graph theory. Finally, we prove that the problem of computing the connectivity dimension is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Learning complexity of many-body quantum sign structures through the lens of Boolean Fourier analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study sign structures of the ground states of spin-$1/2$ magnetic systems using the methods of Boolean Fourier analysis. Previously it was shown that the sign structures of frustrated systems are of complex nature: specifically, neural networks of popular architectures lack the generalization ability necessary to effectively reconstruct sign structures in supervised learning settings. This is believed to be an obstacle for applications of neural quantum states to frustrated systems. In the present work, we develop an alternative language for the analysis of sign structures based on representing them as polynomial functions defined on the Boolean hypercube - an approach called Boolean Fourier analysis. We discuss the relations between the properties of the Boolean Fourier series and the learning complexity of sign structures, and demonstrate that such polynomials can potentially serve as variational ans\"atze for the complex sign structures that dramatically outperform neural networks in terms of generalization ability. While ans\"atze of this type cannot yet be directly used in the context of variational optimization, they indicate that the complexity of sign structures is not an insurmountable curse, and can potentially be learned with better designed NQS architectures. Finally, we show how augmenting data with Boolean functions can aid sign prediction by neural networks.</description>

      <title>A Tutte-type canonical decomposition of 3- and 4-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a unique decomposition of every 4-connected graph into parts that are either quasi-5-connected, cycles of triangle-torsos and 3-connected torsos on $\leq 5$ vertices, generalised double-wheels, or thickened $K_{4,m}$'s. The decomposition can be described in terms of a tree-decomposition but with edges allowed in the adhesion-sets. Our construction is explicit, canonical, and exhibits a defining property of the Tutte-decomposition.
  As a corollary, we obtain a new Tutte-type canonical decomposition of 3-connected graphs into parts that are either quasi-4-connected, generalised wheels or thickened $K_{3,m}$'s. This decomposition is similar yet different from the tri-separation decomposition.
  As an application of the decomposition for 4-connectivity, we obtain a new theorem characterising all quasi-4-connected vertex-transitive finite graphs as essentially quasi-5-connected or on a short explicit list of graphs.</description>

      <title>Half-Iterates and Delta Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07625v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vivid contrast between two competing algorithms for solving Abel's equation $g(\theta(x)) = g(x) + 1$, given $\theta(x)$, is easily sketched. EJ is faster and more efficient, but ML evaluates a limit characterizing the principal solution $g(x)$ directly. EJ finds $g(x)+\delta$, where $\delta$ is possibly nonzero but independent of $x$. If we were to know an exact expression for $\delta$, then the "intrinsicality" of ML would be subsumed by EJ. Filling this gap in our knowledge is the aim of this paper.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the Brouwer Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Brouwer conjecture (BC) in spectral graph theory claims that the sum of the largest k Kirchhoff eigenvalues of a graph are bounded above by the number m of edges plus k(k+1)/2. We show that (BC) holds for all graphs with n vertices if n is larger or equal than 4 times the square of the maximal vertex degree. We also note that (BC) for graphs implies (BC) for quivers.</description>
