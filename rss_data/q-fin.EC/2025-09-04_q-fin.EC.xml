      <title>National social cost of carbon: An application of FUND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a refined country-level integrated assessment model, FUND 3.9n, that extends the regional FUND 3.9 framework by incorporating sector-specific climate impact functions and parametric uncertainty analysis for 198 individual countries. The model enables estimation of the national social cost of carbon (NSCC), capturing heterogeneity across nations from economic structure, climate sensitivity, and population exposure. Our results demonstrate that both the NSCC and the global sum estimates are highly sensitive to damage specifications and preference parameters, including the pure rate of time preference and relative risk aversion. Compared to aggregated single-sector approaches, the disaggregated model with uncertainty yields higher values of the NSCC for low- and middle-income countries. The paper contributes to the literature by quantifying how sector-specific vulnerabilities and stochastic variability amplify climate damages and reshape global equity in the distribution of the NSCC. The NSCCs derived from our model offer policy-relevant metrics for adaptation planning, mitigation target setting, and equitable burden-sharing in international climate negotiations. This approach bridges the gap between globally harmonized carbon pricing and nationally differentiated climate impacts, providing a theoretically grounded and empirically rich framework for future climate policy design.</description>

      <title>Noisy Certification in a Duopolistic Setting with Loss-Averse Buyers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies how noise in certification technology affects seller profits in a duopoly with unobservable product quality. We identify two opposing effects of noisy certification. First, it reduces the informativeness of certification outcomes, homogenizing buyers' beliefs and limiting the scope for vertical differentiation. Second, it introduces randomness into buyer perceptions, endogenously generating differentiation between otherwise similar products. When buyers are risk-neutral, the first effect dominates, reducing seller profits. However, when buyers are loss averse, the negative impact of reduced informativeness is mitigated, and noisy certification can increase profits relative to accurate certification. Experimentally, treatments with inaccurate certification are more profitable than those with accurate certification, particularly in settings with intense competition.</description>

      <title>When Does Tourism Raise Land Prices? Threshold Effects, Superstar Cities, and Policy Lessons from Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While tourism is widely regarded as a catalyst for economic and urban transformation, its effects on land prices remain contested. This study examines tourism and land prices using a panel of 1,724 Japanese municipalities from 2021 to 2024, with annual tourist arrivals as a proxy for tourism activity. Using mediation analysis and panel threshold regression, we show that sizable land price increases are concentrated in a small group of "superstar" cities, specifically those in the top 5.9 percent for tourist arrivals, while most municipalities experience little or no effect. The results highlight pronounced nonlinearities and spatial heterogeneity in tourism's economic impact across Japan. The potential mechanisms linking tourism to land price growth are mixed, with possible benefits for local residents as well as risks of increased burdens. These findings underscore the need for policies that promote inclusive growth and an equitable distribution of tourism-related gains.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity in Sectoral Production and the Macro Effect of Sectoral Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of a negative sectoral shock on GDP depends on how important the shocked sector is as a direct and indirect supplier and how easily sectors can substitute inputs. Past estimates of the parameters that determine these qualities in the US have been restrictive: they have not been allowed to vary across industries or across time. This paper uses a novel empirical strategy to produce new estimates of these parameters without these restrictions, by exploiting variation in input expenditure shares within industries rather than across industries. The resulting estimates exhibit significant sectoral and temporal heterogeneity. In a calibrated GE model of multi-sector production, this heterogeneity (1) raises(lowers) the GDP effect of negative shocks to sectors whose customers are less(more) able to substitute inputs (e.g. the GDP effect of a "Chemical products" shock rises by 15%), and (2) raises(lowers) the GDP effect of negative shocks to sectors as they become more[less] central input suppliers (e.g. between 1997 and 2023 the GDP effect of a shock to the "Data processing, internet publishing, and other information services" sector nearly tripled due to changes in its importance as an input supplier).</description>

      <title>General Social Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Useful social science theories predict behavior across settings. However, applying a theory to make predictions in new settings is challenging: rarely can it be done without ad hoc modifications to account for setting-specific factors. We argue that AI agents put in simulations of those novel settings offer an alternative for applying theory, requiring minimal or no modifications. We present an approach for building such "general" agents that use theory-grounded natural language instructions, existing empirical data, and knowledge acquired by the underlying AI during training. To demonstrate the approach in settings where no data from that data-generating process exists--as is often the case in applied prediction problems--we design a highly heterogeneous population of 883,320 novel games. AI agents are constructed using human data from a small set of conceptually related, but structurally distinct "seed" games. In preregistered experiments, on average, agents predict human play better than (i) game-theoretic equilibria and (ii) out-of-the-box agents in a random sample of 1,500 games from the population. For a small set of separate novel games, these simulations predict responses from a new sample of human subjects better even than the most plausibly relevant published human data.</description>

      <title>Coping with the Dunkelflaute: Power system implications of variable renewable energy droughts in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17683v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coping with prolonged periods of low availability of wind and solar power, also referred to as renewable energy droughts or "Dunkelflaute", emerges as a key challenge for realizing decarbonized energy systems based on renewable energy sources. Here we investigate the role of long-duration electricity storage and geographical balancing in dealing with such events, combining a time series analysis of renewable availability with power sector modeling of 35 historical weather years. We find that extreme droughts define long-duration storage operation and investment. Assuming policy-relevant interconnection, we find 351 TWh long-duration storage capacity or 7% of yearly electricity demand optimal to deal with the most extreme event in Europe. While nuclear power can partially reduce storage needs, the storage-mitigating effect of fossil backup plants in combination with carbon removal is limited. Policymakers and system planners should prepare for a rapid expansion of long-duration storage to safeguard the renewable energy transition in Europe.</description>

      <title>Computational Basis of LLM's Decision Making in Social Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as human-like decision-making agents in social science and applied settings. These LLM-agents are typically assigned human-like characters and placed in real-life contexts. However, how these characters and contexts shape an LLM's behavior remains underexplored. This study proposes and tests methods for probing, quantifying, and modifying an LLM's internal representations in a Dictator Game -- a classic behavioral experiment on fairness and prosocial behavior. We extract ``vectors of variable variations'' (e.g., ``male'' to ``female'') from the LLM's internal state. Manipulating these vectors during the model's inference can substantially alter how those variables relate to the model's decision-making. This approach offers a principled way to study and regulate how social concepts can be encoded and engineered within transformer-based models, with implications for alignment, debiasing, and designing AI agents for social simulations in both academic and commercial applications, strengthening sociological theory and measurement.</description>
