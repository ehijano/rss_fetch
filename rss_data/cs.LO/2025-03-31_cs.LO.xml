      <title>Tape Diagrams for Monoidal Monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tape diagrams provide a graphical representation for arrows of rig categories, namely categories equipped with two monoidal structures, $\oplus$ and $\otimes$, where $\otimes$ distributes over $\oplus$. However, their applicability is limited to categories where $\oplus$ is a biproduct, i.e., both a categorical product and a coproduct. In this work, we extend tape diagrams to deal with Kleisli categories of symmetric monoidal monads, presented by algebraic theories.</description>

      <title>A SAT-centered XAI method for Deep Learning based Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel formal SAT-based explanation model for deep learning in video understanding. The proposed method integrates SAT solving techniques with the principles of formal explainable AI to address the limitations of existing XAI techniques in this domain. By encoding deep learning models and video data into a logical framework and formulating explanation queries as satisfiability problems, the method aims to generate logic-based explanations with formal guarantees. The paper details the conceptual framework, the process of encoding deep learning models and video data, the formulation of "Why?" and "Why not?" questions, and a novel architecture integrating a SAT solver with a deep learning video understanding model. While challenges related to computational complexity and the representational power of propositional logic remain, the proposed approach offers a promising direction for enhancing the explainability of deep learning in the complex and critical domain of video understanding.</description>

      <title>Classical Simulation of Quantum CSP Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that any perfect quantum strategy for the two-prover game encoding a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) can be simulated via a perfect classical strategy with an extra classical communication channel, whose size depends only on $(i)$ the size of the shared quantum system used in the quantum strategy, and $(ii)$ structural parameters of the CSP template. The result is obtained via a combinatorial characterisation of perfect classical strategies with extra communication channels and a geometric rounding procedure for the projection-valued measurements involved in quantum strategies. A key intermediate step of our proof is to establish that the gap between the classical chromatic number of graphs and its quantum variant is bounded when the quantum strategy involves shared quantum information of bounded size.</description>

      <title>On the Quantum Chromatic Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The largest known gap between quantum and classical chromatic number of graphs, obtained via quantum protocols for colouring Hadamard graphs based on the Deutsch--Jozsa algorithm and the quantum Fourier transform, is exponential. We put forth a quantum pseudo-telepathy version of Khot's $d$-to-$1$ Games Conjecture and prove that, conditional to its validity, the gap is unbounded: There exist graphs whose quantum chromatic number is $3$ and whose classical chromatic number is arbitrarily large. Furthermore, we show that the existence of a certain form of pseudo-telepathic XOR games would imply the conjecture and, thus, the unboundedness of the quantum chromatic gap. As two technical steps of our proof that might be of independent interest, we establish a quantum adjunction theorem for Pultr functors between categories of relational structures, and we prove that the Dinur--Khot--Kindler--Minzer--Safra reduction, recently used for proving the $2$-to-$2$ Games Theorem, is quantum complete.</description>

      <title>Random expansions of trees with bounded height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a sequence $\mathbf{T} = (\mathcal{T}_n : n \in \mathbb{N}^+)$ of trees $\mathcal{T}_n$ where, for some $\Delta \in \mathbb{N}^+$ every $\mathcal{T}_n$ has height at most $\Delta$ and as $n \to \infty$ the minimal number of children of a nonleaf tends to infinity. We can view every tree as a (first-order) $\tau$-structure where $\tau$ is a signature with one binary relation symbol. For a fixed (arbitrary) finite and relational signature $\sigma \supseteq \tau$ we consider the set $\mathbf{W}_n$ of expansions of $\mathcal{T}_n$ to $\sigma$ and a probability distribution $\mathbb{P}_n$ on $\mathbf{W}_n$ which is determined by a (parametrized/lifted) Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) $\mathbb{G}$ which can use the information given by $\mathcal{T}_n$.
  The kind of PGM that we consider uses formulas of a many-valued logic that we call $PLA^*$ with truth values in the unit interval $[0, 1]$. We also use $PLA^*$ to express queries, or events, on $\mathbf{W}_n$. With this setup we prove that, under some assumptions on $\mathbf{T}$, $\mathbb{G}$, and a (possibly quite complex) formula $\varphi(x_1, \ldots, x_k)$ of $PLA^*$, as $n \to \infty$, if $a_1, \ldots, a_k$ are vertices of the tree $\mathcal{T}_n$ then the value of $\varphi(a_1, \ldots, a_k)$ will, with high probability, be almost the same as the value of $\psi(a_1, \ldots, a_k)$, where $\psi(x_1, \ldots, x_k)$ is a ``simple'' formula the value of which can always be computed quickly (without reference to $n$), and $\psi$ itself can be found by using only the information that defines $\mathbf{T}$, $\mathbb{G}$ and $\varphi$. A corollary of this, subject to the same conditions, is a probabilistic convergence law for $PLA^*$-formulas.</description>

      <title>Qunity: A Unified Language for Quantum and Classical Computing (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12384v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Qunity, a new quantum programming language designed to treat quantum computing as a natural generalization of classical computing. Qunity presents a unified syntax where familiar programming constructs can have both quantum and classical effects. For example, one can use sum types to implement the direct sum of linear operators, exception-handling syntax to implement projective measurements, and aliasing to induce entanglement. Further, Qunity takes advantage of the overlooked BQP subroutine theorem, allowing one to construct reversible subroutines from irreversible quantum algorithms through the uncomputation of "garbage" outputs. Unlike existing languages that enable quantum aspects with separate add-ons (like a classical language with quantum gates bolted on), Qunity provides a unified syntax and a novel denotational semantics that guarantees that programs are quantum mechanically valid. We present Qunity's syntax, type system, and denotational semantics, showing how it can cleanly express several quantum algorithms. We also detail how Qunity can be compiled into a low-level qubit circuit language like OpenQASM, proving the realizability of our design.</description>

      <title>On guarded extensions of MMSNP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04234v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feder and Vardi showed that the class Monotone Monadic SNP without inequality (MMSNP) has a P vs NP-complete dichotomy if and only if such a dichotomy holds for finite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems. Moreover, they showed that none of the three classes obtained by removing one of the defining properties of MMSNP (monotonicity, monadicity, no inequality) has a dichotomy. The overall objective of this paper is to study the gaps between MMSNP and each of these three superclasses, where the existence of a dichotomy remains unknown. For the gap between MMSNP and Monotone SNP without inequality, we study the class Guarded Monotone SNP without inequality (GMSNP) introduced by Bienvenu, ten Cate, Lutz, and Wolter, and prove that GMSNP has a dichotomy if and only if a dichotomy holds for GMSNP problems over signatures consisting of a unique relation symbol. For the gap between MMSNP and MMSNP with inequality, we have two contributions. We introduce a new class MMSNP with guarded inequality, that lies between MMSNP and MMSNP with inequality and that is strictly more expressive than the former and still has a dichotomy. Apart from that, we give a detailed proof that every problem in NP is polynomial-time equivalent to a problem in MMSNP with inequality, which implies the absence of a dichotomy for the latter. For the gap between MMSNP and Monadic SNP without inequality, we introduce a logic that extends the class of Matrix Partitions in a similar way how MMSNP extends CSP, and pose an open question about the existence of a dichotomy for this class. Finally, we revisit the theorem of Feder and Vardi, which claims that the class NP embeds into MMSNP with inequality. We give a detailed proof of this theorem as it ensures no dichotomy for the right-hand side class of each of the three gaps.</description>

      <title>Learning Algorithms for Verification of Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09184v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for applying learning algorithms and heuristical guidance to the verification of Markov decision processes (MDPs). The primary goal of our techniques is to improve performance by avoiding an exhaustive exploration of the state space, instead focussing on particularly relevant areas of the system, guided by heuristics. Our work builds on the previous results of Br{\'{a}}zdil et al., significantly extending it as well as refining several details and fixing errors.
  The presented framework focuses on probabilistic reachability, which is a core problem in verification, and is instantiated in two distinct scenarios. The first assumes that full knowledge of the MDP is available, in particular precise transition probabilities. It performs a heuristic-driven partial exploration of the model, yielding precise lower and upper bounds on the required probability. The second tackles the case where we may only sample the MDP without knowing the exact transition dynamics. Here, we obtain probabilistic guarantees, again in terms of both the lower and upper bounds, which provides efficient stopping criteria for the approximation. In particular, the latter is an extension of statistical model-checking (SMC) for unbounded properties in MDPs. In contrast to other related approaches, we do not restrict our attention to time-bounded (finite-horizon) or discounted properties, nor assume any particular structural properties of the MDP.</description>

      <title>Deriving Representative Structure from Music Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Western music is an innately hierarchical system of interacting levels of structure, from fine-grained melody to high-level form. In order to analyze music compositions holistically and at multiple granularities, we propose a unified, hierarchical meta-representation of musical structure called the structural temporal graph (STG). For a single piece, the STG is a data structure that defines a hierarchy of progressively finer structural musical features and the temporal relationships between them. We use the STG to enable a novel approach for deriving a representative structural summary of a music corpus, which we formalize as a dually NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem extending the Generalized Median Graph problem. Our approach first applies simulated annealing to develop a measure of structural distance between two music pieces rooted in graph isomorphism. Our approach then combines the formal guarantees of SMT solvers with nested simulated annealing over structural distances to produce a structurally sound, representative centroid STG for an entire corpus of STGs from individual pieces. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments verifying that structural distance accurately differentiates between music pieces, and that derived centroids accurately structurally characterize their corpora.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic analysis of systems with affine input and polynomial state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide exact and terminating algorithms for the formal analysis of deterministic continuous-time control systems with affine input and polynomial state dynamics (in short, polynomial systems). We consider the following semantic properties: zeroness and equivalence, input independence, linearity, and analyticity. Our approach is based on Chen-Fliess series, which provide a unique representation of the dynamics of such systems via their formal generating series.
  Our starting point is Fliess' seminal work showing how the semantic properties above are mirrored by corresponding combinatorial properties on generating series. Next, we observe that the generating series of polynomial systems coincide with the class of shuffle-finite series, a nonlinear generalisation of Sch\"utzenberger's rational series which has recently been studied in the context of automata theory and enumerative combinatorics. We exploit and extend recent results in the algorithmic analysis of shuffle-finite series (such as zeroness, equivalence, and commutativity) to show that the semantic properties above can be decided exactly and in finite time for polynomial systems. Some of our analyses rely on a novel technical contribution, namely that shuffle-finite series are closed under support restrictions with commutative regular languages, a result of independent interest.</description>
