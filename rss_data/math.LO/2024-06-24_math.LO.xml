      <title>More on yet another ideal version of the bounding number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a continuation of the paper [J. Symb. Log. 87 (2022), 1065--1092]. For an ideal $\mathcal{I}$ on $\omega$ we denote $\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{I}}=\{f\in\omega^\omega: f^{-1}[\{n\}]\in\mathcal{I} \text{ for every $n\in \omega$}\}$ and write $f\leq_{\mathcal{I}} g$ if $\{n\in\omega:f(n)&gt;g(n)\}\in\mathcal{I}$, where $f,g\in\omega^\omega$.
  We study the cardinal numbers $\mathfrak{b}(\geq_{\mathcal{I}}\cap (\cD_{\mathcal{I}} \times \cD_{\mathcal{I}}))$ describing the smallest sizes of subsets of $\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{I}}$ that are unbounded from below with respect to $\leq_{\mathcal{I}}$.
  In particular, we examine the relationships of $\mathfrak{b}(\geq_{\mathcal{I}}\cap (\cD_{\mathcal{I}} \times \cD_{\mathcal{I}}))$ with the dominating number $\mathfrak{d}$. We show that, consistently, $\mathfrak{b}(\geq_{\mathcal{I}}\cap (\cD_{\mathcal{I}} \times \cD_{\mathcal{I}}))&gt;\mathfrak{d}$ for some ideal $\mathcal{I}$, however $\mathfrak{b}(\geq_{\mathcal{I}}\cap (\cD_{\mathcal{I}} \times \cD_{\mathcal{I}}))\leq\mathfrak{d}$ for all analytic ideals $\mathcal{I}$. Moreover, we give example of a Borel ideal with $\mathfrak{b}(\geq_{\mathcal{I}}\cap (\cD_{\mathcal{I}} \times \cD_{\mathcal{I}}))=add(\mathcal{M})$.</description>

      <title>Some General Completeness Results for Propositionally Quantified Modal Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the completeness problem for propositionally quantified modal logics on quantifiable general frames, where the admissible sets are the propositions the quantifiers can range over and expressible sets of worlds are admissible, and Kripke frames, where the quantifiers range over all sets of worlds. We show that any normal propositionally quantified modal logic containing all instances of the Barcan scheme is strongly complete with respect to the class of quantifiable general frames validating it. We also provide a sufficient condition for the truth of all formulas, possibly with quantifiers, to be preserved under passing from a quantifiable general frame to its underlying Kripke frame. This is reminiscent of both the idea of elementary submodel in model theory and the persistence concepts in propositional modal logic. The key to this condition is the concept of finite diversity (Fritz 2023), and with it, we show that if $\Theta$ is a set of Sahlqvist formulas whose class of Kripke frames has finite diversity, then the smallest normal propositionally quantified modal logic containing $\Theta$, Barcan, a formula stating the existence of world propositions, and a formula stating the definability of successor sets, is Kripke complete. As a special case, we have a simple finite axiomatization of the logic of Euclidean Kripke frames.</description>

      <title>First-order Logic with Being a Thesis Modal Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce syntactic modal operator $\BOX$ for \textit{being a thesis} into first-order logic. This logic is a modern realization of R. Carnap's old ideas on modality, as logical necessity (J. Symb. Logic, 1946) \cite{Ca46}. We place it within the modern framework of quantified modal logic with a variant of possible world semantics with variable domains. We prove completeness using a kind of normal form and show that in the canonical frame, the relation on all maximal consistent sets, $R = \{\langle \Gamma, \Delta \rangle : \forall A (\BOX A \in \Gamma \Longrightarrow A \in \Delta)\}$, is a universal relation. The strength of the $\BOX$ operator is a proper extension of modal logic $\mathsf{S5}$. Using completeness, we prove that satisfiability in a model of $\BOX A$ under arbitrary valuation implies that $A$ is a thesis of formulated logic. So we can syntactically define logical entailment and consistency. Our semantics differ from S. Kripke's standard one \cite{Kr63} in syntax, semantics, and interpretation of the necessity operator. We also have free variables, contrary to Kripke's and Carnap's approaches, but our notion of substitution is non-standard (variables inside modalities are not free). All $\BOX$-free first-order theses are provable, as well as the Barcan formula and its converse. Our specific theses are \linebreak[4] $\BOX A \to \forall x A$, $\neg \BOX (x = y)$, $\neg \BOX \neg (x = y)$, $\neg \BOX P(x)$, $\neg \BOX \neg P(x)$. We also have $\POS \exists x A(x) \to \POS A(^{y}/_{x})$, and $\forall x \BOX A(x) \to \BOX A(^{y}/_{x})$, if $A$ is a $\BOX$-free formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that types over real algebraically closed sets in the theory of separably closed fields of infinite degree of imperfection and in the theory of beautiful pairs of algebraically closed fields are stationary. This is proven in a general setup under suitable hypotheses on the interaction of the considered theory with another, better understood, stable theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random groups of density d&lt;\frac{1}{2} are infinite hyperbolic, and of density d&gt;\frac{1}{2} are finite. We prove that for any given system of equations \Sigma, all the solutions of \Sigma over a random group of density d&lt;\frac{1}{2} are projected from solutions of \Sigma over the free group F_{k}, with overwhelming probability, where k is the rank of the group. We conclude that any given sentence in the Boolean algebra of universal sentences, is a truth sentence over F_{k} if and only if it is a truth sentence over random groups of density d&lt;\frac{1}{2}, with overwhelming probability.</description>

      <title>Sentences over Random Groups II: Sentences of Minimal Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random groups of density d&lt;\frac{1}{2} are infinite hyperbolic, and of density d&gt;\frac{1}{2} are finite. We prove the existence of a uniform quantifier elimination procedure for formulas of minimal rank (probably the superstable part of the theory). Namely, given a minimal rank formula V(p), we prove the existence of a formula \varphi(p) that belongs to the Boolean algebra of two quantifiers, so that the two formulas V(p) and \varphi(p) define the same set over the free group F_{k} and over a random group of density d&lt;\frac{1}{2}. We conclude that any given sentence of minimal rank is a truth sentence over the free group F_{k} if and only if it is a truth sentence over random groups of density d&lt;\frac{1}{2}.</description>

      <title>On the Multicategorical Meta-Theorem and the Completeness of Restricted Algebraic Deduction Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eight categorical soundness and completeness theorems are established within the framework of algebraic theories. Exactly six of the eight deduction systems exhibit complete semantics within the cartesian monoidal category of sets. The multicategorical meta-theorem via soundness and completeness enables the transference of properties of families of models from the cartesian monoidal category of sets to $\Delta$-multicategories $C$.
  A bijective correspondence $R \mapsto \Delta_R$ is made between context structures $R$ and structure categories $\Delta$, which are wide subcategories of $\textbf{FinOrd}$ consisting of finite ordinals and functions. Given a multisorted signature $\sigma$ with a context structure $R$, an equational deduction system $\vdash_R$ is constructed for $R$-theories. The models within $\Delta_R$-multicategories provide a natural semantic framework for the deduction system $\vdash_R$ for modelable context structures $R$. Each of the eight modelable context structures $R$ is linked with a soundness and completeness theorem for the deduction system $\vdash_R$.</description>

      <title>Deducibility in the full Lambek calculus with weakening is HAck-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the problem of deciding the consequence relation of the full Lambek calculus with weakening is complete for the class HAck of hyper-Ackermannian problems (i.e., level F_{\omega}^{\omega} of the ordinal-indexed hierarchy of fast-growing complexity classes). Provability was already known to be PSPACE-complete. We prove that deducibility is HAck-complete even for the multiplicative fragment. Lower bounds are proved via a novel reduction from reachability in lossy channel systems and the upper bounds are obtained by combining structural proof theory (forward proof search over sequent calculi) and well-quasi-order theory (length theorems for Higman's Lemma).</description>

      <title>Computable one-way functions on the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major open problem in computational complexity is the existence of a one-way function, namely a function from strings to strings which is computationally easy to compute but hard to invert. Levin (2023) formulated the notion of one-way functions from reals (infinite bit-sequences) to reals in terms of computability, and asked whether partial computable one-way functions exist. We give a strong positive answer using the hardness of the halting problem and exhibiting a total computable one-way function.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Probability Logic: Decidability &amp; Computability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, the decidability and computability issues of dynamic probability logic (DPL) are addressed. Firstly, a proof system $\mathcal{H}_{DPL}$ is introduced for DPL and shown that it is weakly complete. Furthermore, this logic has the finite model property and so is decidable. Secondly, a strongly complete proof system HDPL is presented for DPL and proved that its canonical model is a computable structure.</description>

      <title>Integration on the Surreals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14331v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conway's real closed field No of surreal numbers is a sweeping generalization of the real numbers and the ordinals to which a number of elementary functions such as log and exponentiation have been shown to extend. The problems of identifying significant classes of functions that can be so extended and of defining integration for them have proven to be formidable. In this paper, we address this and related unresolved issues by showing that extensions to No, and thereby integrals, exist for most functions arising in practical applications. In particular, we show they exist for a large subclass of the resurgent functions, a subclass that contains the functions that at infinity are semi-algebraic, semi-analytic, analytic, meromorphic, and Borel summable as well as generic solutions to linear and nonlinear systems of ODEs possibly having irregular singularities. We further establish a sufficient condition for the theory to carry over to ordered exponential subfields of No more generally and illustrate the result with structures familiar from the surreal literature. We work in NBG less the Axiom of Choice (for both sets and proper classes), with the result that the extensions of functions and integrals that concern us here have a "constructive" nature in this sense. In the Appendix it is shown that the existence of such constructive extensions and integrals of substantially more general types of functions (e.g. smooth functions) is obstructed by considerations from the foundations of mathematics.</description>

      <title>$\widetilde{\mid}\hspace{1mm}$-divisibility of ultrafilters II: The big picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A divisibility relation on ultrafilters is defined as follows: ${\cal F}\hspace{1mm}\widetilde{\mid}\hspace{1mm}{\cal G}$ if and only if every set in $\cal F$ upward closed for divisibility also belongs to $\cal G$. After describing the first $\omega$ levels of this quasiorder, in this paper we generalize the process of determining the basic divisors of an ultrafilter. First we describe these basic divisors, obtained as (equivalence classes of) powers of prime ultrafilters. Using methods of nonstandard analysis we determine the pattern of an ultrafilter: the collection of its basic divisors as well as the multiplicity of each of them. All such patterns have a certain closure property in an appropriate topology. We isolate the family of sets belonging to every ultrafilter with a given pattern. Finally, we show that every pattern with the closure property is realized by an ultrafilter.</description>

      <title>Modal logic, fundamentally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-classical generalizations of classical modal logic have been developed in the contexts of constructive mathematics and natural language semantics. In this paper, we discuss a general approach to the semantics of non-classical modal logics via algebraic representation theorems. We begin with complete lattices $L$ equipped with an antitone operation $\neg$ sending $1$ to $0$, a completely multiplicative operation $\Box$, and a completely additive operation $\Diamond$. Such lattice expansions can be represented by means of a set $X$ together with binary relations $\vartriangleleft$, $R$, and $Q$, satisfying some first-order conditions, used to represent $(L,\neg)$, $\Box$, and $\Diamond$, respectively. Indeed, any lattice $L$ equipped with such a $\neg$, a multiplicative $\Box$, and an additive $\Diamond$ embeds into the lattice of propositions of a frame $(X,\vartriangleleft,R,Q)$. Building on our recent study of "fundamental logic", we focus on the case where $\neg$ is dually self-adjoint ($a\leq \neg b$ implies $b\leq\neg a$) and $\Diamond \neg a\leq\neg\Box a$. In this case, the representations can be constrained so that $R=Q$, i.e., we need only add a single relation to $(X,\vartriangleleft)$ to represent both $\Box$ and $\Diamond$. Using these results, we prove that a system of fundamental modal logic is sound and complete with respect to an elementary class of bi-relational structures $(X,\vartriangleleft, R)$.</description>
