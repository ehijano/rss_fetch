      <title>How to Train an Oscillator Ising Machine using Equilibrium Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) are prime candidates for use as neuromorphic machine learning processors with Equilibrium Propagation (EP) based on-chip learning. The inherent energy gradient descent dynamics of OIMs, combined with their standard CMOS implementation using existing fabrication processes, provide a natural substrate for EP learning. Our simulations confirm that OIMs satisfy the gradient-descending update property necessary for a scalable Equilibrium Propagation implementation and achieve 97.2(1)% test accuracy on the MNIST dataset without requiring any hardware modifications. Importantly, OIMs maintain robust performance under realistic hardware constraints, including moderate phase noise and 10-bit parameter quantization. These results establish OIMs as a promising platform for fast and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, potentially enabling energy-based learning algorithms that have been previously constrained by computational limitations.</description>

      <title>Many-body critical phase in a quasiperiodic chain and dynamical Widom lines in Fock space properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a quasiperiodic model in one dimension, namely the extended Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (EAAH) chain, that realizes a critical phase comprising entirely single-particle critical states in the non-interacting limit. In the presence of short-range interactions, the non-interacting critical phase transforms to a many-body critical (MBC) phase, separated by lines of MBC-ergodic, MBC-many-body localized (MBL) and ergodic-MBL phase transitions that meet at a triple point. We elucidate the unusual characteristics of the MBC phase compared to the ergodic and MBL phases through the localization properties of the excitations in real space and Fock space (FS), and eigenstate inverse participation ratio (IPR). We show that the MBC phase, like the MBL phase, is well described by a multifractal scaling of the IPR and a linear finite-size scaling ansatz near the transition to the ergodic and MBL phases. However, the MBC phase, at the same time, exhibits delocalization of all single-particle excitations and a system-size dependent Fock-space localization length, analogous to the ergodic phase. Remarkably, we find evidence of unusual Widom lines on the phase diagram in the form of lines of pronounced peaks or dips in the FS localization properties inside the MBC and MBL phases. These Widom lines either emerge as a continuation of the precursor phase transition line, terminating at the triple point, or originate from a phase boundary.</description>

      <title>Emergent scattering regimes in disordered metasurfaces near critical packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered metasurfaces provide a versatile platform for harnessing near- and far-field scattered light. Most research has focused on either particulate topologies composed of individual, well-identified metaatoms or, to a lesser extent, semi-continuous aggregate topologies without well identified inclusions. Here, we uncover an intermediate critical packing regime characterized by metasurface morphologies in which a significant fraction of metaatoms begin to connect. We experimentally demonstrate that, at this threshold, the properties of the scattered light abruptly change and interpret this change as a marked transition in the statistics of the photon density of states. Unlike percolation metal films, this transition affects not only the specular but also the diffuse components of the scattered light in a profound way. Our results introduce critical packing topologies as a novel design strategy for manipulating the spectral and angular characteristics of light using ultrathin optical coatings. Emergent functionalities include color shifts in diffuse light driven by multiple scattering and surface whitening, with potential applications in display technologies -- for example, to reduce glare in electronic screens.</description>

      <title>Heterosynaptic Circuits Are Universal Gradient Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a design principle for the learning circuits of the biological brain. The principle states that almost any dendritic weights updated via heterosynaptic plasticity can implement a generalized and efficient class of gradient-based meta-learning. The theory suggests that a broad class of biologically plausible learning algorithms, together with the standard machine learning optimizers, can be grounded in heterosynaptic circuit motifs. This principle suggests that the phenomenology of (anti-) Hebbian (HBP) and heterosynaptic plasticity (HSP) may emerge from the same underlying dynamics, thus providing a unifying explanation. It also suggests an alternative perspective of neuroplasticity, where HSP is promoted to the primary learning and memory mechanism, and HBP is an emergent byproduct. We present simulations that show that (a) HSP can explain the metaplasticity of neurons, (b) HSP can explain the flexibility of the biology circuits, and (c) gradient learning can arise quickly from simple evolutionary dynamics that do not compute any explicit gradient. While our primary focus is on biology, the principle also implies a new approach to designing AI training algorithms and physically learnable AI hardware. Conceptually, our result demonstrates that contrary to the common belief, gradient computation may be extremely easy and common in nature.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput GW Calculations via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning (ML) framework that predicts $G_0W_0$ quasiparticle energies across molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories with high accuracy and efficiency. Using only DFT-derived mean-field eigenvalues and exchange-correlation potentials, the model is trained on 25\% of MD snapshots and achieves RMSEs below 0.1 eV. It accurately reproduces k-resolved quasiparticle band structures and density of states, even for BN polymorphs excluded from the training data. This approach bypasses the computational bottlenecks of $G_0W_0$ simulations over dynamic configurations, offering a scalable route to excited-state electronic structure simulations with many-body accuracy.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Random Energy Model is the Limit of Quantum $ p $-Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the free energy of a class of spin glass models with $ p$-spin interactions in a transverse magnetic field. As $ p \to \infty $, the infinite system-size free energy is proven to converge to that of the quantum random energy model. This is accomplished by combining existing analytical techniques addressing the non-commutative properties of such quantum glasses, with the description of the typical geometry of extreme negative deviations of the classical $ p $-spin glass. We also review properties of the corresponding classical free energy and conjectures addressing $ 1/p $-corrections in the quantum case.</description>

      <title>Mutual distribution of two partial solutions in 1D localization: new information on the phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the mutual distribution of two linearly independent solutions y_1(x) and y_2(x) of the 1D Schroedinger equation with a random potential. Since individual distributions of $y_1$ and $y_2$ are log-normal, it is naturally to suggest that their mutual distribution is also log-normal. Such hypothesis is confirmed in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands, but failed near the initial band edge. The mechanism of deviations from the log-normal form is elucidated, and the first correction to it is calculated. The latter allows to demonstrate broadening of the spectral lines in the universal conductance fluctuations. A lot of new information is obtained on the phase transition in the distribution P(\psi), where \psi is a combined phase entering the evolution equations. According to the previous publications, this transition is related with appearance of the imaginary part of \psi at a certain energy E_0, and is not accompanied by singularities in the system resistance. The real sense of this transition consists in the change of configuration of four Lyapunov exponents, which determine the general solution: there are two pairs of complex-conjugated exponents for E&gt;E_0, while for E&lt;E_0 all exponents become real. Realization of two different configurations is confirmed for energies in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands; it proves the existence of the singular point E_0 at the formal level. The phase transition can be observed in optical systems, tracing the sign of the field in a wave, when the coordinate is changed.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Quantum Hall Effect in Topological Amorphous Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals have been theoretically predicted to become topological metals with anomalous Hall conductivity in amorphous systems. However, measuring the anomalous Hall conductivity in realistic materials, particularly those with multiple pairs of Weyl points, is a significant challenge. If a system respects time-reversal symmetry, then the anomalous Hall conductivity even vanishes. As such, it remains an open question how to probe the Weyl band like topology in amorphous materials. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that, under magnetic fields, a topological metal slab in amorphous systems exhibits three-dimensional quantum Hall effect, even in time-reversal invariant systems, thereby providing a feasible approach to exploring Weyl band like topology in amorphous materials. We unveil the topological origin of the quantized Hall conductance by calculating the Bott index. The index is carried by broadened Landau levels with bulk states spatially localized except at critical transition energies.The topological property also results in edge states localized at distinct hinges on two opposite surfaces.</description>

      <title>Automatic Input Feature Relevance via Spectral Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In machine learning practice it is often useful to identify relevant input features, so as to obtain compact dataset for more efficient numerical handling. On the other hand, by isolating key input elements, ranked according their respective degree of relevance, can help to elaborate on the process of decision making. Here, we propose a novel method to estimate the relative importance of the input components for a Deep Neural Network. This is achieved by leveraging on a spectral re-parametrization of the optimization process. Eigenvalues associated to input nodes provide in fact a robust proxy to gauge the relevance of the supplied entry features. Notably, the spectral features ranking is performed automatically, as a byproduct of the network training, with no additional processing to be carried out. The technique is successfully challenged against both synthetic and real data.</description>
