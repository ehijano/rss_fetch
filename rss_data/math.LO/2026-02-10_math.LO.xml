      <title>Scott spectral gaps for trees are bounded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Borel class of trees, we show that there is a tree in that class whose Scott sentence is not too much more complicated than the definition of the class. In particular, if the class is definable by a $\Pi_\alpha$ sentence, then there is a model of Scott rank at most $\alpha + 2$. This gives another proof-and one that does not require first proving Vaught's conjecture for trees-of the fact that trees are not faithfully Borel complete.</description>

      <title>Some contributions to presheaf model theory, II -- back and forth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the back and forth technique in the context of presheaf model theory. The essence of the back and forth technique lies in showing the relationship between various hierarchies which calibrate similarity between two models and, more generally, between two pairs consisting of a model and a tuple from it. In this paper we define several such hierarchies for presheaf models (and tuples of sections from them): those based on the degree of extendibility of partial isomorphisms through literal back and forth conditions, on sharing specific, abstract invariants which we define (the $F^\alpha_{M,\bar{a}}$ of \S{}\ref{function_analysis} for example), on agreeing on the (truth) values of instantiations of formulae up to a given amount of quantifier completity, on the existence of winning strategies for player II in certain Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e-type games and, finally, on satisfying certain infinitary sentences that arise in the construction of Scott sentences. We ultimately show that all of these hierarchies align.</description>

      <title>Scott-Karp analysis without sentences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scott and Karp gave an analysis which provides a level-by-level equivalence between global similarity between two structures and local commonality in terms of sharing particular invariants. Scott and Karp's local invariants were certain infinitary formulae.
  We give a more abstract version of the local side of Scott-Karp analysis which avoids the use of infinitary languages. We show the resulting hierarchies are still provide desired equivalences in the classical setting.
  Moreover, the abstract nature of our analysis, as we show, makes it suitable to provide local level-by-level equivalents to Hjorth's much more general version of global similarity in the context of topological group actions on topological groups.
  We, furthermore, provide, analogously to the classical work of Ehrenfeucht and Fra\"iss\'e, novel game theoretic equivalents for Hjorth's global similarity relations and some natural variants.</description>

      <title>The Game-Theoretic Kat\v{e}tov Order and Idealised Effective Subtoposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the longstanding problem of determining the structure of the $\leq_{\mathrm{LT}}$-order in the Effective Topos, known to effectively embed the Turing degrees. In a surprising discovery, we show that the $\leq_{\mathrm{LT}}$-order is in fact tightly controlled by the combinatorics of filters on $\omega$, raising deep questions about how combinatorial and computable complexity interact, both within this order and beyond it.
  To make the connection precise, we introduce a game-theoretic (''gamified'') variant of the Kat\v{e}tov order on filters over $\omega$, which turns out to exhibit a striking mix of coarseness and subtlety. For one, it is strictly coarser than the classical Rudin-Keisler order and, when viewed dually on ideals, collapses all MAD families to a single equivalence class. On the other hand, the order also supports a rich internal structure, including an infinite strictly ascending chain of ideal classes, which we identify by way of a new separation technique.
  From the computability-theoretic perspective, we show that a computable (and extended) variant of the gamified Kat\v{e}tov order is isomorphic to the original $\leq_{\mathrm{LT}}$-order. Moreover, our work brings into focus a new degree-spectrum invariant for filters $\mathcal{F}$, $$\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{T}}(\mathcal{F}):=\{\,[f\colon\omega\to\omega] \mid f\leq_{\mathrm{LT}} \mathcal{F} \},$$
  which is shown to always determine a proper initial segment of the Turing degrees. Extending this, given any $\Delta^1_1$ filter $\mathcal{F}$, we show that $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{T}}(\mathcal{F})$ is precisely the class of hyperarithmetic degrees. This significantly generalises previous results obtained by van Oosten \cite{vO14} and Kihara \cite{Kih23}.
  The proofs draw on ideas from general topology, descriptive set theory, and computability theory.</description>

      <title>$\star$-translation for Varsovian models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The technique of $\star$-translation is important in arguments calibrating the strengths of determinacy theories against large cardinals, for example in [9] and [1] in the paper's bibliography. It has also been used in analysing the internal theory of mice, for example in [5], [3], [6].
  We give a detailed development of $\star$-translation, slightly strengthening the large cardinal level in the development of [1]. We then develop a variant of $\star$-translation for Varsovian models, in which certain extenders overlapping the Woodin cardinal are total, and used to directly induce extenders on the sequence of the $\star$-translation (details for this component are missing from this draft). This variant was used in [3] and [6], where it was outlined but not developed in detail. We use the material to verify the star-translation hypothesis of [5] and deduce some self-iterability facts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the framework of $\alpha$-largeness introduced by Ketonen and Solovay, by proving a partition theorem for $\alpha$-large sets with $\alpha &lt; \epsilon_0$ which generalizes theorems from Ketonen and Solovay and from Bigorajska and Kotlarski. We also prove that for every $\omega^{nk+3}$-large set $X$ with $\min X \geq 18$, every coloring $f : [X]^2 \to k$ admits an $\omega^n$-large $f$-homogeneous subset. This bound is tight, up to an additive constant.</description>

      <title>Mitchell rank for supercompactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper defines a Mitchell rank for supercompact cardinals. If $\kappa$ is a $\theta$-supercompact cardinal then $o_{\theta-sc}(\kappa) = \sup \{ o_{\theta-sc}(\mu) + 1 \ | \ \mu \in m(\kappa)\}$, where $m(\kappa)$ is the collection of normal fine measures on $P_{\kappa}\theta$. We show how to force to kill the degree of a measurable cardinal $\kappa$ to any specified degree which is less than or equal to the degree of $\kappa$ in the ground model. We will also show how to softly kill the Mitchell rank for supercompactness of any supercompact cardinal so that in the forcing extension it is any desired degree less than or equal to it's degree in the ground model, along with some results concerning strongly compact cardinals.</description>

      <title>Elementary characterisation of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ by its absolute Galois group -- A modern perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1927, Artin and Schreier showed that a field is real closed if and only if its absolute Galois group has order two. Inspired by this characterisation and drawing on earlier work of Neukirch, Pop conjectured the following $p$-adic analogue: a field is $p$-adically closed if and only if its absolute Galois group is isomorphic to that of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. In 1995, the conjecture was independently solved by Efrat for $p \ne 2$ and by Koenigsmann in full generality. Using novel techniques in the theory of valued fields developed over the last 25 years, we give a new elementary and self-contained proof of this theorem, which does not rely on local class field theory and Galois cohomology. We further highlight connections to the recent work of Jahnke-Kartas on perfectoid fields and model-theoretic transfer techniques. We provide a systematic account of all of our methods to encourage further investigations.</description>

      <title>The Banach-Tarski paradox in complete discretely valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove some results related to the classical Banach--Tarski paradox in the setting of a field $\mathbb{K}$ that is complete with respect to a discrete non-Archimedean valuation (e.g., when $\mathbb{K}$ is the field $\mathbb{Q}_p$ of $p$-adic numbers for a prime $p$). Namely, the field $\mathbb{K}$, as well as all balls and spheres in $\mathbb{K}$, admit a paradoxical decomposition with respect to the isometry group of $\mathbb{K}$. Such decompositions can be realized using pieces with the Baire property if $\mathbb{K}$ is separable. Under the additional assumption of local compactness of $\mathbb{K}$ (e.g., when $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{Q}_p$), any two bounded subsets of $\mathbb{K}$ with nonempty interiors are equidecomposable with respect to the isometry group of $\mathbb{K}$.
  Our results complete the study of paradoxical decompositions in the non-Archimedean setting, addressing the one-dimensional case and building on earlier work for higher-dimensional normed spaces over $\mathbb{K}$ with respect to groups of affine isometries.</description>

      <title>Impredicativity in Linear Dependent Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a realizability model of linear dependent type theory from a linear combinatory algebra. Our model motivates a number of additions to the type theory. In particular, we add a universe with two decoding operations: one takes codes to cartesian types and the other takes codes to linear types. The universe is impredicative in the sense that it is closed under both large cartesian dependent products and large linear dependent products. We also add a rule for injectivity of the modality turning linear terms into cartesian terms. With all of the additions, we are able to encode (linear) inductive types. As a case study, we consider the type of lists over a linear type, and demonstrate that our encoding has the relevant uniqueness principle. The construction of the realizability model is fully formalized in the proof assistant Rocq.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03801v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Walsh [MR4525964, Zbl 1569.03151] has shown that comparing proof-theoretic ordinals is equivalent to comparing $\Pi^1_1$-consequence comparison and $\Pi^1_1$-reflection comparison, all modulo true $\Sigma^1_1$-sentences. In this paper, we prove the analogous result for $\Sigma^1_2$-consequences modulo true $\Pi^1_2$-sentences, that is, the equivalence between $\Sigma^1_2$-proof-theoretic ordinal comparison, $\Sigma^1_2$-consequence comparison, and $\Sigma^1_2$-reflection comparison, all modulo true $\Pi^1_2$-sentences. We also examine the connection between $\Sigma^1_2$-proof-theoretic ordinal and $\Sigma^1_2$-analogue of the robust reflection rank in Pakhomov-Walsh [MR4362917, Zbl 1511.03018]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper makes contributions to ``pure'' sheaf model theory, the part of model theory in which the models are sheaves over a complete Heyting algebra. We start by outlining the theory in a way we hope is readable for the non-specialist. We then give a careful treatment of the interpretation of terms and formulae. This allows us to prove various preservation results, including strengthenings of the results of \cite{BM14}. We give refinements of Miraglia's work on directed colimits, \cite{M88}, and an analogue of Tarski's theorem on the preservation of $\forall_2$-sentences under unions of chains. We next show various categories whose objects are (pairs of) presheaves and sheaves with various notions of morphism are accessible in the category theoretic sense. Together these ingredients allow us ultimately to prove that these categories are encompassed in the AECats framework for independence relations developed by Kamsma in \cite{K22}.</description>

First, we give a simple proof of the fact that every CBER on $[\mathbb{N}]^{\mathbb{N}}$ is hyperfinite on some set of the form $[A]^{\mathbb{N}}$. Using the idea behind the proof, we show the analogous result for every topological Ramsey space.</description>

This answers a question of Mitchell and provides a decisive answer to a question of Foreman and Shelah.</description>

Abstract: We compare Fornasiero and Terzo's framework of generic derivations on algebraically bounded structures with Le\'on S\'anchez and Tressl's differentially large fields. We show in the case of a single derivation that genericity and differential largeness coincide for \'ez-fields, as introduced by Walsberg and Ye. We also show that an NTP$_2$ algebraically bounded structure remains NTP$_2$ after expanding by a generic derivation.</description>

Abstract: We show that a field $K$ is model complete (in the language of rings) if and only if the Heisenberg group $H(K)$ is model complete (in the language of groups). To show that, we extend Levchuk's result about automorphisms of $H(K)$ to the case of monomorphisms $H(K)\to H(M)$. We also show that $H(K)$ does not have quantifier elimination and discuss its (non-)bi-interpretability with $K$.</description>

Abstract: We compute the cardinality $\mathfrak n_{\dim}(\mathcal M)$ of the sets of dimension functions on the ordered structures $\mathcal M$. The inequality $\mathfrak n_{\dim}(\mathcal M) \leq 1$ holds if $\mathcal M$ is a d-minimal expansion of an ordered group. If $\mathcal M$ is o-minimal and $\mathfrak n_{\dim}(\mathcal M)&lt;\infty$, there exists a positive integer $m$ such that $\mathfrak n_{\dim}(\mathcal M)=2^m-1$. For every positive integer $m$, there exists a weakly o-minimal expansion $\mathcal M$ of an ordered divisible Abelian group such that $\mathfrak n_{\dim}(\mathcal M)=m$.</description>

      <title>Goldstern's Principle with respect to Hausdorff Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22852v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of the paper [Got25] and studies Goldstern's principle, a principle about unions of continuum many null sets, further. The main result is that the Hausdorff measure version of Goldstern's principle for $\boldsymbol{\Pi}^1_1$ sets fails in $L$, despite the fact that the Lebesgue measure version is true. Moreover, we show that this version holds provided that the measurable cardinal exists. Other various results regarding Goldstern's principle are established.</description>

      <title>The Hausdorff measure due to Davies and Rogers and its cardinal invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Davies and Rogers constructed a Hausdorff measure satisfying the following property: every Borel subset of the space has measure either $\infty$ or $0$. In this paper, we examine cardinal invariants of their measure.</description>

      <title>On the Weierstrass Preparation Theorem over General Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study rings over which an analogue of the Weierstrass preparation theorem holds for power series. We show that a commutative ring $R$ admits a factorization of every power series in $R[[x]]$ as the product of a polynomial and a unit if and only if $R$ is isomorphic to a finite product of complete local principal ideal rings. We also characterize Noetherian rings $R$ for which this factorization holds under the weaker condition that the coefficients of the series generate the unit ideal: this occurs precisely when $R$ is isomorphic to a finite product of complete local Noetherian integral domains. Beyond this, we investigate the failure of Weierstrass-type preparation in finitely generated rings and prove a general transcendence result for zeros of $p$-adic power series, producing a large class of power series over number rings that cannot be written as a polynomial times a unit. Finally, we show that for a finitely generated infinite commutative ring $R$, the decision problem of determining whether an integer power series (with computable coefficients) factors as a polynomial times a unit in $R[[x]]$ is undecidable.</description>

      <title>Failure of singular compactness for Hom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming G\"odel's axiom of constructibility $V=L$, we construct a $\chi$-free abelian group $G$ of singular cardinality for some suitable cardinal $\chi$ which is regular and uncountable, equipped with the property that for every nontrivial subgroup $G' \subseteq G$ of smaller cardinality, $Hom(G',\mathbb{Z}) \neq 0$, while $Hom(G,\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. This provides a consistent counterexample to the singular compactness of nontrivial duality with respect to the functor $Hom(-,\mathbb{Z})$.</description>
