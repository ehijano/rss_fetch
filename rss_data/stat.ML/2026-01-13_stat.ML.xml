      <title>Physics-informed Gaussian Process Regression in Solving Eigenvalue Problem of Linear Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Regression to the eigenvalue problem $(\mathcal{L}-\lambda)u = 0$ poses a fundamental challenge, where the null source term results in a trivial predictive mean and a degenerate marginal likelihood. Drawing inspiration from system identification, we construct a transfer function-type indicator for the unknown eigenvalue/eigenfunction using the physics-informed Gaussian Process posterior. We demonstrate that the posterior covariance is only non-trivial when $\lambda$ corresponds to an eigenvalue of the partial differential operator $\mathcal{L}$, reflecting the existence of a non-trivial eigenspace, and any sample from the posterior lies in the eigenspace of the linear operator. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through several numerical examples with both linear and non-linear eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <title>Inference-Time Alignment for Diffusion Models via Doob's Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference-time alignment for diffusion models aims to adapt a pre-trained diffusion model toward a target distribution without retraining the base score network, thereby preserving the generative capacity of the base model while enforcing desired properties at the inference time. A central mechanism for achieving such alignment is guidance, which modifies the sampling dynamics through an additional drift term. In this work, we introduce Doob's matching, a novel framework for guidance estimation grounded in Doob's $h$-transform. Our approach formulates guidance as the gradient of logarithm of an underlying Doob's $h$-function and employs gradient-penalized regression to simultaneously estimate both the $h$-function and its gradient, resulting in a consistent estimator of the guidance. Theoretically, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates for the estimated guidance. Moreover, we analyze the resulting controllable diffusion processes and prove non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for the generated distributions in the 2-Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <title>Dimension-reduced outcome-weighted learning for estimating individualized treatment regimes in observational studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individualized treatment regimes (ITRs) aim to improve clinical outcomes by assigning treatment based on patient-specific characteristics. However, existing methods often struggle with high-dimensional covariates, limiting accuracy, interpretability, and real-world applicability. We propose a novel sufficient dimension reduction approach that directly targets the contrast between potential outcomes and identifies a low-dimensional subspace of the covariates capturing treatment effect heterogeneity. This reduced representation enables more accurate estimation of optimal ITRs through outcome-weighted learning. To accommodate observational data, our method incorporates kernel-based covariate balancing, allowing treatment assignment to depend on the full covariate set and avoiding the restrictive assumption that the subspace sufficient for modeling heterogeneous treatment effects is also sufficient for confounding adjustment. We show that the proposed method achieves universal consistency, i.e., its risk converges to the Bayes risk, under mild regularity conditions. We demonstrate its finite sample performance through simulations and an analysis of intensive care unit sepsis patient data to determine who should receive transthoracic echocardiography.</description>

      <title>Constrained Density Estimation via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel framework for density estimation under expectation constraints is proposed. The framework minimizes the Wasserstein distance between the estimated density and a prior, subject to the constraints that the expected value of a set of functions adopts or exceeds given values. The framework is generalized to include regularization inequalities to mitigate the artifacts in the target measure. An annealing-like algorithm is developed to address non-smooth constraints, with its effectiveness demonstrated through both synthetic and proof-of-concept real world examples in finance.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Anisotropic Covariance Structure on the Training Dynamics and Generalization Error of Linear Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of deep neural networks largely depends on the statistical structure of the training data. While learning dynamics and generalization on isotropic data are well-established, the impact of pronounced anisotropy on these crucial aspects is not yet fully understood. We examine the impact of data anisotropy, represented by a spiked covariance structure, a canonical yet tractable model, on the learning dynamics and generalization error of a two-layer linear network in a linear regression setting. Our analysis reveals that the learning dynamics proceed in two distinct phases, governed initially by the input-output correlation and subsequently by other principal directions of the data structure. Furthermore, we derive an analytical expression for the generalization error, quantifying how the alignment of the spike structure of the data with the learning task improves performance. Our findings offer deep theoretical insights into how data anisotropy shapes the learning trajectory and final performance, providing a foundation for understanding complex interactions in more advanced network architectures.</description>

      <title>Match Made with Matrix Completion: Efficient Learning under Matching Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matching markets face increasing needs to learn the matching qualities between demand and supply for effective design of matching policies. In practice, the matching rewards are high-dimensional due to the growing diversity of participants. We leverage a natural low-rank matrix structure of the matching rewards in these two-sided markets, and propose to utilize matrix completion to accelerate reward learning with limited offline data. A unique property for matrix completion in this setting is that the entries of the reward matrix are observed with matching interference -- i.e., the entries are not observed independently but dependently due to matching or budget constraints. Such matching dependence renders unique technical challenges, such as sub-optimality or inapplicability of the existing analytical tools in the matrix completion literature, since they typically rely on sample independence. In this paper, we first show that standard nuclear norm regularization remains theoretically effective under matching interference. We provide a near-optimal Frobenius norm guarantee in this setting, coupled with a new analytical technique. Next, to guide certain matching decisions, we develop a novel ``double-enhanced'' estimator, based off the nuclear norm estimator, with a near-optimal entry-wise guarantee. Our double-enhancement procedure can apply to broader sampling schemes even with dependence, which may be of independent interest. Additionally, we extend our approach to online learning settings with matching constraints such as optimal matching and stable matching, and present improved regret bounds in matrix dimensions. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our methods using both synthetic data and real data of labor markets.</description>

      <title>Conditional Normalizing Flows for Forward and Backward Joint State and Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional filtering algorithms for state estimation -- such as classical Kalman filtering, unscented Kalman filtering, and particle filters - show performance degradation when applied to nonlinear systems whose uncertainty follows arbitrary non-Gaussian, and potentially multi-modal distributions. This study reviews recent approaches to state estimation via nonlinear filtering based on conditional normalizing flows, where the conditional embedding is generated by standard MLP architectures, transformers or selective state-space models (like Mamba-SSM). In addition, we test the effectiveness of an optimal-transport-inspired kinetic loss term in mitigating overparameterization in flows consisting of a large collection of transformations. We investigate the performance of these approaches on applications relevant to autonomous driving and patient population dynamics, paying special attention to how they handle time inversion and chained predictions. Finally, we assess the performance of various conditioning strategies for an application to real-world COVID-19 joint SIR system forecasting and parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Local EGOP for Continuous Index Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the setting of continuous index learning, in which a function of many variables varies only along a small number of directions at each point. For efficient estimation, it is beneficial for a learning algorithm to adapt, near each point $x$, to the subspace that captures the local variability of the function $f$. We pose this task as kernel adaptation along a manifold with noise, and introduce Local EGOP learning, a recursive algorithm that utilizes the Expected Gradient Outer Product (EGOP) quadratic form as both a metric and inverse-covariance of our target distribution. We prove that Local EGOP learning adapts to the regularity of the function of interest, showing that under a supervised noisy manifold hypothesis, intrinsic dimensional learning rates are achieved for arbitrarily high-dimensional noise. Empirically, we compare our algorithm to the feature learning capabilities of deep learning. Additionally, we demonstrate improved regression quality compared to two-layer neural networks in the continuous single-index setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of mean estimation under quantization and adversarial corruption. We construct multivariate robust estimators that are optimal up to logarithmic factors in two different settings. The first is a one-bit setting, where each bit depends only on a single sample, and the second is a partial quantization setting, in which the estimator may use a small fraction of unquantized data.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport under Group Fairness Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring fairness in matching algorithms is a key challenge in allocating scarce resources and positions. Focusing on Optimal Transport (OT), we introduce a novel notion of group fairness requiring that the probability of matching two individuals from any two given groups in the OT plan satisfies a predefined target. We first propose \texttt{FairSinkhorn}, a modified Sinkhorn algorithm to compute perfectly fair transport plans efficiently. Since exact fairness can significantly degrade matching quality in practice, we then develop two relaxation strategies. The first one involves solving a penalised OT problem, for which we derive novel finite-sample complexity guarantees. This result is of independent interest as it can be generalized to arbitrary convex penalties. Our second strategy leverages bilevel optimization to learn a ground cost that induces a fair OT solution, and we establish a bound guaranteeing that the learned cost yields fair matchings on unseen data. Finally, we present empirical results that illustrate the trade-offs between fairness and performance.</description>

      <title>Multi-environment Invariance Learning with Missing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning models that can handle distribution shifts is a key challenge in domain generalization. Invariance learning, an approach that focuses on identifying features invariant across environments, improves model generalization by capturing stable relationships, which may represent causal effects when the data distribution is encoded within a structural equation model (SEM) and satisfies modularity conditions. This has led to a growing body of work that builds on invariance learning, leveraging the inherent heterogeneity across environments to develop methods that provide causal explanations while enhancing robust prediction. However, in many practical scenarios, obtaining complete outcome data from each environment is challenging due to the high cost or complexity of data collection. This limitation in available data hinders the development of models that fully leverage environmental heterogeneity, making it crucial to address missing outcomes to improve both causal insights and robust prediction. In this work, we derive an estimator from the invariance objective under missing outcomes. We establish non-asymptotic guarantees on variable selection property and $\ell_2$ error convergence rates, which are influenced by the proportion of missing data and the quality of imputation models across environments. We evaluate the performance of the new estimator through extensive simulations and demonstrate its application using the UCI Bike Sharing dataset to predict the count of bike rentals. The results show that despite relying on a biased imputation model, the estimator is efficient and achieves lower prediction error, provided the bias is within a reasonable range.</description>

      <title>Covariance-Driven Regression Trees: Reducing Overfitting in CART</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision trees are powerful machine learning algorithms, widely used in fields such as economics and medicine for their simplicity and interpretability. However, decision trees such as CART are prone to overfitting, especially when grown deep or the sample size is small. Conventional methods to reduce overfitting include pre-pruning and post-pruning, which constrain the growth of uninformative branches. In this paper, we propose a complementary approach by introducing a covariance-driven splitting criterion for regression trees (CovRT). This method is more robust to overfitting than the empirical risk minimization criterion used in CART, as it produces more balanced and stable splits and more effectively identifies covariates with true signals. We establish an oracle inequality of CovRT and prove that its predictive accuracy is comparable to that of CART in high-dimensional settings. We find that CovRT achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to CART in both simulations and real-world tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\rho$-posterior framework provides universal Bayesian estimation with explicit contamination rates and optimal convergence guarantees, but has remained computationally difficult due to an optimization over reference distributions that precludes intractable posterior computation. We develop a PAC-Bayesian framework that recovers these theoretical guarantees through temperature-dependent Gibbs posteriors, deriving finite-sample oracle inequalities with explicit rates and introducing tractable variational approximations that inherit the robustness properties of exact $\rho$-posteriors. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves theoretical contamination rates while remaining computationally feasible, providing the first practical implementation of $\rho$-posterior inference with rigorous finite-sample guarantees.</description>

      <title>Position: Don't be Afraid of Over-Smoothing And Over-Squashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-smoothing and over-squashing have been extensively studied in the literature on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) over the past years. We challenge this prevailing focus in GNN research, arguing that these phenomena are less critical for practical applications than assumed. We suggest that performance decreases often stem from uninformative receptive fields rather than over-smoothing. We support this position with extensive experiments on several standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating that accuracy and over-smoothing are mostly uncorrelated and that optimal model depths remain small even with mitigation techniques, thus highlighting the negligible role of over-smoothing. Similarly, we challenge that over-squashing is always detrimental in practical applications. Instead, we posit that the distribution of relevant information over the graph frequently factorises and is often localised within a small k-hop neighbourhood, questioning the necessity of jointly observing entire receptive fields or engaging in an extensive search for long-range interactions. The results of our experiments show that architectural interventions designed to mitigate over-squashing fail to yield significant performance gains. This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in theoretical research, urging a diligent analysis of learning tasks and datasets using statistics that measure the underlying distribution of label-relevant information to better understand their localisation and factorisation.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Kernel Clustering with Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering with bandit feedback refers to the problem of partitioning a set of items, where the clustering algorithm can sequentially query the items to receive noisy observations. The problem is formally posed as the task of partitioning the arms of an N-armed stochastic bandit according to their underlying distributions, grouping two arms together if and only if they share the same distribution, using samples collected sequentially and adaptively. This setting has gained attention in recent years due to its applicability in recommendation systems and crowdsourcing. Existing works on clustering with bandit feedback rely on a strong assumption that the underlying distributions are sub-Gaussian. As a consequence, the existing methods mainly cover settings with linearly-separable clusters, which has little practical relevance. We introduce a framework of ``nonparametric clustering with bandit feedback'', where the underlying arm distributions are not constrained to any parametric, and hence, it is applicable for active clustering of real-world datasets. We adopt a kernel-based approach, which allows us to reformulate the nonparametric problem as the task of clustering the arms according to their kernel mean embeddings in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Building on this formulation, we introduce the KABC algorithm with theoretical correctness guarantees and analyze its sampling budget. We introduce a notion of signal-to-noise ratio for this problem that depends on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between the arm distributions and on their variance in the RKHS. Our algorithm is adaptive to this unknown quantity: it does not require it as an input yet achieves instance-dependent guarantees.</description>

      <title>Dual-Level Models for Physics-Informed Multi-Step Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an approach for multi-step forecasting of dynamical systems by integrating probabilistic input forecasting with physics-informed output prediction. Accurate multi-step forecasting of time series systems is important for the automatic control and optimization of physical processes, enabling more precise decision-making. While mechanistic-based and data-driven machine learning (ML) approaches have been employed for time series forecasting, they face significant limitations. Incomplete knowledge of process mathematical models limits mechanistic-based direct employment, while purely data-driven ML models struggle with dynamic environments, leading to poor generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a dual-level strategy for physics-informed forecasting of dynamical systems. On the first level, input variables are forecast using a hybrid method that integrates a long short-term memory (LSTM) network into probabilistic state transition models (STMs). On the second level, these stochastically predicted inputs are sequentially fed into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to generate multi-step output predictions. The experimental results of the paper demonstrate that the hybrid input forecasting models achieve a higher log-likelihood and lower mean squared errors (MSE) compared to conventional STMs. Furthermore, the PINNs driven by the input forecasting models outperform their purely data-driven counterparts in terms of MSE and log-likelihood, exhibiting stronger generalization and forecasting performance across multiple test cases.</description>

      <title>Causal and Federated Multimodal Learning for Cardiovascular Risk Prediction under Heterogeneous Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the major cause of death globally, calling for predictive models that not only handle diverse and high-dimensional biomedical signals but also maintain interpretability and privacy. We create a single multimodal learning framework that integrates cross modal transformers with graph neural networks and causal representation learning to measure personalized CVD risk. The model combines genomic variation, cardiac MRI, ECG waveforms, wearable streams, and structured EHR data to predict risk while also implementing causal invariance constraints across different clinical subpopulations.
  To maintain transparency, we employ SHAP based feature attribution, counterfactual explanations and causal latent alignment for understandable risk factors. Besides, we position the design in a federated, privacy, preserving optimization protocol and establish rules for convergence, calibration and uncertainty quantification under distributional shift. Experimental studies based on large-scale biobank and multi institutional datasets reveal state discrimination and robustness, exhibiting fair performance across demographic strata and clinically distinct cohorts. This study paves the way for a principled approach to clinically trustworthy, interpretable and privacy respecting CVD prediction at the population level.</description>

      <title>LLM Flow Processes for Text-Conditioned Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meta-learning methods for regression like Neural (Diffusion) Processes achieve impressive results, but with these models it can be difficult to incorporate expert prior knowledge and information contained in metadata. Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on giant corpora including varied real-world regression datasets alongside their descriptions and metadata, leading to impressive performance on a range of downstream tasks. Recent work has extended this to regression tasks and is able to leverage such prior knowledge and metadata, achieving surprisingly good performance, but this still rarely matches dedicated meta-learning methods. Here we introduce a general method for sampling from a product-of-experts of a diffusion or flow matching model and an `expert' with binned probability density; we apply this to combine neural diffusion processes with LLM token probabilities for regression (which may incorporate textual knowledge), exceeding the empirical performance of either alone.</description>

      <title>Time-Series Anomaly Classification for Launch Vehicle Propulsion Systems: Fast Statistical Detectors Enhancing LSTM Accuracy and Data Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supporting Go/No-Go decisions prior to launch requires assessing real-time telemetry data against redline limits established during the design qualification phase. Family data from ground testing or previous flights is commonly used to detect initiating failure modes and their timing; however, this approach relies heavily on engineering judgment and is more error-prone for new launch vehicles. To address these limitations, we utilize Long-Term Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for supervised classification of time-series anomalies. Although, initial training labels derived from simulated anomaly data may be suboptimal due to variations in anomaly strength, anomaly settling times, and other factors. In this work, we propose a novel statistical detector based on the Mahalanobis distance and forward-backward detection fractions to adjust the supervised training labels. We demonstrate our method on digital twin simulations of a ground-stage propulsion system with 20.8 minutes of operation per trial and O(10^8) training timesteps. The statistical data relabeling improved precision and recall of the LSTM classifier by 7% and 22% respectively.</description>

      <title>Matrix Factorization Framework for Community Detection under the Degree-Corrected Block Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection is a fundamental task in data analysis. Block models form a standard approach to partition nodes according to a graph model, facilitating the analysis and interpretation of the network structure. By grouping nodes with similar connection patterns, they enable the identification of a wide variety of underlying structures. The degree-corrected block model (DCBM) is an established model that accounts for the heterogeneity of node degrees. However, existing inference methods for the DCBM are heuristics that are highly sensitive to initialization, typically done randomly. In this work, we show that DCBM inference can be reformulated as a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization problem. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel method for community detection and a theoretically well-grounded initialization strategy that provides an initial estimate of communities for inference algorithms. Our approach is agnostic to any specific network structure and applies to graphs with any structure representable by a DCBM, not only assortative ones. Experiments on synthetic and real benchmark networks show that our method detects communities comparable to those found by DCBM inference, while scaling linearly with the number of edges and communities; for instance, it processes a graph with 100,000 nodes and 2,000,000 edges in approximately 4 minutes. Moreover, the proposed initialization strategy significantly improves solution quality and reduces the number of iterations required by all tested inference algorithms. Overall, this work provides a scalable and robust framework for community detection and highlights the benefits of a matrix-factorization perspective for the DCBM.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Estimating Restricted Mean Survival Time Difference using Pseudo-observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A targeted learning (TL) framework is developed to estimate the difference in the restricted mean survival time (RMST) for a clinical trial with time-to-event outcomes. The approach starts by defining the target estimand as the RMST difference between investigational and control treatments. Next, an efficient estimation method is introduced: a targeted minimum loss estimator (TMLE) utilizing pseudo-observations. Moreover, a version of the copy reference (CR) approach is developed to perform a sensitivity analysis for right-censoring. The proposed TL framework is demonstrated using a real data application.</description>

      <title>A Unified Shape-Aware Foundation Model for Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale source datasets are reshaping the traditional training paradigm for time series classification. However, existing time series foundation models primarily focus on forecasting tasks and often overlook classification-specific challenges, such as modeling interpretable shapelets that capture class-discriminative temporal features. To bridge this gap, we propose UniShape, a unified shape-aware foundation model designed for time series classification. UniShape incorporates a shape-aware adapter that adaptively aggregates multiscale discriminative subsequences (shapes) into class tokens, effectively selecting the most relevant subsequence scales to enhance model interpretability. Meanwhile, a prototype-based pretraining module is introduced to jointly learn instance- and shape-level representations, enabling the capture of transferable shape patterns. Pre-trained on a large-scale multi-domain time series dataset comprising 1.89 million samples, UniShape exhibits superior generalization across diverse target domains. Experiments on 128 UCR datasets and 30 additional time series datasets demonstrate that UniShape achieves state-of-the-art classification performance, with interpretability and ablation analyses further validating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Certified Unlearning in Decentralized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by the right to be forgotten (RTBF), machine unlearning has become an essential requirement for privacy-preserving machine learning. However, its realization in decentralized federated learning (DFL) remains largely unexplored. In DFL, clients exchange local updates only with neighbors, causing model information to propagate and mix across the network. As a result, when a client requests data deletion, its influence is implicitly embedded throughout the system, making removal difficult without centralized coordination. We propose a novel certified unlearning framework for DFL based on Newton-style updates. Our approach first quantifies how a client's data influence propagates during training. Leveraging curvature information of the loss with respect to the target data, we then construct corrective updates using Newton-style approximations. To ensure scalability, we approximate second-order information via Fisher information matrices. The resulting updates are perturbed with calibrated noise and broadcast through the network to eliminate residual influence across clients. We theoretically prove that our approach satisfies the formal definition of certified unlearning, ensuring that the unlearned model is difficult to distinguish from a retrained model without the deleted data. We also establish utility bounds showing that the unlearned model remains close to retraining from scratch. Extensive experiments across diverse decentralized settings demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.</description>

      <title>Deriving Decoder-Free Sparse Autoencoders from First Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient descent on log-sum-exp (LSE) objectives performs implicit expectation--maximization (EM): the gradient with respect to each component output equals its responsibility. The same theory predicts collapse without volume control analogous to the log-determinant in Gaussian mixture models. We instantiate the theory in a single-layer encoder with an LSE objective and InfoMax regularization for volume control. Experiments confirm the theory's predictions. The gradient--responsibility identity holds exactly; LSE alone collapses; variance prevents dead components; decorrelation prevents redundancy. The model exhibits EM-like optimization dynamics in which lower loss does not correspond to better features and adaptive optimizers offer no advantage. The resulting decoder-free model learns interpretable mixture components, confirming that implicit EM theory can prescribe architectures.</description>

      <title>Detecting LLM-Generated Text with Performance Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok have been deeply integrated into our daily life. They now support a wide range of tasks -- from dialogue and email drafting to assisting with teaching and coding, serving as search engines, and much more. However, their ability to produce highly human-like text raises serious concerns, including the spread of fake news, the generation of misleading governmental reports, and academic misconduct. To address this practical problem, we train a classifier to determine whether a piece of text is authored by an LLM or a human. Our detector is deployed on an online CPU-based platform https://huggingface.co/spaces/stats-powered-ai/StatDetectLLM, and contains three novelties over existing detectors: (i) it does not rely on auxiliary information, such as watermarks or knowledge of the specific LLM used to generate the text; (ii) it more effectively distinguishes between human- and LLM-authored text; and (iii) it enables statistical inference, which is largely absent in the current literature. Empirically, our classifier achieves higher classification accuracy compared to existing detectors, while maintaining type-I error control, high statistical power, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Implicit bias as a Gauge correction: Theory and Inverse Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central problem in machine learning theory is to characterize how learning dynamics select particular solutions among the many compatible with the training objective, a phenomenon, called implicit bias, which remains only partially characterized. In the present work, we identify a general mechanism, in terms of an explicit geometric correction of the learning dynamics, for the emergence of implicit biases, arising from the interaction between continuous symmetries in the model's parametrization and stochasticity in the optimization process. Our viewpoint is constructive in two complementary directions: given model symmetries, one can derive the implicit bias they induce; conversely, one can inverse-design a wide class of different implicit biases by computing specific redundant parameterizations. More precisely, we show that, when the dynamics is expressed in the quotient space obtained by factoring out the symmetry group of the parameterization, the resulting stochastic differential equation gains a closed form geometric correction in the stationary distribution of the optimizer dynamics favoring orbits with small local volume. We compute the resulting symmetry induced bias for a range of architectures, showing how several well known results fit into a single unified framework. The approach also provides a practical methodology for deriving implicit biases in new settings, and it yields concrete, testable predictions that we confirm by numerical simulations on toy models trained on synthetic data, leaving more complex scenarios for future work. Finally, we test the implicit bias inverse-design procedure in notable cases, including biases toward sparsity in linear features or in spectral properties of the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Physics-constrained Gaussian Processes for Predicting Shockwave Hugoniot Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A physics-constrained Gaussian Process regression framework is developed for predicting shocked material states along the Hugoniot curve using data from a small number of shockwave simulations. The proposed Gaussian process employs a probabilistic Taylor series expansion in conjunction with the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions between the various shocked material states to construct a thermodynamically consistent covariance function. This leads to the formulation of an optimization problem over a small number of interpretable hyperparameters and enables the identification of regime transitions, from a leading elastic wave to trailing plastic and phase transformation waves. This work is motivated by the need to investigate shock-driven material response for materials discovery and for offering mechanistic insights in regimes where experimental characterizations and simulations are costly. The proposed methodology relies on large-scale molecular dynamics which are an accurate but expensive computational alternative to experiments. Under these constraints, the proposed methodology establishes Hugoniot curves from a limited number of molecular dynamics simulations. We consider silicon carbide as a representative material and atomic-level simulations are performed using a reverse ballistic approach together with appropriate interatomic potentials. The framework reproduces the Hugoniot curve with satisfactory accuracy while also quantifying the uncertainty in the predictions using the Gaussian Process posterior.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models with Heavy-Tailed Targets: Score Estimation and Sampling Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have become a powerful framework for generative modeling, with score estimation as a central statistical bottleneck. Existing guarantees for score estimation largely focus on light-tailed targets or rely on restrictive assumptions such as compact support, which are often violated by heavy-tailed data in practice. In this work, we study conventional (Gaussian) score-based diffusion models when the target distribution is heavy-tailed and belongs to a Sobolev class with smoothness parameter $\beta&gt;0$. We consider both exponential and polynomial tail decay, indexed by a tail parameter $\gamma$. Using kernel density estimation, we derive sharp minimax rates for score estimation, revealing a qualitative dichotomy: under exponential tails, the rate matches the light-tailed case up to polylogarithmic factors, whereas under polynomial tails the rate depends explicitly on $\gamma$. We further provide sampling guarantees for the associated continuous reverse dynamics. In total variation, the generated distribution converges at the minimax optimal rate $n^{-\beta/(2\beta+d)}$ under exponential tails (up to logarithmic factors), and at a $\gamma$-dependent rate under polynomial tails. Whether the latter sampling rate is minimax optimal remains an open question. These results characterize the statistical limits of score estimation and the resulting sampling accuracy for heavy-tailed targets, extending diffusion theory beyond the light-tailed setting.</description>

      <title>Why are there many equally good models? An Anatomy of the Rashomon Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rashomon effect -- the existence of multiple, distinct models that achieve nearly equivalent predictive performance -- has emerged as a fundamental phenomenon in modern machine learning and statistics. In this paper, we explore the causes underlying the Rashomon effect, organizing them into three categories: statistical sources arising from finite samples and noise in the data-generating process; structural sources arising from non-convexity of optimization objectives and unobserved variables that create fundamental non-identifiability; and procedural sources arising from limitations of optimization algorithms and deliberate restrictions to suboptimal model classes. We synthesize insights from machine learning, statistics, and optimization literature to provide a unified framework for understanding why the multiplicity of good models arises. A key distinction emerges: statistical multiplicity diminishes with more data, structural multiplicity persists asymptotically and cannot be resolved without different data or additional assumptions, and procedural multiplicity reflects choices made by practitioners. Beyond characterizing causes, we discuss both the challenges and opportunities presented by the Rashomon effect, including implications for inference, interpretability, fairness, and decision-making under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Artificial Entanglement in the Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be adapted to new tasks using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods that modify only a small number of trainable parameters, often through low-rank updates. In this work, we adopt a quantum-information-inspired perspective to understand their effectiveness. From this perspective, low-rank parameterizations naturally correspond to low-dimensional Matrix Product States (MPS) representations, which enable entanglement-based characterizations of parameter structure. Thereby, we term and measure "Artificial Entanglement", defined as the entanglement entropy of the parameters in artificial neural networks (in particular the LLMs). We first study the representative low-rank adaptation (LoRA) PEFT method, alongside full fine-tuning (FFT), using LLaMA models at the 1B and 8B scales trained on the Tulu3 and OpenThoughts3 datasets, and uncover: (i) Internal artificial entanglement in the updates of query and value projection matrices in LoRA follows a volume law with a central suppression (termed as the "Entanglement Valley"), which is sensitive to hyper-parameters and is distinct from that in FFT; (ii) External artificial entanglement in attention matrices, corresponding to token-token correlations in representation space, follows an area law with logarithmic corrections and remains robust to LoRA hyper-parameters and training steps. Drawing a parallel to the No-Hair Theorem in black hole physics, we propose that although LoRA and FFT induce distinct internal entanglement signatures, such differences do not manifest in the attention outputs, suggesting a "no-hair" property that results in the effectiveness of low rank updates. We further provide theoretical support based on random matrix theory, and extend our analysis to an MPS Adaptation PEFT method, which exhibits qualitatively similar behaviors.</description>

      <title>Variational decomposition autoencoding improves disentanglement of latent representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure of complex, nonstationary, high-dimensional time-evolving signals is a central challenge in scientific data analysis. In many domains, such as speech and biomedical signal processing, the ability to learn disentangled and interpretable representations is critical for uncovering latent generative mechanisms. Traditional approaches to unsupervised representation learning, including variational autoencoders (VAEs), often struggle to capture the temporal and spectral diversity inherent in such data. Here we introduce variational decomposition autoencoding (VDA), a framework that extends VAEs by incorporating a strong structural bias toward signal decomposition. VDA is instantiated through variational decomposition autoencoders (DecVAEs), i.e., encoder-only neural networks that combine a signal decomposition model, a contrastive self-supervised task, and variational prior approximation to learn multiple latent subspaces aligned with time-frequency characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DecVAEs on simulated data and three publicly available scientific datasets, spanning speech recognition, dysarthria severity evaluation, and emotional speech classification. Our results demonstrate that DecVAEs surpass state-of-the-art VAE-based methods in terms of disentanglement quality, generalization across tasks, and the interpretability of latent encodings. These findings suggest that decomposition-aware architectures can serve as robust tools for extracting structured representations from dynamic signals, with potential applications in clinical diagnostics, human-computer interaction, and adaptive neurotechnologies.</description>

      <title>Tractable Multinomial Logit Contextual Bandits with Non-Linear Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the multinomial logit (MNL) contextual bandit problem for sequential assortment selection. Although most existing research assumes utility functions to be linear in item features, this linearity assumption restricts the modeling of intricate interactions between items and user preferences. A recent work (Zhang &amp; Luo, 2024) has investigated general utility function classes, yet its method faces fundamental trade-offs between computational tractability and statistical efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for MNL contextual bandits leveraging the upper confidence bound principle, specifically designed for non-linear parametric utility functions, including those modeled by neural networks. Under a realizability assumption and a mild geometric condition on the utility function class, our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ denotes the total number of rounds. Our result establishes that sharp $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$-regret is attainable even with neural network-based utilities, without relying on strong assumptions such as neural tangent kernel approximations. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method is the first computationally tractable algorithm for MNL contextual bandits with non-linear utilities that provably attains $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Comprehensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing robust performance not only in realizable settings but also in scenarios with model misspecification.</description>

      <title>Simulated Annealing-based Candidate Optimization for Batch Acquisition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization with multi-objective acquisition functions such as q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) requires efficient candidate optimization to maximize acquisition function values. Traditional approaches rely on continuous optimization methods like Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) for candidate selection. However, these gradient-based methods can become trapped in local optima, particularly in complex or high-dimensional objective landscapes. This paper presents a simulated annealing-based approach for candidate optimization in batch acquisition functions as an alternative to conventional continuous optimization methods. We evaluate our simulated annealing approach against SLSQP across four benchmark multi-objective optimization problems: ZDT1 (30D, 2 objectives), DTLZ2 (7D, 3 objectives), Kursawe (3D, 2 objectives), and Latent-Aware (4D, 2 objectives). Our results demonstrate that simulated annealing consistently achieves superior hypervolume performance compared to SLSQP in most test functions. The improvement is particularly pronounced for DTLZ2 and Latent-Aware problems, where simulated annealing reaches significantly higher hypervolume values and maintains better convergence characteristics. The histogram analysis of objective space coverage further reveals that simulated annealing explores more diverse and optimal regions of the Pareto front. These findings suggest that metaheuristic optimization approaches like simulated annealing can provide more robust and effective candidate optimization for multi-objective Bayesian optimization, offering a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods for batch acquisition function optimization.</description>

      <title>Minimum Wasserstein distance estimator under covariate shift: closed-form, super-efficiency and irregularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Covariate shift arises when covariate distributions differ between source and target populations while the conditional distribution of the response remains invariant, and it underlies problems in missing data and causal inference. We propose a minimum Wasserstein distance estimation framework for inference under covariate shift that avoids explicit modeling of outcome regressions or importance weights. The resulting W-estimator admits a closed-form expression and is numerically equivalent to the classical 1-nearest neighbor estimator, yielding a new optimal transport interpretation of nearest neighbor methods. We establish root-$n$ asymptotic normality and show that the estimator is not asymptotically linear, leading to super-efficiency relative to the semiparametric efficient estimator under covariate shift in certain regimes, and uniformly in missing data problems. Numerical simulations, along with an analysis of a rainfall dataset, underscore the exceptional performance of our W-estimator.</description>

      <title>Online Markov Decision Processes with Terminal Law Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning usually assumes either episodic interactions with resets or continuous operation to minimize average or cumulative loss. While episodic settings have many theoretical results, resets are often unrealistic in practice. The infinite-horizon setting avoids this issue but lacks non-asymptotic guarantees in online scenarios with unknown dynamics. In this work, we move towards closing this gap by introducing a reset-free framework called the periodic framework, where the goal is to find periodic policies: policies that not only minimize cumulative loss but also return the agents to their initial state distribution after a fixed number of steps. We formalize the problem of finding optimal periodic policies and identify sufficient conditions under which it is well-defined for tabular Markov decision processes. To evaluate algorithms in this framework, we introduce the periodic regret, a measure that balances cumulative loss with the terminal law constraint. We then propose the first algorithms for computing periodic policies in two multi-agent settings and show they achieve sublinear periodic regret of order $\tilde O(T^{3/4})$. This provides the first non-asymptotic guarantees for reset-free learning in the setting of $M$ homogeneous agents, for $M &gt; 1$.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Private Linear Regression via Iterative Hessian Mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study differentially private ordinary least squares (DP-OLS) with bounded data. The dominant approach, adaptive sufficient-statistics perturbation (AdaSSP), adds an adaptively chosen perturbation to the sufficient statistics, namely, the matrix $X^{\top}X$ and the vector $X^{\top}Y$, and is known to achieve near-optimal accuracy and to have strong empirical performance. In contrast, methods that rely on Gaussian-sketching, which ensure differential privacy by pre-multiplying the data with a random Gaussian matrix, are widely used in federated and distributed regression, yet remain relatively uncommon for DP-OLS. In this work, we introduce the iterative Hessian mixing, a novel DP-OLS algorithm that relies on Gaussian sketches and is inspired by the iterative Hessian sketch algorithm. We provide utility analysis for the iterative Hessian mixing as well as a new analysis for the previous methods that rely on Gaussian sketches. Then, we show that our new approach circumvents the intrinsic limitations of the prior methods and provides non-trivial improvements over AdaSSP. We conclude by running an extensive set of experiments across standard benchmarks to demonstrate further that our approach consistently outperforms these prior baselines.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Micro-Level Claims Reserving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Outstanding claim liabilities are revised repeatedly as claims develop, yet most modern reserving models are trained as one-shot predictors and typically learn only from settled claims. We formulate individual claims reserving as a claim-level Markov decision process in which an agent sequentially updates outstanding claim liability (OCL) estimates over development, using continuous actions and a reward design that balances accuracy with stable reserve revisions. A key advantage of this reinforcement learning (RL) approach is that it can learn from all observed claim trajectories, including claims that remain open at valuation, thereby avoiding the reduced sample size and selection effects inherent in supervised methods trained on ultimate outcomes only. We also introduce practical components needed for actuarial use -- initialisation of new claims, temporally consistent tuning via a rolling-settlement scheme, and an importance-weighting mechanism to mitigate portfolio-level underestimation driven by the rarity of large claims. On CAS and SPLICE synthetic general insurance datasets, the proposed Soft Actor-Critic implementation delivers competitive claim-level accuracy and strong aggregate OCL performance, particularly for the immature claim segments that drive most of the liability.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Singular-Value Learning for Cross-Covariances Forecasting in Financial Markets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new wave of work on covariance cleaning and nonlinear shrinkage has delivered asymptotically optimal analytical solutions for large covariance matrices. Building on this progress, these ideas have been generalized to empirical cross-covariance matrices, whose singular-value shrinkage characterizes comovements between one set of assets and another. Existing analytical cross-covariance cleaners are derived under strong stationarity and large-sample assumptions, and they typically rely on mesoscopic regularity conditions such as bounded spectra; macroscopic common modes (e.g., a global market factor) violate these conditions. When applied to real equity returns, where dependence structures drift over time and global modes are prominent, we find that these theoretically optimal formulas do not translate into robust out-of-sample performance. We address this gap by designing a random-matrix-inspired neural architecture that operates in the empirical singular-vector basis and learns a nonlinear mapping from empirical singular values to their corresponding cleaned values. By construction, the network can recover the analytical solution as a special case, yet it remains flexible enough to adapt to non-stationary dynamics and mode-driven distortions. Trained on a long history of equity returns, the proposed method achieves a more favorable bias-variance trade-off than purely analytical cleaners and delivers systematically lower out-of-sample cross-covariance prediction errors. Our results demonstrate that combining random-matrix theory with machine learning makes asymptotic theories practically effective in realistic time-varying markets.</description>

      <title>Riesz Representer Fitting under Bregman Divergence: A Unified Framework for Debiased Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the Riesz representer is a central problem in debiased machine learning for causal and structural parameter estimation. Various methods for Riesz representer estimation have been proposed, including Riesz regression and covariate balancing. This study unifies these methods within a single framework. Our framework fits a Riesz representer model to the true Riesz representer under a Bregman divergence, which includes the squared loss and the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence as special cases. We show that the squared loss corresponds to Riesz regression, and the KL divergence corresponds to tailored loss minimization, where the dual solutions correspond to stable balancing weights and entropy balancing weights, respectively, under specific model specifications. We refer to our method as generalized Riesz regression, and we refer to the associated duality as automatic covariate balancing. Our framework also generalizes density ratio fitting under a Bregman divergence to Riesz representer estimation, and it includes various applications beyond density ratio estimation. We also provide a convergence analysis for both cases where the model class is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and where it is a neural network.</description>

      <title>Non-Convex Portfolio Optimization via Energy-Based Models: A Comparative Analysis Using the Thermodynamic HypergRaphical Model Library (THRML) for Index Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization under cardinality constraints transforms the classical Markowitz mean-variance problem from a convex quadratic problem into an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. This paper introduces a novel approach using THRML (Thermodynamic HypergRaphical Model Library), a JAX-based library for building and sampling probabilistic graphical models that reformulates index tracking as probabilistic inference on an Ising Hamiltonian. Unlike traditional methods that seek a single optimal solution, THRML samples from the Boltzmann distribution of high-quality portfolios using GPU-accelerated block Gibbs sampling, providing natural regularization against overfitting.
  We implement three key innovations: (1) dynamic coupling strength that scales inversely with market volatility (VIX), adapting diversification pressure to market regimes; (2) rebalanced bias weights prioritizing tracking quality over momentum for index replication; and (3) sector-aware post-processing ensuring institutional-grade diversification. Backtesting on a 100-stock S and P 500 universe from 2023 to 2025 demonstrates that THRML achieves 4.31 percent annualized tracking error versus 5.66 to 6.30 percent for baselines, while simultaneously generating 128.63 percent total return against the index total return of 79.61 percent. The Diebold-Mariano test confirms statistical significance with p less than 0.0001 across all comparisons. These results position energy-based models as a promising paradigm for portfolio construction, bridging statistical mechanics and quantitative finance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.04031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With appropriately chosen sampling probabilities, sampling-based random projection can be used to implement large-scale statistical methods, substantially reducing computational cost while maintaining low statistical error. However, computing optimal sampling probabilities is often itself expensive, and in practice one typically resorts to suboptimal schemes. This generally leads to increased time and space costs, as more subsamples are required and the resulting projection matrices become larger, thereby making the inference procedure more computationally demanding. In this paper, we extend the framework of sampling-based random projection and propose a new projection method, \emph{accumulative sub-sampling}. By carefully accumulating multiple such projections, accumulative sub-sampling improves statistical efficiency while controlling the effective matrix size throughout the statistical computation. On the theoretical side, we quantify how the quality of the subsampling scheme affects the error in approximating matrix products and positive semidefinite matrices, and show how the proposed accumulation strategy mitigates this effect. Moreover, we apply our method to statistical models involving intensive matrix operations, such as eigendecomposition in spectral clustering and matrix inversion in kernel ridge regression, and demonstrate that reducing the effective matrix size leads to substantial computational savings. Numerical experiments across a range of problems further show that our approach consistently improves computational efficiency compared to existing random projection baselines under suboptimal sampling schemes.</description>

Abstract: Persistent homology is an important methodology in topological data analysis which adapts theory from algebraic topology to data settings. Computing persistent homology produces persistence diagrams, which have been successfully used in diverse domains. Despite its widespread use, persistent homology is simply impossible to compute when a dataset is very large. We study a statistical approach to the problem of computing persistent homology for massive datasets using a multiple subsampling framework and extend it to three summaries of persistent homology: H\"{o}lder continuous vectorizations of persistence diagrams; the alternative representation as persistence measures; and standard persistence diagrams. Specifically, we derive finite sample convergence rates for empirical means for persistent homology and practical guidance on interpreting and tuning parameters. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data. We demonstrate the performance of multiple subsampling in a permutation test to analyze the topological structure of Poincar\'{e} embeddings of large lexical databases.</description>

      <title>The Interpolating Information Criterion for Overparameterized Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of model selection is considered for the setting of interpolating estimators, where the number of model parameters exceeds the size of the dataset. Classical information criteria typically consider the large-data limit, penalizing model size. However, these criteria are not appropriate in modern settings where overparameterized models tend to perform well. For any overparameterized model, we show that there exists a dual underparameterized model that possesses the same marginal likelihood, thus establishing a form of Bayesian duality. This enables more classical methods to be used in the overparameterized setting, revealing the Interpolating Information Criterion, a measure of model quality that naturally incorporates the choice of prior into the model selection. Our new information criterion accounts for prior misspecification, geometric and spectral properties of the model, and is numerically consistent with known empirical and theoretical behavior in this regime.</description>

Abstract: We study policy evaluation of offline contextual bandits subject to unobserved confounders. Sensitivity analysis methods are commonly used to estimate the policy value under the worst-case confounding over a given uncertainty set. However, existing work often resorts to some coarse relaxation of the uncertainty set for the sake of tractability, leading to overly conservative estimation of the policy value. In this paper, we propose a general estimator that provides a sharp lower bound of the policy value using convex programming. The generality of our estimator enables various extensions such as sensitivity analysis with f-divergence, model selection with cross validation and information criterion, and robust policy learning with the sharp lower bound. Furthermore, our estimation method can be reformulated as an empirical risk minimization problem thanks to the strong duality, which enables us to provide strong theoretical guarantees of the proposed estimator using techniques of the M-estimation.</description>

      <title>Learning Operators with Stochastic Gradient Descent in General Hilbert Spaces</title>

Abstract: This study investigates leveraging stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to learn operators between general Hilbert spaces. We propose weak and strong regularity conditions for the target operator to depict its intrinsic structure and complexity. Under these conditions, we establish upper bounds for convergence rates of the SGD algorithm and conduct a minimax lower bound analysis, further illustrating that our convergence analysis and regularity conditions quantitatively characterize the tractability of solving operator learning problems using the SGD algorithm. It is crucial to highlight that our convergence analysis is still valid for nonlinear operator learning. We show that the SGD estimator will converge to the best linear approximation of the nonlinear target operator. Moreover, applying our analysis to operator learning problems based on vector-valued and real-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces yields new convergence results, thereby refining the conclusions of existing literature.</description>

      <title>Hierarchic Flows to Estimate and Sample High-dimensional Probabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding low-dimensional interpretable models of complex physical fields such as turbulence remains an open question, 80 years after the pioneer work of Kolmogorov. Estimating high-dimensional probability distributions from data samples suffers from an optimization and an approximation curse of dimensionality. It may be avoided by following a hierarchic probability flow from coarse to fine scales. This inverse renormalization group is defined by conditional probabilities across scales, renormalized in a wavelet basis. For a $\vvarphi^4$ scalar potential, sampling these hierarchic models avoids the critical slowing down at the phase transition. In a well chosen wavelet basis, conditional probabilities can be captured with low dimensional parametric models, because interactions between wavelet coefficients are local in space and scales. An outstanding issue is also to approximate non-Gaussian fields having long-range interactions in space and across scales. We introduce low-dimensional models of wavelet conditional probabilities with the scattering covariance. It is calculated with a second wavelet transform, which defines interactions over two hierarchies of scales. We estimate and sample these wavelet scattering models to generate 2D vorticity fields of turbulence, and images of dark matter densities.</description>

      <title>Point processes with event time uncertainty</title>

Abstract: Point processes are widely used statistical models for continuous-time discrete event data, such as medical records, crime reports, and social network interactions, to capture the influence of historical events on future occurrences. In many applications, however, event times are not observed exactly, motivating the need to incorporate time uncertainty into point process modeling. In this work, we introduce a framework for modeling time-uncertain self-exciting point processes, known as Hawkes processes, possibly defined over a network. We begin by formulating the model in continuous time under assumptions motivated by real-world scenarios. By imposing a time grid, we obtain a discrete-time model that facilitates inference and enables computation via first-order optimization methods such as gradient descent and variational inequality (VI). We establish a parameter recovery guarantee for VI inference with an $O(1/k)$ convergence rate using $k$ steps. Our framework accommodates non-stationary processes by representing the influence kernel as a matrix (or tensor on a network), while also encompassing stationary processes, such as the classical Hawkes process, as a special case. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing baselines on both simulated and real-world datasets, including the sepsis-associated derangement prediction challenge and the Atlanta Police Crime Dataset.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless transition in a context-sensitive random language model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several power-law critical properties involving different statistics in natural languages -- reminiscent of scaling properties of physical systems at or near phase transitions -- have been documented for decades. The recent rise of large language models has added further evidence and excitement by providing intriguing similarities with notions in physics such as scaling laws and emergent abilities. However, specific instances of classes of generative language models that exhibit phase transitions, as understood by the statistical physics community, are lacking. In this work, inspired by the one-dimensional Potts model in statistical physics, we construct a simple probabilistic language model that falls under the class of context-sensitive grammars, which we call the context-sensitive random language model, and numerically demonstrate an unambiguous phase transition in the framework of a natural language model. We explicitly show that a precisely defined order parameter -- that captures symbol frequency biases in the sentences generated by the language model -- changes from strictly zero to a strictly nonzero value (in the infinite-length limit of sentences), implying a mathematical singularity arising when tuning the parameter of the stochastic language model we consider. Furthermore, we identify the phase transition as a variant of the Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) transition, which is known to exhibit critical properties not only at the transition point but also in the entire phase. This finding leads to the possibility that critical properties in natural languages may not require careful fine-tuning nor self-organized criticality, but are generically explained by the underlying connection between language structures and the BKT phases.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Non-Convex Generalized Linear Models in High-Dimensions: A proof of the replica formula</title>

Abstract: The analytic characterization of the high-dimensional behavior of optimization for Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) with Gaussian data has been a central focus in statistics and probability in recent years. While convex cases, such as the LASSO, ridge regression, and logistic regression, have been extensively studied using a variety of techniques, the non-convex case remains far less understood despite its significance. A non-rigorous statistical physics framework has provided remarkable predictions for the behavior of high-dimensional optimization problems, but rigorously establishing their validity for non-convex problems has remained a fundamental challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by developing a systematic framework that rigorously proves replica-symmetric formulas for non-convex GLMs and precisely determines the conditions under which these formulas are valid. Remarkably, the rigorous replica-symmetric predictions align exactly with the conjectures made by physicists, and the so-called replicon condition. The originality of our approach lies in connecting two powerful theoretical tools: the Gaussian Min-Max Theorem, which we use to provide precise lower bounds, and Approximate Message Passing (AMP), which is shown to achieve these bounds algorithmically. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through significant applications: (i) by proving the optimality of the Tukey loss over the more commonly used Huber loss under a $\varepsilon$ contaminated data model, (ii) establishing the optimality of negative regularization in high-dimensional non-convex regression and (iii) characterizing the performance limits of linearized AMP algorithms. By rigorously validating statistical physics predictions in non-convex settings, we aim to open new pathways for analyzing increasingly complex optimization landscapes beyond the convex regime.</description>

      <title>Learning Operators by Regularized Stochastic Gradient Descent with Operator-valued Kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of statistical inverse problems involving the estimation of a regression operator from a Polish space to a separable Hilbert space, where the target lies in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by an operator-valued kernel. To address the associated ill-posedness, we analyze regularized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms in both online and finite-horizon settings. The former uses polynomially decaying step sizes and regularization parameters, while the latter adopts fixed values. Under suitable structural and distributional assumptions, we establish dimension-independent bounds for prediction and estimation errors. The resulting convergence rates are near-optimal in expectation, and we also derive high-probability estimates that imply almost sure convergence. Our analysis introduces a general technique for obtaining high-probability guarantees in infinite-dimensional settings. Possible extensions to broader kernel classes and encoder-decoder structures are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Multivariate Extremes: a Wasserstein-Aitchison GAN approach</title>

Abstract: Economically responsible mitigation of multivariate extreme risks-such as extreme rainfall over large areas, large simultaneous variations in many stock prices, or widespread breakdowns in transportation systems-requires assessing the resilience of the systems under plausible stress scenarios. This paper uses Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to develop a new approach to simulating such multivariate extreme events. Specifically, we assume that after transformation to a standard scale the distribution of the random phenomenon of interest is multivariate regular varying and use this to provide a sampling procedure for extremes on the original scale. Our procedure combines a Wasserstein-Aitchison Generative Adversarial Network (WA-GAN) to simulate the tail dependence structure on the standard scale with joint modeling of the univariate marginal tails on the original scale. The WA-GAN procedure relies on the angular measure-encoding the distribution on the unit simplex of the angles of extreme observations-after transformation to Aitchison coordinates, which allows the Wasserstein-GAN algorithm to be run in a linear space. Our method is applied both to simulated data under various tail dependence scenarios and to a financial data set from the Kenneth French Data Library. The proposed algorithm demonstrates strong performance compared to existing alternatives in the literature, both in capturing tail dependence structures and in generating accurate new extreme observations.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rates of Constrained Expected Improvement</title>

Abstract: Constrained Bayesian optimization (CBO) methods have seen significant success in black-box optimization with constraints. One of the most commonly used CBO methods is the constrained expected improvement (CEI) algorithm. CEI is a natural extension of expected improvement (EI) when constraints are incorporated. However, the theoretical convergence rate of CEI has not been established. In this work, we study the convergence rate of CEI by analyzing its simple regret upper bound. First, we show that when the objective function $f$ and constraint function $c$ are assumed to each lie in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), CEI achieves the convergence rates of $\mathcal{O} \left(t^{-\frac{1}{2}}\log^{\frac{d+1}{2}}(t) \right) \ \text{and }\ \mathcal{O}\left(t^{\frac{-\nu}{2\nu+d}} \log^{\frac{\nu}{2\nu+d}}(t)\right)$ for the commonly used squared exponential and Mat\'{e}rn kernels ($\nu&gt;\frac{1}{2}$), respectively. Second, we show that when $f$ is assumed to be sampled from Gaussian processes (GPs), CEI achieves similar convergence rates with a high probability. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Stable Minima of ReLU Neural Networks Suffer from the Curse of Dimensionality: The Neural Shattering Phenomenon</title>

Abstract: We study the implicit bias of flatness / low (loss) curvature and its effects on generalization in two-layer overparameterized ReLU networks with multivariate inputs -- a problem well motivated by the minima stability and edge-of-stability phenomena in gradient-descent training. Existing work either requires interpolation or focuses only on univariate inputs. This paper presents new and somewhat surprising theoretical results for multivariate inputs. On two natural settings (1) generalization gap for flat solutions, and (2) mean-squared error (MSE) in nonparametric function estimation by stable minima, we prove upper and lower bounds, which establish that while flatness does imply generalization, the resulting rates of convergence necessarily deteriorate exponentially as the input dimension grows. This gives an exponential separation between the flat solutions compared to low-norm solutions (i.e., weight decay), which are known not to suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In particular, our minimax lower bound construction, based on a novel packing argument with boundary-localized ReLU neurons, reveals how flat solutions can exploit a kind of "neural shattering" where neurons rarely activate, but with high weight magnitudes. This leads to poor performance in high dimensions. We corroborate these theoretical findings with extensive numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis provides the first systematic explanation for why flat minima may fail to generalize in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>When Less Is More: Binary Feedback Can Outperform Ordinal Comparisons in Ranking Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01613v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Paired comparison data, where users evaluate items in pairs, play a central role in ranking and preference learning tasks. While ordinal comparison data intuitively offer richer information than binary comparisons, this paper challenges that conventional wisdom. We propose a general parametric framework for modeling ordinal paired comparisons without ties. The model adopts a generalized additive structure, featuring a link function that quantifies the preference difference between two items and a pattern function that governs the distribution over ordinal response levels. This framework encompasses classical binary comparison models as special cases, by treating binary responses as binarized versions of ordinal data. Within this framework, we show that binarizing ordinal data can significantly improve the accuracy of ranking recovery. Specifically, we prove that under the counting algorithm, the ranking error associated with binary comparisons exhibits a faster exponential convergence rate than that of ordinal data. Furthermore, we characterize a substantial performance gap between binary and ordinal data in terms of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) determined by the pattern function. We identify the pattern function that minimizes the SNR and maximizes the benefit of binarization. Extensive simulations and a real application on the MovieLens dataset further corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern neural networks often produce miscalibrated confidence scores and struggle to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, while most existing methods post-process outputs without testing internal consistency. We introduce the Bag-of-Coins (BoC) probe, a non-parametric diagnostic of logit coherence that compares softmax confidence $\hat p$ to an aggregate of pairwise Luce-style dominance probabilities $\bar q$, yielding a deterministic coherence score and a p-value-based structural score. Across ViT, ResNet, and RoBERTa with ID/OOD test sets, the coherence gap $\Delta=\bar q-\hat p$ reveals clear ID/OOD separation for ViT (ID ${\sim}0.1$-$0.2$, OOD ${\sim}0.5$-$0.6$) but substantial overlap for ResNet and RoBERTa (both ${\sim}0$), indicating architecture-dependent uncertainty geometry. As a practical method, BoC improves calibration only when the base model is poorly calibrated (ViT: ECE $0.024$ vs.\ $0.180$) and underperforms standard calibrators (ECE ${\sim}0.005$), while for OOD detection it fails across architectures (AUROC $0.020$-$0.253$) compared to standard scores ($0.75$-$0.99$). We position BoC as a research diagnostic for interrogating how architectures encode uncertainty in logit geometry rather than a production calibration or OOD detection method.</description>

      <title>From Sublinear to Linear: Fast Convergence in Deep Networks via Locally Polyak-Lojasiewicz Regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient descent (GD) on deep neural network loss landscapes is non-convex, yet often converges far faster in practice than classical guarantees suggest. Prior work shows that within locally quasi-convex regions (LQCRs), GD converges to stationary points at sublinear rates, leaving the commonly observed near-exponential training dynamics unexplained. We show that, under a mild local Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) stability assumption, the loss satisfies a PL-type error bound within these regions, yielding a Locally Polyak-Lojasiewicz Region (LPLR) in which the squared gradient norm controls the suboptimality gap. For properly initialized finite-width networks, we show that under local NTK stability this PL-type mechanism holds around initialization and establish linear convergence of GD as long as the iterates remain within the resulting LPLR. Empirically, we observe PL-like scaling and linear-rate loss decay in controlled full-batch training and in a ResNet-style CNN trained with mini-batch SGD on a CIFAR-10 subset, indicating that LPLR signatures can persist under modern architectures and stochastic optimization. Overall, the results connect local geometric structure, local NTK stability, and fast optimization rates in a finite-width setting.</description>

Abstract: We consider fully connected and feedforward deep neural networks with dependent and possibly heavy-tailed weights, as introduced in Lee et al. 2023, to address limitations of the standard Gaussian prior. It has been proved in Lee et al. 2023 that, as the number of nodes in the hidden layers grows large, according to a sequential and ordered limit, the law of the output converges weakly to a Gaussian mixture. Among our results, we present sufficient conditions on the model parameters (the activation function and the associated L\'evy measures) which ensure that the sequential limit is independent of the order. Next, we study the neural network through the lens of the posterior distribution with a Gaussian likelihood. If the random covariance matrix of the infinite-width limit is positive definite under the prior, we identify the posterior distribution of the output in the wide-width limit according to a sequential regime. Remarkably, we provide mild sufficient conditions to ensure the aforementioned invertibility of the random covariance matrix under the prior, thereby extending the results in L. Carvalho et al. 2025. We illustrate our findings using numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We develop a stochastic approximation framework for learning nonlinear operators between infinite-dimensional spaces utilizing general Mercer operator-valued kernels. Our framework encompasses two key classes: (i) compact kernels, which admit discrete spectral decompositions, and (ii) diagonal kernels of the form $K(x,x')=k(x,x')T$, where $k$ is a scalar-valued kernel and $T$ is a positive operator on the output space. This broad setting induces expressive vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that generalize the classical $K=kI$ paradigm, thereby enabling rich structural modeling with rigorous theoretical guarantees. To address target operators lying outside the RKHS, we introduce vector-valued interpolation spaces to precisely quantify misspecification error. Within this framework, we establish dimension-free polynomial convergence rates, demonstrating that nonlinear operator learning can overcome the curse of dimensionality. The use of general operator-valued kernels further allows us to derive rates for intrinsically nonlinear operator learning, going beyond the linear-type behavior inherent in diagonal constructions of $K=kI$. Importantly, this framework accommodates a wide range of operator learning tasks, ranging from integral operators such as Fredholm operators to architectures based on encoder-decoder representations. Moreover, we validate its effectiveness through numerical experiments on the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Predictive inference for time series: why is split conformal effective despite temporal dependence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of uncertainty quantification for prediction in a time series: if we use past data to forecast the next time point, can we provide valid prediction intervals around our forecasts? To avoid placing distributional assumptions on the data, in recent years the conformal prediction method has been a popular approach for predictive inference, since it provides distribution-free coverage for any iid or exchangeable data distribution. However, in the time series setting, the strong empirical performance of conformal prediction methods is not well understood, since even short-range temporal dependence is a strong violation of the exchangeability assumption. Using predictors with "memory" -- i.e., predictors that utilize past observations, such as autoregressive models -- further exacerbates this problem. In this work, we examine the theoretical properties of split conformal prediction in the time series setting, including the case where predictors may have memory. Our results bound the loss of coverage of these methods in terms of a new "switch coefficient", measuring the extent to which temporal dependence within the time series creates violations of exchangeability. Our characterization of the coverage probability is sharp over the class of stationary, $\beta$-mixing processes. Along the way, we introduce tools that may prove useful in analyzing other predictive inference methods for dependent data.</description>

      <title>Copula-Stein Discrepancy: A Generator-Based Stein Operator for Archimedean Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel Stein discrepancies (KSDs) are widely used for goodness-of-fit testing, but standard KSDs can be insensitive to higher-order dependence features such as tail dependence. We introduce the Copula-Stein Discrepancy (CSD), which defines a Stein operator directly on the copula density to target dependence geometry rather than the joint score. For Archimedean copulas, CSD admits a closed-form Stein kernel derived from the scalar generator. We prove that CSD metrizes weak convergence of copula distributions, admits an empirical estimator with minimax-optimal rate $O_P(n^{-1/2})$, and is sensitive to differences in tail dependence coefficients. We further extend the framework beyond Archimedean families to general copulas, including elliptical and vine constructions. Computationally, exact CSD kernel evaluation is linear in dimension, and a random-feature approximation reduces the quadratic $O(n^2)$ sample scaling to near-linear $\tilde{O}(n)$; experiments show near-nominal Type~I error, increasing power, and rapid concentration of the approximation toward the exact $\widehat{\mathrm{CSD}}_n^2$ as the number of features grows.</description>

      <title>Relaxed Gaussian process interpolation: a goal-oriented approach to Bayesian optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03034v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a new procedure for obtaining predictive distributions in the context of Gaussian process (GP) modeling, with a relaxation of the interpolation constraints outside ranges of interest: the mean of the predictive distributions no longer necessarily interpolates the observed values when they are outside ranges of interest, but are simply constrained to remain outside. This method called relaxed Gaussian process (reGP) interpolation provides better predictive distributions in ranges of interest, especially in cases where a stationarity assumption for the GP model is not appropriate. It can be viewed as a goal-oriented method and becomes particularly interesting in Bayesian optimization, for example, for the minimization of an objective function, where good predictive distributions for low function values are important. When the expected improvement criterion and reGP are used for sequentially choosing evaluation points, the convergence of the resulting optimization algorithm is theoretically guaranteed (provided that the function to be optimized lies in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space attached to the known covariance of the underlying Gaussian process). Experiments indicate that using reGP instead of stationary GP models in Bayesian optimization is beneficial.</description>

      <title>Strategic Geosteering Workflow with Uncertainty Quantification and Deep Learning: A Case Study on the Goliat Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The real-time interpretation of the logging-while-drilling data allows us to estimate the positions and properties of the geological layers in an anisotropic subsurface environment. Robust real-time estimations capturing uncertainty can be very useful for efficient geosteering operations. However, the model errors in the prior conceptual geological models and forward simulation of the measurements can be significant factors in the unreliable estimations of the profiles of the geological layers. The model errors are specifically pronounced when using a deep-neural-network (DNN) approximation which we use to accelerate and parallelize the simulation of the measurements. This paper presents a practical workflow consisting of offline and online phases. The offline phase includes DNN training and building of an uncertain prior near-well geo-model. The online phase uses the flexible iterative ensemble smoother (FlexIES) to perform real-time assimilation of extra-deep electromagnetic data accounting for the model errors in the approximate DNN model. We demonstrate the proposed workflow on a case study for a historic well in the Goliat Field (Barents Sea). The median of our probabilistic estimation is on-par with proprietary inversion despite the approximate DNN model and regardless of the number of layers in the chosen prior. By estimating the model errors, FlexIES automatically quantifies the uncertainty in the layers' boundaries and resistivities, which is not standard for proprietary inversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a hierarchical tensor-network approach for approximating high-dimensional probability density via empirical distribution. This leverages randomized singular value decomposition (SVD) techniques and involves solving linear equations for tensor cores in this tensor network. The complexity of the resulting algorithm scales linearly in the dimension of the high-dimensional density. An analysis of estimation error demonstrates the effectiveness of this method through several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A Concentration Bound for TD(0) with Function Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10424v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive uniform all-time concentration bound of the type 'for all $n \geq n_0$ for some $n_0$' for TD(0) with linear function approximation. We work with online TD learning with samples from a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain. This makes our analysis significantly different from offline TD learning or TD learning with access to independent samples from the stationary distribution of the Markov chain. We treat TD(0) as a contractive stochastic approximation algorithm, with both martingale and Markov noises. Markov noise is handled using the Poisson equation and the lack of almost sure guarantees on boundedness of iterates is handled using the concept of relaxed concentration inequalities.</description>

      <title>Reimagining Anomalies: What If Anomalies Were Normal?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have achieved a breakthrough in image anomaly detection, but their complexity introduces a considerable challenge to understanding why an instance is predicted to be anomalous. We introduce a novel explanation method that generates multiple alternative modifications for each anomaly, capturing diverse concepts of anomalousness. Each modification is trained to be perceived as normal by the anomaly detector. The method provides a semantic explanation of the mechanism that triggered the detector, allowing users to explore ``what-if scenarios.'' Qualitative and quantitative analyses across various image datasets demonstrate that applying this method to state-of-the-art detectors provides high-quality semantic explanations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In data-driven decision-making in marketing, healthcare, and education, it is desirable to utilize a large amount of data from existing ventures to navigate high-dimensional feature spaces and address data scarcity in new ventures. We explore knowledge transfer in dynamic decision-making by concentrating on batch stationary environments and formally defining task discrepancies through the lens of Markov decision processes (MDPs). We propose a framework of Transferred Fitted $Q$-Iteration algorithm with general function approximation, enabling the direct estimation of the optimal action-state function $Q^*$ using both target and source data. We establish the relationship between statistical performance and MDP task discrepancy under sieve approximation, shedding light on the impact of source and target sample sizes and task discrepancy on the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. We show that the final learning error of the $Q^*$ function is significantly improved from the single task rate both theoretically and empirically.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Online Dynamic Assortment with Dual Contextual Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As e-commerce expands, delivering real-time personalized recommendations from vast catalogs poses a critical challenge for retail platforms. Maximizing revenue requires careful consideration of both individual customer characteristics and available item features to continuously optimize assortments over time. In this paper, we consider the dynamic assortment problem with dual contexts -- user and item features. In high-dimensional scenarios, the quadratic growth of dimensions complicates computation and estimation. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new low-rank dynamic assortment model to transform this problem into a manageable scale. Then we propose an efficient algorithm that estimates the intrinsic subspaces and utilizes the upper confidence bound approach to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off in online decision making. Theoretically, we establish a regret bound of $\tilde{O}((d_1+d_2)r\sqrt{T})$, where $d_1, d_2$ represent the dimensions of the user and item features respectively, $r$ is the rank of the parameter matrix, and $T$ denotes the time horizon. This bound represents a substantial improvement over prior literature, achieved by leveraging the low-rank structure. Extensive simulations and an application to the Expedia hotel recommendation dataset further demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Iterative Methods for Full-Scale Gaussian Process Approximations for Large Spatial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14492v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes are flexible probabilistic regression models which are widely used in statistics and machine learning. However, a drawback is their limited scalability to large data sets. To alleviate this, full-scale approximations (FSAs) combine predictive process methods and covariance tapering, thus approximating both global and local structures. We show how iterative methods can be used to reduce computational costs in calculating likelihoods, gradients, and predictive distributions with FSAs. In particular, we introduce a novel preconditioner and show theoretically and empirically that it accelerates the conjugate gradient method's convergence speed and mitigates its sensitivity with respect to the FSA parameters and the eigenvalue structure of the original covariance matrix, and we demonstrate empirically that it outperforms a state-of-the-art pivoted Cholesky preconditioner. Furthermore, we introduce an accurate and fast way to calculate predictive variances using stochastic simulation and iterative methods. In addition, we show how our newly proposed fully independent training conditional (FITC) preconditioner can also be used in iterative methods for Vecchia approximations. In our experiments, it outperforms existing state-of-the-art preconditioners for Vecchia approximations. All methods are implemented in a free C++ software library with high-level Python and R packages.</description>

      <title>Model Privacy: A Unified Framework to Understand Model Stealing Attacks and Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning (ML) has become increasingly prevalent in various domains, highlighting the importance of understanding and ensuring its safety. One pressing concern is the vulnerability of ML applications to model stealing attacks. These attacks involve adversaries attempting to recover a learned model through limited query-response interactions, such as those found in cloud-based services or on-chip artificial intelligence interfaces. While existing literature proposes various attack and defense strategies, these often lack a theoretical foundation and standardized evaluation criteria. In response, this work presents a framework called ``Model Privacy'', providing a foundation for comprehensively analyzing model stealing attacks and defenses. We establish a rigorous formulation for the threat model and objectives, propose methods to quantify the goodness of attack and defense strategies, and analyze the fundamental tradeoffs between utility and privacy in ML models. Our developed theory offers valuable insights into enhancing the security of ML models, especially highlighting the importance of the attack-specific structure of perturbations for effective defenses. We demonstrate the application of model privacy from the defender's perspective through various learning scenarios. Extensive experiments corroborate the insights and the effectiveness of defense mechanisms developed under the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Calibration Bands for Mean Estimates within the Exponential Dispersion Family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A statistical model is said to be calibrated if the resulting mean estimates perfectly match the true means of the underlying responses. Aiming for calibration is often not achievable in practice as one has to deal with finite samples of noisy observations. A weaker notion of calibration is auto-calibration. An auto-calibrated model satisfies that the expected value of the responses for a given mean estimate matches this estimate. Testing for autocalibration has only been considered recently in the literature and we propose a new approach based on calibration bands. Calibration bands denote a set of lower and upper bounds such that the probability that the true means lie simultaneously inside those bounds exceeds some given confidence level. Such bands were constructed by Yang-Barber (2019) for sub-Gaussian distributions. Dimitriadis et al. (2023) then introduced narrower bands for the Bernoulli distribution. We use the same idea in order to extend the construction to the entire exponential dispersion family that contains for example the binomial, Poisson, negative binomial, gamma and normal distributions. Moreover, we show that the obtained calibration bands allow us to construct various tests for calibration and auto-calibration, respectively. As the construction of the bands does not rely on asymptotic results, we emphasize that our tests can be used for any sample size.</description>

      <title>Ordinary Least Squares as an Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I show that ordinary least squares (OLS) predictions can be rewritten as the output of a restricted attention module, akin to those forming the backbone of large language models. This connection offers an alternative perspective on attention beyond the conventional information retrieval framework, making it more accessible to researchers and analysts with a background in traditional statistics. It falls into place when OLS is framed as a similarity-based method in a transformed regressor space, distinct from the standard view based on partial correlations. In fact, the OLS solution can be recast as the outcome of an alternative problem: minimizing squared prediction errors by optimizing the embedding space in which training and test vectors are compared via inner products. Rather than estimating coefficients directly, we equivalently learn optimal encoding and decoding operations for predictors. From this vantage point, OLS maps naturally onto the query-key-value structure of attention mechanisms. Building on this foundation, I discuss key elements of Transformer-style attention and draw connections to classic ideas from time series econometrics.</description>

      <title>SAD Neural Networks: Divergent Gradient Flows and Asymptotic Optimality via o-minimal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gradient flows for loss landscapes of fully connected feedforward neural networks with commonly used continuously differentiable activation functions such as the logistic, hyperbolic tangent, softplus or GELU function. We prove that the gradient flow either converges to a critical point or diverges to infinity while the loss converges to an asymptotic critical value. Moreover, we prove the existence of a threshold $\varepsilon&gt;0$ such that the loss value of any gradient flow initialized at most $\varepsilon$ above the optimal level converges to it. For polynomial target functions and sufficiently big architecture and data set, we prove that the optimal loss value is zero and can only be realized asymptotically. From this setting, we deduce our main result that any gradient flow with sufficiently good initialization diverges to infinity. Our proof heavily relies on the geometry of o-minimal structures. We confirm these theoretical findings with numerical experiments and extend our investigation to more realistic scenarios, where we observe an analogous behavior.</description>

      <title>The Power of Iterative Filtering for Supervised Learning with (Heavy) Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent work on learning with distribution shift, we give a general outlier removal algorithm called iterative polynomial filtering and show a number of striking applications for supervised learning with contamination: (1) We show that any function class that can be approximated by low-degree polynomials with respect to a hypercontractive distribution can be efficiently learned under bounded contamination (also known as nasty noise). This is a surprising resolution to a longstanding gap between the complexity of agnostic learning and learning with contamination, as it was widely believed that low-degree approximators only implied tolerance to label noise. In particular, it implies the first efficient algorithm for learning halfspaces with $\eta$-bounded contamination up to error $2\eta+\epsilon$ with respect to the Gaussian distribution. (2) For any function class that admits the (stronger) notion of sandwiching approximators, we obtain near-optimal learning guarantees even with respect to heavy additive contamination, where far more than $1/2$ of the training set may be added adversarially. Prior related work held only for regression and in a list-decodable setting. (3) We obtain the first efficient algorithms for tolerant testable learning of functions of halfspaces with respect to any fixed log-concave distribution. Even the non-tolerant case for a single halfspace in this setting had remained open. These results significantly advance our understanding of efficient supervised learning under contamination, a setting that has been much less studied than its unsupervised counterpart.</description>

      <title>PCA-Guided Quantile Sampling: Preserving Data Structure in Large-Scale Subsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Principal Component Analysis guided Quantile Sampling (PCA QS), a novel sampling framework designed to preserve both the statistical and geometric structure of large scale datasets. Unlike conventional PCA, which reduces dimensionality at the cost of interpretability, PCA QS retains the original feature space while using leading principal components solely to guide a quantile based stratification scheme. This principled design ensures that sampling remains representative without distorting the underlying data semantics. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees, deriving convergence rates for empirical quantiles, Kullback Leibler divergence, and Wasserstein distance, thus quantifying the distributional fidelity of PCA QS samples. Practical guidelines for selecting the number of principal components, quantile bins, and sampling rates are provided based on these results. Extensive empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that PCA QS consistently outperforms simple random sampling, yielding better structure preservation and improved downstream model performance. Together, these contributions position PCA QS as a scalable, interpretable, and theoretically grounded solution for efficient data summarization in modern machine learning workflows.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapped Control Limits for Score-Based Concept Drift Control Charts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitoring for changes in a predictive relationship represented by a fitted supervised learning model (i.e., concept drift detection) is a widespread problem in modern data-driven applications. A general and powerful Fisher score-based concept drift approach was recently proposed, in which detecting concept drift reduces to detecting changes in the mean of the model's score vector using a multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA). To implement the approach, the initial data must be split into two subsets. The first subset serves as the training sample to which the model is fit, and the second subset serves as an out-of-sample test set from which the MEWMA control limit (CL) is determined. In this paper, we retain the same score-based MEWMA monitoring statistic as the existing method and focus instead on improving the computation of the control limit. We develop a novel nested bootstrap procedure for calibrating the CL that allows the entire initial sample to be used for model fitting, thereby yielding a more accurate baseline model while eliminating the need for a large holdout set. We show that a standard nested bootstrap substantially underestimates the variability of the monitoring statistic and develop a 0.632-like correction that appropriately accounts for this. We demonstrate the advantages with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed, boundary-constrained Gaussian process regression for the reconstruction of fluid flow fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process regression techniques have been used in fluid mechanics for the reconstruction of flow fields from a reduction-of-dimension perspective. A main ingredient in this setting is the construction of adapted covariance functions, or kernels, to obtain such estimates. In this paper, we present a general method for constraining a prescribed Gaussian process on an arbitrary compact set. The kernel of the pre-defined process must be at least continuous and may include other information about the studied phenomenon. This general boundary-constraining framework can be implemented with high flexibility for a broad range of engineering applications. From this, we derive physics-informed kernels for simulating two-dimensional velocity fields of an incompressible (divergence-free) flow around aerodynamic profiles. These kernels allow to define Gaussian process priors satisfying the incompressibility condition and the prescribed boundary conditions along the profile in a continuous manner. We describe an adapted numerical method for the boundary-constraining procedure parameterized by a measure on the compact set. The relevance of the methodology and performances are illustrated by numerical simulations of flows around a cylinder and a NACA 0412 airfoil profile, for which no observation at the boundary is needed at all.</description>

      <title>TensorHyper-VQC: A Tensor-Train-Guided Hypernetwork for Robust and Scalable Variational Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental scalability barriers, primarily due to barren plateaus and sensitivity to quantum noise. To address these challenges, we introduce TensorHyper-VQC, a novel tensor-train (TT)-guided hypernetwork framework that significantly improves the robustness and scalability of VQC. Our framework fully delegates the generation of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Grounded in Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum simulation tasks demonstrate that TensorHyper-VQC consistently achieves superior performance and robust noise tolerance, including hardware-level validation on a 156-qubit IBM Heron processor. These results position TensorHyper-VQC as a scalable and noise-resilient framework for advancing practical quantum machine learning on near-term devices.</description>

      <title>ORACLE: Explaining Feature Interactions in Neural Networks with ANOVA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10825v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ORACLE, a framework for explaining neural networks on tabular data and scientific factorial designs. ORACLE summarizes a trained network's prediction surface with main effects and pairwise interactions by treating the network as a black-box response, discretizing the inputs onto a grid, and fitting an orthogonal factorial (ANOVA-style) surrogate -- the $L^2$ orthogonal projection of the model response onto a finite-dimensional factorial subspace. A simple centering and $\mu$-rebalancing step then expresses this surrogate as main- and interaction-effect tables that remain faithful to the original model in the $L^2$ sense. The resulting grid-based interaction maps are easy to visualize, comparable across backbones, and directly aligned with classical design-of-experiments practice. On synthetic factorial benchmarks and low- to medium-dimensional tabular regression tasks, ORACLE more accurately recovers ground-truth interaction structure and hotspots than Monte Carlo SHAP-family interaction methods, as measured by ranking, localization, and cross-backbone stability. We also discuss its scope in latent image and text settings: grid-based factorial surrogates are most effective when features admit an interpretable factorial structure, making ORACLE particularly well-suited to scientific and engineering workflows that require stable DoE-style interaction summaries.</description>

      <title>Wide Neural Networks as a Baseline for the Computational No-Coincidence Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish that randomly initialized neural networks, with large width and a natural choice of hyperparameters, have nearly independent outputs exactly when their activation function is nonlinear with zero mean under the Gaussian measure: $\mathbb{E}_{z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)}[\sigma(z)]=0$. For example, this includes ReLU and GeLU with an additive shift, as well as tanh, but not ReLU or GeLU by themselves. Because of their nearly independent outputs, we propose neural networks with zero-mean activation functions as a promising candidate for the Alignment Research Center's computational no-coincidence conjecture -- a conjecture that aims to measure the limits of AI interpretability.</description>

      <title>Gradient descent for deep equilibrium single-index models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for training infinitely deep weight-tied neural networks that achieve state of the art performance across many modern machine learning tasks. Despite their practical success, theoretically understanding the gradient descent dynamics for training DEQs remains an area of active research. In this work, we rigorously study the gradient descent dynamics for DEQs in the simple setting of linear models and single-index models, filling several gaps in the literature. We prove a conservation law for linear DEQs which implies that the parameters remain trapped on spheres during training and use this property to show that gradient flow remains well-conditioned for all time. We then prove linear convergence of gradient descent to a global minimizer for linear DEQs and deep equilibrium single-index models under appropriate initialization and with a sufficiently small step size. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through experiments.</description>

      <title>SAVeD: Semantic Aware Version Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our work introduces SAVeD (Semantically Aware Version Detection), a contrastive learning-based framework for identifying versions of structured datasets without relying on metadata, labels, or integration-based assumptions. SAVeD addresses a common challenge in data science of repeated labor due to a difficulty of similar work or transformations on datasets. SAVeD employs a modified SimCLR pipeline, generating augmented table views through random transformations (e.g., row deletion, encoding perturbations). These views are embedded via a custom transformer encoder and contrasted in latent space to optimize semantic similarity. Our model learns to minimize distances between augmented views of the same dataset and maximize those between unrelated tables. We evaluate performance using validation accuracy and separation, defined respectively as the proportion of correctly classified version/non-version pairs on a hold-out set, and the difference between average similarities of versioned and non-versioned tables (defined by a benchmark, and not provided to the model). Our experiments span five canonical datasets from the Semantic Versioning in Databases Benchmark, and demonstrate substantial gains post-training. SAVeD achieves significantly higher accuracy on completely unseen tables in, and a significant boost in separation scores, confirming its capability to distinguish semantically altered versions. Compared to untrained baselines and prior state-of-the-art dataset-discovery methods like Starmie, our custom encoder achieves competitive or superior results.</description>

      <title>CLAPS: Posterior-Aware Conformal Intervals via Last-Layer Laplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present CLAPS, a posterior-aware conformal regression method that pairs a Last-Layer Laplace Approximation with split-conformal calibration. From the resulting Gaussian posterior, CLAPS defines a simple two-sided posterior CDF score that aligns the conformity metric with the full predictive shape, not just a point estimate. This alignment can yield substantially narrower prediction intervals at a fixed target coverage, particularly on small to medium tabular datasets where data are scarce and uncertainty modeling is informative. We also provide a lightweight diagnostic suite that separates aleatoric and epistemic components and visualizes posterior behavior, helping practitioners assess when and why intervals shrink. Across multiple benchmarks using the same MLP backbone, CLAPS achieves nominal coverage and offers the most efficient intervals on small to medium datasets with mild heterogeneity, while remaining competitive and diagnostically transparent on large-scale heterogeneous data where Normalized-CP and CQR attain the tightest intervals.</description>

      <title>A Regime-Aware Fusion Framework for Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based methods such as Rocket are among the most effective default approaches for univariate time series classification (TSC), yet they do not perform equally well across all datasets. We revisit the long-standing intuition that different representations capture complementary structure and show that selectively fusing them can yield consistent improvements over Rocket on specific, systematically identifiable kinds of datasets. We introduce Fusion-3 (F3), a lightweight framework that adaptively fuses Rocket, SAX, and SFA representations. To understand when fusion helps, we cluster UCR datasets into six groups using meta-features capturing series length, spectral structure, roughness, and class imbalance, and treat these clusters as interpretable data-structure regimes. Our analysis shows that fusion typically outperforms strong baselines in regimes with structured variability or rich frequency content, while offering diminishing returns in highly irregular or outlier-heavy settings. To support these findings, we combine three complementary analyses: non-parametric paired statistics across datasets, ablation studies isolating the roles of individual representations, and attribution via SHAP to identify which dataset properties predict fusion gains. Sample-level case studies further reveal the underlying mechanism: fusion primarily improves performance by rescuing specific errors, with adaptive increases in frequency-domain weighting precisely where corrections occur. Using 5-fold cross-validation on the 113 UCR datasets, F3 yields small but consistent average improvements over Rocket, supported by frequentist and Bayesian evidence and accompanied by clearly identifiable failure cases. Our results show that selectively applied fusion provides dependable and interpretable extension to strong kernel-based methods, correcting their weaknesses precisely where the data support it.</description>
