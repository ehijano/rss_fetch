      <title>Is the annualized compounded return of Medallion over 35%?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a challenge to estimate fund performance by compounded returns. Arguably, it is incorrect to use yearly returns directly for compounding, with reported annualized return of above 60% for Medallion for the 31 years up to 2018. We propose an estimation based on fund sizes and trading profits and obtain a compounded return of 32.6% before fees with a 3% financing rate. Alternatively, we suggest using the manager's wealth as a proxy and arriving at a compounded growth rate of 25.6% for Simons for the 33 years up to 2020. We conclude that the annualized compounded return of Medallion before fees is probably under 35%. Our findings have implications for how to compute fund performance correctly.</description>

      <title>Data-generating process and time-series asset pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the data-generating processes for factors expressed in return differences, which the literature on time-series asset pricing seems to have overlooked. For the factors' data-generating processes or long-short zero-cost portfolios, a meaningful definition of returns is impossible; further, the compounded market factor (MF) significantly underestimates the return difference between the market and the risk-free rate compounded separately. Surprisingly, if MF were treated coercively as periodic-rebalancing long-short (i.e., the same as size and value), Fama-French three-factor (FF3) would be economically unattractive for lacking compounding and irrelevant for suffering from the small "size of an effect." Otherwise, FF3 might be misspecified if MF were buy-and-hold long-short. Finally, we show that OLS with net returns for single-index models leads to inflated alphas, exaggerated t-values, and overestimated Sharpe ratios (SR); worse, net returns may lead to pathological alphas and SRs. We propose defining factors (and SRs) with non-difference compound returns.</description>

      <title>Uniform Pessimistic Risk and its Optimal Portfolio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal allocation of assets has been widely discussed with the theoretical analysis of risk measures, and pessimism is one of the most attractive approaches beyond the conventional optimal portfolio model. The $\alpha$-risk plays a crucial role in deriving a broad class of pessimistic optimal portfolios. However, estimating an optimal portfolio assessed by a pessimistic risk is still challenging due to the absence of a computationally tractable model. In this study, we propose an integral of $\alpha$-risk called the \textit{uniform pessimistic risk} and the computational algorithm to obtain an optimal portfolio based on the risk. Further, we investigate the theoretical properties of the proposed risk in view of three different approaches: multiple quantile regression, the proper scoring rule, and distributionally robust optimization. Real data analysis of three stock datasets (S\&amp;P500, CSI500, KOSPI200) demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed risk and portfolio model.</description>
