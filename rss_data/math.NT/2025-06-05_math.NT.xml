      <title>Indefinite theta functions arising from affine Lie superalgebras and sums of triangular numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the recently developed theory of Roehrig and Zwegers on indefinite theta functions to prove certain power series are modular forms. As a consequence, we obtain several power series identities for powers of the generating function of triangular numbers. We also show that these identities arise as specializations of denominator identities of affine Lie superalgebras.</description>

      <title>On the number of divisors of Mersenne numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denote $f(n):=\sum_{1\le k\le n} \tau(2^k-1)$, where $\tau$ is the number of divisors function. Motivated by a question of Paul Erd\H{o}s, we show that the sequence of ratios $f(2n)/f(n)$ is unbounded. We also present conditional results on the divergence of this sequence to infinity. Finally, we test numerically both the conjecture $f(2n)/f(n)\to\infty$ and our sufficient conditions for it to hold.</description>

      <title>Refinements on higher order Weil-Oesterl\'e bounds via a Serre type argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weil's theorem gives the most standard bound on the number of points of a curve over a finite field. This bound was improved by Ihara and Oesterl\'e for larger genus. Recently, Hallouin and Perret gave a new point of view on these bounds, that can be obtained by solving a sequence of semi-definite programs, and the two first steps of this hierarchy recover Weil's and Ihara's bounds. On the other hand, by taking into account arithmetic constraints, Serre obtained a refinement on Weil's bound. In this article, we combine these two approaches and propose a strengthening of Ihara's bound, based on an argument similar to Serre's refinement. We show that this generically improves upon Ihara's bound, even in the range where it was the best bound so far. Finally we discuss possible extensions to higher order Weil-Oesterl\'e bounds.</description>

      <title>The non-unit conjecture for Misiurewicz parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Misiurewicz parameter is a complex number $c$ for which the orbit of the critical point $z=0$ under $z^2+c$ is strictly preperiodic. Such parameters play the same role in dynamical moduli spaces as singular moduli (corresponding to CM elliptic curves) play on modular curves. Building on our earlier work, we investigate whether the difference of two Misiurewicz parameters can be an algebraic unit. (The corresponding question for singular moduli was recently answered in the negative by Li.) We answer this dynamical question in many new cases under a widely believed irreducibility assumption.</description>

      <title>Green functions for positive-depth Deligne--Lusztig induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under a largeness assumption on the size of the residue field, we give an explicit description of the positive-depth Deligne--Lusztig induction of unramified elliptic pairs $(T,\theta)$. When $\theta$ is regular, we show that positive-depth Deligne--Lusztig induction gives a geometric realization of Kaletha's Howe-unramified regular $L$-packets. This is obtained as an immediate corollary of a very simple "litmus test" characterization theorem which we foresee will have interesting future applications to small-$p$ constructions. We next define and analyze Green functions of two different origins: Yu's construction (algebra) and positive-depth Deligne--Lusztig induction (geometry). Using this, we deduce a comparison result for arbitrary $\theta$ from the regular setting. As a further application of our comparison isomorphism, we prove the positive-depth Springer hypothesis in the $0$-toral setting and use it to give a geometric explanation for the appearance of orbital integrals in supercuspidal character formulae.</description>

      <title>Hecke Actions on Loops and Periods of Iterated Shimura Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00143v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the classical Hecke correspondences T_N, N&gt;0, act on the free abelian groups generated by the conjugacy classes of the modular group SL_2(Z) and the conjugacy classes of its profinite completion. We show that this action induces a dual action on the ring of class functions of a certain relative unipotent completion of the modular group. This ring contains all iterated integrals of modular forms that are constant on conjugacy classes. It possesses a natural mixed Hodge structure and, after tensoring with Q_ell$, a natural action of the absolute Galois group. Each Hecke operator preserves this mixed Hodge structure and commutes with the action of the absolute Galois group. Unlike in the classical case, the algebra generated by these Hecke operators is not commutative. The appendix by Pham Tiep is not included. It can be found at arXiv:2303.02807.</description>

      <title>2-Elongated Plane Partitions and Powers of 7: The Localization Method Applied to a Genus 1 Congruence Family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15594v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last century, a large variety of infinite congruence families have been discovered and studied, exhibiting a great variety with respect to their difficulty. Major complicating factors arise from the topology of the associated modular curve: classical techniques are sufficient when the associated curve has cusp count 2 and genus 0. Recent work has led to new techniques that have proven useful when the associated curve has cusp count greater than 2 and genus 0. We show here that these techniques may be adapted in the case of positive genus. In particular, we examine a congruence family over the 2-elongated plane partition diamond counting function $d_2(n)$ by powers of 7, for which the associated modular curve has cusp count 4 and genus 1. We compare our method with other techniques for proving genus 1 congruence families, and conjecture a second congruence family by powers of 7, which may be amenable to similar techniques.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Greenberg's conjecture for Galois representations associated to elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E_{/\mathbb{Q}}$ be an elliptic curve and $p$ be an odd prime number at which $E$ has good ordinary reduction. Let $Sel_{p^\infty}(\mathbb{Q}_\infty, E)$ denote the $p$-primary Selmer group of $E$ considered over the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. The (algebraic) \emph{$\mu$-invariant} of $Sel_{p^\infty}(\mathbb{Q}_\infty, E)$ is denoted $\mu_p(E)$. Denote by $\bar{\rho}_{E, p}:Gal(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})\rightarrow GL_2(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})$ the Galois representation on the $p$-torsion subgroup of $E(\bar{\mathbb{Q}})$. Greenberg conjectured that if $\bar{\rho}_{E, p}$ is reducible, then there is a rational isogeny $E\rightarrow E'$ whose degree is a power of $p$, and such that $\mu_p(E')=0$. In this article, we study this conjecture by showing that it is satisfied provided some purely Galois theoretic conditions hold that are expressed in terms of the representation $\bar{\rho}_{E,p}$. In establishing our results, we leverage a theorem of Coates and Sujatha on the algebraic structure of the fine Selmer group. Furthermore, in the case when $\bar{\rho}_{E, p}$ is irreducible, we show that our hypotheses imply that $\mu_p(E)=0$ provided the classical Iwasawa $\mu$-invariant vanishes for the splitting field $\mathbb{Q}(E[p]):=\bar{\mathbb{Q}}^{ker\bar{\rho}_{E,p}}$.</description>

      <title>Counting Rational Points In Non-Isotropic Neighborhoods of Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we initiate the study of the number of rational points with bounded denominators, contained in a non-isotropic $\delta_1\times\ldots\times \delta_R$ neighborhood of a compact submanifold $\mathcal{M}$ of codimension $R$ in $\mathbb{R}^{M}$. We establish an upper bound for this counting function which holds when $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies a strong curvature condition, first introduced by Schindler-Yamagishi in \cite{schindler2022density}. Further, even in the isotropic case when $\delta_1=\ldots=\delta_R=\delta$, we obtain an asymptotic formula which holds beyond the range of distance to $\mathcal{M}$ established in \cite{schindler2022density}. Our result is also a generalization of the work of J.J. Huang \cite{huangduke} for hypersurfaces.
  As an application, we establish for the first time an upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the set of weighted simultaneously well approximable points on a manifold $\mathcal{M}$ satisfying the strong curvature condition, which agrees with the lower bound obtained by Allen-Wang in \cite{allen2022note}. Moreover, for $R&gt;1$, we obtain a new upper bound for the number of rational points \textit{on} $\mathcal{M}$, which goes beyond the bound in an analogue of Serre's dimension growth conjecture for submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^M$ .</description>

      <title>Dirichlet improvability in $L_p$-norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a norm $F$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$, we consider the set of $F$-Dirichlet improvable numbers $\mathbf{DI}_F$. In the most important case of $F$ being an $L_p$-norm with $p=\infty$, which is a supremum norm, it is well-known that $\mathbf{DI}_F = \mathbf{BA}\cup \mathbb{Q}$, where $\mathbf{BA}$ is a set of badly approximable numbers. It is also known that $\mathbf{BA}$ and each $\mathbf{DI}_F$ are of measure zero and of full Hausdorff dimension.
  Using classification of critical lattices for unit balls in $L_p$, we provide a complete and effective characterization of $\mathbf{DI}_p:=\mathbf{DI}_{F^{[p]}}$ in terms of the occurrence of patterns in regular continued fraction expansions, where $F^{[p]}$ is an $L_p$-norm with $p\in[1,\infty)$. This yields several corollaries. In particular, we resolve two open questions by Kleinbock and Rao by showing that the set $\mathbf{DI}_{p}\setminus \mathbf{BA}$ is of full Hausdorff dimension, as well as proving some results about the size of the difference $\mathbf{DI}_{p_1}\setminus \mathbf{DI}_{p_2}$. To be precise, we show that the set difference of Dirichlet improvable numbers in Euclidean norm ($p=2$) minus Dirichlet improvable numbers in taxicab norm ($p=1$) and vice versa, that is $\mathbf{DI}_{2}\setminus \mathbf{DI}_{1}$ and $\mathbf{DI}_{1}\setminus \mathbf{DI}_{2}$, are of full Hausdorff dimension.
  We also find all values of $p$, for which the set $\mathbf{DI}_p^c\cap\mathbf{BA}$ has full Hausdorff dimension.
  Finally, our characterization result implies that the number $e$ satisfies $e\in \mathbf{DI}_p$ if and only if $p\in(1,2)\cup(p_0,\infty)$ for some special constant $p_0\approx2.57$.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number and let $d$ be a positive integer. In this paper, we generalize Iwasawa theory for graphs initiated by Gonet and Valli\`{e}res to weighted graphs. In particular, we prove an analogue of Iwasawa's class number formula and that of Kida's formula for compatible systems of $(\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z})^d$-covers of weighted graphs. We also provide numerical examples of characteristic elements and Iwasawa invariants. At the end of this paper, we give an application of the ideas of Iwasawa theory to the theory of discrete-time quantum walks in graphs.</description>

      <title>On the Sylvester program and Cayley algorithm for vector partition reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A vector partition problem asks for a number of nonnegative integer solutions to a system of several linear Diophantine equations with integer nonnegative coefficients. J.J. Sylvester put forward an idea of reduction of vector partition to a sum of scalar partitions. In the simplest case of two equations with positive coefficients A. Cayley performed a reduction of the corresponding double partition to a sum of scalar partitions using an algorithm subject to a set of conditions on the coefficients. We suggested a modification of the original Cayley algorithm for the cases when these conditions are not satisfied. This result is extended to arbitrary number of the Diophantine equations to accomplish the Sylvester program of the vector partition reduction to a combination of scalar partitions.</description>

Abstract: Let $R(N)$ be the number of representations of $N$ as a sum of a prime and a square-full number weighted with logarithmic function. In $2024$, the author and Y. Suzuki obtained an asymptotic formula for the sum of $R(N)$ over positive integers $N$ in a short interval ($X$, $X+H$] for $X^{\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon} \le H &lt; X^{1-\varepsilon}$. In this article, we improve the range of $H$, that is, we prove the same asymptotic formula for $X^{\frac{32-4\sqrt{15}}{49}+\varepsilon} \le H \le X^{1- \varepsilon}$.</description>
