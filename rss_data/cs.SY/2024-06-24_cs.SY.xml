      <title>Physically Analyzable AI-Based Nonlinear Platoon Dynamics Modeling During Traffic Oscillation: A Koopman Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the complexity and nonlinearity inherent in traffic dynamics within vehicular platoons, there exists a critical need for a modeling methodology with high accuracy while concurrently achieving physical analyzability. Currently, there are two predominant approaches: the physics model-based approach and the Artificial Intelligence (AI)--based approach. Knowing the facts that the physical-based model usually lacks sufficient modeling accuracy and potential function mismatches and the pure-AI-based method lacks analyzability, this paper innovatively proposes an AI-based Koopman approach to model the unknown nonlinear platoon dynamics harnessing the power of AI and simultaneously maintain physical analyzability, with a particular focus on periods of traffic oscillation. Specifically, this research first employs a deep learning framework to generate the embedding function that lifts the original space into the embedding space. Given the embedding space descriptiveness, the platoon dynamics can be expressed as a linear dynamical system founded by the Koopman theory. Based on that, the routine of linear dynamical system analysis can be conducted on the learned traffic linear dynamics in the embedding space. By that, the physical interpretability and analyzability of model-based methods with the heightened precision inherent in data-driven approaches can be synergized. Comparative experiments have been conducted with existing modeling approaches, which suggests our method's superiority in accuracy. Additionally, a phase plane analysis is performed, further evidencing our approach's effectiveness in replicating the complex dynamic patterns. Moreover, the proposed methodology is proven to feature the capability of analyzing the stability, attesting to the physical analyzability.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the practical employment of G-Programming tools to demonstrate, design, and implement traditional control algorithms upon magnetic levitation system. The complexity of controlling this type of fast dynamic and sensitive system is vital for highlighting the capabilities of LabVIEW G-programming in control education. PID and Lead-Lag controllers are designed and implemented within the LabVIEW environment, with the ability to tune and optimize the controllers utilizing the Virtual Instruments (VIs) of the control design and simulation toolkit. The paper enables the reader to understand the modelling, testing the control action, and dynamic simulation of the system. Then, deploying the control law in real time. It can be concluded that the G programming shows a suitable and easy tool for facilitating hands-on, experiential learning and validation in control systems engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the set of terminal state covariances that are reachable over a finite time horizon from a given initial state covariance for a linear stochastic system with additive noise. For discrete-time systems, a complete characterization of the set of reachable state covariances is given. For continuous-time systems, we present an upper bound on the set of reachable state covariances. Moreover, for both linear discrete-time and continuous-time systems, necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for the controllability of the state covariance over a finite horizon.</description>

      <title>Optimal estimation in spatially distributed systems: how far to share measurements from?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the centralized optimal estimation problem in spatially distributed systems. We use the setting of spatially invariant systems as an idealization for which concrete and detailed results are given. Such estimators are known to have a degree of spatial localization in the sense that the estimator gains decay in space, with the spatial decay rates serving as a proxy for how far measurements need to be shared in an optimal distributed estimator. In particular, we examine the dependence of spatial decay rates on problem specifications such as system dynamics, measurement and process noise variances, as well as their spatial autocorrelations. We propose non-dimensional parameters that characterize the decay rates as a function of problem specifications. In particular, we find an interesting matching condition between the characteristic lengthscale of the dynamics and the measurement noise correlation lengthscale for which the optimal centralized estimator is completely decentralized. A new technique - termed the branch point locus - is introduced to quantify spatial decay rates in terms of analyticity regions in the complex spatial frequency plane. Our results are illustrated through two case studies of systems with dynamics modeled by diffusion and the Swift-Hohenberg equation, respectively.</description>

      <title>Resilience of the Electric Grid through Trustable IoT-Coordinated Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electricity grid has evolved from a physical system to a cyber-physical system with digital devices that perform measurement, control, communication, computation, and actuation. The increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) that include renewable generation, flexible loads, and storage provides extraordinary opportunities for improvements in efficiency and sustainability. However, they can introduce new vulnerabilities in the form of cyberattacks, which can cause significant challenges in ensuring grid resilience. %, i.e. the ability to rapidly restore grid services in the face of severe disruptions. We propose a framework in this paper for achieving grid resilience through suitably coordinated assets including a network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A local electricity market is proposed to identify trustable assets and carry out this coordination. Situational Awareness (SA) of locally available DERs with the ability to inject power or reduce consumption is enabled by the market, together with a monitoring procedure for their trustability and commitment. With this SA, we show that a variety of cyberattacks can be mitigated using local trustable resources without stressing the bulk grid. The demonstrations are carried out using a variety of platforms with a high-fidelity co-simulation platform, real-time hardware-in-the-loop validation, and a utility-friendly simulator.</description>

      <title>Generalized Vector Locus Transformation for Unbalanced Three-Phase Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinate transformations significantly simplify power systems computations. Most notably, the classical Clarke and dq0 transformations are widely used in three-phase systems, as together they transform balanced abc quantities into constant-valued signals. However, during unbalanced operation, the utility of these transformations diminishes, since a null 0 coordinate cannot be ensured and oscillating signals emerge. While recently proposed transformations ensure a null 0 coordinate, they still do not lead to constant-valued signals in the dq0 domain. In this letter, we propose a generalized vector locus transformation that ensures both a null 0 coordinate and constant-valued signals. Moreover, we show that, in the balanced case, the classical amplitude-invariant Clarke transformation is an instance of the proposed transformation.</description>

      <title>Damping Wind Farm Resonances with Current Based Model Predictive Pulse Pattern Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-established that a proportional current control gain emulates a resistor in the converter output impedance. Even though this resistance can provide additional damping to grid resonances, its effect for traditional linear current controllers is known to be rather limited. Moreover, for medium-voltage systems, high switching frequencies are not an option due to the high switching losses. To meet the harmonic standards, it is expedient to use optimized pulse patterns. This further exacerbates the problems with the resistance of classical controllers, since an additional filtering would be required so that the current controller acts only on the fundamental component (and not on the ripple component). Such a design limits the damping effect not only in its amplitude but also in the frequency range where it is active. This paper shows that a high-bandwidth current-based model predictive pulse pattern controller can alleviate these limitations. The pulse pattern control approach can achieve a high gain even at low switching frequencies, while controlling directly the instantaneous currents (i.e., the fundamental component and the ripple together). With a fast implementation cycle, the frequency range where this damping effect is active can be further extended. Numerical studies showcase these benefits for a multi-phase medium-voltage wind power conversion system.</description>

      <title>Robust Control Performance for Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.13691v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust performance of control schemes for open quantum systems is investigated under classical uncertainties in the generators of the dynamics and nonclassical uncertainties due to decoherence and initial state preparation errors. A formalism is developed to measure performance based on the transmission of a dynamic perturbation or initial state preparation error to the quantum state error. This makes it possible to apply tools from classical robust control such as structured singular value analysis. A difficulty arising from the singularity of the closed-loop Bloch equations for the quantum state is overcome by introducing the #-inversion lemma, a specialized version of the matrix inversion lemma. Under some conditions, this guarantees continuity of the structured singular value at s = 0. Additional difficulties occur when symmetry gives rise to multiple open-loop poles, which under symmetry-breaking unfold into single eigenvalues. The concepts are applied to systems subject to pure decoherence and a general dissipative system example of two qubits in a leaky cavity under laser driving fields and spontaneous emission. A nonclassical performance index, steady-state entanglement quantified by the concurrence, a nonlinear function of the system state, is introduced. Simulations confirm a conflict between entanglement, its log-sensitivity and stability margin under decoherence.</description>

      <title>Time Domain Sensitivity of the Tracking Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15783v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A strictly time-domain formulation of the log-sensitivity of the error signal to structured plant uncertainty is presented and analyzed through simple but representative classical and quantum systems. Results demonstrate that across a wide range of physical systems, maximization of performance (minimization of the error signal) asymptotically or at a specific time comes at the cost of increased log-sensitivity, implying a time-domain constraint analogous to the frequency-domain identity $\mathbf{S(s) + T(s) = I}$. While of limited value in classical problems based on asymptotic stabilization or tracking, such a time-domain formulation is valuable in assessing the reduced robustness cost concomitant with high-fidelity quantum control schemes predicated on time-based performance measures.</description>

      <title>Age of Information Versions: a Semantic View of Markov Source Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of real-time remote monitoring of a two-state Markov process, where a sensor observes the state of the source and makes a decision on whether to transmit the status updates over an unreliable channel or not. We introduce a modified randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy where the decision to perform sampling occurs probabilistically depending on the current state of the source and whether the system was in a sync state during the previous time slot or not. We then propose two new performance metrics, coined the Version Innovation Age (VIA) and the Age of Incorrect Version (AoIV) and analyze their performance under the modified randomized stationary and other state-of-the-art sampling and transmission policies. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for the distribution and the average of VIA, AoIV, and Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) under these policies. Furthermore, we formulate and solve three constrained optimization problems. The first optimization problem aims to minimize the average VIA subject to constraints on the time-averaged sampling cost and time-averaged reconstruction error. In the second and third problems, the objective is to minimize the average AoIV and AoII, respectively, while considering a constraint on the time-averaged sampling cost. Finally, we compare the performance of various sampling and transmission policies and identify the conditions under which each policy outperforms the others in optimizing the proposed metrics.</description>

      <title>Singular knee identification to support emergence recognition in physical swarm and cellular automata trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After decades of attention, emergence continues to lack a centralized mathematical definition that leads to a rigorous emergence test applicable to physical flocks and swarms, particularly those containing both deterministic elements (eg, interactions) and stochastic perturbations like measurement noise. This study develops a heuristic test based on singular value curve analysis of data matrices containing deterministic and Gaussian noise signals. The minimum detection criteria are identified, and statistical and matrix space analysis developed to determine upper and lower bounds. This study applies the analysis to representative examples by using recorded trajectories of mixed deterministic and stochastic trajectories for multi-agent, cellular automata, and biological video. Examples include Cucker Smale and Vicsek flocking, Gaussian noise and its integration, recorded observations of bird flocking, and 1D cellular automata. Ensemble simulations including measurement noise are performed to compute statistical variation and discussed relative to random matrix theory noise bounds. The results indicate singular knee analysis of recorded trajectories can detect gradated levels on a continuum of structure and noise. Across the eight singular value decay metrics considered, the angle subtended at the singular value knee emerges with the most potential for supporting cross-embodiment emergence detection, the size of noise bounds is used as an indication of required sample size, and the presence of a large fraction of singular values inside noise bounds as an indication of noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Validating safety-critical autonomous systems in high-dimensional domains such as robotics presents a significant challenge. Existing black-box approaches based on Markov chain Monte Carlo may require an enormous number of samples, while methods based on importance sampling often rely on simple parametric families that may struggle to represent the distribution over failures. We propose to sample the distribution over failures using a conditional denoising diffusion model, which has shown success in complex high-dimensional problems such as robotic task planning. We iteratively train a diffusion model to produce state trajectories closer to failure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on high-dimensional robotic validation tasks, improving sample efficiency and mode coverage compared to existing black-box techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of an upper limb end-effector based rehabilitation device for stroke patients, offering assistance or resistance along any 2-dimensional trajectory during physical therapy. It employs a non-backdrivable ball-screw-driven mechanism for enhanced control accuracy. The control system features three novel algorithms: First, the Implicit Euler velocity control algorithm (IEVC) highlighted for its state-of-the-art accuracy, stability, efficiency and generalizability in motion restriction control. Second, an Admittance Virtual Dynamics simulation algorithm that achieves a smooth and natural human interaction with the non-backdrivable end-effector. Third, a generalized impedance force calculation algorithm allowing efficient impedance control on any trajectory or area boundary. Experimental validation demonstrated the system's effectiveness in accurate end-effector position control across various trajectories and configurations. The proposed upper limb end-effector-based rehabilitation device, with its high performance and adaptability, holds significant promise for extensive clinical application, potentially improving rehabilitation outcomes for stroke patients.</description>

      <title>Capture Point Control in Thruster-Assisted Bipedal Locomotion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite major advancements in control design that are robust to unplanned disturbances, bipedal robots are still susceptible to falling over and struggle to negotiate rough terrains. By utilizing thrusters in our bipedal robot, we can perform additional posture manipulation and expand the modes of locomotion to enhance the robot's stability and ability to negotiate rough and difficult-to-navigate terrains. In this paper, we present our efforts in designing a controller based on capture point control for our thruster-assisted walking model named Harpy and explore its control design possibilities. While capture point control based on centroidal models for bipedal systems has been extensively studied, the incorporation of external forces that can influence the dynamics of linear inverted pendulum models, often used in capture point-based works, has not been explored before. The inclusion of these external forces can lead to interesting interpretations of locomotion, such as virtual buoyancy studied in aquatic-legged locomotion. This paper outlines the dynamical model of our robot, the capture point method we use to assist the upper body stabilization, and the simulation work done to show the controller's feasibility.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control of the Neural Manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural manifolds are an attractive theoretical framework for characterizing the complex behaviors of neural populations. However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control this latent activity would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. Employing techniques from the field of optimal control, we simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. With a data-driven latent dynamics model, we apply model predictive control (MPC) to provide anticipatory, optimal control over the trajectory of the circuit in a latent space. We are able to control the latent dynamics of the SNN to follow several reference trajectories despite observing only a subset of neurons and with a substantial amount of unknown noise injected into the network. These results provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and other variables of interest such as organismal behavior and BCI performance.</description>

      <title>Converse Theorems for Certificates of Safety and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14823</link>

Abstract: Motivated by the key role of control barrier functions (CBFs) in assessing safety and enabling the synthesis of safe controllers in nonlinear control systems, this paper presents a suite of converse results on CBFs. Given any safe set, we first identify a set of general sufficient conditions which guarantee the existence of a CBF. Our technical analysis also enables us to define an extended notion of CBF which is always guaranteed to exist if the set is safe. We next turn our attention to the problem of joint safety and stability, and give conditions under which the notions of control Lyapunov-barrier function (CLBF) and compatible control Lyapunov function (CLF) and CBF pair are guaranteed to exist. Finally, we identify conditions under which a CLBF and a compatible CLF-CBF pair can be constructed from a non-compatible CLF-CBF pair. Throughout the paper, we intersperse different examples and counterexamples to motivate our results and position them within the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Learning Autonomous Race Driving with Action Mapping Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous race driving poses a complex control challenge as vehicles must be operated at the edge of their handling limits to reduce lap times while respecting physical and safety constraints. This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach, incorporating the action mapping (AM) mechanism to manage state-dependent input constraints arising from limited tire-road friction. A numerical approximation method is proposed to implement AM, addressing the complex dynamics associated with the friction constraints. The AM mechanism also allows the learned driving policy to be generalized to different friction conditions. Experimental results in our developed race simulator demonstrate that the proposed AM-RL approach achieves superior lap times and better success rates compared to the conventional RL-based approaches. The generalization capability of driving policy with AM is also validated in the experiments.</description>

      <title>A Biomechatronic Approach to Evaluating the Security of Wearable Devices in the Internet of Medical Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by reducing human error and improving patient health. For instance, wearable smart infusion pumps can accurately administer medication and integrate with electronic health records. These pumps can alert healthcare professionals or remote servers when an operation fails, preventing distressing incidents. However, as the number of connected medical devices increases, so does the risk of cyber threats. Wearable medication devices based on IoT attached to patients' bodies are particularly vulnerable to significant cyber threats. Since they are connected to the internet, these devices can be exposed to potential harm, which can disrupt or degrade device performance and harm patients. Therefore, it is crucial to establish secure data authentication for internet-connected medical devices to ensure patient safety and well-being. It is also important to note that the wearability option of such devices might downgrade the computational resources, making them more susceptible to security risks. We propose implementing a security approach for a wearable infusion pump to mitigate cyber threats. We evaluated the proposed architecture with 20, 50, and 100 users for 10 minutes and repeated the evaluation 10 times with two infusion settings, each repeated five times. The desired volumes and rates for the two settings were 2 ml and 4 ml/hr and 5 ml and 5 ml/hr, respectively. The maximum error in infusion rate was measured to be 2.5%. We discuss the practical challenges of implementing such a security-enabled device and suggest initial solutions.</description>

      <title>Passivity theorems for input-to-state stability of forced Lur'e inclusions and equations, and consequent entrainment-type properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A suite of input-to-state stability results are presented for a class of forced differential inclusions, so-called Lur'e inclusions. As a consequence, semi-global incremental input-to-state stability results for systems of forced Lur'e differential equations are derived. The results are in the spirit of the passivity theorem from control theory as both the linear and nonlinear components of the Lur'e inclusion (or equation) are assumed to satisfy passivity-type conditions. These results provide a basis for the analysis of forced Lur'e differential equations subject to (almost) periodic forcing terms and, roughly speaking, ensure the existence and attractivity of (almost) periodic state- and output-responses, comprising another focus of the present work. One ultimate aim of the study is to provide a robust and rigorous theoretical foundation for a well-defined and tractable ``frequency response'' of forced Lur'e systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Capabilities and Limitations of Large Language Models in the Electric Energy Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09125v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as chatbots have drawn remarkable attention thanks to their versatile capability in natural language processing as well as in a wide range of tasks. While there has been great enthusiasm towards adopting such foundational model-based artificial intelligence tools in all sectors possible, the capabilities and limitations of such LLMs in improving the operation of the electric energy sector need to be explored, and this article identifies fruitful directions in this regard. Key future research directions include data collection systems for fine-tuning LLMs, embedding power system-specific tools in the LLMs, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG)-based knowledge pool to improve the quality of LLM responses and LLMs in safety-critical use cases.</description>

      <title>Explainable Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Cyber-Physical Systems via Causal Discovery from Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online unsupervised detection of anomalies is crucial to guarantee the correct operation of cyber-physical systems and the safety of humans interacting with them. State-of-the-art approaches based on deep learning via neural networks achieve outstanding performance at anomaly recognition, evaluating the discrepancy between a normal model of the system (with no anomalies) and the real-time stream of sensor time series. However, large training data and time are typically required, and explainability is still a challenge to identify the root of the anomaly and implement predictive maintainance. In this paper, we use causal discovery to learn a normal causal graph of the system, and we evaluate the persistency of causal links during real-time acquisition of sensor data to promptly detect anomalies. On two benchmark anomaly detection datasets, we show that our method has higher training efficiency, outperforms the accuracy of state-of-the-art neural architectures and correctly identifies the sources of $&gt;10$ different anomalies.

      <title>Thin Film Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for Harmonic Beam Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter explores an implementation of a novel thin film 1-by-4 reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) designed for future communication and sensing scenarios. Utilizing cost-effective inkjet printing methods and additive manufacturing, our approach significantly simplifies the RIS construction process and reduces production costs. The RIS, fabricated on a flexible and lightweight polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate, integrates antennas, switching circuitry, and a microcontroller unit (MCU), without a ground shield. This setup enables individual and simultaneous control of each RIS element, manipulating the captured carrier signal by reflecting and refracting its dominant harmonics. Beams of the harmonics can be steered to multiple desired directions at both front and back sides of the surface. Measurement results of the beam steering show that the RIS has the potential to enable RIS-aided communication and sensing applications.</description>
