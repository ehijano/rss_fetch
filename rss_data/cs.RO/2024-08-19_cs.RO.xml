      <title>Physics-Guided Reinforcement Learning System for Realistic Vehicle Active Suspension Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The suspension system is a crucial part of the automotive chassis, improving vehicle ride comfort and isolating passengers from rough road excitation. Unlike passive suspension, which has constant spring and damping coefficients, active suspension incorporates electronic actuators into the system to dynamically control stiffness and damping variables. However, effectively controlling the suspension system poses a challenging task that necessitates real-time adaptability to various road conditions. This paper presents the Physics-Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for adjusting an active suspension system's variable kinematics and compliance properties for a quarter-car model in real time. Specifically, the outputs of the model are defined as actuator stiffness and damping control, which are bound within physically realistic ranges to maintain the system's physical compliance. The proposed model was trained on stochastic road profiles according to ISO 8608 standards to optimize the actuator's control policy. According to qualitative results on simulations, the vehicle body reacts smoothly to various novel real-world road conditions, having a much lower degree of oscillation. These observations mean a higher level of passenger comfort and better vehicle stability. Quantitatively, DRL outperforms passive systems in reducing the average vehicle body velocity and acceleration by 43.58% and 17.22%, respectively, minimizing the vertical movement impacts on the passengers.

      <title>Study of MRI-compatible Notched Plastic Ultrasonic Stator with FEM Simulation and Holography Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intra-operative image guidance using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can significantly enhance the precision of surgical procedures, such as deep brain tumor ablation. However, the powerful magnetic fields and limited space within an MRI scanner require the use of robotic devices to aid surgeons. Piezoelectric motors are commonly utilized to drive these robots, with piezoelectric ultrasonic motors being particularly notable. These motors consist of a piezoelectric ring stator that is bonded to a rotor through frictional coupling. When the stator is excited at specific frequencies, it generates distinctive mode shapes with surface waves that exhibit both in-plane and out-of-plane displacement, leading to the rotation of the rotor. In this study, we continue our previous work and refine the motor design and performance, we combine finite element modeling (FEM) with stroboscopic and time-averaged digital holography to validate a further plastic-based ultrasonic motor with better rotary performance.</description>

      <title>Detection and tracking of MAVs using a LiDAR with rosette scanning pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usage of commercial Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) has increased drastically during the last decade. While the added value of MAVs to society is apparent, their growing use is also coming with increasing risks like violating public airspace at airports or committing privacy violations. To mitigate these issues it is becoming critical to develop solutions that incorporate the detection and tracking of MAVs with autonomous systems. This work presents a method for the detection and tracking of MAVs using a novel, low-cost rosette scanning LiDAR on a pan-tilt turret. Once the static background is captured, a particle filter is utilized to detect a possible target and track its position with a physical, programmable pan-tilt system. The tracking makes it possible to keep the MAV in the center, maximizing the density of 3D points measured on the target by the LiDAR sensor. The developed algorithm was evaluated within the indoor MIcro aerial vehicle and MOtion capture (MIMO) arena and has state-of-the-art tracking accuracy, stability, and fast re-detection time in case of tracking loss. Based on the outdoor tests, it was possible to significantly increase the detection distance and number of returned points compared to other similar methods using LiDAR.</description>

      <title>S-RAF: A Simulation-Based Robustness Assessment Framework for Responsible Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) technology advances, ensuring the robustness and safety of AI-driven systems has become paramount. However, varying perceptions of robustness among AI developers create misaligned evaluation metrics, complicating the assessment and certification of safety-critical and complex AI systems such as autonomous driving (AD) agents. To address this challenge, we introduce Simulation-Based Robustness Assessment Framework (S-RAF) for autonomous driving. S-RAF leverages the CARLA Driving simulator to rigorously assess AD agents across diverse conditions, including faulty sensors, environmental changes, and complex traffic situations. By quantifying robustness and its relationship with other safety-critical factors, such as carbon emissions, S-RAF aids developers and stakeholders in building safe and responsible driving agents, and streamlining safety certification processes. Furthermore, S-RAF offers significant advantages, such as reduced testing costs, and the ability to explore edge cases that may be unsafe to test in the real world. The code for this framework is available here: https://github.com/cognitive-robots/rai-leaderboard</description>

      <title>Case Study: Runtime Safety Verification of Neural Network Controlled System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly used in safety-critical applications such as robotics and autonomous vehicles. However, the deployment of neural-network-controlled systems (NNCSs) raises significant safety concerns. Many recent advances overlook critical aspects of verifying control and ensuring safety in real-time scenarios. This paper presents a case study on using POLAR-Express, a state-of-the-art NNCS reachability analysis tool, for runtime safety verification in a Turtlebot navigation system using LiDAR. The Turtlebot, equipped with a neural network controller for steering, operates in a complex environment with obstacles. We developed a safe online controller switching strategy that switches between the original NNCS controller and an obstacle avoidance controller based on the verification results. Our experiments, conducted in a ROS2 Flatland simulation environment, explore the capabilities and limitations of using POLAR-Express for runtime verification and demonstrate the effectiveness of our switching strategy.</description>

      <title>User-centered evaluation of the Wearable Walker lower limb exoskeleton, preliminary assessment based on the Experience protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using lower-limbs exoskeletons provides potential advantages in terms of productivity and safety associated with reduced stress. However, complex issues in human-robot interaction are still open, such as the physiological effects of exoskeletons and the impact on the user's subjective experience. In this work, an innovative exoskeleton, the Wearable Walker, is assessed using the EXPERIENCE benchmarking protocol from the EUROBENCH project. The Wearable Walker is a lower-limb exoskeleton that enhances human abilities, such as carrying loads. The device uses a unique control approach called Blend Control that provides smooth assistance torques. It operates two models simultaneously, one in the case in which the left foot is grounded and another for the grounded right foot. These models generate assistive torques combined to provide continuous and smooth overall assistance, preventing any abrupt changes in torque due to model switching. The EXPERIENCE protocol consists of walking on flat ground while gathering physiological signals such as heart rate, its variability, respiration rate, and galvanic skin response and completing a questionnaire. The test was performed with five healthy subjects. The scope of the present study is twofold: to evaluate the specific exoskeleton and its current control system to gain insight into possible improvements and to present a case study for a formal and replicable benchmarking of wearable robots.</description>

      <title>System Identification For Constrained Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the parameters of robotic systems, such as motor inertia or joint friction, is critical to satisfactory controller synthesis, model analysis, and observer design. Conventional identification techniques are designed primarily for unconstrained systems, such as robotic manipulators. In contrast, the growing importance of legged robots that feature closed kinematic chains or other constraints, poses challenges to these traditional methods. This paper introduces a system identification approach for constrained systems that relies on iterative least squares to identify motor inertia and joint friction parameters from data. The proposed approach is validated in simulation and in the real-world on Digit, which is a 20 degree-of-freedom humanoid robot built by Agility Robotics. In these experiments, the parameters identified by the proposed method enable a model-based controller to achieve better tracking performance than when it uses the default parameters provided by the manufacturer. The implementation of the approach is available at https://github.com/roahmlab/ConstrainedSysID.</description>

      <title>Timing Analysis and Priority-driven Enhancements of ROS 2 Multi-threaded Executors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second generation of Robotic Operating System, ROS 2, has gained much attention for its potential to be used for safety-critical robotic applications. The need to provide a solid foundation for timing correctness and scheduling mechanisms is therefore growing rapidly. Although there are some pioneering studies conducted on formally analyzing the response time of processing chains in ROS 2, the focus has been limited to single-threaded executors, and multi-threaded executors, despite their advantages, have not been studied well. To fill this knowledge gap, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive response-time analysis framework for chains running on ROS 2 multi-threaded executors. We first analyze the timing behavior of the default scheduling scheme in ROS 2 multi-threaded executors, and then present priority-driven scheduling enhancements to address the limitations of the default scheme. Our framework can analyze chains with both arbitrary and constrained deadlines and also the effect of mutually-exclusive callback groups. Evaluation is conducted by a case study on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and schedulability experiments using randomly-generated chains. The results demonstrate that our analysis framework can safely upper-bound response times under various conditions and the priority-driven scheduling enhancements not only reduce the response time of critical chains but also improve analytical bounds.</description>

      <title>D5RL: Diverse Datasets for Data-Driven Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning algorithms hold the promise of enabling data-driven RL methods that do not require costly or dangerous real-world exploration and benefit from large pre-collected datasets. This in turn can facilitate real-world applications, as well as a more standardized approach to RL research. Furthermore, offline RL methods can provide effective initializations for online finetuning to overcome challenges with exploration. However, evaluating progress on offline RL algorithms requires effective and challenging benchmarks that capture properties of real-world tasks, provide a range of task difficulties, and cover a range of challenges both in terms of the parameters of the domain (e.g., length of the horizon, sparsity of rewards) and the parameters of the data (e.g., narrow demonstration data or broad exploratory data). While considerable progress in offline RL in recent years has been enabled by simpler benchmark tasks, the most widely used datasets are increasingly saturating in performance and may fail to reflect properties of realistic tasks. We propose a new benchmark for offline RL that focuses on realistic simulations of robotic manipulation and locomotion environments, based on models of real-world robotic systems, and comprising a variety of data sources, including scripted data, play-style data collected by human teleoperators, and other data sources. Our proposed benchmark covers state-based and image-based domains, and supports both offline RL and online fine-tuning evaluation, with some of the tasks specifically designed to require both pre-training and fine-tuning. We hope that our proposed benchmark will facilitate further progress on both offline RL and fine-tuning algorithms.

      <title>Robust Stochastic Shortest-Path Planning via Risk-Sensitive Incremental Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the pervasiveness of Stochastic Shortest-Path (SSP) problems in high-risk industries, such as last-mile autonomous delivery and supply chain management, robust planning algorithms are crucial for ensuring successful task completion while mitigating hazardous outcomes. Mainstream chance-constrained incremental sampling techniques for solving SSP problems tend to be overly conservative and typically do not consider the likelihood of undesirable tail events. We propose an alternative risk-aware approach inspired by the asymptotically-optimal Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT*) planning algorithm, which selects nodes along path segments with minimal Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). Our motivation rests on the step-wise coherence of the CVaR risk measure and the optimal substructure of the SSP problem. Thus, optimizing with respect to the CVaR at each sampling iteration necessarily leads to an optimal path in the limit of the sample size. We validate our approach via numerical path planning experiments in a two-dimensional grid world with obstacles and stochastic path-segment lengths. Our simulation results show that incorporating risk into the tree growth process yields paths with lengths that are significantly less sensitive to variations in the noise parameter, or equivalently, paths that are more robust to environmental uncertainty. Algorithmic analyses reveal similar query time and memory space complexity to the baseline RRT* procedure, with only a marginal increase in processing time. This increase is offset by significantly lower noise sensitivity and reduced planner failure rates.</description>

      <title>A Transparency Paradox? Investigating the Impact of Explanation Specificity and Autonomous Vehicle Perceptual Inaccuracies on Passengers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transparency in automated systems could be afforded through the provision of intelligible explanations. While transparency is desirable, might it lead to catastrophic outcomes (such as anxiety), that could outweigh its benefits? It's quite unclear how the specificity of explanations (level of transparency) influences recipients, especially in autonomous driving (AD). In this work, we examined the effects of transparency mediated through varying levels of explanation specificity in AD. We first extended a data-driven explainer model by adding a rule-based option for explanation generation in AD, and then conducted a within-subject lab study with 39 participants in an immersive driving simulator to study the effect of the resulting explanations. Specifically, our investigation focused on: (1) how different types of explanations (specific vs. abstract) affect passengers' perceived safety, anxiety, and willingness to take control of the vehicle when the vehicle perception system makes erroneous predictions; and (2) the relationship between passengers' behavioural cues and their feelings during the autonomous drives. Our findings showed that passengers felt safer with specific explanations when the vehicle's perception system had minimal errors, while abstract explanations that hid perception errors led to lower feelings of safety. Anxiety levels increased when specific explanations revealed perception system errors (high transparency). We found no significant link between passengers' visual patterns and their anxiety levels. Our study suggests that passengers prefer clear and specific explanations (high transparency) when they originate from autonomous vehicles (AVs) with optimal perceptual accuracy.</description>

      <title>Geometric Tracking Control of Omnidirectional Multirotors for Aggressive Maneuvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An omnidirectional multirotor has the maneuverability of decoupled translational and rotational motions, superseding the traditional multirotors' motion capability. Such maneuverability is achieved due to the ability of the omnidirectional multirotor to frequently alter the thrust amplitude and direction. In doing so, the rotors' settling time, which is induced by inherent rotor dynamics, significantly affects the omnidirectional multirotor's tracking performance, especially in aggressive flights. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel tracking controller that takes the rotor dynamics into account and does not require additional rotor state measurement. We prove that the proposed controller yields almost global exponential stability. The proposed controller is validated in experiments, where we demonstrate significantly improved tracking performance in multiple aggressive maneuvers compared with a baseline geometric PD controller.</description>

      <title>MonoForce: Self-supervised Learning of Physics-informed Model for Predicting Robot-terrain Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09007v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While autonomous navigation of mobile robots on rigid terrain is a well-explored problem, navigating on deformable terrain such as tall grass or bushes remains a challenge. To address it, we introduce an explainable, physics-aware and end-to-end differentiable model which predicts the outcome of robot-terrain interaction from camera images, both on rigid and non-rigid terrain. The proposed MonoForce model consists of a black-box module which predicts robot-terrain interaction forces from onboard cameras, followed by a white-box module, which transforms these forces and a control signals into predicted trajectories, using only the laws of classical mechanics. The differentiable white-box module allows backpropagating the predicted trajectory errors into the black-box module, serving as a self-supervised loss that measures consistency between the predicted forces and ground-truth trajectories of the robot. Experimental evaluation on a public dataset and our data has shown that while the prediction capabilities are comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms on rigid terrain, MonoForce shows superior accuracy on non-rigid terrain such as tall grass or bushes. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we release both the code and datasets.</description>

      <title>Osprey: Multi-Session Autonomous Aerial Mapping with LiDAR-based SLAM and Next Best View Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03484v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aerial mapping systems are important for many surveying applications (e.g., industrial inspection or agricultural monitoring). Aerial platforms that can fly GPS-guided preplanned missions semi-autonomously are already widely available but fully autonomous systems can significantly improve efficiency. Autonomously mapping complex 3D structures requires a system that performs online mapping and mission planning. This paper presents Osprey, an autonomous aerial mapping system with state-of-the-art multi-session LiDAR-based mapping capabilities. It enables a non-expert operator to specify a bounded target area that the aerial platform can then map autonomously over multiple flights. Field experiments with Osprey demonstrate that this system can achieve greater map coverage of large industrial sites than manual surveys with a pilot-flown aerial platform or a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). Three sites, with a total ground coverage of $2528$ m$^2$ and a maximum height of $27$ m, were mapped in separate missions using $112$ minutes of autonomous flight time. True colour maps were created from images captured by Osprey using pointcloud and NeRF reconstruction methods. These maps provide useful data for structural inspection tasks.</description>

Abstract: Planning algorithms decompose complex problems into intermediate steps that can be sequentially executed by robots to complete tasks. Recent works have employed Large Language Models (LLMs) for task planning, using natural language to generate robot policies in both simulation and real-world environments. LLMs like GPT-4 have shown promising results in generalizing to unseen tasks, but their applicability is limited due to hallucinations caused by insufficient grounding in the robot environment. The robustness of LLMs in task planning can be enhanced with environmental state information and feedback. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to task planning that utilizes two separate LLMs for high-level planning and low-level control, improving task-related success rates and goal condition recall. Our algorithm, \textit{BrainBody-LLM}, draws inspiration from the human neural system, emulating its brain-body architecture by dividing planning across two LLMs in a structured, hierarchical manner. BrainBody-LLM implements a closed-loop feedback mechanism, enabling learning from simulator errors to resolve execution errors in complex settings. We demonstrate the successful application of BrainBody-LLM in the VirtualHome simulation environment, achieving a 29\% improvement in task-oriented success rates over competitive baselines with the GPT-4 backend. Additionally, we evaluate our algorithm on seven complex tasks using a realistic physics simulator and the Franka Research 3 robotic arm, comparing it with various state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results show advancements in the reasoning capabilities of recent LLMs, which enable them to learn from raw simulator/controller errors to correct plans, making them highly effective in robotic task planning.</description>

      <title>Touch-GS: Visual-Tactile Supervised 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel method to supervise 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scenes using optical tactile sensors. Optical tactile sensors have become widespread in their use in robotics for manipulation and object representation; however, raw optical tactile sensor data is unsuitable to directly supervise a 3DGS scene. Our representation leverages a Gaussian Process Implicit Surface to implicitly represent the object, combining many touches into a unified representation with uncertainty. We merge this model with a monocular depth estimation network, which is aligned in a two stage process, coarsely aligning with a depth camera and then finely adjusting to match our touch data. For every training image, our method produces a corresponding fused depth and uncertainty map. Utilizing this additional information, we propose a new loss function, variance weighted depth supervised loss, for training the 3DGS scene model. We leverage the DenseTact optical tactile sensor and RealSense RGB-D camera to show that combining touch and vision in this manner leads to quantitatively and qualitatively better results than vision or touch alone in a few-view scene syntheses on opaque as well as on reflective and transparent objects.

      <title>AirPilot: A PPO-based DRL Auto-Tuned Nonlinear PID Drone Controller for Robust Autonomous Flights</title>

Abstract: Navigation precision, speed and stability are crucial for safe UAV flight maneuvers and effective flight mission executions in dynamic environments. Different flight missions may have varying objectives, such as minimizing energy consumption, achieving precise positioning, or maximizing speed. A controller that can adapt to different objectives on the fly is highly valuable. Proportional Integral Derivative controllers are one of the most popular and widely used control algorithms for drones control systems, but their linear control algorithm fails to capture the nonlinear nature of the dynamic wind conditions and complex drone system. Manually tuning the PID gains for various missions can be time-consuming and requires significant expertise. This paper aims to revolutionize drone flight control by presenting the AirPilot, a nonlinear Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) - enhanced PID drone controller using Proximal Policy Optimization. AirPilot controller combines the simplicity and effectiveness of traditional PID control with the adaptability, learning capability, and optimization potential of DRL. This makes it better suited for modern drone applications where the environment is dynamic, and mission-specific performance demands are high. We employed a COEX Clover autonomous drone for training the DRL agent within the Gazebo simulator and subsequently implemented it in a real-world lab setting, which marks a significant milestone as one of the first attempts to apply a DRL-based flight controller on an actual drone. Airpilot is capable of reducing the navigation error by more than 82% and improving overshoot, speed and settling time significantly.</description>

      <title>IPC: Incremental Probabilistic Consensus-based Consistent Set Maximization for SLAM Backends</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In SLAM (Simultaneous localization and mapping) problems, Pose Graph Optimization (PGO) is a technique to refine an initial estimate of a set of poses (positions and orientations) from a set of pairwise relative measurements. The optimization procedure can be negatively affected even by a single outlier measurement, with possible catastrophic and meaningless results. Although recent works on robust optimization aim to mitigate the presence of outlier measurements, robust solutions capable of handling large numbers of outliers are yet to come. This paper presents IPC, acronym for Incremental Probabilistic Consensus, a method that approximates the solution to the combinatorial problem of finding the maximally consistent set of measurements in an incremental fashion. It evaluates the consistency of each loop closure measurement through a consensus-based procedure, possibly applied to a subset of the global problem, where all previously integrated inlier measurements have veto power. We evaluated IPC on standard benchmarks against several state-of-the-art methods. Although it is simple and relatively easy to implement, IPC competes with or outperforms the other tested methods in handling outliers while providing online performances. We release with this paper an open-source implementation of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Reinforcement Learning in Sensor Fusion: A Comparative Analysis of Cubature and Sampling-based Integration Methods for Rover Search Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the computational speed and accuracy of two numerical integration methods, cubature and sampling-based, for integrating an integrand over a 2D polygon. Using a group of rovers searching the Martian surface with a limited sensor footprint as a test bed, the relative error and computational time are compared as the area was subdivided to improve accuracy in the sampling-based approach. The results show that the sampling-based approach exhibits a $14.75\%$ deviation in relative error compared to cubature when it matches the computational performance at $100\%$. Furthermore, achieving a relative error below $1\%$ necessitates a $10000\%$ increase in relative time to calculate due to the $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ complexity of the sampling-based method. It is concluded that for enhancing reinforcement learning capabilities and other high iteration algorithms, the cubature method is preferred over the sampling-based method.</description>

      <title>Agentic Skill Discovery</title>

Abstract: Language-conditioned robotic skills make it possible to apply the high-level reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) to low-level robotic control. A remaining challenge is to acquire a diverse set of fundamental skills. Existing approaches either manually decompose a complex task into atomic robotic actions in a top-down fashion, or bootstrap as many combinations as possible in a bottom-up fashion to cover a wider range of task possibilities. These decompositions or combinations, however, require an initial skill library. For example, a ``grasping'' capability can never emerge from a skill library containing only diverse ``pushing'' skills. Existing skill discovery techniques with reinforcement learning acquire skills by an exhaustive exploration but often yield non-meaningful behaviors. In this study, we introduce a novel framework for skill discovery that is entirely driven by LLMs. The framework begins with an LLM generating task proposals based on the provided scene description and the robot's configurations, aiming to incrementally acquire new skills upon task completion. For each proposed task, a series of reinforcement learning processes are initiated, utilizing reward and success determination functions sampled by the LLM to develop the corresponding policy. The reliability and trustworthiness of learned behaviors are further ensured by an independent vision-language model. We show that starting with zero skill, the skill library emerges and expands to more and more meaningful and reliable skills, enabling the robot to efficiently further propose and complete advanced tasks.

      <title>Three-dimensional Morphological Reconstruction of Millimeter-Scale Soft Continuum Robots based on Dual-Stereo-Vision</title>

Abstract: Continuum robots can be miniaturized to just a few millimeters in diameter. Among these, notched tubular continuum robots (NTCR) show great potential in many delicate applications. Existing works in robotic modeling focus on kinematics and dynamics but still face challenges in reproducing the robot's morphology -- a significant factor that can expand the research landscape of continuum robots, especially for those with asymmetric continuum structures. This paper proposes a dual stereo vision-based method for the three-dimensional morphological reconstruction of millimeter-scale NTCRs. The method employs two oppositely located stationary binocular cameras to capture the point cloud of the NTCR, then utilizes predefined geometry as a reference for the KD tree method to relocate the capture point clouds, resulting in a morphologically correct NTCR despite the low-quality raw point cloud collection. The method has been proved feasible for an NTCR with a 3.5 mm diameter, capturing 14 out of 16 notch features, with the measurements generally centered around the standard of 1.5 mm, demonstrating the capability of revealing morphological details. Our proposed method paves the way for 3D morphological reconstruction of millimeter-scale soft robots for further self-modeling study.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly its combination with deep neural networks referred to as deep RL (DRL), has shown tremendous promise across a wide range of applications, suggesting its potential for enabling the development of sophisticated robotic behaviors. Robotics problems, however, pose fundamental difficulties for the application of RL, stemming from the complexity and cost of interacting with the physical world. This article provides a modern survey of DRL for robotics, with a particular focus on evaluating the real-world successes achieved with DRL in realizing several key robotic competencies. Our analysis aims to identify the key factors underlying those exciting successes, reveal underexplored areas, and provide an overall characterization of the status of DRL in robotics. We highlight several important avenues for future work, emphasizing the need for stable and sample-efficient real-world RL paradigms, holistic approaches for discovering and integrating various competencies to tackle complex long-horizon, open-world tasks, and principled development and evaluation procedures. This survey is designed to offer insights for both RL practitioners and roboticists toward harnessing RL's power to create generally capable real-world robotic systems.</description>

      <title>MMP++: Motion Manifold Primitives with Parametric Curve Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17072v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motion Manifold Primitives (MMP), a manifold-based approach for encoding basic motion skills, can produce diverse trajectories, enabling the system to adapt to unseen constraints. Nonetheless, we argue that current MMP models lack crucial functionalities of movement primitives, such as temporal and via-points modulation, found in traditional approaches. This shortfall primarily stems from MMP's reliance on discrete-time trajectories. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Motion Manifold Primitives++ (MMP++), a new model that integrates the strengths of both MMP and traditional methods by incorporating parametric curve representations into the MMP framework. Furthermore, we identify a significant challenge with MMP++: performance degradation due to geometric distortions in the latent space, meaning that similar motions are not closely positioned. To address this, Isometric Motion Manifold Primitives++ (IMMP++) is proposed to ensure the latent space accurately preserves the manifold's geometry. Our experimental results across various applications, including 2-DoF planar motions, 7-DoF robot arm motions, and SE(3) trajectory planning, show that MMP++ and IMMP++ outperform existing methods in trajectory generation tasks, achieving substantial improvements in some cases. Moreover, they enable the modulation of latent coordinates and via-points, thereby allowing efficient online adaptation to dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Self-organizing Multiagent Target Enclosing under Limited Information and Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to address the target enclosing problem using non-holonomic multiagent systems, where agents self-organize on the enclosing shape around a fixed target. In our approach, agents independently move toward the desired enclosing geometry when apart and activate the collision avoidance mechanism when a collision is imminent, thereby guaranteeing inter-agent safety. Our approach combines global enclosing behavior and local collision avoidance mechanisms by devising a special potential function and sliding manifold. We rigorously show that an agent does not need to ensure safety with every other agent and put forth a concept of the nearest colliding agent (for any arbitrary agent) with whom ensuring safety is sufficient to avoid collisions in the entire swarm. The proposed control eliminates the need for a fixed or pre-established agent arrangement around the target and requires only relative information between an agent and the target. This makes our design particularly appealing for scenarios with limited global information, hence significantly reducing communication requirements. We finally present simulation results to vindicate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by traditional handmade crafts, where a person improvises assemblies based on the available objects, we formally introduce the Craft Assembly Task. It is a robotic assembly task that involves building an accurate representation of a given target object using the available objects, which do not directly correspond to its parts. In this work, we focus on selecting the subset of available objects for the final craft, when the given input is an RGB image of the target in the wild. We use a mask segmentation neural network to identify visible parts, followed by retrieving labelled template meshes. These meshes undergo pose optimization to determine the most suitable template. Then, we propose to simplify the parts of the transformed template mesh to primitive shapes like cuboids or cylinders. Finally, we design a search algorithm to find correspondences in the scene based on local and global proportions. We develop baselines for comparison that consider all possible combinations, and choose the highest scoring combination for common metrics used in foreground maps and mask accuracy. Our approach achieves comparable results to the baselines for two different scenes, and we show qualitative results for an implementation in a real-world scenario.</description>

      <title>Personalizing Federated Instrument Segmentation with Visual Trait Priors in Robotic Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) for surgical instrument segmentation (SIS) is a promising approach. It enables multiple clinical sites to collaboratively train a series of models in privacy, with each model tailored to the individual distribution of each site. Existing PFL methods rarely consider the personalization of multi-headed self-attention, and do not account for appearance diversity and instrument shape similarity, both inherent in surgical scenes. We thus propose PFedSIS, a novel PFL method with visual trait priors for SIS, incorporating global-personalized disentanglement (GPD), appearance-regulation personalized enhancement (APE), and shape-similarity global enhancement (SGE), to boost SIS performance in each site. GPD represents the first attempt at head-wise assignment for multi-headed self-attention personalization. To preserve the unique appearance representation of each site and gradually leverage the inter-site difference, APE introduces appearance regulation and provides customized layer-wise aggregation solutions via hypernetworks for each site's personalized parameters. The mutual shape information of instruments is maintained and shared via SGE, which enhances the cross-style shape consistency on the image level and computes the shape-similarity contribution of each site on the prediction level for updating the global parameters. PFedSIS outperforms state-of-the-art methods with +1.51% Dice, +2.11% IoU, -2.79 ASSD, -15.55 HD95 performance gains. The corresponding code and models will be released at https://github.com/wzjialang/PFedSIS.</description>

      <title>FedRobo: Federated Learning Driven Autonomous Inter Robots Communication For Optimal Chemical Sprays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning enables robots to learn from each other's experiences without relying on centralized data collection. Each robot independently maintains a model of crop conditions and chemical spray effectiveness, which is periodically shared with other robots in the fleet. A communication protocol is designed to optimize chemical spray applications by facilitating the exchange of information about crop conditions, weather, and other critical factors. The federated learning algorithm leverages this shared data to continuously refine the chemical spray strategy, reducing waste and improving crop yields. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the agriculture industry by offering a scalable and efficient solution for crop protection. However, significant challenges remain, including the development of a secure and robust communication protocol, the design of a federated learning algorithm that effectively integrates data from multiple sources, and ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous robots. The proposed cluster-based federated learning approach also effectively reduces the computational load on the global server and minimizes communication overhead among clients.</description>
