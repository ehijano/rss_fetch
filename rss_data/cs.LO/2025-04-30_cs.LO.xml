      <title>Weighted GKAT: Completeness and Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Weighted Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (wGKAT), an uninterpreted weighted programming language equipped with branching, conditionals, and loops. We provide an operational semantics for wGKAT using a variant of weighted automata and introduce a sound and complete axiomatization. We also provide a polynomial time decision procedure for bisimulation equivalence.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of the Emptiness Problem of Deterministic Propositional While Programs with Graph Loop: Hypothesis Elimination Using Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the emptiness (unsatisfiability) problem is undecidable and $\mathrm{\Pi}^{0}_{1}$-complete for deterministic propositional while programs with (graph) loop. To this end, we introduce a hypothesis elimination using loops. Using this, we give reductions from the complement of the periodic domino problem.
  Moreover, as a corollary via hypothesis eliminations, we also show that the equational theory is $\mathrm{\Pi}^{0}_{1}$-complete for the positive calculus of relations with transitive closure and difference. Additionally, we show that the emptiness problem is PSPACE-complete for the existential calculus of relations with transitive closure.</description>

      <title>Separation and Definability in Fragments of Two-Variable First-Order Logic with Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20491v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For fragments L of first-order logic (FO) with counting quantifiers, we consider the definability problem, which asks whether a given L-formula can be equivalently expressed by a formula in some fragment of L without counting, and the more general separation problem asking whether two mutually exclusive L-formulas can be separated in some counting-free fragment of L. We show that separation is undecidable for the two-variable fragment of FO extended with counting quantifiers and for the graded modal logic with inverse, nominals and universal modality. On the other hand, if inverse or nominals are dropped, separation becomes coNExpTime- or 2ExpTime-complete, depending on whether the universal modality is present. In contrast, definability can often be reduced in polynomial time to validity in L. We also consider uniform separation and show that it often behaves similarly to definability.</description>

      <title>Turing machines deciders, part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Busy Beaver Challenge (or bbchallenge) aims at collaboratively solving the following conjecture: "$S(5) = 47{,}176{,}870$" [Rad\'o, 1962], [Marxen and Buntrock, 1990], [Aaronson, 2020]. This conjecture says that if a 5-state Turing machine runs for more than 47,176,870 steps without halting, then it will never halt -- starting from the all-0 tape. Proving this conjecture amounts to deciding whether 181,385,789 Turing machines with 5 states halt or not -- starting from the all-0 tape [bbchallenge, 2025]. To do so, we write $\textit{deciders}$: programs that take as input a Turing machine and output either HALT, NONHALT, or UNKNOWN. Each decider is specialised in recognising a particular type of non-halting behavior.
  After two years of work, the Busy Beaver Challenge achieved its goal in July 2024 by delivering a proof of "$S(5) = 47{,}176{,}870$" formalised in Coq [bbchallenge, 2025]. In this document, we present deciders that were developed before the Coq proof and which were mainly not used in the proof; nonetheless, they are relevant techniques for analysing Turing machines. Part II of this work is the decider section of our paper showing "$S(5) = 47{,}176{,}870$" [bbchallenge, 2025], presenting the deciders that were used in the Coq proof.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference in Quantum Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditioning is a key feature in probabilistic programming to enable modeling the influence of data (also known as observations) to the probability distribution described by such programs. Determining the posterior distribution is also known as Bayesian inference. This paper equips a quantum while-language with conditioning, defines its denotational and operational semantics over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and shows their equivalence. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of weakest (liberal) precondition-transformers and derive inductive characterizations of these transformers. It is shown how w(l)p-transformers can be used to assess the effect of Bayesian inference on (possibly diverging) quantum programs.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Shoenfield Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05777v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article provides the theoretical framework of Probabilistic Shoenfield Machines (PSMs), an extension of the classical Shoenfield Machine that models randomness in the computation process. PSMs are introduced in contexts where deterministic computation is insufficient, such as randomized algorithms. By allowing transitions to multiple possible states with certain probabilities, PSMs can solve problems and make decisions based on probabilistic outcomes, thus expanding the variety of possible computations. We provide an overview of PSMs, detailing their formal definitions, the computation mechanism, and their equivalence with Non-deterministic Shoenfield Machines (NSMs)</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Polynomial-Time Minimizable $\omega$-Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central question in the theory of automata is which classes of automata can be minimized in polynomial time. We close the remaining gaps for deterministic and history-deterministic automata over infinite words by proving that deterministic co-B\"uchi automata with transition-based acceptance are NP-hard to minimize, as are history-deterministic B\"uchi automata with transition-based acceptance.</description>

      <title>Deciding Predicate Logical Theories of Real-Valued Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16505v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of a real-valued function is central to mathematics, computer science, and many other scientific fields. Despite this importance, there are hardly any positive results on decision procedures for predicate logical theories that reason about real-valued functions. This paper defines a first-order predicate language for reasoning about multi-dimensional smooth real-valued functions and their derivatives, and demonstrates that - despite the obvious undecidability barriers - certain positive decidability results for such a language are indeed possible.</description>

      <title>Timeout Asynchronous Session Types: Safe Asynchronous Mixed-Choice For Timed Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed-choice has long been barred from models of asynchronous communication since it compromises the decidability of key properties of communicating finite-state machines. Session types inherit this restriction, which precludes them from fully modelling timeouts -- a core property of web and cloud services. To address this deficiency, we present (binary) Timeout Asynchronous Session Types (TOAST) as an extension to (binary) asynchronous timed session types, that permits mixed-choice. TOAST deploys timing constraints to regulate the use of mixed-choice so as to preserve communication safety. We provide a new behavioural semantics for TOAST which guarantees progress in the presence of mixed-choice. Building upon TOAST, we provide a calculus featuring process timers which is capable of modelling timeouts using a receive-after pattern, much like Erlang, and capture the correspondence with TOAST specifications via a type system for which we prove subject reduction.</description>

      <title>Drawing with Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18182v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing (a multiset of) coloured balls from an urn is one of the most basic models in discrete probability theory. Three modes of drawing are commonly distinguished: multinomial (draw-replace), hypergeometric (draw-delete), and Polya (draw-add). These drawing operations are represented as maps from urns to distributions over multisets of draws. The set of urns is a metric space via the Kantorovich distance. The set of distributions over draws is also a metric space, using Kantorovich-over-Kantorovich. It is shown that these three draw operations are all isometries, that is, they exactly preserve the Kantorovich distances. Further, drawing is studied in the limit, both for large urns and for large draws. First it is shown that, as the urn size increases, the Kantorovich distances go to zero between hypergeometric and multinomial draws, and also between P\'olya and multinomial draws. Second, it is shown that, as the drawsize increases, the Kantorovich distance goes to zero (in probability) between an urn and (normalised) multinomial draws from the urn. These results are known, but here, they are formulated in a novel metric manner as limits of Kantorovich distances. We call these two limit results the law of large urns and the law of large draws.</description>

      <title>From Innermost to Full Probabilistic Term Rewriting: Almost-Sure Termination, Complexity, and Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are many evaluation strategies for term rewrite systems, but automatically proving termination or analyzing complexity is usually easiest for innermost rewriting. Several syntactic criteria exist when innermost termination implies full termination or when runtime complexity and innermost runtime complexity coincide. We adapt these criteria to the probabilistic setting, e.g., we show when it suffices to analyze almost-sure termination w.r.t.\ innermost rewriting in order to prove full almost-sure termination of probabilistic term rewrite systems. These criteria can be applied for both termination and complexity analysis in the probabilistic setting. We implemented and evaluated our new contributions in the tool AProVE. Moreover, we also use our new results on innermost and full probabilistic rewriting to investigate the modularity of probabilistic termination properties.</description>
