      <title>The effects of the orbital configurations of mergers on reshaping galaxy structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a systematic analysis of how the orbital configuration of a merger can influence the structural formation of remnant galaxies using 531 merger pairs selected from IllustrisTNG-100. We comprehensively described the merger orbital configuration, considering the relative orbital motion of the merger pair and their disk orientations. We quantified the galaxy structures by dynamically defining four components: bulge, disk, warm component, and hot inner stellar halo. For mergers on spiral-in orbits, the disk planes of the two merging galaxies tend to be aligned with the orbital plane, leading to higher fractions for the disk and warm components, as well as lower fractions for the bulge and hot inner stellar halo components in the remnant galaxy. For mergers on direct collision orbits, the disk planes of the two galaxies tend to be perpendicular to the orbital plane, leading to lower fractions for disk and warm components, as well as higher fractions of the bulge and hot inner stellar halo in the remnant. Mergers can lead to either an increase or decrease in the disk and bulge mass fraction in the remnant compared to the progenitor galaxy, depending on the merger orbital configurations; however, in 93% of cases, mergers cause an increase in the hot inner stellar halo. As a result, the luminosity fraction of the hot inner stellar halo (but not the bulge) in galaxies at $z=0$ is highly correlated with its total ex situ stellar mass. In addition, we find that merger on spiral-in orbits is one of the possible reasons for the formation of recently discovered red but HI-rich (RR) galaxies.</description>

      <title>RIOJA. Merger-induced Clumps in a Galaxy at Redshift 6.81 Revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially resolved multi-wavelength analysis is essential to study galaxy formation and evolution. A UV-bright galaxy COS-2987030247 at $z = 6.81$ is one of the Rosetta Stones in the epoch of reionization for which JWST NIRSpec Integral Field Spectroscopy, NIRCam imaging, and ALMA data are available thanks to the RIOJA program. We identified the rest-frame optical emission lines from the ionized hydrogen, oxygen, and neon gas. The [OIII] 5008\AA\ line emission and the NIRCam images show a complex kinematical and morphological structure where two bright main and three faint clumps are identified in a 10 kpc extent. The system is not a simple rotating disk, but instead consists of merger-induced star-forming clumps, as expected from recent cosmological simulations. The spatially resolved emission line fluxes show that dust attenuation, metal enrichment, and ionization parameter are preferentially enhanced in the star formation peaks. Our SED fitting suggests that the main clumps are in a moderately dust-attenuated star forming phase ($A_{\rm V} = 0.2$--$0.3$ and SFR(H$\alpha$) $\sim 10$\,M$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$) with almost zero escape fraction of ionizing photons. In contrast, the sub-clumps are dust-free and lying on or below the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. These sub-clumps may work as a perturber that triggers the clumpy starburst in the surrounding gas through the merger event.</description>

      <title>RIOJA. JWST and ALMA unveil the inhomogeneous and complex ISM structure in a star-forming galaxy at $z=6.81$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a complex, two-phase ionized gas structure in the star-forming galaxy COS-2987 at $z = 6.81$, revealed by the unprecedented synergy between JWST/NIRSpec IFS and ALMA observations. These observations detect key emission lines, including [OII]$\lambda\lambda$ 3727, 3730, [OIII] 4364, [OIII] $\lambda\lambda$ 4960, 5008, [OIII] 88 $\mu$m, as well as H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$. JWST spectroscopy alone indicates interstellar medium (ISM) properties that are typical for galaxies at $z\sim7$. These include low dust extinction ($A_{\rm V} \approx 0.14$ mag), moderate electron density ($n_{\rm e} \approx 500$ cm$^{-3}$), and low gas-phase metallicity ($\sim10\%$). However, the strong far-infrared [OIII] 88 $\mu$m emission detected by ALMA cannot be explained by a single-phase ionized medium with uniform electron density and temperature. Instead, a two-phase ISM model, comprising compact, high-temperature, high-density gas components ($T_e \approx 26,000$ K; $n_e \approx 600 \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$) and an extended, cooler, lower-density component ($T_e \approx 8,000$ K; $n_e \approx 50 \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$), successfully reproduces the observed line ratios of [OIII] 88 $\mu$m/[OIII] 5008 \r{A} and [OIII] 4364 \r{A}/[OIII] 5008 \r{A}, with a volume ratio of 1 : 300 between the two phases. Our results demonstrate that JWST alone probes only a fraction of the ISM and highlight the critical importance of combining JWST and ALMA to reveal the density-stratified ISM of early galaxies.</description>

      <title>On the rapid growth of SMBHs in high-z galaxies: the aftermath of Population III.1 stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast amount of energy released by active galactic nuclei (AGN) is increasingly recognized as a key driver of evolution not only in massive galaxies and clusters, but also in low-mass dwarf galaxies. Despite this, their role in the early stages of galaxy formation and in self-regulating the rapid growth of the first and abundant supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains poorly understood. Through new high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations, we follow the co-evolution of $10^5 M_\odot$ black hole seeds with their host galaxy. The simulated suite progressively spans physics ranging from no AGN feedback and Eddington-limited thermal feedback, to more complex setups including non-Eddington-limited thermal, kinetic and radiative feedback. Across all our models, we find that black hole seeds efficiently reach masses of $\sim10^7 M_\odot$ by z=8. Although they exhibit notably different mass growth histories, these latter seem unimpeded by the presence of AGN feedback. The simulation including radiative feedback is the most distinct, with super-Eddington episodes driving fast and mass-loaded gas outflows (exceeding 2500 km $s^{-1}$) up to $\sim$50 kpc, along with minor stellar mass suppression in the host galaxy. Our measurements are in broad agreement with moderate luminosity quasars recently observed by JWST, producing overmassive black holes, dynamical masses of $\sim10^{9.5} M_\odot$, and high, though short-lived, Eddington fraction accretion rates. These results advocate for a scenario where AGN feedback allows for rapid SMBH growth during the reionisation era, while driving winds that extend deep into the intergalactic medium - shaping host galaxies as well as more distant surroundings.</description>

      <title>Vertical Structure and Dynamics of a Galactic Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the visible mass in a typical spiral galaxy is distributed in a thin disk, with a radial extent much larger than its thickness. While the planar disk structure, including non-axisymmetric features such as spiral structure, has been studied extensively, the vertical structure has not received comparable attention. This review aims to give a comprehensive, pedagogic introduction to the rich topic of vertical structure of a galactic disk in hydrostatic equilibrium and discuss the theoretical developments in this field in the context of recent observations. A realistic multi-component disk plus halo model of a galaxy has been developed and studied by us in detail. This takes account of both stars and interstellar gas, treated as isothermal components with different velocity dispersions, which are gravitationally coupled; further, the disk is in the gravitational field of the dark matter halo. This review focuses on this model and the results from it in different physical cases.
  The gas and halo crucially affect the resulting self-consistent stellar distribution such that it is vertically constrained to be closer to the mid-plane and has a steeper profile than in the standard one-component case, in agreement with modern observations. A typical stellar disk is shown to flare by a factor of few within the visible radial extent of the disk. These robust results question the sech^2 profile and a constant scale height, routinely used in the literature, for convenience. In an important application, the observed HI gas scale height is used as a constraint on the model which helps determine the shape and the density profile of the dark matter halo for galaxies. Finally, we outline some key, open questions which can be addressed in the near future using the above model, and new observational data -- for example, from IFU surveys and JWST -- for a better understanding of this topic.</description>

      <title>Photometric analysis of the intracluster light in the TNG300 simulation and wide-field observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a robust, apples-to-apples comparison between the photometric properties of the intracluster light (ICL) in the TNG300 magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulation and those in Wendelstein Wide Field Imager (WWFI) observations. This is accomplished by generating synthetic $g'$-band images of 40 massive ($\log\left(M_{\rm 200, crit}/{\rm M}_{\odot}\right) &gt; 14.5$) TNG300 clusters at $z \approx 0.06$, closely mimicking WWFI observations, and then performing identical photometric calculations on the synthetic and real images. Importantly, we apply the same observationally motivated satellite-masking procedure to both data-sets, which effectively removes any possible biases introduced by the halo finder. We first analyze the light distribution of the `smooth' stellar component of each cluster, composed of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) plus the ICL, and find that it tends to be about twice as extended in TNG300 than in observations, while also being approximately 1 $g'$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ brighter. We then quantify $f_{\rm ICL}$, the ICL fraction relative to the BCG+ICL, by considering several ICL definitions: (i) the light dimmer than a surface brightness cut at 27 $g'$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$, (ii) the excess light over a de Vaucouleurs profile, (iii) the light beyond twice the half-light radius ($2 r_{\rm half}$), and (iv) the light beyond a fixed circular aperture of 30, 50, or 100 kpc. For most definitions, the median $f_{\rm ICL}$ is consistent between simulation and observations. However, the observations exhibit larger scatter in $f_{\rm ICL}$, which we attribute primarily to observational uncertainties in the total BCG+ICL luminosity rather than `true' cluster-to-cluster variation in the real Universe. We also find that most methods yield median $f_{\rm ICL}$ values near 0.3, which is consistent with a BCG/ICL transition radius around $2 r_{\rm half}$.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Wind Driven Structures in the Orion Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study of [C II] 158 micron and HI 21-cm spectroscopic images plus high velocity resolution optical and ultraviolet spectra has shown the structure of the Orion Nebula to be different from that found from the study of those data separately. The [C II] features recently identified as the [C II] Shell is shown to be part of the Veil-B HI foreground layer. Jointly called the Outer Shell, it covers the bright Huygens Region and the Extended Orion Nebula. Its maximum expansion velocity is 15 km/s. Closer to ThetaOne OrionisC there is a second expanding shell, called the Inner Shell. It has an expansion velocity of 27 km/s and probably results from a more recent period of strong wind from one or more of the Trapezium stars. Even closer to ThetaOne OrionisC there is a central high ionization bubble, freely expanding towards the observer but slowed in the opposite direction by photo-ionized gas coming off the Main Ionization Front. Utilization of spectroscopic measures of the equivalent width of Hbeta shows that the enhanced emission in [C II] seen just outside the visual wavelength boundaries of the Orion Nebula is not caused by limb-brightening of the Outer Shell. This enhanced emission is due to the radiation field of the Trapezium stars being filtered by intervening residual neutral hydrogen. A velocity component near 30 km/s (Heliocentric) first seen in HI is also present in [C II] and may result from a foreground cloud of the ISM.</description>

      <title>High resolution radio analysis of the starburst galaxy NGC 4527: signatures of an AGN core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 4527 is a nearby edge-on spiral galaxy with both starburst and AGN features, hosting a LINER nucleus. We present a radio study of the large-scale structure and nuclear region of this galaxy, based on new uGMRT observations at 700 and 1230 MHz. Our continuum maps reveal extended emission tracing the stellar disk, with no evidence of a radio halo. The spectral index distribution and the presence of PAHs across the disk are consistent with ongoing star formation. In the nuclear region we resolve three compact sources: one at the galactic centre and two symmetrically aligned with the major axis at $\sim400$ pc. The spectral index values and the destruction of PAHs in the central source, together with previously detected X-rays emission, suggest the presence of a low-luminosity AGN. The two off-centre sources are consistent with a star formation ring, coincident with a molecular gas ring previously reported. We explore a scenario where super-Eddington accretion onto the black hole drives a dense wind that falls back onto the disk, triggering star formation in a circumnuclear ring.</description>

      <title>Ammonia in the hot core W51-IRS2: Maser line profiles, variability, and saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: W51-IRS2 is known to be one of the most prolific sources of interstellar ammonia (NH$_3$) maser lines. So far, however, many of these inversion lines have rarely been studied. Here we report spectrally resolved line profiles for the majority of detected features and provide information on the variability of these maser components between 2012 and 2023. This includes the first tentative detection of a ($J$,$K$) = (5,2) maser in the interstellar medium and the first tentative detection of a (6,4) maser in W51-IRS2. Furthermore, we report for the first time NH$_3$ (9,6) maser emission below Local Standard of Rest velocities of 50 km s$^{-1}$ in this source as well as double maser features occasionally seen in other transitions. The detected maser lines strongly indicate vibrational pumping by $\approx$10 $\mu$m photons, which must be abundant due to the high kinetic temperature ($\approx$300 K) of the ammonia emitting gas. The detection of vibrationally excited NH$_3$, suggesting a vibrational excitation temperature consistent with the kinetic one, and a comparison with measured SiO line profiles is also presented. For the (10,7) line, we find a tentative correlation between flux density and line width compatible with unsaturated maser emission. The velocity drift of the so-called 45 km s$^{-1}$ maser features, reported to be +0.2 km s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ between 1996 and 2012, has either slowed down to values $&lt;$0.1 km s$^{-1}$ or has entirely disappeared. In 2023, the component is only seen in ammonia inversion lines that are located at least 800 K above the ground state. The other features have faded. Possible scenarios explaining this phenomenon are discussed.</description>

      <title>The dark matter content of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies: Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way Survey of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has so far observed three classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs): Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor. Based on the observed line-of-sight velocities and metallicities of their member stars, we apply the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion modeling (JAM) approach to recover their inner dark matter distributions. In particular, both the traditional single-population Jeans model and the multiple population chemodynamical model are adopted. With the chemodynamical model, we divide member stars of each dSph into metal-rich and metal-poor populations. The metal-rich populations are more centrally concentrated and dynamically colder, featuring lower velocity dispersion profiles than the metal-poor populations. We find a diversity of the inner density slopes $\gamma$ of dark matter halos, with the best constraints by single-population or chemodynamical models consistent with each other. The inner density slopes are $0.71^{+0.34}_{-0.35}$, $0.26^{+0.22}_{-0.12}$ and $0.33^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ for Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor, respectively. We also present the measured astrophysical J and D factors of the three dSphs. Our results indicate that the study of the dark matter content of dSphs through stellar kinematics is still subject to uncertainties behind both the methodology and the observed data, through comparisons with previous measurements and data sets.</description>

      <title>The SOMA-POL Survey. I. Polarization and magnetic field properties of massive protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of magnetic fields in regulating the formation of massive stars remains much debated. Here we present sub-millimeter polarimetric observations with JCMT-POL2 at $850\:\mu$m of 13 regions of massive star formation selected from the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) star formation survey, yielding a total of 29 massive protostars. Our investigation of the $p'-I$ relationship suggests that grain alignment persists up to the highest intensities. We examine the relative orientations between polarization-inferred magnetic field direction and source column density elongation direction on small and large scales. On small scales, we find a bimodal distribution of these relative orientations, i.e., with an excess of near-parallel and near-perpendicular orientations. By applying a one-sample Kuiper test and Monte Carlo simulations to compare to a relative orientation distribution drawn from a uniform distribution, we statistically confirm this bimodal distribution, independent of the methods to measure structural orientation. This bimodal distribution suggests that magnetic fields are dynamically important on the local scales ($\lesssim 0.6\:$pc) of massive protostellar cores. We also examine how basic polarization properties of overall degree of polarization and local dispersion in polarization vector orientations depend on intrinsic protostellar properties inferred from spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. We find a statistically significant anti-correlation between the debiased polarized fraction and the luminosity to mass ratio, $L_{\rm bol}/M_{\rm env}$, which hints at a change in the dust properties for protostellar objects at different evolutionary stages.</description>

      <title>A Virgo Environmental Survey Tracing Ionised Gas Emission (VESTIGE). XIX. The discovery of a spectacular 230 kpc Halpha tail following NGC 4569 in the Virgo cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Galaxies fly inside galaxy clusters and ram pressure by the ICM can remove a large amount of the ISM from the galaxy, and deposit the gas in the ICM. The ISM decoupled from the host galaxy leaves a long trail following the moving galaxy. Such long trails track the galaxy motion and can be detected with sensitive data in Halpha.
  Aims. We study the Halpha tail trailing NGC 4569 in the Virgo cluster.
  Methods. The initial discovery was made with the deep Halpha imaging data with CFHT, from the VESTIGE project. The follow-up spectroscopic observations were made with APO/DIS, MMT/Binospec and CFHT/SITELLE.
  Results. Besides the known 80 kpc Halpha tail downstream of NGC 4569, the deep Halpha imaging data allow the Halpha tail detected to at least 230 kpc from the galaxy. More importantly, the Halpha clumps implied from the imaging data are confirmed with the spectroscopic data. The Halpha clumps show a smooth radial velocity gradient across about 1300 km/s, eventually reaching the velocity of the cluster. We build a simple model to explain the deceleration of stripped clumps and constrain the age to about 0.9 Gyr.
  Conclusions. This discovery, for the first time, demonstrates the full deceleration process of the stripped ISM. This discovery also showcases the potential with wide-field Halpha survey on galaxy clusters to discover intracluster optical emission-line clouds originated from cluster galaxies. These clouds provide kinematic tracers to the infall history of cluster galaxies and the turbulence in the ICM. They are also excellent multi-phase objects to study the relevant important physical processes.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the unwinding due to ram pressure stripping in simulated galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies moving through the gas of the intracluster medium (ICM) experience ram pressure stripping, which can leave behind a gas tail. When a disk galaxy receives the wind edge-on, however, the characteristic signature is not a typical jellyfish tail, but rather an unwinding of the spiral arms. We aim to quantify such asymmetries both in the gas and in the stellar component of a simulated galaxy. To this end, we simulate a gas-rich star-forming spiral galaxy moving through a self-consistent ICM gas. The amplitude and location of the asymmetries were measured via Fourier decomposition. We found that the asymmetry is much more evident in the gas component, but it is also measurable in the stars. The amplitude tends to increase with time and the asymmetry radius migrates inwards. We found that, when considering the gas, the spiral arms extend much further and are more unwound than the corresponding stellar arms. Characterizing the unwinding via simulations should help inform the observational criteria used to classify ram pressure stripped galaxies, as opposed to asymmetries induced by other mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Massive Interacting Binaries Enhance Feedback in Star-Forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new framework to incorporate feedback from massive interacting binaries in simulations of star cluster formation. Our new feedback model adds binary stellar evolution to the cluster formation code Torch, and couples it in AMUSE to the pre-existing modules for collisional stellar dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and mechanical and radiative feedback. Our model accounts for the effects of mass transfer on the stars' mass loss rates, their radiation spectra, and the timing of core-collapse supernovae. It also injects mass lost through non-conservative mass transfer and common envelope ejection into the interstellar medium. We demonstrate the use of our feedback model through simulations of isolated binaries in a gaseous medium, and of embedded clusters of massive binaries. Feedback from interacting binaries efficiently couples with the surrounding interstellar medium. It increases the size of HII regions, increases the kinetic and thermal energy of the gas, and increases the pressure within HII regions compared to models that use single star stellar evolution. Those differences arise from the ionizing radiation, which increases by three orders of magnitude, resulting in HII regions that expand due to thermal pressure rather than radiation pressure. The effects of stellar dynamics and the gravitational potential of the background gas cause the evolution of individual binaries to deviate from the predictions made by secular evolution, impacting the subsequent feedback from the binary. We conclude that massive interacting binaries are an important source of feedback in cluster-forming regions, and must be considered when studying the emerging timescales of young star clusters.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in Simulated Local Cluster Analogs: one-to-one comparisons between SLOW and XRISM/Hitomi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The XRISM Resolve X-ray spectrometer allows to gain detailed insight into gas motions of the intra cluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters. Current simulation studies focus mainly on statistical comparisons, making the comparison to the currently still small number of clusters difficult due to unknown selection effects. This study aims to bridge this gap, using simulated counterparts of Coma, Virgo, and Perseus from the SLOW constrained simulations. These clusters show excellent agreement in their properties and dynamical state with observations, thus providing an ideal testbed to understand the processes shaping the properties of the ICM. We find that the simulations match the order of the amount of turbulence for the three considered clusters, Coma being the most active, followed by Perseus, while Virgo is very relaxed. Typical turbulent velocities are a few $\approx100$ km s$^{-1}$, very close to observed values. The resulting turbulent pressure support is $\approx1\%$ for Virgo and $\approx 3-4\%$ for Perseus and Coma within the central $1-2\%$ of $R_{200}$. Compared to previous simulations and observations, measured velocities and turbulent pressure support are consistently lower, in line with XRISM findings, thus indicating the importance of selection effects.</description>

      <title>XRISM analysis of the complex Fe K$\alpha$ line in Centaurus A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the high-resolution XRISM/Resolve spectrum of the Fe K$\alpha$ emission line of the nearest active galactic nucleus, in Centaurus A. The line features two narrow and resolved peaks of Fe K$\alpha_1$, and Fe K$\alpha_2$ with a FWHM of $(4.8\pm0.2)\times10^2$ km/s each. A broad line with a FWHM of $(4.3\pm0.3)\times10^3$ km/s, and with a flux similar to the two narrow line cores, is also required. This broad component is not observed in the optical or IR spectra of Cen A. The line shape requires the existence of an emission region that extends from $\sim10^{-3}$ pc to $\sim10^1$ pc. Assuming that the emissivity follows a radial power-law profile of $r^{-q}$, we find $q\approx2$. This may indicate an extended corona, an emitting region that bends towards the corona, or a non-uniform density. When assuming $q=3$, the line shape can only be reproduced by including three emitting components in the model. The measured best-fit inclination is $24^{+13}_{-7}$ degrees, but higher inclinations are only slightly disfavored. A single blurred MYTorusL line profile can describe the line shape, but requires a large relative normalization. This could be due to past variability, modified abundances, or differing geometries. The line shape can be reproduced from the radii measured by reverberation mapping, but only if an additional extended emitting region at small radii is included.</description>

      <title>VLTI observations of the Orion Belt stars: I. eps Orionis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars play a decisive role in the evolution of the Universe. In order to constrain their current state and structure, we need sufficiently complex models, constrained by astrometric, interferometric, and spectroscopic observations. However, they are not available for distant stars. Instead, we focused on the nearest massive stars in the Orion Belt. We obtained VLTI interferometric observations of Orion Belt stars and calibrated visibility data from the GRAVITY and PIONIER instruments. Additionally, we obtained spectroscopic data from the CFHT and CTIO observatories. For modelling, we used a modified version of PHOEBE2, extended with new interferometric and spectroscopic modules. To describe non-spherical, rotating, or Roche-like stars, integrals over triangular meshes have to be computed, using extensive grids of synthetic spectra. For fitting, we used the simplex algorithm and chi2 mapping of the parameter space. In this paper, we present single-star models of the B0Ia supergiant eps Ori. Interferometric visibilities indicate that the star is not spherical but rotating close to its critical velocity. The preferred distance, d=(384+-8)pc, corresponds to the median of distances for the Orion OB1b association. We obtained the following parameters: m=(28.4+-2.0)Msol, R=(27.6+-1.5)Rsol, Teff=25000 K, i=45deg, longitude of the ascending node, Omega=300deg, and Prot=4.3+1.0d. This compromise model provides a reasonable fit to wind-free Balmer line profiles, but there is still some tension between interferometric and spectroscopic datasets, corresponding to a faster- vs. slower-rotating star. Our fast-rotating model implies that circumstellar matter should be naturally present, in the form of wind or disk, and contribute to continuum radiation. The fast rotation of eps Ori is compatible with a merger, formed from a multiple system of comparable mass, like del, zet or sig Ori.</description>

      <title>Hadronic origin of the very high-energy gamma-ray emission from the low-luminosity AGN in NGC 4278</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory has detected very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays from NGC 4278, which is known to host a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN). Having only very weak radio jets, the origin of its VHE gamma rays is unclear. In this paper we first show that NGC 4278 has a massive molecular cloud surrounding the nucleus by analyzing data taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We then assume that cosmic ray protons are accelerated in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow around the supermassive black hole, which diffuse into the molecular cloud and produce gamma rays and neutrinos via $pp$ interactions. We model the gamma-ray spectra and find that the observations can be explained by such hadronic processes if the AGN activity was higher in the past than at present, and the diffusion coefficient in the molecular cloud is appreciably smaller than in the Milky Way interstellar medium. However, we also show that the high-energy neutrinos co-produced with the gamma rays are unlikely to be detectable even with IceCube-Gen2.</description>

      <title>On the width and profiles of cosmic filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the widths and profiles of cosmic filaments using the IllustrisTNG simulations. Filaments were identified with DisPerSE, using galaxy samples in simulations as input. Since the width of an individual filament can vary significantly along its spine, we divided each filament into segments with lengths between $1.5\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and $2.5\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and measure their properties. The typical width of these filament segments increases gradually from approximately $0.3\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ at redshift $z = 2.0$ to about $1.0-1.5\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $z = 0.0$. We find that the segment width correlates nearly linearly with the linear halo mass density, consistent with previous studies. A similar linear relation is observed between the segment width and the linear stellar mass density, providing a potential estimator for filament width. Furthermore, the density profiles of filaments with different widths exhibit self-similarity and can be described by a unified formula akin to the isothermal $\beta$-model. For segments with a given width, the rescaled density profiles show only mild evolution from $z = 2.0$ to $z = 0.0$. Within the filament width, the gas temperature decreases slowly from the center to the boundary, with thicker filaments generally containing hotter gas than thinner ones. These trends in filament width, density, and thermal profiles are consistently observed across the TNG50, TNG100, and TNG300 simulations, and align well with results from earlier studies. We briefly discuss the potential implications and applications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Angular correlation functions of bright Lyman-break galaxies at $\mathbf{3 \lesssim z \lesssim 5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the clustering of Lyman-break galaxies at redshifts of 3 $\lesssim z \lesssim$ 5 within the COSMOS field by measuring the angular two-point correlation function. Our robust sample of $\sim$60,000 bright ($m_{\rm UV}\lesssim 27$) Lyman-break galaxies was selected based on spectral energy distribution fitting across 14 photometric bands spanning optical and near-infrared wavelengths. We constrained both the 1- and 2-halo terms at separations up to 300 arcsec, finding an excess in the correlation function at scales corresponding to $&lt;20$ kpc, consistent with enhancement due to clumps in the same galaxy or interactions on this scale. We then performed Bayesian model fits on the correlation functions to infer the Halo Occupation Distribution parameters, star formation duty cycle, and galaxy bias in three redshift bins. We examined several cases where different combinations of parameters were varied, showing that our data can constrain the slope of the satellite occupation function, which previous studies have fixed. For an $M_{\rm{UV}}$-limited sub-sample, we found galaxy bias values of $b_g=3.18^{+0.14}_{-0.14}$ at $z\simeq3$, $b_g=3.58^{+0.27}_{-0.29}$ at $z\simeq4$, $b_g=4.27^{+0.25}_{-0.26}$ at $z\simeq5$. The duty cycle values are $0.62^{+0.25}_{-0.26}$, $0.40^{+0.34}_{-0.22}$, and $0.39^{+0.31}_{-0.20}$, respectively. These results suggest that, as the redshift increases, there is a slight decrease in the host halo masses and a shorter timescale for star formation in bright galaxies, at a fixed rest-frame UV luminosity threshold.</description>

      <title>Spherically Symmetric Accretion with Self-Gravity: Analytical Formulae and Numerical Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spherically symmetric accretion incorporating self-gravity constitutes a three-point boundary value problem (TPBVP) governed by constraints at the outer boundary, sonic point, and accretor surface. Previous studies have two limitations: either employing an incorrect formula for self-gravity potential in analytical treatments, or introducing additional input parameters in numerical implementations to circumvent solving the full TPBVP. To address these issues, we present a self-consistent TPBVP formulation, solved using the relaxation method. We also derive approximate analytical formulae that enable rapid estimates of self-gravity effects. Our analysis identifies a dimensionless parameter $\beta \equiv 2G \bar{\rho} r_\mathrm{out}^2/a_\mathrm{out}^2$ that characterizes the strength of self-gravity, where $\bar{\rho}$ and $r_\mathrm{out}$ are the mean density and outer radius of the flow, respectively, and $a_\mathrm{out}$ is the adiabatic sound speed of the external medium. For practical estimation, $\bar{\rho}$ may be approximated by the external medium density $\rho_\mathrm{out}$. We identify an upper limit for $\beta$, beyond which steady accretion becomes unsustainable -- a behavior consistent with classical gravitational instability that previous studies failed to capture. The accretion rate enhancement decreases monotonically as the adiabatic index $\gamma$ increases. For $\gamma=5/3$, self-gravity ceases to augment the accretion rate. These theoretical predictions are validated by our numerical solutions. We further apply our results to two astrophysical scenarios: hyper-Eddington accretion onto supermassive black hole seeds in the early Universe, where self-gravity is significant; and accretion onto stellar-mass objects embedded in active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks, where self-gravity is non-negligible under certain conditions and should be evaluated using $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Preliminary Characterization of a Third Interstellar Object: 3I/ATLAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report initial observations aimed at the characterization of a third interstellar object candidate. This object, 3I/ATLAS -- also C/2025 N1 (ATLAS) -- , was discovered on 2025 July 1 UT and has an orbital eccentricity of $e\sim6.2$, perihelion of $q\sim 1.35$ au, inclination of $\sim175^\circ$, and hyperbolic velocity of $V_\infty\sim 60$ km s$^{-1}$. 3I/ATLAS has an absolute magnitude of $H_V\sim12$, which corresponds to a nuclear radius of $\sim10\text{ km}$, assuming an asteroid-like albedo of $p\sim0.05$. The discovery of this object implies a spatial number density of $n_0\sim10^{-3}$ au$^{-3}$ for objects with radii greater than or equal to that of 3I/ATLAS. We report deep stacked images obtained using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope that display faint activity. Using images obtained from the Las Cumbres Observatory 0.36 m telescopes at Haleakala and the 2.0 m Faulkes Telescope North, we find a small light curve variation of less than 0.2 mag for the object over a $\sim29$ h time span. The visible/near-infrared spectral slope of the object is red, comparable to 1I/`Oumuamua. The object will be observable until September 2025, unobservable near perihelion due to low solar elongation, and observable again in November. This limitation unfortunately prohibits detailed observations at perihelion when the activity of 3I/ATLAS is likely to peak. Based on the experience of 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, we ask the community to maintain a constant observational presence while possible with photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric methods. Such observational data would constrain the (i) light curve, (ii) onset and variation of activity, and (iii) nongravitational effects. It is essential that the community collaborate to rapidly and comprehensively characterize these properties of 3I/ATLAS.</description>

Abstract: X-ray observations collected over the last decades have revealed a strongly variable X-ray signal within the Milky Way's Galactic center, interpreted as X-ray echoes from its supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. These echoes are traced by the strong Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescent line at 6.4 keV of which its intensity is proportional to the density of the illuminated molecular gas. Over time, the echo scans through molecular clouds (MCs) in our Galactic center, revealing their 3D structure and highlighting their densest parts. While previous studies have utilized spectral line doppler shifts along with kinematic models to constrain the geometry of the CMZ or to study the structure of individual clouds, these methods have limitations, particularly in the turbulent region of the CMZ. We use archival Chandra X-ray data to construct one of the first 3D representations of one prominent MC, the Stone Cloud, located at (l = 0.068{\deg}, b = -0.076{\deg}) at a distance of ~20pc from Sgr A* in projection. Using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we followed the X-ray echo in this cloud from 2008 to 2017. We combine this data with 1.3 mm dust continuum emission observed with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Herschel Space Observatory to re-construct the 3D structure of the cloud and estimate the column densities for each year's observed slice. The analysis of the X-ray echoes along with velocities from SMA molecular line data indicate that the structure of the Stone cloud can be described as a very diffuse background with multiple dense clumps throughout.</description>

      <title>In Search of the First Stars: An Ultra-Compact and Very Low Metallicity Lyman-$\alpha$ Emitter Deep Within the Epoch of Reionization</title>

Abstract: We present {\it JWST} observations of a gravitationally-lensed, extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift $z=8.203\pm 0.001$ from the CANUCS survey. Based on the low oxygen to Balmer line ratios we infer a gas-phase metallicity of $12+{\rm log(O/H)}=6.85$ (1.4\% solar), making CANUCS-A370-z8-LAE one of the most metal-poor galaxies known at $z&gt;7$. With a high H$\beta$ equivalent width of $225\pm50$\,\AA\ and a half-light radius of only $r_{\rm hl} = 38 ^{+3}_{-19} $\,pc, the galaxy has a high star-formation-rate density of $50 - 100\,M_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$\,kpc$^{-2}$. The galaxy shows high equivalent width Lyman-$\alpha$ emission with an inferred Lyman-$\alpha$ escape fraction of $0.21 \pm 0.05$. The high escape fraction of Lyman-$\alpha$ is likely due to the compact starbursting nature of the galaxy combined with its location in an overdensity traced by at least two other galaxies spectroscopically confirmed to lie within $\delta z = 0.01$ that have helped to reionize the environment. The low metallicity of CANUCS-A370-z8-LAE is best explained by a model where infalling metal-poor gas dilutes the interstellar medium, rather than being a young galaxy forming its first stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Gas outflows in two recently quenched galaxies at z = 4 and 7</title>

Abstract: Outflows are a key element in the baryon cycle of galaxies, and their properties provide a fundamental test for our models of how star formation quenches in galaxies. Here we report the detection of outflowing gas in two recently quenched, massive ($M_\star\sim10^{10.2}M_\odot$) galaxies at z=4.106 (NS_274) and z=7.276 (RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7) observed with JWST/NIRSpec. The outflows are traced by blue-shifted MgII absorption lines, and in the case of the z=4.1 system, also by FeII and NaI features. The spectra of the two sources are similar to those of local post-starburst galaxies, showing deep Balmer features and minimal star formation on 10 Myr timescales as traced by the lack of bright emission lines, also suggesting the absence of a strong and radiatively efficient AGN. The galaxies' SFHs are consistent with an abrupt quenching of star formation, which continued at rates of $\sim15\,M_\odot$/yr averaged over 100 Myr timescales. Dedicated millimeter observations of NS_274 constrain its dust obscured SFR to $&lt;12\,M_\odot$/yr. Under simple geometrical assumptions, we derive mass loading factors $\lesssim1$ and $&gt;10$ for the z=4.1 and z=7.3 systems, respectively, and similarly different energies carried by the outflows. Supernova feedback can account for the mass and energy of the outflow in NS_274. However, the low mass loading factor and average gas velocity suggest that the observed outflow is likely not the primary factor behind its quenching. SF-related processes seem to be insufficient to explain the extreme mass outflow rate of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7, which would require an additional ejective mechanism such as an undetected AGN. Finally, the average outflow velocities per unit $M_\star$, SFR, or its surface area are consistent with those of lower-redshift post-starburst galaxies, suggesting that outflows in rapidly quenched galaxies might occur similarly across cosmic time.

      <title>New constraints on the galactic ionizing efficiency and escape fraction at 2.5 &lt; z &lt; 6 based on quasar absorption spectra</title>

Abstract: Measurements of the ionisation state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can probe the sources of the extragalactic ionising background. We provide new measurements of the ionising emissivity of galaxies using measurements of the ionising background and ionising photon mean free path from high-redshift quasar spectra at $2.5 &lt; z &lt; 6$. Unlike most prior works, we account for radiative-transfer effects and possible neutral islands from the tail of reionisation at $z &gt; 5$. We combine our results with measurements of the UV luminosity function to constrain the average escaping ionising efficiency of galaxies, $\langle f_{\rm esc} \xi_{\rm ion}\rangle_{L_{\rm UV}}$. Assuming galaxies with $M_{\rm UV} &lt; -11$ emit ionising photons, we find $\log (\langle f_{\rm esc} \xi_{\rm ion}\rangle_{L_{\rm UV}}/{\rm erg^{-1}Hz}) = 24.47_{-0.17}^{+0.09}$ and $24.75_{-0.28}^{+0.15}$ at $z=5$ and $6$, and $1\sigma$ upper limits of $24.48$ and $24.31$ at $z = 2.5$ and $4$, respectively. We also estimate the population-averaged $f_{\rm esc}$ using measurements of intrinsic ionising efficiency from JWST. We find $\langle f_{\rm esc} \rangle = 0.126_{-0.041}^{+0.034}$ and $0.224_{-0.108}^{+0.098}$ at $z=5$ and $6$, and $1\sigma$ upper limits of $f_{\rm esc}&lt; 0.138$ and $0.096$ at $z=2.5$ and $4$, respectively, for $M_{\rm UV} &lt; -11$. Our findings are consistent with prior measurements of $f_{\rm esc} \lesssim 10\%$ at $z \leq 4$, but indicate a factor of several increase between $z = 4$ and $6$. The steepness of this evolution is sensitive to the highly uncertain mean free path and ionising background intensity at $z&gt;5$. Lastly, we find $1.10^{+0.21}_{-0.39}$ photons per H atom are emitted into the IGM between $z=6$ and $=5.3$. This is $\approx 4\times$ more than needed to complete the last $20\%$ of reionisation absent recombinations, suggesting that reionisation's end was likely absorption-dominated.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Star Cluster Formation: The Effects of Ongoing Star Formation and Stellar Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a high resolution zoom-in simulation of star cluster assembly including the merger of two sub-clusters with initial conditions taken from previous large scale giant molecular cloud (GMC) simulations. We couple hydrodynamics to N-body dynamics to simulate the individual stars themselves, and the gas-rich environment in which they evolve. We include prescriptions for star formation and stellar feedback and compare directly to previous simulations of the same region without these prescriptions to determine their role in shaping the dynamics inherited from the cluster assembly process. The stellar mass of the cluster grows through star formation within the cluster and accretion of new stars and star forming gas from a nearby filament. This growth results in an enhancement in the cluster's rotation and anisotropic expansion compared to simulations without star formation. We also analyze the internal kinematics of the cluster once it has lost most of its gas and find that the rotational velocity and the velocity anisotropy profiles are qualitatively similar to those expected of clusters that have undergone violent relaxation. As well, rotation and anisotropic expansion are still present by the time of gas removal. This implies that evolution within the GMC was unable to completely erase the kinematics inherited by the merger.</description>

Abstract: Dwarf galaxies serve as powerful laboratories for investigating the underlying physics of galaxy evolution including the impact of baryonic feedback processes and environmental influences. We compare the visual and structural properties of dwarf galaxies in ultra-deep HSC-SSP imaging of the COSMOS field with those measured from realistic HSC-like synthetic observations of dwarfs generated by the Illustris TNG50 and NewHorizon simulations. Using S\'ersic profile fitting and non-parametric morphological metrics (Gini, $M_{20}$, asymmetry, and concentration), we evaluate the diversity of structural properties in observed and simulated galaxies.
  Our analysis shows that NewHorizon and TNG50 galaxies lie at opposite extremes of observed structural trends: NewHorizon produces diffuse, extended galaxies with shallow S\'ersic indices, while TNG50 yields compact, concentrated systems with steep indices. Both simulations reproduce observed structural trends more closely at higher stellar masses ($M_{\star}\sim10^{9.5} {\rm M_{\odot}}$) but fail to capture the full diversity of COSMOS dwarfs at lower masses. Non-parametric metrics further show that NewHorizon galaxies exhibit more uneven, clumpy light distributions while TNG50 galaxies have smoother but excessively concentrated profiles. These structural differences reflect underlying differences in their physical prescriptions and are likely driven by differing approaches to ISM physics, supernova feedback and star formation in addition to differences in numerical resolution.
  Our findings highlight the unique power of low-mass galaxies to constrain differences in simulation physics, especially star formation and feedback. Upcoming surveys from facilities like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid will enable more rigorous comparisons with simulations, offering deeper insights into the physical processes shaping galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Disruptions of stars and binary systems on chaotic orbits in an axisymmetric Milky Way center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-spherical potentials allow a wide range of trajectories, both regular and chaotic, whose periapse distances can vary orbit to orbit. In particular chaotic trajectories can bring a system arbitrarily close to the central massive black hole leading to a disruption. In this paper, we work with an observationally benchmarked model of the innermost 200 pc of the Milky Way and show that low z-angular momentum trajectories are commonly chaotic. We compute the timescales and properties of close pericenter passages, and compare the implied collisionless disruption rate to the well-studied collisional rate from 2-body scatterings. We find that the relative collisionless rate can dominate by orders of magnitude. Our calculations are relevant for a wide range of disruption phenomena, including the production of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs). Most of these disruptions involve stars come from the Nuclear Stellar Cluster, with a pericenter distribution that strongly favours shallow encounters, and a preference for high inclination interactions. The latter implies that unbound disrupted material - whether ejected stars or stellar debris - would be preferentially directed towards the galactic poles. Many of our conclusions apply generally to any galaxy with a non-spherical galactic centre potential and central massive black hole.</description>

Abstract: Cold gaseous systems play important roles in galaxy evolution by possibly providing fuel to ignite active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and star-formation. In this work, we analyze [CII]$158\rm \mu m$ and continuum observations from ALMA for a sample of four radio AGN at $z \approx 3.5$, focusing on eight associated companion cloud systems discovered within projected distances of tens of kiloparsecs or less. The spatial distribution of these companions indicates that the majority of cold gas is not located at the AGN position, i.e., not in their host galaxies. With the assistance of [CII] at 0.2" resolution, we further confirm the gas-poor nature of the hosts by re-analyzing archival [CI] (a tracer of H$_{2}$) at $\sim2"$ resolution. Our sample has [CII] luminosities in a range of $2.8\times10^{8}&lt;L_{\rm [CII]}/L_{\odot}&lt;4.2\times10^{9}$. The $L_{\rm [CII]}/L_{\rm IR}$ ratio, $\sim 9.4\times10^{-4}$, is consistent with sources discussed in the literature. Our findings show the gas-poor radio AGN hosts have nearby gas-rich companions. We propose that these companions, which may be stripped clouds in merger process and by interaction with the energy output from the AGN, could be a trigger of radio-loud AGN. They may also be a signature of negative AGN feedback (e.g., shock heating) on these infalling companions and on the host galaxy. In general, our analysis shows that powerful AGN at and before Cosmic Noon are impacting and being impacted by cold gaseous clouds in their circum-galactic or proto-intracluster media.</description>

      <title>A kinematically constrained kick distribution for isolated neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnitudes of the velocity kicks that neutron stars (NSs) obtain at their formation have long been a topic of discussion. In previous work, a novel method was proposed to determine kicks based on the eccentricity of Galactic trajectories. We applied this method to the isolated pulsars with known parallax in order to kinematically constrain the NS natal kick distribution. We assumed the velocity vectors of the pulsars to be distributed isotropically in the local standard of rest frame, and for each pulsar we sampled 100 velocities taking into account this assumption. These velocity vectors were used to trace back the trajectories of the NSs through the Galaxy and estimate their eccentricity. Then, we simulated kicked objects in order to evaluate the relationship between kick magnitude and Galactic eccentricity, which was used to infer the kicks corresponding to the estimated eccentricities. The resulting kick distributions indeed show a bimodal structure for young pulsars and our fits resemble the ones from literature well. However, for older pulsars the bimodality vanishes and instead we find a log-normal kick distribution peaking at ~200 km/s and a median of ~400 km/s. We also compare our methods to literature that suggests natal kicks are significantly higher and follow a Maxwellian with $\sigma=265$ km/s. We cannot reproduce these results using their sample and distance estimates, and instead find kicks that are consistent with our proposed distribution. We conclude that our kinematically constrained kick distribution is well-described by a log-normal distribution with $\mu=6.38$ and $\sigma=1.01$, normalised between 0 and 1000 km/s. This analysis reveals no evidence for bimodality in the larger sample, and we suggest that the bimodality found by existing literature may be caused by their relatively small sample size.</description>

      <title>The PAU Survey: Measuring intrinsic galaxy alignments in deep wide fields as a function of colour, luminosity, stellar mass and redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the measurements and constraints of intrinsic alignments (IA) in the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS) deep wide fields, which include the W1 and W3 fields from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) and the G09 field from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS). Our analyses cover 51deg$^{2}$, in the photometric redshift (photo-$z$) range $0.1 &lt; z_{\mathrm{b}} &lt; 1$ and a magnitude limit $i_{\mathrm{AB}}&lt;22$. The precise photo-$z$s and the luminosity coverage of PAUS enable robust IA measurements, which are key for setting informative priors for upcoming stage-IV surveys. For red galaxies, we detect an increase in IA amplitude with both luminosity and stellar mass, extending previous results towards fainter and less massive regimes. As a function of redshift, we observe strong IA signals at intermediate ($z_{\mathrm{b}}\sim0.55$) and high ($z_{\mathrm{b}}\sim0.75$) redshift bins. However, we find no significant trend of IA evolution with redshift after accounting for the varying luminosities across redshift bins, consistent with the literature. For blue galaxies, no significant IA signal is detected, with $A_{1}=0.68_{-0.51}^{+0.53}$ when splitting only by galaxy colour, yielding some of the tightest constraints to date for the blue population and constraining a regime of very faint and low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>Delving into the depths of NGC 3783 with XRISM. I. Kinematic and ionization structure of the highly ionized outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present our study of the XRISM observation of the Seyfert-1 galaxy NGC 3783. XRISM's Resolve microcalorimeter has enabled, for the first time, a detailed characterization of the highly ionized outflows in this active galactic nucleus. Our analysis constrains their outflow and turbulent velocities, along with their ionization parameter ($\xi$) and column density ($N_{\rm H}$). The high-resolution Resolve spectrum reveals a distinct series of Fe absorption lines between 6.4 and 7.8 keV, ranging from Fe XVIII to Fe XXVI. At lower energies, absorption features from Si, S, and Ar are also detected. Our spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of the time-averaged Resolve spectrum uncovers six outflow components, five of which exhibit relatively narrow absorption lines with outflow velocities ranging from 560 to 1170 km/s. In addition, a broad absorption feature is detected, which is consistent with Fe XXVI outflowing at 14,300 km/s (0.05 $c$). The kinetic luminosity of this component is 0.8-3% of the bolometric luminosity. Our analysis of the Resolve spectrum shows that more highly ionized absorption lines are intrinsically broader than those of lower-ionization species, indicating that the turbulent velocity of the six outflow components (ranging from 0 to 3500 km/s) increases with $\xi$. Furthermore, we find that the $N_{\rm H}$ of the outflows generally declines with $\xi$ up to $\log \xi = 3.2$ but rises beyond this point, suggesting a complex ionization structure. The absorption profile of the Fe XXV resonance line is intriguingly similar to UV absorption lines (Ly$\alpha$ and C IV) observed by the HST, from which we infer that the outflows are clumpy in nature. Our XRISM/Resolve results support a "hybrid wind" scenario in which the observed outflows have multiple origins and driving mechanisms. We explore various interpretations of our findings within AGN wind models.</description>

Abstract: The star NGC 3603-A1 has long been known to be a very massive binary, consisting of a pair of O2-3If*/WN5-6 stars, which show Wolf-Rayet-like emission due to their luminosities being near the Eddington limit. The system has been poorly characterized until now, due to the difficulties of obtaining reliable radial velocities from broad, blended emission lines and the extreme crowding in the cluster. However, previously unpublished archival HST/STIS spectra revealed that some of the upper Balmer lines (seen in absorption) are well separated at favorable orbital phases, prompting us to obtain our own carefully-timed new HST/STIS spectra, which we have analyzed along with the older data. Radial velocities measured from these spectra allow us to obtain an orbit for this 3.77298 day system. We also used archival STIS imaging of the cluster to obtain a more accurate light curve for this eclipsing system, which we then modeled, yielding the orbital inclination and providing values for the stellar radii and temperatures. Together, these data show that the NGC 3603-A1 system consists of a 93.3+/-11.0 Mo O3If*/WN6 primary with an effective temperature of 37,000 K, and a 70.4+/-9.3 Mo O3If*/WN5 secondary that is slightly hotter, 42,000 K. Although a more massive binary is known in the LMC, NGC 3603-A1 is as massive as any binary known in our own Galaxy for which a direct measurement of its mass has been made. The secondary has been spun up by mass accretion from the primary, and we discuss the evolutionary status of this intriguing system.</description>
