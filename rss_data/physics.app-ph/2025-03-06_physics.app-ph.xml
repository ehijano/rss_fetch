      <title>Lithium Tantalate Bulk Acoustic Resonator For Piezoelectric Power Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first lithium tantalate (LT) thickness-extensional (TE) mode bulk acoustic resonators designed for piezoelectric power conversion, showcasing a low temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of -13.56 ppm/K. These resonators also exhibit high quality factors (Q) of 1698, and electromechanical coupling coefficients ($k^2$) of 8.8%, making them suitable for efficient power conversion applications. A grounded ring structure is leveraged for spurious mode-free response and figure of merit (FoM=$k^2 \times Q$) enhancement near the series resonance. The temperature dependency of Q and $k^2$ is experimentally tested over a wide temperature range, from $25^{\circ}\text{C}$ to $130^{\circ}\text{C}$, demonstrating the resonators thermal stability and consistent performance under varying conditions. This work highlights the potential of LT resonators in the future development of thermally stable power electronic systems, enabling more reliable and efficient piezoelectric power converters.</description>

      <title>Mass-manufactured Gradient Plasmonic Metasurfaces for Enhanced Mid-IR Spectrochemical Analysis of Complex Biofluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mid-infrared spectroscopy offers powerful label-free molecular analysis capabilities but faces significant challenges when analyzing complex biological samples. Here, we present a transformative surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) platform that overcomes fundamental limitations through key innovations. First, we demonstrate high-throughput wafer-scale fabrication of mid-IR plasmonic micro-hole-array (MHA) metasurfaces on free-standing silicon nitride membranes, yielding approximately 400 sensor chips per 6-inch wafer. Second, our gradient MHA metasurface design supports spectrally cascaded plasmonic modes, generating over 400 sharp resonance peaks across the 1200-2000 cm-1 fingerprint region. This approach enables comprehensive molecular fingerprinting using simple imaging optics in transmission mode. Third, we validate our SEIRAS platform using a model polymer system and clinical peritoneal fluid samples from ovarian cancer patients, demonstrating its capability to resolve complex molecular signatures in real biological specimens. The platform's dense spectral coverage ensures optimal on-resonance enhancement across the broad fingerprint region, revealing previously obscured vibrational bands that conventional IR spectroscopy cannot distinguish. By combining high-throughput fabrication with simplified optical readout and the capability to analyze complex biological samples, our work establishes a foundation for translating SEIRAS technology into practical biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Nanocavity-Enhanced Second-Harmonic Generation from Colossal Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are an attractive medium for nonlinear optics and deterministic heterogeneous integration with photonic devices. Their intrinsic nonlinearities can be strengthened further by coupling QDs to low mode-volume photonic nanocavities, enabling low-power, on-chip nonlinear optics. In this paper, we demonstrated cavity-enhanced second harmonic generation via integration of colossal QDs with a silicon nitride nanobeam cavity. By pumping the cavity-QD system with an ultrafast pulsed laser, we observed a strong second harmonic generation from the cavity-coupled QD, and we estimate an enhancement factor of ~3,040. Our work, coupled with previously reported deterministic positioning of colossal QDs, can enable a scalable QD-cavity platform for low-power nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Tunable Absorption in Near Infrared Based on Indium Tin Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a serrated ultra-broadband infrared absorber based on the multi-layer repetitive stacking of indium tin oxide (ITO) and silicon materials. This absorber achieves continuously tunable absorption within a wide infrared light range. By changing the size and materials of the absorber, its average absorption rate can reach a relatively high level. Simulation results reveal wavelength-dependent electric field localization: shorter wavelengths concentrate in narrower upper regions, while longer wavelengths localize in wider lower areas. This design offers potential applications in near-infrared detectors, optical communication, and smart windows.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation measurements with the FOOT experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle Therapy (PT) has emerged as a powerful tool in cancer treatment, leveraging the unique dose distribution of charged particles to deliver high radiation levels to the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Despite its advantages, further improvements in Treatment Planning Systems (TPS) are needed to address uncertainties related to fragmentation process, which can affect both dose deposition and effectiveness. These fragmentation effects also play a critical role in Radiation Protection in Space, where astronauts are exposed to high level of radiation, necessitating precise models for shielding optimization. The FOOT (FragmentatiOn Of Target) experiment addresses these challenges by measuring fragmentation cross-section with high precision, providing essential data for improving TPS for PT and space radiation protection strategies. This thesis contributes to the FOOT experiment in two key areas. First, it focuses on the performances of the vertex detector, which is responsible for reconstructing particle tracks and fragmentation vertexes with high spatial resolution. The study evaluates the detector's reconstruction algorithm and its efficiency to detect particles. Second the thesis present a preliminary calculation of fragmentation cross section, incorporating the vertex detector for the first time in these measurements.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear particle motion and bursty periodic energy deposition in inductively coupled plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations are employed to study particle motion and power deposition in inductively coupled plasmas. We show that under condition of low-frequency ($\sim\mathrm{MHz}$) and low-pressure, the electron motion is highly nonlinear in the skin region near the coil: electrons are strongly magnetized, and the energy deposition is small throughout most of the RF cycle. However, during the phase when the RF magnetic field vanishes, electrons briefly demagnetize, causing a jet-like current penetrating into the plasma. During these short time intervals the power deposition becomes high, resulting in periodic bursts in the energy deposition. We developed a new kinetic theory, which not only provides analytical expressions for the plasma current and energy deposition, but also predicts a new nonlinear relation between electron current and the RF inductive electric field. A criterion for transition between the low frequency, periodic bursty nonlinear regime and the high frequency, anomalous non-local skin effect regime is proposed and verified using a series of fully kinetic 2D particle-in-cell simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of quantum thermodynamics, quantum batteries have emerged as promising devices for energy storage and manipulation. Over the past decade, substantial progress has been made in understanding the fundamental properties of quantum batteries, with several experimental implementations showing great promise. This Perspective provides an overview of the solid-state materials platforms that could lead to fully operational quantum batteries. After briefly introducing the basic features of quantum batteries, we discuss organic microcavities, where superextensive charging has already been demonstrated experimentally. We then explore other materials, including inorganic nanostructures (such as quantum wells and dots), perovskite systems, and (normal and high-temperature) superconductors. Key achievements in these areas, relevant to the experimental realization of quantum batteries, are highlighted. We also address challenges and future research directions. Despite their enormous potential for energy storage devices, research into advanced materials for quantum batteries is still in its infancy. This paper aims to stimulate interdisciplinarity and convergence among different materials science research communities to accelerate the development of new materials and device architectures for quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Manipulate intrinsic light-matter interaction with bound state in the continuum in van der Waals metasurfaces by artificial etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent demonstrations of van der Waals (vdW) nanophotonics have opened new pathways for manipulating the light-matter interaction in an intrinsic manner, leading to fascinating achievements in tunable magneto-optics by self-hybrid polaritons, indirect bandgap lasering, and exceptionally enhanced optical nonlinearity. However, the anisotropic atomic lattice, chemically active side walls, and distinct enthalpies of formation across vdW materials, pose significant challenges in nanofabrication and material choices, hindering the realization of high-Q resonant mode on arbitrary materials. In this work, we propose an etch-free vdW structure that mimics the shallow etching, termed "artificial etching". This approach utilizes a low refractive index (LRI) perturbation layer made of photoresist, drastically reducing radiation loss and experimentally achieving a remarkable Q factor of up to 348, which is comparable to the highest values reported in vdW nanophotonics. We demonstrate room-temperature polaritons in etch-free structures using four representative materials (WS$_2$, MoS$_2$, WSe$_2$, and MoSe$_2$) through self-hybridization of high-Q (quasi-)bound states in the continuum (BIC) modes and excitons, achieving a Rabi-splitting of approximately 80 meV, which significantly surpasses the intrinsic excitonic loss. Furthermore, we showcase optical modulation of indirect bandgap emission in bulk WS$_2$ and direct exciton emission in heterostructures, achieving substantial polarization-dependent enhancement of their emission efficiencies. The proposed etch-free vdW structure provides a versatile platform for high-Q nanophononics while preserving material integrity, advancing applications in photoelectronic and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field Control of Magnetic Skyrmion Chirality in a Centrosymmetric 2D van der Waals Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals magnets hosting topological magnetic textures, such as skyrmions, show promise for applications in spintronics and quantum computing. Electrical control of these topological spin textures would enable novel devices with enhanced performance and functionality. Here, using electron microscopy combined with in situ electric and magnetic biasing, we show that the skyrmion chirality, whether left-handed or right-handed, in insulating Cr2Ge2Te6, is controlled by external electric field direction applied during magnetic field cooling process. The electric-field-tuned chirality remains stable, even amid variations in magnetic and electric fields. Our theoretical investigation reveals that nonzero Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between the nearest neighbors, induced by the external electric field, change their sign upon reversing the electric field direction, thereby facilitating chirality selection. The electrical control of magnetic chirality demonstrated in this study can be extended to other non-metallic centrosymmetric skyrmion-hosting magnets, opening avenues for future device designs in topological spintronics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Controlling nonergodicity in quantum many-body systems by reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding optimal control strategies to suppress quantum thermalization for arbitrarily initial states, the so-called quantum nonergodicity control, is important for quantum information science and technologies. Previous control methods largely relied on theoretical model of the target quantum system, but invertible model approximations and inaccuracies can lead to control failures. We develop a model-free and deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for quantum nonergodicity control. It is a machine-learning method with the unique focus on balancing exploration and exploitation strategies to maximize the cumulative rewards so as to preserve the initial memory in the time-dependent nonergodic metrics over a long stretch of time. We use the paradigmatic one-dimensional tilted Fermi-Hubbard system to demonstrate that the DRL agent can efficiently learn the quantum many-body system solely through the interactions with the environment. The optimal policy obtained by the DRL provides broader control scenarios for managing nonergodicity in the phase diagram as compared to, e.g., the specific protocol for Wannier-Stark localization. The continuous control protocols and observations are experimentally feasible. The model-free nature of DRL and its versatile search space for control functions render promising nonergodicity control in more complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Noise Constraints for Nonlinear Exceptional Point Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are singularities in the parameter space of a non-Hermitian system where eigenenergies and eigenstates coincide. They hold promise for enhancing sensing applications, but this is limited by the divergence of shot noise near EPs. According to recent studies, EP sensors operating in the nonlinear regime may avoid these limitations. By analyzing an exemplary nonlinear system, we show that the interplay of noise and nonlinearity introduces previously-unidentified obstacles to enhanced sensing. The noise effectively displaces the EP in parameter space and reduces its order, thereby eliminating the sought-for divergence in the signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the noise near the nonlinear EP experiences a stronger divergence than predicted by standard calculations of the Petermann noise factor, due to the properties of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian governing the fluctuations. Our semi-analytical estimates for the noise level agree quantitatively with the results of stochastic numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manipulating optical vortices at ultrafast spatiotemporal coupled domain is still a great challenge in photonics. Especially, the single- or few-cycle level short pulses carrying stable vortex topological charge, called helical pulses, have never been experimentally realized. Here, we introduce two complementary methods for experimentally generating such space-time nonseparable helical pulses (SNHPs) across optical and microwave spectral regimes. We achieve few-cycle quasi-linearly polarized SNHPs through the polarization decomposition of optical toroidal pulses. We also generated exactly single-cycle nontransverse SNHPs directly from a microwave ultrawideband spiral emitter. These approaches not only enable the experimental realization of SNHPs but also provide a platform for further investigation into their properties and applications, such as nontrivial light-matter interactions and optical communications, marking a significant step forward in the field of structured light.</description>
