      <title>A synthetic proof of the spherical and hyperbolic Pythagorean theorem on models in Euclidean and Minkowski space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are multiple generalisations of the Pythagorean theorem to spherical and hyperbolic geometry. A natural one, involving areas of disks with radii equal to the sides of a proper triangle, was discovered in the hyperbolic case by Maria Teresa Calapso and generalised to the spherical case by Paolo Maraner. All known proofs are analytic, and Maraner posed the question of whether there is a synthetic proof. In this paper, we explain the statement of the theorem in a way that is accessible to a wide audience. Next, we give an elementary geometric proof of this theorem using the sphere in Euclidean space and the hyperboloid in Minkowski space as models for spherical and hyperbolic geometry.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Bottleneck Distance for Merge Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Merge trees are a topological descriptor of a filtered space that enriches the degree zero barcode with its merge structure. The space of merge trees comes equipped with an interleaving distance $d_I$, which prompts a naive question: is the interleaving distance between two merge trees equal to the bottleneck distance between their corresponding barcodes? As the map from merge trees to barcodes is not injective, the answer as posed is no, but (as conjectured in Gasparovic et al.) we prove that it is true for the \emph{intrinsic} metrics $\widehat{d}_I$ and $\widehat{d}_B$ realized by infinitesimal path length in merge tree space. This result suggests that in some special cases the bottleneck distance (which can be computed quickly) can be substituted for the interleaving distance (in general, NP-hard).</description>

      <title>Power Laws for the Favard Length Problem in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a power law for the asymptotic decay of the Favard length of neighbourhoods of certain self-similar sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \geq 2$. These self-similar sets are generalizations of the so-called four-corner Cantor set to higher dimensions, as well as to a more general class of rational digit sets. When $d \geq 3$, our estimates are the first such non-trivial asymptotic upper bounds for the Favard length problem. The extension to a new class of digit sets (which is new even when $d = 2$, but holds for $d \geq 2$ generally) uses the work of G. Kiss, I. Laba, G. Somlai and the author on vanishing sums of roots of unity and divisibility by many cyclotomic polynomials.</description>

      <title>Milnor invariants and thickness of spherical links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ropelength of a knot or link is the minimal number of inches of 1-inch-thick rope that it takes to tie it. The relationship of this measurement to knot and link invariants has been studied by various authors. We give the first results of this type for higher-dimensional spherical links, generalizing work of the first author and Michaelides in the classical case. We find optimal asymptotic bounds on their Milnor invariants in terms of thickness, uncovering a dichotomy between a polynomial and an exponential regime. Along the way, we give a detailed treatment of these Milnor invariants and their properties using Massey products. As an application, we resolve a question of Freedman and Krushkal.</description>

      <title>Sparsity, Stress-Independence and Globally Linked Pairs in Graph Rigidity Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph is $\mathcal{R}_d$-independent (resp. $\mathcal{R}_d$-connected) if its $d$-dimensional generic rigidity matroid is free (resp. connected). A result of Maxwell from 1867 implies that every $\mathcal{R}_d$-independent graph satisfies the sparsity condition $|E(H)|\leq d|V(H)|-\binom{d+1}{2}$ for all subgraphs $H$ with at least $d+1$ vertices. Several other families of graphs $G$ arising naturally in rigidity theory, such as minimally globally $d$-rigid graphs, are known to satisfy the bound $|E(G)|\leq (d+1)|V(G)|-\binom{d+2}{2}$. We unify and extend these results by considering the family of $d$-stress-independent graphs which includes many of these families. We show that every $d$-stress-independent graph is $\mathcal{R}_{d+1}$-independent. A key ingredient in our proofs is the concept of $d$-stress-linked pairs of vertices. We derive a new sufficient condition for $d$-stress linkedness and use it to obtain a similar condition for a pair of vertices of a graph to be globally $d$-linked. This result strengthens a result of Tanigawa on globally $d$-rigid graphs. We also show that every minimally $\mathcal{R}_d$-connected graph $G$ is $\mathcal{R}_{d+1}$-independent and that the only subgraphs of $G$ that can satisfy Maxwell's criterion for $\mathcal{R}_{d+1}$-independence with equality are copies of $K_{d+2}$. Our results give affirmative answers to two conjectures in graph rigidity theory.</description>

      <title>Geodesics on Grushin spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider higher-dimensional generalizations of the $\alpha$-Grushin plane, focusing on the problem of classification of geodesics that minimize length, also known as optimal synthesis. Solving Hamilton's equations on these spaces using the calculus of generalized trigonometric functions, we obtain explicit conjugate times for geodesics starting at a Riemannian point. From symmetries in the geodesic structure, we propose a conjectured cut time, and prove that it provides an upper bound on the first conjugate time, a key step in the extended Hadamard technique. In the three-dimensional case, we combine this method with a density argument to establish the conjecture.</description>

      <title>A Brenier Theorem on $(\mathcal{P}_2 (\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d )), W_2 )$ and Applications to Adapted Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brenier's fundamental theorem characterizes optimal transport plans for measures $\mu, \nu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and quadratic distance costs in terms of gradients of convex functions. In particular it guarantees the existence of optimal transport maps for measures which are absolutely continuous wrt Lebesgue measure.
  Our goal is to provide a version of this result for measures $P,Q$ on $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and costs given by the squared Wasserstein distance $W_2^2(\mu, \nu)$. We characterize optimizers in terms of convexity of the Lions lift. This is based on an observation which seems to be of independent interest: the $c$-transform of a functional $\phi$, where $c(\mu, \nu)$ denotes maximal covariance of $\mu, \nu$ corresponds precisely to the Legendre transform of the Lions lift of $\phi$. Moreover we show that for typical $P \in\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ the optimizer is unique and given by a transport map. In the absence of a canonical reference measure on $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ we use a topological notion to make `typical' precise. Specifically we show that the transport regular measures are of second Baire category.
  A particular motivation for our article stems from the theory of adapted transport where the adapted Wasserstein distance provides an adequate distance between stochastic processes. In contrast to other metrics, the adapted Wasserstein distance yields continuity of Doob-decomposition, optimal stopping and stochastic control problems. Based on our results for measures on $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ we obtain a first Brenier-type theorem for the adapted Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <title>Geodesic complexity of the octahedron, and an algorithm for cut loci on convex polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geodesic complexity of a length space $X$ quantifies the required number of case distinctions to continuously choose a shortest path connecting any given start and end point. We prove a local lower bound for the geodesic complexity of $X$ obtained by embedding simplices into $X\times X$. We additionally create and prove correctness of an algorithm to find cut loci on surfaces of convex polyhedra, as the structure of a space's cut loci is related to its geodesic complexity. We use these techniques to prove the geodesic complexity of the octahedron is four. Our method is inspired by earlier work of Recio-Mitter and Davis, and thus recovers their results on the geodesic complexity of the $n$-torus and the tetrahedron, respectively.</description>
