      <title>Inference of germinal center evolutionary dynamics via simulation-based deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: B cells and the antibodies they produce are vital to health and survival, motivating research on the details of the mutational and evolutionary processes in the germinal centers (GC) from which mature B cells arise. It is known that B cells with higher affinity for their cognate antigen (Ag) will, on average, tend to have more offspring. However the exact form of this relationship between affinity and fecundity, which we call the ``affinity-fitness response function'', is not known. Here we use deep learning and simulation-based inference to learn this function from a unique experiment that replays a particular combination of GC conditions many times. All code is freely available at https://github.com/matsengrp/gcdyn, while datasets and inference results can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15022130.</description>

      <title>Coupling between risk and cautious behavior affect epidemic morbidity, mortality and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models for epidemic spread typically account for variable risk factors but do not account for the correlation between behavior and risk. Here we extend these models to account for such correlations. We find that a positive correlation between behavior and risk, i.e., voluntary risk aversion by individuals at high risk and risk-taking behavior by individuals at low risk, leads to a linear reduction in morbidity and mortality and load on healthcare services compared to the uncorrelated case. We show that increasing caution in response to news from countries with a preceding outbreak leads to a more graded response to a lock-down. We also show that if vaccinated individuals are less cautious an increase in herd immunity threshold ensues.</description>

      <title>Strong anomalous diffusion for free-ranging birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion and anomalous diffusion are widely observed and used to study movement across organisms, resulting in extensive use of the mean and mean-squared displacement (MSD). However, these measures - corresponding to specific displacement moments - do not capture the full complexity of movement behavior. Using high-resolution data from over 70 million localizations of young and adult free-ranging Barn Owls (\textit{Tyto alba}), we reveal strong anomalous diffusion as nonlinear growth of displacement moments. The moment spectrum function $\lambda_t(q)$ -- defined by $\left&lt;|\bm{x}(t)|^q\right&gt; \sim t^{\lambda_t(q)}$ -- displays piecewise linearity in $q$, with a critical moment marking the crossover between scaling regimes. This highlights the need of a broad spectrum of displacement moments to characterize movement, which we link to age-specific ecological drivers. Furthermore, a characteristic timescale of five minutes marks an unexpected transition from a convex to a concave $\lambda_t(q)$. Using two stochastic models - a bounded L\'evy walk and a multi-mode behavioral model - we account for the observed phenomena, showing good agreement with data, relating age-specific behavioral states to environmentally confined movement, and demonstrating how L\'evy walk-like patterns can arise from underlying behavioral structure. Finally, we discuss the ecological significance of our results, arguing that strong anomalous diffusion may be widespread in animal movement.</description>
