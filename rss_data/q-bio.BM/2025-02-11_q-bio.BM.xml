      <title>An Evaluation on the Role of Non-Coding RNA in HIV Transcription and Latency: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of latent cellular reservoirs is recognized as the major barrier to an HIV cure. Reactivating and eliminating "shock and kill" or permanently silencing "block and lock" the latent HIV reservoir, as well as gene editing, remain promising approaches, but so far have proven to be only partially successful. Moreover, using latency reversing agents or "block and lock" drugs pose additional considerations, including the ability to cause cellular toxicity, a potential lack of specificity for HIV, or low potency when each agent is used alone. RNA molecules, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are becoming increasingly recognized as important regulators of gene expression. RNA-based approaches for combatting HIV latency represent a promising strategy since both miRNAs and lncRNAs are more cell-type and tissue specific than protein coding genes. Thus, a higher specificity of targeting the latent HIV reservoir with less overall cellular toxicity can likely be achieved. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about HIV gene expression regulation by miRNAs and lncRNAs encoded in the human genome, as well as regulatory molecules encoded in the HIV genome. We discuss both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of HIV gene expression to align with the current definition of latency, and describe RNA molecules that either promote HIV latency or have anti-latency properties. Finally, we provide perspectives on using each class of RNAs as potential targets for combatting HIV latency, and describe the complexity of the interactions between different RNA molecules, their protein targets, and HIV.</description>

      <title>Predicting Molecular Ground-State Conformation via Conformation Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting molecular ground-state conformation (i.e., energy-minimized conformation) is crucial for many chemical applications such as molecular docking and property prediction. Classic energy-based simulation is time-consuming when solving this problem while existing learning-based methods have advantages in computational efficiency but sacrifice accuracy and interpretability. In this work, we propose a novel and effective method to bridge the energy-based simulation and the learning-based strategy, which designs and learns a Wasserstein gradient flow-driven SE(3)-Transformer, called WGFormer, for molecular ground-state conformation prediction. Specifically, our method tackles this task within an auto-encoding framework, which encodes low-quality conformations by the proposed WGFormer and decodes corresponding ground-state conformations by an MLP. The architecture of WGFormer corresponds to Wasserstein gradient flows -- it optimizes molecular conformations by minimizing an energy function defined on the latent mixture models of atoms, thereby significantly improving performance and interpretability. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art competitors, providing a new and insightful paradigm to predict molecular ground-state conformation.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Approaches for Anti-Addiction Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drug addiction is a complex and pervasive global challenge that continues to pose significant public health concerns. Traditional approaches to anti-addiction drug discovery have struggled to deliver effective therapeutics, facing high attrition rates, long development timelines, and inefficiencies in processing large-scale data. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative solution to address these issues. Using advanced algorithms, AI is revolutionizing drug discovery by enhancing the speed and precision of key processes. This review explores the transformative role of AI in the pipeline for anti-addiction drug discovery, including data collection, target identification, and compound optimization. By highlighting the potential of AI to overcome traditional barriers, this review systematically examines how AI addresses critical gaps in anti-addiction research, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize drug discovery and development, overcome challenges, and advance more effective therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Protein-Ligand Docking: Are We There Yet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14108v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of ligand binding on protein structures and their in vivo functions carry numerous implications for modern biomedical research and biotechnology development efforts such as drug discovery. Although several deep learning (DL) methods and benchmarks designed for protein-ligand docking have recently been introduced, to date no prior works have systematically studied the behavior of the latest docking and structure prediction methods within the broadly applicable context of (1) using predicted (apo) protein structures for docking (e.g., for applicability to new proteins); (2) binding multiple (cofactor) ligands concurrently to a given target protein (e.g., for enzyme design); and (3) having no prior knowledge of binding pockets (e.g., for generalization to unknown pockets). To enable a deeper understanding of docking methods' real-world utility, we introduce PoseBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for broadly applicable protein-ligand docking. PoseBench enables researchers to rigorously and systematically evaluate DL methods for apo-to-holo protein-ligand docking and protein-ligand structure prediction using both primary ligand and multi-ligand benchmark datasets, the latter of which we introduce for the first time to the DL community. Empirically, using PoseBench, we find that (1) DL co-folding methods generally outperform comparable conventional and DL docking baselines, yet popular methods such as AlphaFold 3 are still challenged by prediction targets with novel protein sequences; (2) certain DL co-folding methods are highly sensitive to their input multiple sequence alignments, while others are not; and (3) DL methods struggle to strike a balance between structural accuracy and chemical specificity when predicting novel or multi-ligand protein targets. Code, data, tutorials, and benchmark results are available at https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/PoseBench.</description>

      <title>New Aspects of Analyzing Amyloid Fibrils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a summary of mathematical tools we used in research of analyzing the structure of proteins with amyloid form \cite{xi2024Top}. We defined several geometry indicators on the discrete curve namely the hop distance, the discrete curvature and the discrete torsion. Then, we used these indicators to analyze the structure of amyloid fibrils by regarding its peptide chains as discrete curves in $\Rds^3$. We gave examples to show that these indicators give novel insights in the characterization analysis of the structure of amyloid fibrils, for example the discrete torsion can detect the hydrogen bonds interactions between layers of amyloid fibril. {Moreover,} the topological tool performs better than the root mean square deviation (RMSD) in quantifying the difference of the structure of amyloid fibrils, etc.</description>

      <title>Static Three-Dimensional Structures Determine Fast Dynamics Between Distal Loci Pairs in Interphase Chromosomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Live cell imaging experiments have shown that, although eukaryotic chromosomes are compact, the distal dynamics between enhancers and promoters are unexpectedly rapid and cannot be explained by standard polymer models. The discordance between the compact static chromatin organization (structure) and the relaxation times (dynamics) is a conundrum that violates the expected structure-function relationship. To resolve the puzzle, we developed a theory to predict chromatin dynamics by first calculating the accurate three-dimensional (3D) structure using static Hi-C contact maps or fixed-cell imaging data. The calculated 3D coordinates are used to accurately forecast the two-point dynamics reported in recent experiments that simultaneously monitor chromatin dynamics and transcription. Strikingly, the theory not only predicts the observed fast enhancer-promoter dynamics but also reveals a novel scaling relationship between two-point relaxation time and genomic separation that is in near quantitative agreement with recent experiments. The theory also predicts that cohesin depletion speeds up the dynamics between distal loci. Both the rapid dynamics between distal loci pairs in interphase chromosomes and the acceleration of chromatin loci diffusion upon cohesin depletion are explained in terms of structure-based centrality measure used in graph theory. Our framework shows that chromatin dynamics can be predicted based solely on static experimental data, reinforcing the concept that the three-dimensional structure determines their dynamic behavior. The generality of the theory opens new avenues for exploring chromatin dynamics, especially transcriptional dynamics, across different biological contexts.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of solution of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0408153</link>
      <description>arXiv:cond-mat/0408153v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a solution of long polyanions (PA) with shorter polycations (PC) and focus on the role of Coulomb interaction. A good example is solutions of DNA and PC which are widely studied for gene therapy. In the solution, each PA attracts many PCs to form a complex. When the ratio of total charges of PA and PC in the solution, $x$, equals to 1, complexes are neutral and they condense in a macroscopic drop. When $x$ is far away from 1, complexes are strongly charged. The Coulomb repulsion is large and free complexes are stable. As $x$ approaches to 1, PCs attached to PA disproportionate themselves in two competing ways. One way is inter-complex disproportionation, in which PCs make some complexes neutral and therefore condensed in a macroscopic drop while other complexes become even stronger charged and stay free. The other way is intra-complex disproportionation, in which PCs make one end of a complex neutral and condensed in a small droplet while the rest of the complex forms a strongly charged tail. Thus each complex becomes a "tadpole". These two ways can also combine together to give even lower free energy. We get a phase diagram of PA-PC solution in a plane of $x$ and inverse screening radius of the monovalent salt, which includes phases or phase coexistence with both kinds of disproportionation.</description>
