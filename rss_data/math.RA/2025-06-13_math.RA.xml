      <title>The probability that the product of k elements in a finite ring is zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for a fixed integer $k\ge 2$, we study the probability that the product of $k$ randomly chosen elements in a finite commutative ring $R$ is zero, which we denote by $zp_{_k}(R)$. We investigate bounds for $zp_{_k}(R)$ that turn out to be sharp bounds for certain classes of rings. Further, we determine the maximum value of $zp_{_k}(R)$ that can be obtained for any ring $R$, and classify all rings within some specific range of $zp_{_k}(R)$.</description>

      <title>Finitary conditions for graph products of monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph products of monoids provide a common framework for free products and direct products. Trace monoids are graph products of finitely generated free monoids. We investigate the interaction of certain finitary conditions with graph products. Specifically, we examine the conditions of being weakly left noetherian (that is, every left ideal is finitely generated) and weakly left coherent (that is, every finitely generated left ideal has a finite presentation) and the related conditions of the ascending chain condition on principal left ideals, being left ideal Howson, and being finitely left equated. All of these conditions, and others, are preserved under retract; as a consequence, if a graph product has such a property, then so do all the constituent monoids. We show that the converse is also true for all the conditions listed except that of being weakly left noetherian. In the latter case we precisely determine the graph products of monoids which are weakly left noetherian.</description>

      <title>On Singer's conjecture for the fourth algebraic transfer in certain generic degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the finite field $k := \mathbb Z_2$ and $G(q)$ be the general linear group of rank $q$ over $k.$ A well-known open problem in algebraic topology is the explicit determination of the cohomology groups of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}^{q, *}_A(k, k),$ for all homological degrees $q \geq 0.$ The Singer algebraic transfer of rank $q,$ formulated by William Singer in 1989, serves as a valuable method for the description of such Ext groups. This transfer maps from the coinvariants of a certain representation of $G(q)$ to ${\rm Ext}^{q, *}_A(k, k).$ Singer predicted that the algebraic transfer is always injective, but this has gone unanswered for all $q\geq 4.$ This paper establishes Singer's conjecture for rank four in the generic degrees $n = 2^{s+t+1} +2^{s+1} - 3$ whenever $t\neq 3$ and $s\geq 1,$ and $n = 2^{s+t} + 2^{s} - 2$ whenever $t\neq 2,\, 3,\, 4$ and $s\geq 1.$ In conjunction with our previous results, this completes the proof of the Singer conjecture for rank four.</description>

      <title>The embedded deformation problem for monomial ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is concerned with homological properties of local or graded rings whose defining relations are monomials on some regular sequence. The main result of the article positively answers a question of Avramov for such a ring $R$. More precisely, we establish that an embedded deformation of $R$ corresponds exactly to a degree two central element in the homotopy Lie algebra of $R$, as well as a free summand of the conormal module of $R$. A major input in the proof is an analysis of cohomological support varieties. Other main results include establishing a lower bound for the dimension of the cohomological support variety of any complex over such rings, and classifying all possible subvarieties of affine $n$-space that are the cohomological support of rings defined by $n$ monomial relations where $n$ is five or less.</description>

      <title>Presentations for small reflection equation algebras of type A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give presentations, in terms of the generators and relations, for the reflection equation algebras of type $GL_n$ and $SL_n$, i.e., the covariantized algebras of the dual Hopf algebras of the small quantum groups of $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_n$. Our presentations display these algebras as quotients of the infinite-dimensional reflection equation algebras of types $GL_n$ and $SL_n$ by identifying additional relations that correspond to twisting the nilpotency and unipotency relations of the finite-dimensional quantum function algebras. The presentations are valid for appropriately defined integral forms of these algebras.</description>

      <title>The affirmative answer to Singer's conjecture on the algebraic transfer of rank four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, the structure of the mod-2 cohomology of the Steenrod ring $\mathscr A$ has become a major subject of study in the field of Algebraic Topology. One of the earliest attempts to study this cohomology through the use of modular representations of the general linear groups was the groundbreaking work [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523] by W.M. Singer. In that work, Singer introduced a homomorphism, commonly referred to as the "algebraic transfer," which maps from the coinvariants of a certain representation of the general linear group to the mod-2 cohomology group of the ring $\mathscr A.$ Singer's conjecture, in particular, which states that the algebraic transfer is a monomorphism for all homological degrees, remains a highly significant and unresolved problem in Algebraic Topology. In this research, we take a major stride toward resolving the Singer conjecture by establishing its truth for the homological degree four.</description>
