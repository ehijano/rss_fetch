      <title>Forecasting Labor Demand: Predicting JOLT Job Openings using Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis studies the effectiveness of Long Short Term Memory model in forecasting future Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data in the United States. Drawing on multiple economic indicators from various sources, the data are fed directly into LSTM model to predict JOLT job openings in subsequent periods. The performance of the LSTM model is compared with conventional autoregressive approaches, including ARIMA, SARIMA, and Holt-Winters. Findings suggest that the LSTM model outperforms these traditional models in predicting JOLT job openings, as it not only captures the dependent variables trends but also harmonized with key economic factors. These results highlight the potential of deep learning techniques in capturing complex temporal dependencies in economic data, offering valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in developing data-driven labor market strategies</description>

      <title>Empirical Bayes shrinkage (mostly) does not correct the measurement error in regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the value-added literature, it is often claimed that regressing on empirical Bayes shrinkage estimates corrects for the measurement error problem in linear regression. We clarify the conditions needed; we argue that these conditions are stronger than the those needed for classical measurement error correction, which we advocate for instead. Moreover, we show that the classical estimator cannot be improved without stronger assumptions. We extend these results to regressions on nonlinear transformations of the latent attribute and find generically slow minimax estimation rates.</description>

      <title>Automatic Inference for Value-Added Regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is common to use shrinkage methods such as empirical Bayes to improve estimates of teacher value-added. However, when the goal is to perform inference on coefficients in the regression of long-term outcomes on value-added, it's unclear whether shrinking the value-added estimators can help or hurt. In this paper, we consider a general class of value-added estimators and the properties of their corresponding regression coefficients. Our main finding is that regressing long-term outcomes on shrinkage estimates of value-added performs an automatic bias correction: the associated regression estimator is asymptotically unbiased, asymptotically normal, and efficient in the sense that it is asymptotically equivalent to regressing on the true (latent) value-added. Further, OLS standard errors from regressing on shrinkage estimates are consistent. As such, efficient inference is easy for practitioners to implement: simply regress outcomes on shrinkage estimates of value added.</description>

      <title>Identification of Average Treatment Effects in Nonparametric Panel Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies identification of average treatment effects in a panel data setting. It introduces a novel nonparametric factor model and proves identification of average treatment effects. The identification proof is based on the introduction of a consistent estimator. Underlying the proof is a result that there is a consistent estimator for the expected outcome in the absence of the treatment for each unit and time period; this result can be applied more broadly, for example in problems of decompositions of group-level differences in outcomes, such as the much-studied gender wage gap.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Outlier Detection for Matrix-variate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayes Factor (BF) is one of the tools used in Bayesian analysis for model selection. The predictive BF finds application in detecting outliers, which are relevant sources of estimation and forecast errors. An efficient framework for outlier detection is provided and purposely designed for large multidimensional datasets. Online detection and analytical tractability guarantee the procedure's efficiency. The proposed sequential Bayesian monitoring extends the univariate setup to a matrix--variate one. Prior perturbation based on power discounting is applied to obtain tractable predictive BFs. This way, computationally intensive procedures used in Bayesian Analysis are not required. The conditions leading to inconclusive responses in outlier identification are derived, and some robust approaches are proposed that exploit the predictive BF's variability to improve the standard discounting method. The effectiveness of the procedure is studied using simulated data. An illustration is provided through applications to relevant benchmark datasets from macroeconomics and finance.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Internal Validity of Weighted Estimands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study a class of weighted estimands, which we define as parameters that can be expressed as weighted averages of the underlying heterogeneous treatment effects. The popular ordinary least squares (OLS), two-stage least squares (2SLS), and two-way fixed effects (TWFE) estimands are all special cases within our framework. Our focus is on answering two questions concerning weighted estimands. First, under what conditions can they be interpreted as the average treatment effect for some (possibly latent) subpopulation? Second, when these conditions are satisfied, what is the upper bound on the size of that subpopulation, either in absolute terms or relative to a target population of interest? We argue that this upper bound provides a valuable diagnostic for empirical research. When a given weighted estimand corresponds to the average treatment effect for a small subset of the population of interest, we say its internal validity is low. Our paper develops practical tools to quantify the internal validity of weighted estimands.</description>

      <title>Generalization Issues in Conjoint Experiment: Attention and Salience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can the causal effects estimated in an experiment be generalized to real-world scenarios? This question lies at the heart of social science studies. External validity primarily assesses whether experimental effects persist across different settings, implicitly presuming the consistency of experimental effects with their real-life counterparts. However, we argue that this presumed consistency may not always hold, especially in experiments involving multi-dimensional decision processes, such as conjoint experiments. We introduce a formal model to elucidate how attention and salience effects lead to three types of inconsistencies between experimental findings and real-world phenomena: amplified effect magnitude, effect sign reversal, and effect importance reversal. We derive testable hypotheses from each theoretical outcome and test these hypotheses using data from various existing conjoint experiments and our own experiments. Drawing on our theoretical framework, we propose several recommendations for experimental design aimed at enhancing the generalizability of survey experiment findings.</description>

      <title>Causal Panel Analysis under Parallel Trends: Lessons from A Large Reanalysis Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15983v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-way fixed effects (TWFE) models are widely used in political science to establish causality, but recent methodological discussions highlight their limitations under heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) and violations of the parallel trends (PT) assumption. This growing literature has introduced numerous new estimators and procedures, causing confusion among researchers about the reliability of existing results and best practices. To address these concerns, we replicated and reanalyzed 49 studies from leading journals using TWFE models for observational panel data with binary treatments. Using six HTE-robust estimators, diagnostic tests, and sensitivity analyses, we find: (i) HTE-robust estimators yield qualitatively similar but highly variable results; (ii) while a few studies show clear signs of PT violations, many lack evidence to support this assumption; and (iii) many studies are underpowered when accounting for HTE and potential PT violations. We emphasize the importance of strong research designs and rigorous validation of key identifying assumptions.</description>
