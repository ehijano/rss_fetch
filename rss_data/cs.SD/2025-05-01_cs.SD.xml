      <title>Bridging Cultural and Digital Divides: A Low-Latency JackTrip Framework for Equitable Music Education in the Global South</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of digital technologies has transformed educational landscapes worldwide, yet significant infrastructural and cultural challenges persist in the Global South. This paper introduces a low-latency JackTrip framework designed to bridge both the cultural and digital divides in music education. By leveraging an open-source, UDP-based audio streaming protocol originally developed at Stanford's CCRMA, the framework is tailored to address technical constraints such as intermittent connectivity, limited bandwidth, and high latency that characterize many rural and underserved regions. The study systematically compares the performance of JackTrip with conventional platforms like Zoom, demonstrating that JackTrip achieves sub-30~ms latency under simulated low-resource conditions while preserving the intricate audio details essential for non-Western musical traditions. Spectral analysis confirms that JackTrip's superior handling of microtonal scales, complex rhythms, and harmonic textures provides a culturally authentic medium for real-time ensemble performance and music education. These findings underscore the transformative potential of decentralized, edge-computing solutions in empowering educators and musicians across the Global South, promoting both technological equity and cultural preservation.</description>

      <title>Voice Cloning: Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voice Cloning has rapidly advanced in today's digital world, with many researchers and corporations working to improve these algorithms for various applications. This article aims to establish a standardized terminology for voice cloning and explore its different variations. It will cover speaker adaptation as the fundamental concept and then delve deeper into topics such as few-shot, zero-shot, and multilingual TTS within that context. Finally, we will explore the evaluation metrics commonly used in voice cloning research and related datasets. This survey compiles the available voice cloning algorithms to encourage research toward its generation and detection to limit its misuse.</description>

      <title>BERSting at the Screams: A Benchmark for Distanced, Emotional and Shouted Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some speech recognition tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), are approaching or have reached human performance in many reported metrics. Yet, they continue to struggle in complex, real-world, situations, such as with distanced speech. Previous challenges have released datasets to address the issue of distanced ASR, however, the focus remains primarily on distance, specifically relying on multi-microphone array systems. Here we present the B(asic) E(motion) R(andom phrase) S(hou)t(s) (BERSt) dataset. The dataset contains almost 4 hours of English speech from 98 actors with varying regional and non-native accents. The data was collected on smartphones in the actors homes and therefore includes at least 98 different acoustic environments. The data also includes 7 different emotion prompts and both shouted and spoken utterances. The smartphones were places in 19 different positions, including obstructions and being in a different room than the actor. This data is publicly available for use and can be used to evaluate a variety of speech recognition tasks, including: ASR, shout detection, and speech emotion recognition (SER). We provide initial benchmarks for ASR and SER tasks, and find that ASR degrades both with an increase in distance and shout level and shows varied performance depending on the intended emotion. Our results show that the BERSt dataset is challenging for both ASR and SER tasks and continued work is needed to improve the robustness of such systems for more accurate real-world use.</description>
