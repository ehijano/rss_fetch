      <title>Complexity-energy trade-off in programmable unitary interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent multiport interferometers are a promising approach to realize matrix multiplication in integrated photonics. However, most known architectures - such as MZI and beamsplitter meshes, as well as more general interferometers - suffer from complicated procedures for mapping the matrix elements of the desired transformation to specific phaseshifts in the device. We point out that the high programming complexity is intrinsic, rather than accidental. At the same time, we argue that interferometers admitting efficient programming algorithms in general yield a much lower useful output energy, which ultimately limits their accuracy and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Planar Waveguide Circulating Gaussian Beam Resonators on a Silicon Photonic Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Si slab waveguide resonator design with a circulating Gaussian-like cavity mode is described and characterized, for both all-pass and add-drop configurations and several different input/output coupling strengths. The circulating beam propagates in a slab waveguide with no lateral confinement. Three straight mirrors and one curved mirror define a folded two-dimensional Gaussian cavity. Light is coupled to and from the resonator by beam splitters formed by a narrow gap between a cavity mirror and the input slab waveguides. The coupling is determined by the gap width and is wavelength independent and lossless. For a L=100 um path length cavity, resonance line widths of 5 pm with Q-values of Q = 310000 were measured. The resonator drop spectrum exhibited a comb of almost identical resonance lines across a 100 nm tuning range. This resonator design is capable of broadband operation and is less susceptible to sidewall roughness and defect scattering induced loss and mode splitting, when compared with Si rings formed from narrow single mode waveguides.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Plasmon dispersion and Optical Conductivity of Holey Graphene: signatures of flat-bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holey graphene (HG) is a novel two-dimensional (2D) material that has attracted considerable attention due to its remarkable electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. The recent discovery of flat bands in HG has garnered significant interest. In this work, we systematically investigate the tunable plasmonic modes and optical conductivity of HG at or near the flat band condition by changing the holes radii and periodic configuration. It is found that HG presents nearly flat plasmonic bands in configurations with larger hole radii. Hyperbolic plasmons are found due to the breaking of the graphene's bipartite sublattice symmetry induced by the holes. Such an effect is also confirmed by looking at the optical conductivity, that also presents a marked anisotropy. The material's marked optical anisotropy leads to hyperbolic plasmons, making it a promising platform for nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed PointNets for Modeling Electromagnetic Scattering from All-Dielectric Metasurfaces with Inclined Nanopillars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are innovative planar optical structures capable of manipulating incident light properties. Accurate and computationally efficient modeling of such metasurfaces, particularly those with irregular geometries, remains a challenge for conventional solvers. In this work, we present a mesh-free Physics-Informed PointNet (PIPN) to model electromagnetic scattering from all-dielectric metasurfaces that feature spatially varying nanopillars. Our approach uses the PointNet architecture to directly encode spatially varying material properties into the Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) framework. We demonstrate the generalization capability of our PIPN through evaluations on datasets; these datasets are generated with varying refractive indices representing common dielectric materials. Furthermore, the inclination angles are varied within each dataset, which represent expected manufacturing defects. Overall, our method provides a promising, mesh-free framework for accurate and efficient modeling of complex optical structures represented by irregular geometries.</description>

      <title>Ray-tracing image simulations of transparent objects with complex shape and inhomogeneous refractive index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical images of transparent three-dimensional objects can be different from a replica of the object's cross section in the image plane, due to refraction at the surface or in the body of the object. Simulations of the object's image are thus needed for the visualization and validation of physical models, but previous image simulations for fluid dynamics showed significant differences from experiments. We report ray tracing image simulations that replicate with high fidelity brightfield microscopy images of drops with complex shapes, and images of pressure and shock waves traveling inside them. For high fidelity, the simulations must replicate the spatial and angular distribution of illumination rays, and both the experiment and the simulation must be designed for accurate optical modeling. These techniques are directly applicable to optical microscopy and expand the type and the accuracy of three-dimensional information that can be extracted from optical images.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limitations of Absolute Ranging via Deep Frequency Modulation Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision absolute length metrology using laser interferometry faces inherent challenges from interferometric ambiguity. Deep Frequency Modulation Interferometry (DFMI) addresses this by simultaneously extracting two distinct length-encoding parameters: the precise, ambiguous interferometric phase ($\Phi$) and the coarser, unambiguous effective modulation depth ($m$). This paper establishes the fundamental statistical and systematic limitations governing the absolute accuracy of DFMI. We detail two primary readout algorithms: a frequency-domain Non-Linear Least Squares (NLS) fit and a time-domain Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). We derive the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the estimation of $m$ and $\Phi$, identifying intrinsic ``dead zones'' where precision degrades, and asymptotic limits as a function of signal quality and integration time, achievable by both NLS and EKF. Critically, we develop analytical models for dominant systematic biases, revealing previously uncharted ``valleys of robustness'' -- specific operating points where errors from modulation non-linearity and residual amplitude modulation are strongly suppressed. This analysis clarifies critical trade-offs between different design parameters, integration time, and total error, informing instrument design and underscoring the necessity of advanced compensation techniques for high-accuracy applications.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated Monte Carlo Simulation and Experimental Study of Radiative Transfer in Multiple Scattering Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing the problem of photon multiple scattering interference caused by turbid media in optical measurements, biomedical imaging, environmental monitoring and other fields, existing Monte Carlo light scattering simulations widely adopt the Henyey-Greenstein (H-G) phase function approximation model. However, traditional computational resource limitations and high numerical complexity have constrained the application of precise scattering models. Moreover, the single-parameter anisotropy factor assumption neglects higher-order scattering effects and backscattering intensity, failing to accurately characterize the multi-order scattering properties of complex media. To address these issues, we propose a GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo-Rigorous Mie scattering transport model for complex scattering environments. The model employs rigorous Mie scattering theory to replace the H-G approximation, achieving efficient parallel processing of phase function sampling and complex scattering processes through pre-computed cumulative distribution function optimization and deep integration with CUDA parallel architecture. To validate the model accuracy, a standard scattering experimental platform based on 5{\mu}m polystyrene microspheres was established, with multiple optical depth experimental conditions designed, and spatial registration techniques employed to achieve precise alignment between simulation and experimental images. The research results quantitatively demonstrate the systematic accuracy advantages of rigorous Mie scattering phase functions over H-G approximation in simulating lateral scattering light intensity distributions, providing reliable theoretical foundations and technical support for high-precision optical applications in complex scattering environments.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Light Coupling Control in Ultrathin Photonic Nanomembranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic layer materials have emerged as essential building blocks for next generation quantum and semiconductor technologies, where atomic scale control over light matter interactions is critical. However, their inherently small optical interaction volume poses fundamental challenges for efficient integration into quantum and nanophotonic devices. Addressing this limitation requires the development of photonic platforms that can effectively enhance atomic-scale optical coupling. To this end, air suspended nanomembranes with extreme thinness and minimal radiative loss offer an ideal framework for integrating atomic layer materials into photonic systems. Here, we demonstrate an ultrathin freestanding photonic nanomembrane with a thickness down to 29 nm comparable to that of atomic layer materials enabling atomic scale control of light coupling. This architecture supports strong field confinement at the surface and significantly enhances light matter interaction. Through the integration of atomic layer material, we achieve angstrom level thickness modulation, where a single atomic-layer-deposition cycle corresponding to a thickness increment of 0.65 angstrom results in a 0.09 nm shift in the high Q resonance. High-resolution spatial mapping further confirms uniform and deterministic resonance tuning across the nanomembrane surface. This approach provides a scalable and versatile route for atomic-scale light coupling, effectively overcoming the limitations of conventional photonics and enabling progress in quantum photonics, 2D optoelectronics, and advanced semiconductor technologies.</description>

      <title>Conical diffraction of the synchrotron beam to probe the efficiency and morphology of blazed gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the use of synchrotron measurements as a nanometrology tool for blazed gratings. In grazing incidence geometry, one can measure both the conical diffraction and the diffuse scattering on the grating simultaneously in a single scattering pattern. The sensitivity of scattering patterns to the structure of the blazed gratings is evaluated. The diffraction component of the pattern is shown to be sensitive to the average groove profile of the gratings. Meanwhile, the diffuse scattering depends on the roughness morphology of the reflective surface of blazed gratings. These findings are supported by numerical simulations. The simulations were performed using several rigorous solvers for the Helmholtz equations, and with a perturbation theory. The analysis relies on synchrotron data, as well as data from atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The aim of this article is to draw the attention of the optical community to the synchrotron measurements as a nanometrology tool for the modern optical elements.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear synchronization through vector subharmonic entrainment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization is ubiquitous across a wide range of fields. Subharmonic entrainment (SHE) is a nonlinear synchronization phenomenon that results in a locking oscillator at a frequency of an external periodic forcing signal with a fraction of the oscillator frequency. Beyond the fundamentals of nonlinear dynamics, SHE has a range of practical applications from stabilizing ultrafast laser pulses to optimizing control in various engineering and natural systems. However, the vectorial nature of SHE remains elusive. Here, we present the results of a theoretical and experimental study of a vector type of subharmonic entrainment (VSHE) using a passively mode-locked fiber laser as a testbed. We unveil the mechanism of vectorial SHE, in which weak external signals can entrain internal laser dynamics through vectorial coupling. Vectorial SHE presents in the form of synchronization between the subharmonic of mode-locking-driven oscillations and continuous wave (CW) signal through an evolving state of polarization. This CW signal, driven by the internal dynamics of the injected signal, causes VSHE with the frequencies ratios of multiples of ten, resulting in a partially mode-locking regime operation. Our findings offer new control techniques over mode-locking and additional dimension such as polarization states.</description>

      <title>Clock Pulling Enables Maximum-Efficiency Wireless Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear parity-time (PT) symmetry in non-Hermitian wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, while attracting significant attention from both physics and engineering communities, have posed formidable theoretical and practical challenges due to their complex dynamical mechanisms. Here, we revisit multistability in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems and find that the PT-symmetry state is not always stable even in PT-symmetry phase. We report a discovery on a nonlinear clock-pulling mechanism, which can forcibly break the PT symmetry. Proper implementation of this mechanism can switch the system stability, particularly in stabilizing the conventional unstable state which has the maximum transfer efficiency for WPT. Our work offers new tools for non-Hermitian physics and is expected to drive technological progress.</description>

      <title>Improved Simulation of Asynchronous Entanglement Distribution in Noisy Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a lightweight simulation framework for evaluating asynchronous entanglement distribution protocols under realistic error models. We focus on two contemporary protocols: sequential, where entanglement is established one node at a time, and parallel, where all nodes attempt to generate entanglement simultaneously. We evaluate the performance of each protocol using two key metrics: the fidelity of distributed entangled states, and the hashing rate, a measure of entanglement efficiency. These metrics are compared between both protocols across a range of network sizes and noise parameters. We demonstrate that the parallel protocol consistently outperforms the sequential, particularly in the hashing rate metric due to reduced runtime, suggesting that parallel protocols are a strong candidate for a realizable quantum Internet. Our framework offers an accessible and scalable tool for evaluating entanglement distribution strategies, by reducing the simulation of complex quantum processes to simple memory time calculations.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Nonlinear Optical Polarimetry with High Spatial Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical microscopy such as in the optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) modality has become a popular tool today for probing materials in the physical and biological sciences. While imaging and spectroscopy are widely used in the microscopy mode, nonlinear polarimetry, which can shed light on materials' symmetry and microstructure, is relatively underdeveloped. This is partly because quantitative analytical modeling of the optical SHG response for anisotropic crystals and films largely assumes low-numerical aperture (NA) focusing of light, where the plane-wave approximation is sufficient. Tight focusing provides unique benefits in revealing out-of-plane polarization responses, which cannot be detected by near-plane-wave illumination at normal incidence. Here, we outline a method for quantitatively analyzing SHG polarimetry measurements obtained under high-NA focusing within a microscope geometry. Experiments and simulations of a variety of standard samples, from single crystals to thin films, are in good agreement, including measured and simulated spatial SHG maps of ferroelectric domains. A solution to the inverse problem is demonstrated, where the spatial distribution of an SHG tensor with unknown tensor coefficient magnitudes is determined by experimentally measured polarimetry. The ability to extract the out-of-plane component of the nonlinear polarization in normal incidence is demonstrated, which can be valuable for high-resolution polarimetry of 2D materials, thin films, heterostructures, and uniaxial crystals with a strong out-of-plane response.

Abstract: Reciprocity, the principle that a system response is identical in the forward path compared to the backward path, is a fundamental concept across physics, from electrical circuits and optics to acoustics and heat conduction. Nonreciprocity arises when this symmetry is broken, enabling directional-dependent behavior. In photonics, nonreciprocity allows control over the propagation of electromagnetic waves, essential for isolators and circulators. But achieving optical nonreciprocity typically requires complex metamaterials, exotic media, or strong external fields. Because of this, researchers have historically overlooked the possibility that readily available materials could support nonreciprocal optical behavior, assuming that conventional systems lack the ability to produce nonreciprocal behavior. In this work, we challenge that assumption by revisiting the light-matter interactions of chiroptic and linearly anisotropic media. Through Stokes-Mueller formalism we derive a simple analytical expression that predicts a pathway to nonreciprocal absorption and emission of orthogonal linear polarizations. We test this idea experimentally using solution-processed films of CdS, CdSe, and CdTe magic-size clusters that possess commensurate circular dichroism (CD) and linear dichroism (LD)values and find that they can support this effect, engineering films that exhibit nonreciprocal absorption and emission of linearly polarized light. Based on the derived expressions and experiments, several design rules are presented. Our findings reveal that nonreciprocal linear dichroism and emission can be achieved in readily processable, macroscopically symmetric materials by harnessing chiral-linear optical interference. This work opens new opportunities for scalable, polarization-based photonic control for direction-dependent optical routing, optical logic, and polarization-multiplexed information encoding.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase in anisotropic Kepler problem: Perspective for realization in Rydberg atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict a gyroscopic effect that can be demonstrated with Rydberg atoms following the dynamics of a Kepler Hamiltonian with an additional uniaxial anisotropy induced by optical ponderomotive force. This effect is analogous to the rotation of the Foucault pendulum in response to the Earth's rotation. We argue that in Rydberg states a similar geometric angle can be generated by mechanical rotations of an atomic-optical setup on time scales between $1~\mu$s and $1~$ms.</description>

      <title>Theory of dispersive shock waves induced by the Raman effect in optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of dispersive shock waves in optical fibers for the case of long-distance propagation of optical pulses, when the small Raman effect stabilizes the profile of the shock. The Whitham modulation equations are derived as the basis for the Gurevich-Pitaevskii approach to the analytical theory of such shocks. We show that the wave variables at both sides of the shock are related by the analogue of the Rankine-Hugoniot condition that follows from the conservation laws of the Whitham equations. Solutions of the Whitham equations yield the profiles of the wave variables that agree very well with the exact numerical solution of the generalized nonlinear Schroedinger equation for propagation of optical pulses.</description>

      <title>Transport-Induced Decoherence of the Entangled Triplet Exciton Pair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoherence effects for entangled triplet pairs in organic molecular crystals are analyzed for the case when excitons can hop between inequivalent lattice sites. The fluorescence quantum beats caused by quantum interference upon triplet-triplet recombination into an emissive singlet state are predicted as a function of hopping time and magnetic field based on a Monte Carlo analysis. Depending on exciton hopping rates, it is possible to have complete global decoherence and suppression of fluorescence quantum beats in the limit of zero magnetic field, and to have quantum beats that decay at different rates depending on magnetic field strength.</description>

Abstract: While thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) is known for efficient signal generation, on-chip signal amplification remains challenging from fully integrated optical communication circuits. Here we demonstrate the continuous-wave-pump optical parametric amplification (OPA) using an x-cut domain-engineered TFLN waveguide, with high gain over the telecom band up to 13.9 dB, and test it for high signal-to-noise ratio signal amplification using a commercial optical communication module pair. Fabricated in wafer scale using common process as devices including modulators, this OPA device marks an important step in TFLN photonic integration.</description>

      <title>Vectorial Symmetry Decoding with Single-Particle Precision via Room-Temperature Lanthanide Luminescence Polarimetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the local symmetry of luminescent centers in crystals is critical for understanding and controlling their optical transitions, yet current methods are limited by stringent experimental requirements and ambiguous symmetry assignments. Here, we develop a robust computational electromagnetics framework that directly connect the local symmetry and chirality of rare-earth-doped single crystals to the polarization states of their emitted light. This framework is experimentally validated through the precise determination of point and space group symmetries using high-resolution, polarization-resolved micro-photoluminescence ({\mu}-PL) spectra. Unlike conventional approaches that usually rely on analyzing multiple transitions at cryogenic temperatures, our technique operates at room temperature, requires only a single optical transition, and enables accurate orientation of symmetry axes. This enables deterministic polarization control of nano-emitters by tailoring symmetry groups and selecting appropriate transition dipoles, eliminating the need for bulky or complex photonic structures. Additionally, we demonstrate the function of bio-sensing, via determining single particle orientations in complex cellular environments using minimal polarization measurements. These results pave the way for advances in energy transfer systems, ultra-bright rare-earth nanocrystals, nanophotonic materials, and real-time single-particle tracking in biological contexts.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Nanoparticle-in-nanoslit Antenna as Independently Tunable Dual-Resonant Systems for Efficient Frequency Upconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual-band plasmonic nanoantennas, exhibiting two widely separated user-defined resonances, are fundamental building blocks for the investigation and optimization of plasmon-enhanced optical phenomena, including photoluminescence, Raman scattering, and various nonlinear effects such as harmonic generation or sum-frequency generation, parametric down-conversion, etc. The nanoparticle-on-slit (NPoS) or nanoparticle-in-groove (NPiG) is a recently proposed dual-band antenna with independently tunable resonances at mid-infrared and visible wavelengths. It was used to enhance the corresponding sum- and difference-frequency generation processes from optimally located molecules by an estimated $10^{13}$-fold. However, the theoretical understanding of such structures and their eigenmodes remains poor, hindering further optimization and limiting broader applications. Here, we explore a diverse range of nanocavity-like quasi-normal modes (QNMs) supported by NPoS structures, examining the contributions of both their near-field (i.e., giant photonic density of states) and far-field (i.e., spatial radiation patterns) characteristics to frequency upconversion. We identify methods for independently tuning the visible and mid-infrared resonances while conserving a good mode overlap in the near field, which is essential for efficient nonlinear processes. Moreover, through mode analysis, we unveil an experimentally unexplored fundamental resonance with greater field enhancement and much-improved mode overlap with the mid-infrared field, which could, in principle, further boost the mid-infrared upconversion efficiency by 5-fold compared to existing results. This work helps to rationalize and optimize the enhancement of nonlinear effects across a wide spectral range using a flexible and experimentally attractive nanoplasmonic platform.</description>

      <title>Doppler Pulse Amplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to amplify ultrashort pulses has revolutionized modern laser science, driving advances in various fields such as ultrafast optics and spectroscopy. A pivotal development in this field is chirped pulse amplification (CPA), which stretches, amplifies and recompresses ultrashort optical pulses using dispersive elements to overcome amplification limits. However, CPA faces limitations due to gain narrowing, restricting the final pulse duration. Here, we propose Doppler pulse amplification (DoPA), a novel approach for amplifying ultrashort pulses. While DoPA shares similarities with CPA in that it also stretches, amplifies and recompresses pulses, it differs in how it achieves this temporal compansion. Unlike CPA, DoPA exploits Doppler shifts induced by space-time modulated interfaces through a space-time wedge implementation without chirping. We show that DoPA dynamically shifts the pulse spectrum, effectively mitigating the gain narrowing issue of CPA. Additionally, we show that DoPA enables more compact amplification systems via a space-time Fresnel implementation. This approach may pave the way for more efficient, high-intensity laser systems and expand the potential for applications in both laboratory research and practical environments.</description>

      <title>Overprinting with Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (TVAM) is a light-based 3D printing technique capable of producing centimeter-scale objects within seconds. A key challenge lies in the calculation of projection patterns under non-standard conditions, such as the presence of occlusions and materials with diverse optical properties, including varying refractive indices or scattering surfaces. This work focuses on demonstrating a wide variety of overprinting scenarios. First, utilizing a telecentric laser-based TVAM (LaserTVAM), we demonstrate the printing of a microfluidic perfusion system with biocompatible resins on existing nozzles for potential biomedical applications. In a subsequent demonstration, embedded spheres within the bio-resins are localized inside this perfusion system, optimized into specific patterns, and successfully connected to the nozzles via printed channels in less than three minutes. As a final LaserTVAM example, we print gears on a glossy metal rod, taking into account the scattered rays from the rod's surface. Using a non-telecentric LED-based TVAM (LEDTVAM), we then overprint engravings onto an existing LED placed in the resin. With an additional printed lens on this LED, we can project those engravings onto a screen. In a similar application with the same setup, we print microlenses on a glass tube filled with water, allowing us to image samples embedded within the glass tubes. Based on a differentiable physically-based ray optical approach, we are able to optimize all these scenarios within our existing open-source framework called Dr.TVAM. This framework enables the optimization of high-quality projections for both LaserTVAM and LEDTVAM setups within minutes, as well as lower-quality projections within seconds, outperforming existing solutions in terms of speed, flexibility, and quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaging through scattering media via speckle correlation is fundamentally challenged by ill-posed reconstruction. To overcome this, we bypass direct object recovery and instead target the system's deterministic optical transfer function (OTF). We introduce NeOTF, a framework that learns an implicit neural representation of the OTF. By optimizing this representation using multi-frame speckle intensities and a physical Fourier-domain prior, NeOTF robustly retrieves the system's OTF. Subsequent deconvolution with this retrieved OTF yields high-fidelity object reconstructions. Both simulations and experiments demonstrate that NeOTF achieves superior accuracy and efficiency over conventional methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time scattering imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this theoretical work, we propose an all-optical method for fast, precise manipulation of two-dimensional multilayers by transferring orbital angular momentum from phase-structured light (e.g. vortex beams) to a 2D material flake. We model the light-matter interaction, analyze the twist dynamics, and develop a phase diagram for optical twists by mapping the system onto an impulsively forced nonlinear pendulum. Our findings reveal rich dynamical responses spanning single- and multi-pulse twist angle control to (quasi)stable dynamical trajectories, and suggest a pathway for all-optical measurement of the twist potential energy. Aided by classical potential estimates for the interlayer energy and numerical simulation, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with hexagonal boron nitride bilayers and extend the results to dichalcogenides with first-principles calculations. These results can be generalized to other 2D multilayers, paving the way for scalable and customizable moir\'e electronics and photonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), which eliminates all the attacks from the eavesdropper to the measurement party, has been one of the most promising technology for the implementation of end-to-end quantum networks. In practice, the asymmetry of both sources and channels is generally inevitable. Therefore, we propose a theory to analyze the performance when any two MDI users in networks communicates using asymmetric sources in distinct single or multiple temporal modes. As a specific application, we model to obtain the key rate of MDI-QKD with weak coherent pulse source and spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, and compare the performance to the cases with symmetric (i.e. identical) sources. The result demonstrates that the actual performance does not degrade due to the asymmetry of sources. In contrary, it maintains at a good level over the entire distance we study. This work provides a theoretical basis for analyzing and optimizing MDI-QKD networks with asymmetric sources, and thus paving the way for the practical deployment of completely asymmetric MDI-QKD networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we present an approach to the problem of superradiance in dense atomic samples, when dipolar interactions arise between atoms. Our treatment consists of the sequential use of the Holstein-Primakoff and mean-field approximations, from which we derive master equations for the strong and weak couplings of the sample with the reservoir. We find, in both cases, that the radiation emission presents remarkable features, with characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance. In particular, for strong sample-reservoir coupling, a whole comb of superpulses occurs within an envelope with the above-mentioned characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance.</description>

      <title>SinBasis Networks: Matrix-Equivalent Feature Extraction for Wave-Like Optical Spectrograms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave-like images-from attosecond streaking spectrograms to optical spectra, audio mel-spectrograms and periodic video frames-encode critical harmonic structures that elude conventional feature extractors. We propose a unified, matrix-equivalent framework that reinterprets convolution and attention as linear transforms on flattened inputs, revealing filter weights as basis vectors spanning latent feature subspaces. To infuse spectral priors we apply elementwise $\sin(\cdot)$ mappings to each weight matrix. Embedding these transforms into CNN, ViT and Capsule architectures yields Sin-Basis Networks with heightened sensitivity to periodic motifs and built-in invariance to spatial shifts. Experiments on a diverse collection of wave-like image datasets-including 80,000 synthetic attosecond streaking spectrograms, thousands of Raman, photoluminescence and FTIR spectra, mel-spectrograms from AudioSet and cycle-pattern frames from Kinetics-demonstrate substantial gains in reconstruction accuracy, translational robustness and zero-shot cross-domain transfer. Theoretical analysis via matrix isomorphism and Mercer-kernel truncation quantifies how sinusoidal reparametrization enriches expressivity while preserving stability in data-scarce regimes. Sin-Basis Networks thus offer a lightweight, physics-informed approach to deep learning across all wave-form imaging modalities.</description>

Abstract: We present a theoretical study demonstrating enhanced tunability of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) using a strongly interacting Rydberg atomic medium under electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) conditions. In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on static refractiveindex profiles or metamaterials, here the PSHE is controlled via a nonlocal third-order nonlinear susceptibility arising from long range Rydberg-Rydberg interactions. We show that this nonlocal nonlinearity enables dynamic modulation of spin-dependent light trajectories, amplifying the normally weak PSHE into a readily observable and adjustable effect. These results pave the way for new capabilities in photonic information processing and sensing. In particular, an adjustable PSHE may enable beam steering based on photon spin, improve the sensitivity of precision measurements, and support photonic devices whose functionality can be reconfigured in real time.</description>

      <title>Novel techniques of imaging interferometry analysis to study gas and plasma density for laser-plasma experiments</title>

Abstract: Laser-plasma based experiments are always more demanding about the plasma features which need to be generated during the interaction. This is valid for laser-plasma acceleration as well as for inertial confinement fusion experiments. Most of these experiments are moving toward high repetition rate operation regimes, making even more demanding the requests on the plasma sources and the diagnostics to be implemented.\\ Interferometry is one of the most used methods to characterize these sources, since it allows for non-perturbative, single-shot measurements either of the neutral gas or the plasma density. The design of the interferometric setup is non-trivial and needs to be shaped on the actual conditions of the experiment. Similarly, the analysis of the raw data is a complex task, prone to many sources of error and dependent on the manual inputs.\\ In this work, we will present the techniques we are developing for the analysis of the interferograms to measure both the gas and plasma density. We will show the methods, the progress and the problems we encountered in the development of novel routines of analysis based on machine learning. The architectures and the methods to obtain data used for training and testing them will be introduced. The study is ongoing and preliminary results with synthetic data will be presented. The goal is to set up a fast and operator independent diagnostic for the feedback of plasma sources toward high repetition rate experiments.</description>

      <title>Polarized Houston State Framework for Nonequilibrium Driven Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20160</link>

Abstract: We introduce a new theoretical framework -- the polarized Houston basis -- to model nonequilibrium dynamics in driven open quantum systems, formulated for use within the quantum master equation. This basis extends conventional Houston states by incorporating field-induced polarization effects, enabling a more accurate description of excitation dynamics under external driving. Using a one-dimensional dimer-chain model, we examine band population dynamics through projections onto polarized Houston states, original Houston states, and naive Bloch states. We find that the polarized Houston basis significantly suppresses spurious Bloch-state excitations and virtual transitions present in standard Houston approaches, allowing for a cleaner extraction of real excitations. When implemented in the relaxation time approximation of the quantum master equation, this formalism also yields a substantial reduction of unphysical DC currents in insulating systems. Our results highlight the polarized Houston basis as a powerful tool for simulating nonequilibrium phenomena in light-driven open quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Dissipation in the Broadband and Ultrastrong Coupling Regimes of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics: An Ab Initio Quantized Quasinormal Mode Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21408</link>

Abstract: Phenomenological approaches to photon loss have long been the workhorse of cavity-QED, but prove inadequate in the presence of sufficiently broadband light-matter interactions. We present a rigorous and ab initio derivation of a quantum master equation for a quantized optical cavity mode coupled to a dipole, using a quasinormal mode (QNM) quantization procedure for plasmonic and dielectric open-system cavity-QED, which is valid in broadband light-matter interaction regimes, including ultrastrong coupling (USC). The theory supports general three-dimensional resonators with arbitrary dispersion and loss, and thus can be applied to a wide range of open cavities. Our ab initio and gauge-invariant approach fully recovers the recent result of Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 123601 (2025) for the spectral density of a quantized cavity with a single dipole, exhibits a dissipative classical-quantum correspondence for bosonic Hopfield model systems, and reveals important departures from previous heuristic assumptions about system-bath coupling. We identify a new criterion for what we term the "broadband" dissipative regime of cavity-QED, where phenomenological models require corrections in accordance with the intrinsic and spatially-dependent complex phase of the QNM, and also shed light on fundamental limits to single-mode models in extreme coupling regimes. Using plasmonic and dielectric cavity examples, we show validity ranges of our QNM master equation and spectral USC calculations, and discuss prospects for near-term experimental observation of broadband dissipative effects.</description>
