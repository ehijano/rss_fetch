      <title>Formal principle with convergence for rational curves of Goursat type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a conjecture that a general member of a bracket-generating family of rational curves in a complex manifold satisfies the formal principle with convergence, namely, any formal equivalence between such curves is convergent. If the normal bundles of the rational curves are positive, the conjecture follows from the results of Commichau-Grauert and Hirschowitz. We prove the conjecture for the opposite case when the normal bundles are furthest from positive vector bundles among bracket-generating families, namely, when the families of rational curves are of Goursat type. The proof uses natural ODEs associated to rational curves of Goursat type and corresponding Cartan connections constructed by Doubrov-Komrakov-Morimoto. As an example, we see that a general line on a smooth cubic fourfold satisfies the formal principle with convergence.</description>

      <title>Uniform approximation on certain polynomial polyhedra in $\mathbb{C}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the dichotomy given by Samuelsson and Wold that can be thought of as an analogue of the Wermer maximality theorem in $\mathbb{C}^2$ for certain polynomial polyhedra. We consider complex non-degenerate simply connected polynomial polyhedra of the form $\Omega:=\{z\in\mathbb{C}^2: |p_1(z)|&lt;1, |p_2(z)|&lt;1\}$ such that $\overline{\Omega}$ is compact. Under a mild condition of the polynomials $p_1$ and $p_2$, we prove that either the uniform algebra, generated by polynomials and some continuous functions $f_1,\dots, f_N$ on the distinguished boundary that extends as pluriharmonic functions on $\Omega$, is all continuous functions on the distinguished boundary or there exists an algebraic variety in $\overline{\Omega}$ on which each $f_j$ is holomorphic. We also compute the polynomial hull of the graph of pluriharmonic functions in some cases where the pluriharmonic functions are conjugates of holomorphic polynomials. We also give a couple of general theorem about uniform approximation on the domains with low boundary regularity.</description>

      <title>An effective version of Fekete's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result of Fekete gives necessary conditions on a compact set in the complex plane so that it contains infinitely many sets of conjugate algebraic integers. We prove an effective version of Fekete's theorem in terms of a height function. As an application, we give a lower bound on the growth of the leading coefficient of certain polynomial sequences, generalizing a result by Schur. Lastly, we give an upper bound on minimal asymptotics of height over sequences of algebraic numbers.</description>

      <title>The log minimal model program for K\"ahler $3$-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.05924v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we show that the Log Minimal Model Program for $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial dlt pairs $(X, B)$ on a compact K\"ahler $3$-fold holds. More specifically, we show that after finitely many divisorial contractions and flips we obtain either a (log) minimal model or a Mori fiber space. We also prove a base point free theorem K\"ahler $3$-folds.</description>

      <title>On the $4$-dimensional minimal model program for K\"ahler varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.12205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we establish the following results: Let $(X, B)$ be a dlt pair, where $X$ is a $\mathbb Q$-factorial K\"ahler $4$-fold -- (i) if $X$ is compact and $K_X+B\sim_{\mathbb Q} D\geq 0$ for some effective $\mathbb Q$-divisor, then $(X, B)$ has a log minimal model, (ii) if $(X/T, B)$ is a semi-stable klt pair, $W\subset T$ a compact subset and $K_X+B$ is effective over $W$ (resp. not effective over $W$), then we can run a $(K_X+B)$-MMP over $T$ (in a neighborhood of $W$) which ends with a minimal model over $T$ (resp. a Mori fiber space over $T$). We also give a proof of the existence of flips for analytic varieties in all dimensions and the relative MMP for projective morphisms between analytic varieties.</description>

      <title>On the Moser's Bernstein Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the following version of the famous Bernstein's theorem: Let $X\subset \mathbb R^{n+k}$ be a closed and connected set with Hausdorff dimension $n$. Assume that $X$ satisfies the monotonicity formula at $p\in X$. Then, the following statements are equivalent:
  (1) $X$ is an affine linear subspace;
  (2) $X$ is a definable set that is Lipschitz regular at infinity and its geometric tangent cone at infinity, $C(X,\infty)$, is a linear subspace;
  (3) $X$ is a definable set, blow-spherical regular at infinity and $C(X,\infty)$ is a linear subspace;
  (4) $X$ is a definable set that is Lipschitz normally embedded at infinity and $C(X,\infty)$ is a linear subspace;
  (5) the density of $X$ at infinity is 1.
  Consequently, we prove the following generalization of Bernstein's theorem: Let $X\subset \mathbb R^{n+1}$ be a closed and connected set with Hausdorff dimension $n$. Assume that $X$ satisfies the monotonicity formula at $p\in X$ and there are compact sets $K\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\tilde K\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ such that $X\setminus \tilde K$ is a minimal hypersurface that is the graph of a $C^2$-smooth function $u\colon \mathbb{R}^{n}\setminus K\to \mathbb{R}$. Assume that $u$ has bounded derivative whenever $n&gt;7$. Then $X$ is a hyperplane. Several other results are also presented. For example, we generalize the o-minimal Chow's theorem, we prove that any entire complex analytic set that is bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic to a definable set in an o-minimal structure must be an algebraic set. We also obtain that Yau's Bernstein Problem, which says that an oriented stable complete minimal hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ with $n\leq 6$ must be a hyperplane, holds true whether the hypersurface is a definable set in an o-minimal structure.</description>

      <title>Orbifold modifications of complex analytic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that if $X$ is a compact complex analytic variety, which has quotient singularities in codimension 2, then there is a projective bimeromorphic morphism $f\colon Y\to X$, such that $Y$ has quotient singularities, and that the indeterminacy locus of $f^{-1}$ has codimension at least 3 in $X$. As an application, we deduce the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality on orbifold Chern classes for stable reflexive coherent sheaves on compact K\"ahler varieties which have quotient singularities in codimension 2.</description>

      <title>Boundary local integrability of rational functions in two variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by studying boundary singularities of rational functions in two variables that are analytic on a domain, we investigate local integrability on $\mathbb{R}^2$ near $(0,0)$ of rational functions with denominator non-vanishing in the bi-upper half-plane but with an isolated zero (with respect to $\mathbb{R}^2$) at the origin. Building on work of Bickel-Pascoe-Sola, we give a necessary and sufficient test for membership in a local $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ space and we give a complete description of all numerators $Q$ such that $Q/P$ is locally in a given $L^{p}$ space. As applications, we prove that every bounded rational function on the bidisk has partial derivatives belonging to $L^1$ on the two-torus. In addition, we give a new proof of a conjecture, started in Bickel-Knese-Pascoe-Sola and completed by Koll\'ar, characterizing the ideal of $Q$ such that $Q/P$ is locally bounded. A larger takeaway from this work is that a local model for stable polynomials we employ is a flexible tool and may be of use for other local questions about stable polynomials.</description>
