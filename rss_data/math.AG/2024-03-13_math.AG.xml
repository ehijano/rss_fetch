      <title>Low degree rational curves on quasi-polarized K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that there are at most $(24-r_0)$ low-degree rational curves on high-degree models of K3 surfaces with at most Du Val singularities, where $r_0$ is the number of exceptional divisors on the minimal resolution. We also provide several existence results in the above setting (i.e. for rational curves on quasi-polarized K3 surfaces), which imply that for various values of $r_0$ our bound cannot be improved.</description>

      <title>Schubert valuations on Grassmann varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of the paper is twofold: on one side it provides an order structure on the set of all maximal chains in the Bruhat poset of Schubert varieties in a Grassmann variety; on the other hand, using this order structure, it works out explicit formulae for the valuation and the Newton-Okounkov body associated to each maximal chain appearing in the framework of Seshadri stratification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study genus-$4$ curves obtained as double covers of elliptic curves. Firstly we give explicit defining equations of such curves with explicit criterion for whether it is nonsingular, and show the irreducibility of the long polynomial determining whether the curve is nonsingular, in any characteristic $\ne 2,3$. Secondly as an application we enumerate superspecial genus-$4$ double covers of elliptic curves in small characteristic.</description>

      <title>Beilinson-Parshin adeles via solid algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply Clausen-Scholze's theory of solid modules to the existence of adelic decompositions for schemes of finite type over $\mathbb{Z}$. Specifically, we use the six-functor formalism for solid modules to define the skeletal filtration of a scheme, and then we show that decomposing a quasi-coherent sheaf with respect to this filtration gives rise to a new construction of the Beilinson-Parshin adelic resolution.</description>

      <title>Viro's patchworking and the signed reduced A-discriminant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the isotopy type of a hypersurface, defined as the positive real zero set of a multivariate polynomial, is a challenging problem in real algebraic geometry. We focus on the case where the defining polynomial has combinatorially restricted exponent vectors and fixed coefficient signs, enabling faster computation of the isotopy type. In particular, Viro's patchworking provides a polyhedral complex that has the same isotopy type as the hypersurface, for certain choices of the coefficients. So we present properties of the signed support, focussing mainly on the case of n-variate (n+3)-nomials, that ensure all possible isotopy types can be obtained via patchworking. To prove this, we study the signed reduced A-discriminant and show that it has a simple structure if the signed support satisfies some combinatorial conditions.</description>

      <title>Fourier Quasicrystals on $\mathbb R^n$ Preliminary Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper has three aims. First, for $n \geq 1$ we construct a family of real-rooted trigonometric polynomial maps $P : \mathbb C^n \mapsto \mathbb C^n$ whose divisors are Fourier Quasicrystals (FQ). For $n = 1$ these divisors include the first nontrivial FQ with positive integer coefficients constructed by Kurasov and Sarnak \cite{kurasovsarnak}, and for $n &gt; 1$ they overlap with Meyer's curved model sets \cite{meyer6} and two-dimensional \cite{meyer7} and multidimensional \cite{meyer8} crystalline measures. We prove that the divisors are FQ by directly computing their Fourier transforms using a formula derived in \cite{lawton}. Second, we extend the relationship between real-rootedness and amoebas, derived for $n = 1$ by Alon, Cohen and Vinzant \cite{alon}, to the case $n &gt; 1.$ The extension uses results in \cite{bushuevatsikh} about homology of complements of amoebas of algebraic sets of codimension $&gt; 1.$ Third, we prove that the divisors of all uniformly generic real-rooted $P$ are FQ. The proof uses the formula relating Grothendieck residues and Newton polytopes derived by Gelfond and Khovanskii \cite{gelfondkhovanskii1} . Finally, we note that Olevskii and Ulanovskii [60] have proved that all FQ are divisors of real-rooted trigonometric polynomials for $n = 1$ but that the situation for $n &gt; 1$ remains unsolved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the concept of stack one dimension higher, introducing a notion of 2-stack suitable for a trihomomorphism from a 2-category equipped with a bitopology into the tricategory of bicategories. Moreover, we give a characterization of 2-stacks in terms of explicit conditions, that are easier to use in practice. These explicit conditions are effectiveness conditions for appropriate data of descent on objects, morphisms and 2-cells, generalizing the usual stacky gluing conditions one dimension higher. Furthermore, we prove some new results on bitopologies. The main one is that every object of a subcanonical bisite can be seen as the sigma-bicolimit of each covering bisieve over it. This generalizes one dimension higher a well-know result for subcanonical Grothendieck sites.</description>

      <title>On closed definable subsets in Hensel minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with Hensel minimal structures on non-trivially valued fields $K$. The main aim is to establish the following two properties of closed 0-definable subsets $A$ in the affine spaces $K^{n}$. Every such subset $A$ is the zero locus of a continuous 0-definable function $f:K^{n} \to K$, and there exists a 0-definable retraction $r: K^{n} \to A$. While the former property is a non-Archimedean counterpart of the one from o-minimal geometry, the former does not hold in real geometry in general. The proofs make use of a model-theoretic compactness argument and ubiquity of clopen sets in non-Archimedean geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a pointwise comparison of two notions of Lelong numbers of plurisubharmonic functions defined on singular complex spaces. This shows a conjecture proposed by Berman-Boucksom-Eyssidieux-Guedj-Zeriahi, affirming that the Demailly-Lelong number can be determined through a combination of intersection numbers given by the divisorial part of the potential and the SNC divisors over a log resolution of the maximal ideal of a given point. We also provide an estimate for quotient singularities and sharp estimates for two-dimensional ADE singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove non-hyperbolicity of primitive symplectic varieties with $b_2 \geq 5$ that satisfy the rational SYZ conjecture. If in addition $b_2 \geq 7$, we establish that the Kobayashi pseudometric vanishes identically. This in particular applies to all currently known examples of irreducible symplectic manifolds and thereby completes the results by Kamenova--Lu--Verbitsky. The key new contribution is that a projective primitive symplectic variety with a Lagrangian fibration has vanishing Kobayashi pseudometric. The proof uses ergodicity, birational contractions, and cycle spaces.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a Fano type variety and $(X,\Delta)$ be a log Calabi-Yau pair with $\Delta$ a Weil divisor. If $(X,\Delta)$ admits a polarized endomorphism, then we show that $(X,\Delta)$ is a finite quotient of a toric pair. Along the way, we prove that a klt Calabi-Yau pair $(X,\Delta)$ with standard coefficients that admits a polarized endomorphism is the quotient of an abelian variety.</description>

Abstract: We classify meromorphic affine connections on compact complex surfaces with algebraic dimension one, extending the work of Inoue,Kobayashi and Ochiai (1981) in the holomorphic case. The motivation is to investigate possible extension of the principle of uniformization of complex compact curves by means of geometric structures, in higher dimensions and allowing singularities to the geometric structures.</description>

      <title>Apollonian carpets and the boundary of the Kahler cone of a hyperkahler manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ample cone of a compact Kahler $n$-manifold $M$ is the intersection of its Kahler cone and the real subspace generated by integer (1,1)-classes. Its isotropic boundary is the set of all points $\eta$ on its boundary such that $\int_M \eta^n=0$. We are interested in the relation between the shape of the isotropic boundary of the ample cone of a hyperkahler manifold and the dynamics of its holomorphic automorphism group $G$. In this case, the projectivization of the ample cone is realized as an open, locally polyhedral subset in a hyperbolic space $H$. The isotropic boundary $S$ is realized as a subset of the hyperbolic boundary (the absolute) $A$ of $H$, which is naturally identified with a Euclidean sphere. It is clear that the isotropic boundary $S$ contains the limit set of $G$ acting on its ample cone. We prove that, conversely, all irrational points on $S$ belong to the limit set. Using a result of N. Shah about limiting distributions of curves under geodesic flow on hyperbolic manifolds, we prove that every real analytic curve in $S$ is contained in a geodesic sphere in $S$,and in presence of such curves the limit set is the closure of the union of these geodesic spheres. We study the geometry of such fractal sets, called Apollonian carpets, and establish the link between the Apollonian carpet and the structure of the automorphism group.</description>

Using the theory of harmonic maps between Riemann surfaces, we construct a natural map from a component of the space of Bridgeland stability conditions on this category to the enhanced Teichm\"uller space of the surface. We describe a relationship between the central charges of objects in the category and shear coordinates on the Teichm\"uller space.</description>

      <title>Tilted biorthogonal ensembles, Grothendieck random partitions, and determinantal tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study probability measures on partitions based on symmetric Grothendieck polynomials. These deformations of Schur polynomials introduced in the K-theory of Grassmannians share many common properties. Our Grothendieck measures are analogs of the Schur measures on partitions introduced by Okounkov (arXiv:math/9907127 [math.RT]). Despite the similarity of determinantal formulas for the probability weights of Schur and Grothendieck measures, we demonstrate that Grothendieck measures are \emph{not} determinantal point processes. This question is related to the principal minor assignment problem in algebraic geometry, and we employ a determinantal test first obtained by Nanson in 1897 for the $4\times4$ problem. We also propose a procedure for getting Nanson-like determinantal tests for matrices of any size $n\ge4$ which appear new for $n\ge 5$.
  By placing the Grothendieck measures into a new framework of tilted biorthogonal ensembles generalizing a rich class of determinantal processes introduced by Borodin (arXiv:math/9804027 [math.CA]), we identify Grothendieck random partitions as a cross-section of a Schur process, a determinantal process in two dimensions. This identification expresses the correlation functions of Grothendieck measures through sums of Fredholm determinants, which are not immediately suitable for asymptotic analysis. A more direct approach allows us to obtain a limit shape result for the Grothendieck random partitions. The limit shape curve is not particularly explicit as it arises as a cross-section of the limit shape surface for the Schur process. The gradient of this surface is expressed through the argument of a complex root of a cubic equation.</description>

      <title>The Hitchin Image in Type-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by their appearance as Coulomb branch geometries of Class S theories, we study the image of the local Hitchin map in tame Hitchin systems of type-D with residue in a special nilpotent orbit $\mathcal{O}_H$. We describe two important features which distinguish it from the type A case studied in arXiv:2008.01020. The first feature, which we term even type constraints, arise iff the partition label $[\mathcal{O}_H]$ has even parts. In this case, our Hitchin image is non-singular and thus different from the one studied by Baraglia and Kamgarpour. We argue that our Hitchin image always globalizes to being the Hitchin base of an integrable system. The second feature, which we term odd type constraints, is related to a particular finite group $\overline{A}_b(\mathcal{O}_H)$ being non-trivial. When this finite group is non-trivial, we have $\mid \overline{A}_b \mid$ choices for the local Hitchin base. Additionally, we also show that the finite group $\overline{A}_b(\mathcal{O}_H)$ encodes the size of the dual special piece.</description>

Abstract: We provide new criteria for the integrality and birationality of an extension of graded algebras in terms of the general notion of polar multiplicities of Kleiman and Thorup. As an application, we obtain a new criterion for when a module is a reduction of another in terms of certain mixed Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicities. Furthermore, we prove several technical results regarding polar multiplicities.</description>
