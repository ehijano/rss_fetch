      <title>SAFERec: Self-Attention and Frequency Enriched Model for Next Basket Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based approaches such as BERT4Rec and SASRec demonstrate strong performance in Next Item Recommendation (NIR) tasks. However, applying these architectures to Next-Basket Recommendation (NBR) tasks, which often involve highly repetitive interactions, is challenging due to the vast number of possible item combinations in a basket. Moreover, frequency-based methods such as TIFU-KNN and UP-CF still demonstrate strong performance in NBR tasks, frequently outperforming deep-learning approaches. This paper introduces SAFERec, a novel algorithm for NBR that enhances transformer-based architectures from NIR by incorporating item frequency information, consequently improving their applicability to NBR tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that SAFERec outperforms all other baselines, specifically achieving an 8\% improvement in Recall@10.</description>

      <title>Embedding Cultural Diversity in Prototype-based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Popularity bias in recommender systems can increase cultural overrepresentation by favoring norms from dominant cultures and marginalizing underrepresented groups. This issue is critical for platforms offering cultural products, as they influence consumption patterns and human perceptions. In this work, we address popularity bias by identifying demographic biases within prototype-based matrix factorization methods. Using the country of origin as a proxy for cultural identity, we link this demographic attribute to popularity bias by refining the embedding space learning process. First, we propose filtering out irrelevant prototypes to improve representativity. Second, we introduce a regularization technique to enforce a uniform distribution of prototypes within the embedding space. Across four datasets, our results demonstrate a 27\% reduction in the average rank of long-tail items and a 2\% reduction in the average rank of items from underrepresented countries. Additionally, our model achieves a 2\% improvement in HitRatio@10 compared to the state-of-the-art, highlighting that fairness is enhanced without compromising recommendation quality. Moreover, the distribution of prototypes leads to more inclusive explanations by better aligning items with diverse prototypes.</description>

      <title>ChainRank-DPO: Chain Rank Direct Preference Optimization for LLM Rankers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in text reranking through works like RankGPT, leveraging their human-like reasoning about relevance. However, supervised fine-tuning for ranking often diminishes these models' general-purpose capabilities, including the crucial reasoning abilities that make them valuable for ranking. We introduce a novel approach integrating Chain-of-Thought prompting with an SFT-DPO (Supervised Fine-Tuning followed by Direct Preference Optimization) pipeline to preserve these capabilities while improving ranking performance. Our experiments on TREC 2019 and 2020 Deep Learning datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art RankZephyr while maintaining strong performance on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark, demonstrating effective preservation of general-purpose capabilities through thoughtful fine-tuning strategies. Our code and data will be publicly released upon the acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>Are Longer Prompts Always Better? Prompt Selection in Large Language Models for Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large language models (LLM)-based recommendation systems (LLM-RSs), accurately predicting user preferences by leveraging the general knowledge of LLMs is possible without requiring extensive training data. By converting recommendation tasks into natural language inputs called prompts, LLM-RSs can efficiently solve issues that have been difficult to address due to data scarcity but are crucial in applications such as cold-start and cross-domain problems. However, when applying this in practice, selecting the prompt that matches tasks and data is essential. Although numerous prompts have been proposed in LLM-RSs and representing the target user in prompts significantly impacts recommendation accuracy, there are still no clear guidelines for selecting specific prompts.
  In this paper, we categorize and analyze prompts from previous research to establish practical prompt selection guidelines. Through 450 experiments with 90 prompts and five real-world datasets, we examined the relationship between prompts and dataset characteristics in recommendation accuracy. We found that no single prompt consistently outperforms others; thus, selecting prompts on the basis of dataset characteristics is crucial. Here, we propose a prompt selection method that achieves higher accuracy with minimal validation data. Because increasing the number of prompts to explore raises costs, we also introduce a cost-efficient strategy using high-performance and cost-efficient LLMs, significantly reducing exploration costs while maintaining high prediction accuracy. Our work offers valuable insights into the prompt selection, advancing accurate and efficient LLM-RSs.</description>

      <title>VISA: Retrieval Augmented Generation with Visual Source Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation with source attribution is important for enhancing the verifiability of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. However, existing approaches in RAG primarily link generated content to document-level references, making it challenging for users to locate evidence among multiple content-rich retrieved documents. To address this challenge, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Visual Source Attribution (VISA), a novel approach that combines answer generation with visual source attribution. Leveraging large vision-language models (VLMs), VISA identifies the evidence and highlights the exact regions that support the generated answers with bounding boxes in the retrieved document screenshots. To evaluate its effectiveness, we curated two datasets: Wiki-VISA, based on crawled Wikipedia webpage screenshots, and Paper-VISA, derived from PubLayNet and tailored to the medical domain. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of VISA for visual source attribution on documents' original look, as well as highlighting the challenges for improvement. Code, data, and model checkpoints will be released.</description>

      <title>HEC-GCN: Hypergraph Enhanced Cascading Graph Convolution Network for Multi-Behavior Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-behavior recommendation (MBR) has garnered growing attention recently due to its ability to mitigate the sparsity issue by inferring user preferences from various auxiliary behaviors to improve predictions for the target behavior. Although existing research on MBR has yielded impressive results, they still face two major limitations. First, previous methods mainly focus on modeling fine-grained interaction information between users and items under each behavior, which may suffer from sparsity issue. Second, existing models usually concentrate on exploiting dependencies between two consecutive behaviors, leaving intra- and inter-behavior consistency largely unexplored. To the end, we propose a novel approach named Hypergraph Enhanced Cascading Graph Convolution Network for multi-behavior recommendation (HEC-GCN). To be specific, we first explore both fine- and coarse-grained correlations among users or items of each behavior by simultaneously modeling the behavior-specific interaction graph and its corresponding hypergraph in a cascaded manner. Then, we propose a behavior consistency-guided alignment strategy that ensures consistent representations between the interaction graph and its associated hypergraph for each behavior, while also maintaining representation consistency across different behaviors. Extensive experiments and analyses on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach is consistently superior to previous state-of-the-art methods due to its capability to effectively attenuate the sparsity issue as well as preserve both intra- and inter-behavior consistencies. The code is available at https://github.com/marqu22/HEC-GCN.git.</description>

      <title>Sliding Windows Are Not the End: Exploring Full Ranking with Long-Context Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exciting performance in listwise passage ranking. Due to the limited input length, existing methods often adopt the sliding window strategy. Such a strategy, though effective, is inefficient as it involves repetitive and serialized processing, which usually re-evaluates relevant passages multiple times. As a result, it incurs redundant API costs, which are proportional to the number of inference tokens. The development of long-context LLMs enables the full ranking of all passages within a single inference, avoiding redundant API costs. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of long-context LLMs for ranking tasks in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that full ranking with long-context LLMs can deliver superior performance in the supervised fine-tuning setting with a huge efficiency improvement. Furthermore, we identify two limitations of fine-tuning the full ranking model based on existing methods: (1) sliding window strategy fails to produce a full ranking list as a training label, and (2) the language modeling loss cannot emphasize top-ranked passage IDs in the label. To alleviate these issues, we propose a new complete listwise label construction approach and a novel importance-aware learning objective for full ranking. Experiments show the superior performance of our method over baselines. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/8421BCD/fullrank}.</description>

      <title>ECLIPSE: Contrastive Dimension Importance Estimation with Pseudo-Irrelevance Feedback for Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Information Retrieval have leveraged high-dimensional embedding spaces to improve the retrieval of relevant documents. Moreover, the Manifold Clustering Hypothesis suggests that despite these high-dimensional representations, documents relevant to a query reside on a lower-dimensional, query-dependent manifold. While this hypothesis has inspired new retrieval methods, existing approaches still face challenges in effectively separating non-relevant information from relevant signals. We propose a novel methodology that addresses these limitations by leveraging information from both relevant and non-relevant documents. Our method, ECLIPSE, computes a centroid based on irrelevant documents as a reference to estimate noisy dimensions present in relevant ones, enhancing retrieval performance. Extensive experiments on three in-domain and one out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate an average improvement of up to 19.50% (resp. 22.35%) in mAP(AP) and 11.42% (resp. 13.10%) in nDCG@10 w.r.t. the DIME-based baseline (resp. the baseline using all dimensions). Our results pave the way for more robust, pseudo-irrelevance-based retrieval systems in future IR research.</description>

      <title>Spectrum-based Modality Representation Fusion Graph Convolutional Network for Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating multi-modal features as side information has recently become a trend in recommender systems. To elucidate user-item preferences, recent studies focus on fusing modalities via concatenation, element-wise sum, or attention mechanisms. Despite having notable success, existing approaches do not account for the modality-specific noise encapsulated within each modality. As a result, direct fusion of modalities will lead to the amplification of cross-modality noise. Moreover, the variation of noise that is unique within each modality results in noise alleviation and fusion being more challenging. In this work, we propose a new Spectrum-based Modality Representation (SMORE) fusion graph recommender that aims to capture both uni-modal and fusion preferences while simultaneously suppressing modality noise. Specifically, SMORE projects the multi-modal features into the frequency domain and leverages the spectral space for fusion. To reduce dynamic contamination that is unique to each modality, we introduce a filter to attenuate and suppress the modality noise adaptively while capturing the universal modality patterns effectively. Furthermore, we explore the item latent structures by designing a new multi-modal graph learning module to capture associative semantic correlations and universal fusion patterns among similar items. Finally, we formulate a new modality-aware preference module, which infuses behavioral features and balances the uni- and multi-modal features for precise preference modeling. This empowers SMORE with the ability to infer both user modality-specific and fusion preferences more accurately. Experiments on three real-world datasets show the efficacy of our proposed model. The source code for this work has been made publicly available at https://github.com/kennethorq/SMORE.</description>

      <title>DisCo: Graph-Based Disentangled Contrastive Learning for Cold-Start Cross-Domain Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems are widely used in various real-world applications, but they often encounter the persistent challenge of the user cold-start problem. Cross-domain recommendation (CDR), which leverages user interactions from one domain to improve prediction performance in another, has emerged as a promising solution. However, users with similar preferences in the source domain may exhibit different interests in the target domain. Therefore, directly transferring embeddings may introduce irrelevant source-domain collaborative information. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based disentangled contrastive learning framework to capture fine-grained user intent and filter out irrelevant collaborative information, thereby avoiding negative transfer. Specifically, for each domain, we use a multi-channel graph encoder to capture diverse user intents. We then construct the affinity graph in the embedding space and perform multi-step random walks to capture high-order user similarity relationships. Treating one domain as the target, we propose a disentangled intent-wise contrastive learning approach, guided by user similarity, to refine the bridging of user intents across domains. Extensive experiments on four benchmark CDR datasets demonstrate that DisCo consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines, thereby validating the effectiveness of both DisCo and its components.</description>

      <title>Nano-ESG: Extracting Corporate Sustainability Information from News Articles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the sustainability impact of companies is a highly complex subject which has garnered more and more attention over the past few years. Today, investors largely rely on sustainability-ratings from established rating-providers in order to analyze how responsibly a company acts. However, those ratings have recently been criticized for being hard to understand and nearly impossible to reproduce.
  An independent way to find out about the sustainability practices of companies lies in the rich landscape of news article data. In this paper, we explore a different approach to identify key opportunities and challenges of companies in the sustainability domain. We present a novel dataset of more than 840,000 news articles which were gathered for major German companies between January 2023 and September 2024. By applying a mixture of Natural Language Processing techniques, we first identify relevant articles, before summarizing them and extracting their sustainability-related sentiment and aspect using Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, we conduct an evaluation of the obtained data and determine that the LLM-produced answers are accurate. We release both datasets at https://github.com/Bailefan/Nano-ESG.</description>

      <title>Advanced Reasoning and Transformation Engine for Multi-Step Insight Synthesis in Data Analytics with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Advanced Reasoning and Transformation Engine for Multi-Step Insight Synthesis in Data Analytics (ARTEMIS-DA), a novel framework designed to augment Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving complex, multi-step data analytics tasks. ARTEMIS-DA integrates three core components: the Planner, which dissects complex user queries into structured, sequential instructions encompassing data preprocessing, transformation, predictive modeling, and visualization; the Coder, which dynamically generates and executes Python code to implement these instructions; and the Grapher, which interprets generated visualizations to derive actionable insights. By orchestrating the collaboration between these components, ARTEMIS-DA effectively manages sophisticated analytical workflows involving advanced reasoning, multi-step transformations, and synthesis across diverse data modalities. The framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on benchmarks such as WikiTableQuestions and TabFact, demonstrating its ability to tackle intricate analytical tasks with precision and adaptability. By combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with automated code generation and execution and visual analysis, ARTEMIS-DA offers a robust, scalable solution for multi-step insight synthesis, addressing a wide range of challenges in data analytics.</description>

      <title>Whom do Explanations Serve? A Systematic Literature Survey of User Characteristics in Explainable Recommender Systems Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adding explanations to recommender systems is said to have multiple benefits, such as increasing user trust or system transparency. Previous work from other application areas suggests that specific user characteristics impact the users' perception of the explanation. However, we rarely find this type of evaluation for recommender systems explanations. This paper addresses this gap by surveying 124 papers in which recommender systems explanations were evaluated in user studies. We analyzed their participant descriptions and study results where the impact of user characteristics on the explanation effects was measured. Our findings suggest that the results from the surveyed studies predominantly cover specific users who do not necessarily represent the users of recommender systems in the evaluation domain. This may seriously hamper the generalizability of any insights we may gain from current studies on explanations in recommender systems. We further find inconsistencies in the data reporting, which impacts the reproducibility of the reported results. Hence, we recommend actions to move toward a more inclusive and reproducible evaluation.</description>

      <title>Transversal PACS Browser API: Addressing Interoperability Challenges in Medical Imaging Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in imaging technologies have revolutionised the medical imaging and healthcare sectors, leading to the widespread adoption of PACS for the storage, retrieval, and communication of medical images. Although these systems have improved operational efficiency, significant challenges remain in effectively retrieving DICOM images, which are essential for diagnosis and overall patient care. Moreover, issues such as fragmented systems, interoperability barriers, and complex user interfaces can often prevent healthcare professionals from efficiently accessing medical images. Addressing these challenges, the Transversal PACS Browser API is a robust and user-friendly solution designed to enhance the process of querying and retrieving DICOM images. It offers advanced filtering capabilities through a variety of filter options as well as a custom field search, that allows users to easily navigate through large medical image collections with ease. Additionally, the application provides a unified interface for querying and retrieving from multiple PACS stations, addressing the challenges of fragmentation and complexity associated with accessing medical images. Other key features include the ability to pre-view images directly within the application.

      <title>State Space Models are Strong Text Rerankers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers dominate NLP and IR; but their inference inefficiencies and challenges in extrapolating to longer contexts have sparked interest in alternative model architectures. Among these, state space models (SSMs) like Mamba offer promising advantages, particularly $O(1)$ time complexity in inference. Despite their potential, SSMs' effectiveness at text reranking -- a task requiring fine-grained query-document interaction and long-context understanding -- remains underexplored.
  This study benchmarks SSM-based architectures (specifically, Mamba-1 and Mamba-2) against transformer-based models across various scales, architectures, and pre-training objectives, focusing on performance and efficiency in text reranking tasks. We find that (1) Mamba architectures achieve competitive text ranking performance, comparable to transformer-based models of similar size; (2) they are less efficient in training and inference compared to transformers with flash attention; and (3) Mamba-2 outperforms Mamba-1 in both performance and efficiency. These results underscore the potential of state space models as a transformer alternative and highlight areas for improvement in future IR applications.</description>

      <title>Moving Beyond LDA: A Comparison of Unsupervised Topic Modelling Techniques for Qualitative Data Analysis of Online Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media constitutes a rich and influential source of information for qualitative researchers. Although computational techniques like topic modelling assist with managing the volume and diversity of social media content, qualitative researcher's lack of programming expertise creates a significant barrier to their adoption. In this paper we explore how BERTopic, an advanced Large Language Model (LLM)-based topic modelling technique, can support qualitative data analysis of social media. We conducted interviews and hands-on evaluations in which qualitative researchers compared topics from three modelling techniques: LDA, NMF, and BERTopic. BERTopic was favoured by 8 of 12 participants for its ability to provide detailed, coherent clusters for deeper understanding and actionable insights. Participants also prioritised topic relevance, logical organisation, and the capacity to reveal unexpected relationships within the data. Our findings underscore the potential of LLM-based techniques for supporting qualitative analysis.</description>

      <title>Efficient Self-Supervised Video Hashing with Selective State Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised video hashing (SSVH) is a practical task in video indexing and retrieval. Although Transformers are predominant in SSVH for their impressive temporal modeling capabilities, they often suffer from computational and memory inefficiencies. Drawing inspiration from Mamba, an advanced state-space model, we explore its potential in SSVH to achieve a better balance between efficacy and efficiency. We introduce S5VH, a Mamba-based video hashing model with an improved self-supervised learning paradigm. Specifically, we design bidirectional Mamba layers for both the encoder and decoder, which are effective and efficient in capturing temporal relationships thanks to the data-dependent selective scanning mechanism with linear complexity. In our learning strategy, we transform global semantics in the feature space into semantically consistent and discriminative hash centers, followed by a center alignment loss as a global learning signal. Our self-local-global (SLG) paradigm significantly improves learning efficiency, leading to faster and better convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate S5VH's improvements over state-of-the-art methods, superior transferability, and scalable advantages in inference efficiency.

      <title>Progressive Multimodal Reasoning via Active Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-step multimodal reasoning tasks pose significant challenges for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and finding effective ways to enhance their performance in such scenarios remains an unresolved issue. In this paper, we propose AR-MCTS, a universal framework designed to progressively improve the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs through Active Retrieval (AR) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Our approach begins with the development of a unified retrieval module that retrieves key supporting insights for solving complex reasoning problems from a hybrid-modal retrieval corpus. To bridge the gap in automated multimodal reasoning verification, we employ the MCTS algorithm combined with an active retrieval mechanism, which enables the automatic generation of step-wise annotations. This strategy dynamically retrieves key insights for each reasoning step, moving beyond traditional beam search sampling to improve the diversity and reliability of the reasoning space. Additionally, we introduce a process reward model that aligns progressively to support the automatic verification of multimodal reasoning tasks. Experimental results across three complex multimodal reasoning benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of the AR-MCTS framework in enhancing the performance of various multimodal models. Further analysis demonstrates that AR-MCTS can optimize sampling diversity and accuracy, yielding reliable multimodal reasoning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of data proliferation, efficiently sifting through vast information to extract meaningful insights has become increasingly crucial. This paper addresses the computational overhead and resource inefficiency prevalent in existing Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs). We introduce an innovative approach combining pruning methods with advanced model designs. Furthermore, we delve into resource-constrained Neural Architecture Search (NAS), an emerging technique in recommender systems, to optimize models in terms of FLOPs, latency, and energy consumption while maintaining or enhancing accuracy. Our principal contribution is the development of a Data-aware Neural Architecture Search for Recommender System (DNS-Rec). DNS-Rec is specifically designed to tailor compact network architectures for attention-based SRS models, thereby ensuring accuracy retention. It incorporates data-aware gates to enhance the performance of the recommendation network by learning information from historical user-item interactions. Moreover, DNS-Rec employs a dynamic resource constraint strategy, stabilizing the search process and yielding more suitable architectural solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through rigorous experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets, which highlight the superiority of DNS-Rec in SRSs. Our findings set a new standard for future research in efficient and accurate recommendation systems, marking a significant step forward in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>SCONE: A Novel Stochastic Sampling to Generate Contrastive Views and Hard Negative Samples for Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph-based collaborative filtering (CF) has emerged as a promising approach in recommender systems. Despite its achievements, graph-based CF models face challenges due to data sparsity and negative sampling. In this paper, we propose a novel Stochastic sampling for i) COntrastive views and ii) hard NEgative samples (SCONE) to overcome these issues. SCONE generates dynamic augmented views and diverse hard negative samples via a unified stochastic sampling approach based on score-based generative models. Our extensive experiments on 6 benchmark datasets show that SCONE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. SCONE shows efficacy in addressing user sparsity and item popularity issues, while enhancing performance for both cold-start users and long-tail items. Furthermore, our approach improves the diversity of the recommendation and the uniformity of the representations. The code is available at https://github.com/jeongwhanchoi/SCONE.</description>

      <title>DLCRec: A Novel Approach for Managing Diversity in LLM-Based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommender systems has led to substantial performance improvements. However, this often comes at the cost of diminished recommendation diversity, which can negatively impact user satisfaction. To address this issue, controllable recommendation has emerged as a promising approach, allowing users to specify their preferences and receive recommendations that meet their diverse needs. Despite its potential, existing controllable recommender systems frequently rely on simplistic mechanisms, such as a single prompt, to regulate diversity-an approach that falls short of capturing the full complexity of user preferences. In response to these limitations, we propose DLCRec, a novel framework designed to enable fine-grained control over diversity in LLM-based recommendations. Unlike traditional methods, DLCRec adopts a fine-grained task decomposition strategy, breaking down the recommendation process into three sequential sub-tasks: genre prediction, genre filling, and item prediction. These sub-tasks are trained independently and inferred sequentially according to user-defined control numbers, ensuring more precise control over diversity. Furthermore, the scarcity and uneven distribution of diversity-related user behavior data pose significant challenges for fine-tuning. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce two data augmentation techniques that enhance the model's robustness to noisy and out-of-distribution data. These techniques expose the model to a broader range of patterns, improving its adaptability in generating recommendations with varying levels of diversity. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that DLCRec not only provides precise control over diversity but also outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple recommendation scenarios.</description>

Abstract: A wide range of transformer-based language models have been proposed for information retrieval tasks. However, including transformer-based models in retrieval pipelines is often complex and requires substantial engineering effort. In this paper, we introduce Lightning IR, an easy-to-use PyTorch Lightning-based framework for applying transformer-based language models in retrieval scenarios. Lightning IR provides a modular and extensible architecture that supports all stages of a retrieval pipeline: from fine-tuning and indexing to searching and re-ranking.

      <title>Metric Compatible Training for Online Backfilling in Large-Scale Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backfilling is the process of re-extracting all gallery embeddings from upgraded models in image retrieval systems. It inevitably requires a prohibitively large amount of computational cost and even entails the downtime of the service. Although backward-compatible learning sidesteps this challenge by tackling query-side representations, this leads to suboptimal solutions in principle because gallery embeddings cannot benefit from model upgrades. We address this dilemma by introducing an online backfilling algorithm, which enables us to achieve a progressive performance improvement during the backfilling process while not sacrificing the final performance of new model after the completion of backfilling. To this end, we first propose a simple distance rank merge technique for online backfilling. Then, we incorporate a reverse transformation module for more effective and efficient merging, which is further enhanced by adopting a metric-compatible contrastive learning approach. These two components help to make the distances of old and new models compatible, resulting in desirable merge results during backfilling with no extra computational overhead. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our framework on four standard benchmarks in various settings.</description>

      <title>Agent-OM: Leveraging LLM Agents for Ontology Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00326v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ontology matching (OM) enables semantic interoperability between different ontologies and resolves their conceptual heterogeneity by aligning related entities. OM systems currently have two prevailing design paradigms: conventional knowledge-based expert systems and newer machine learning-based predictive systems. While large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents have revolutionised data engineering and have been applied creatively in many domains, their potential for OM remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel agent-powered LLM-based design paradigm for OM systems. With consideration of several specific challenges in leveraging LLM agents for OM, we propose a generic framework, namely Agent-OM (Agent for Ontology Matching), consisting of two Siamese agents for retrieval and matching, with a set of simple OM tools. Our framework is implemented in a proof-of-concept system. Evaluations of three Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks over state-of-the-art OM systems show that our system can achieve results very close to the long-standing best performance on simple OM tasks and can significantly improve the performance on complex and few-shot OM tasks.</description>

      <title>WISE: Rethinking the Knowledge Memory for Lifelong Model Editing of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) need knowledge updates to meet the ever-growing world facts and correct the hallucinated responses, facilitating the methods of lifelong model editing. Where the updated knowledge resides in memories is a fundamental question for model editing. In this paper, we find that editing either long-term memory (direct model parameters) or working memory (non-parametric knowledge of neural network activations/representations by retrieval) will result in an impossible triangle -- reliability, generalization, and locality can not be realized together in the lifelong editing settings. For long-term memory, directly editing the parameters will cause conflicts with irrelevant pretrained knowledge or previous edits (poor reliability and locality). For working memory, retrieval-based activations can hardly make the model understand the edits and generalize (poor generalization). Therefore, we propose WISE to bridge the gap between memories. In WISE, we design a dual parametric memory scheme, which consists of the main memory for the pretrained knowledge and a side memory for the edited knowledge. We only edit the knowledge in the side memory and train a router to decide which memory to go through when given a query. For continual editing, we devise a knowledge-sharding mechanism where different sets of edits reside in distinct subspaces of parameters, and are subsequently merged into a shared memory without conflicts. Extensive experiments show that WISE can outperform previous model editing methods and overcome the impossible triangle under lifelong model editing of question answering, hallucination, and out-of-distribution settings across trending LLM architectures, e.g., GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral.

      <description>arXiv:2405.17969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large language models are rooted in their vast repositories of knowledge encoded within their parameters, enabling them to perceive the world and engage in reasoning. The inner workings of how these models store knowledge have long been a subject of intense interest and investigation among researchers. To date, most studies have concentrated on isolated components within these models, such as the Multilayer Perceptrons and attention head. In this paper, we delve into the computation graph of the language model to uncover the knowledge circuits that are instrumental in articulating specific knowledge. The experiments, conducted with GPT2 and TinyLLAMA, have allowed us to observe how certain information heads, relation heads, and Multilayer Perceptrons collaboratively encode knowledge within the model. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of current knowledge editing techniques on these knowledge circuits, providing deeper insights into the functioning and constraints of these editing methodologies. Finally, we utilize knowledge circuits to analyze and interpret language model behaviors such as hallucinations and in-context learning. We believe the knowledge circuits hold potential for advancing our understanding of Transformers and guiding the improved design of knowledge editing.

      <title>Evidence Contextualization and Counterfactual Attribution for Conversational QA over Heterogeneous Data with RAG Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) works as a backbone for interacting with an enterprise's own data via Conversational Question Answering (ConvQA). In a RAG system, a retriever fetches passages from a collection in response to a question, which are then included in the prompt of a large language model (LLM) for generating a natural language (NL) answer. However, several RAG systems today suffer from two shortcomings: (i) retrieved passages usually contain their raw text and lack appropriate document context, negatively impacting both retrieval and answering quality; and (ii) attribution strategies that explain answer generation usually rely only on similarity between the answer and the retrieved passages, thereby only generating plausible but not causal explanations. In this work, we demonstrate RAGONITE, a RAG system that remedies the above concerns by: (i) contextualizing evidence with source metadata and surrounding text; and (ii) computing counterfactual attribution, a causal explanation approach where the contribution of an evidence to an answer is determined by the similarity of the original response to the answer obtained by removing that evidence. To evaluate our proposals, we release a new benchmark ConfQuestions, with 300 hand-created conversational questions, each in English and German, coupled with ground truth URLs, completed questions, and answers from 215 public Confluence pages, that are typical of enterprise wiki spaces with heterogeneous elements. Experiments with RAGONITE on ConfQuestions show the viability of our ideas: contextualization improves RAG performance, and counterfactual attribution is effective at explaining RAG answers.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Consistency-Guided Multi-modal Hashing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal hashing methods have gained popularity due to their fast speed and low storage requirements. Among them, the supervised methods demonstrate better performance by utilizing labels as supervisory signals compared with unsupervised methods. Currently, for almost all supervised multi-modal hashing methods, there is a hidden assumption that training sets have no noisy labels. However, labels are often annotated incorrectly due to manual labeling in real-world scenarios, which will greatly harm the retrieval performance. To address this issue, we first discover a significant distribution consistency pattern through experiments, i.e., the 1-0 distribution of the presence or absence of each category in the label is consistent with the high-low distribution of similarity scores of the hash codes relative to category centers. Then, inspired by this pattern, we propose a novel Distribution-Consistency-Guided Multi-modal Hashing (DCGMH), which aims to filter and reconstruct noisy labels to enhance retrieval performance. Specifically, the proposed method first randomly initializes several category centers, which are used to compute the high-low distribution of similarity scores; Noisy and clean labels are then separately filtered out via the discovered distribution consistency pattern to mitigate the impact of noisy labels; Subsequently, a correction strategy, which is indirectly designed via the distribution consistency pattern, is applied to the filtered noisy labels, correcting high-confidence ones while treating low-confidence ones as unlabeled for unsupervised learning, thereby further enhancing the model's performance. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art baselines in multi-modal retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Organizations seeking to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for knowledge querying and analysis often encounter challenges in maintaining an LLM fine-tuned on targeted, up-to-date information that keeps answers relevant and grounded. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has quickly become a feasible solution for organizations looking to overcome the challenges of maintaining proprietary models and to help reduce LLM hallucinations in their query responses. However, RAG comes with its own issues regarding scaling data pipelines across tiered-access and disparate data sources. In many scenarios, it is necessary to query beyond a single data silo to provide richer and more relevant context for an LLM. Analyzing data sources within and across organizational trust boundaries is often limited by complex data-sharing policies that prohibit centralized data storage, therefore, inhibit the fast and effective setup and scaling of RAG solutions. In this paper, we introduce Confidential Computing (CC) techniques as a solution for secure Federated Retrieval Augmented Generation (FedRAG). Our proposed Confidential FedRAG system (C-FedRAG) enables secure connection and scaling of a RAG workflows across a decentralized network of data providers by ensuring context confidentiality. We also demonstrate how to implement a C-FedRAG system using the NVIDIA FLARE SDK and assess its performance using the MedRAG toolkit and MIRAGE benchmarking dataset.</description>
