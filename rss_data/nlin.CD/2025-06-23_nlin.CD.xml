      <title>The simplest chaos indicator derived from Lagrangian descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the simplest chaos indicator derivable from Lagrangian Descriptors (LDs), defined as the difference in LD values between two neighboring trajectories. This difference LD is remarkably easy to implement and interpret, offering a direct and intuitive measure of dynamical behavior. We provide a heuristic argument linking its growth to the regularity or chaoticity of the underlying initial condition, considering both arclength-based and $p$-norm formulations of LDs. To evaluate its effectiveness, we benchmark it against more elaborate LD-based chaos indicators using two prototypical systems: the H\'enon-Heiles system and the Chirikov Standard Map. Our results show that, despite its simplicity, the difference LD matches, and in some cases surpasses, the accuracy of more sophisticated methods, making it a robust and accessible tool for chaos detection in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized Spectral Statistics in the Kicked Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kicked Ising model has been studied extensively as a model of quantum chaos. Bertini, Kos, and Prosen studied the system in the thermodynamic limit, finding an analytic expression for the spectral form factor, $K(t)$, at the self-dual point with periodic boundary conditions. The spectral form factor is the 2nd moment of the trace of the time evolution operator, and we study the higher moments of this random variable in the kicked Ising model. A previous study of these higher moments by Flack, Bertini, and Prosen showed that, surprisingly, the trace behaves like a real Gaussian random variable when the system has periodic boundary conditions at the self dual point. By contrast, we investigate the model with open boundary conditions at the self dual point and find that the trace of the time evolution operator behaves as a complex Gaussian random variable as expected from random matrix universality based on the circular orthogonal ensemble. This result highlights a surprisingly strong effect of boundary conditions on the statistics of the trace. We also study a generalization of the spectral form factor known as the Loschmidt spectral form factor and present results for different boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Linking Free and Forced Fluctuations via Koopmanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The link between forced and free fluctuations for nonequilibrium systems can be described via a generalized version of the celebrated fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The use of the formalism of the Koopman operator makes it possible to deliver an intepretable form of the response operators written as a sum of exponentially decaying terms, each associated one-to-one with a mode of natural variability of the system. Here we showcase on a stochastically forced version of the celebrated Lorenz '63 model the feasibility and skill of such an approach by considering different Koopman dictionaries, which allows us to treat also seamlessly coarse-graining approaches like the Ulam method. Our findings provide support for the development of response theory-based investigation methods also in an equation-agnostic, data-driven environment.</description>

      <title>Loss of integrability in a system with two-photon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-matter systems that exhibit two-photon interactions have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring quantum applications. In this work, we focus on the two-photon Dicke model, a system of significant experimental relevance that displays spectral collapse and undergoes a phase transition from a normal to a superradiant phase. We analyze the normal phase, where a classical limit with two degrees of freedom can be derived using a mean-field approximation. Our study presents a detailed investigation of the loss of integrability in the two-photon Dicke model, employing both quantum and classical diagnostics. These results allow us to explore various dynamical features of the system, including the onset of chaos and the existence of mixed phase-space behavior.</description>

      <title>Multistability and Noise-Induced Transitions in Dispersively-Coupled Nonlinear Nanomechanical Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the noisy dynamics of two coupled bistable modes of a nanomechanical beam. When de-coupled, each driven mode obeys the Duffing equation of motion, with a well-defined bistable region in the frequency domain. When both modes are driven, intermodal dispersive coupling emerges due to the amplitude dependence of the modal frequencies and leads to coupled states of the two modes. We map out the dynamics of the system by sweeping the drive frequencies of both modes in the presence of added noise. The system then samples all accessible states at each combination of frequencies, with the probability of each stable state being proportional to its occupancy time at steady state. In the frequency domain, the system exhibits four stable regions -- one for each coupled state -- which are separated by five curves. These curves are reminiscent of coexistence curves in an equilibrium phase diagram: each curve is defined by robust inter-state transitions, with equal probabilities of finding the system in the two contiguous states. Remarkably, the curves intersect in two triple points, where the system now transitions between three distinct contiguous states. A physical analogy can be made between this nonequilibrium system and a multi-phase thermodynamic system, with possible applications in computing, precision sensing, and signal processing.</description>

      <title>A Set-valued Impact Law Approach for Modeling and Analysis of Rigid Contact Universal Joint with Clearance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a dynamic model of a universal joint (U-Joint) with radial clearance, focusing on the rigid unilateral frictional contacts at the crosspiece and yoke interfaces. Unlike previous models that neglect crosspiece inertia and interface friction, this work incorporates these effects using a set-valued impact law based on Signorini's condition with Coulomb friction, capturing the complex non-smooth dynamics introduced by radial clearance. Numerical simulations of a 2 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) shaft system reveal the critical influence of clearance on U-Joint dynamic behavior, including impact-induced oscillations, quasi-periodic motion, and chaotic dynamics, which are essential for accurate driveline modeling and real-time control in automotive, aerospace, and precision medical applications.</description>

      <title>Model Reduction of a Flexible Nonsmooth Oscillator Recovers its Entire Bifurcation Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17947v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the reduced order modeling of a piecewise-linear, globally nonlinear flexible oscillator in which a Bernoulli-Euler beam is subjected to a position-triggered kick force and a piecewise restoring force at its tip. The nonsmooth boundary conditions, which determine different regions of a hybrid phase space, can generally be expected to excite many degrees of freedom. With kick strength as parameter, the system's bifurcation diagram is found to exhibit a range of periodic and chaotic behaviors. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to obtain a single set of global basis functions spanning all of the hybrid regions. The reduced order model (ROM) dimension is chosen using previously developed energy closure analysis, ensuring approximate energy balance on the reduced subspace. This yields accurate ROMs with 8 degrees of freedom. Remarkably, we find that ROMs formulated using using data from individual periodic steady states can nevertheless be used to reconstruct the entire bifurcation structure of the original system without updating. This demonstrates that, despite being constructed with steady state data, the ROMs model sufficiently small transients with enough accuracy to permit using simple continuation for the bifurcation diagram. We also find ROM subspaces obtained for different values of the bifurcation parameter are essentially identical. Thus, POD augmented with energy closure analysis is found to reliably yield effective dimension estimates and ROMs for this nonlinear, nonsmooth system that are robust across stability transitions, including even period doubling cascades to chaos, thereby greatly reducing data requirements and computational costs.</description>

      <title>Harnessing omnipresent oscillator networks as computational resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nature is pervaded with oscillatory dynamics. In networks of coupled oscillators patterns can arise when the system synchronizes to an external input. Hence, these networks provide processing and memory of input. We present a universal framework for harnessing oscillator networks as computational resource. This computing framework is introduced by the ubiquitous model for phase-locking, the Kuramoto model. We force the Kuramoto model by a nonlinear target-system, then after substituting the target-system with a trained feedback-loop it emulates the target-system. Our results are two-fold. Firstly, the trained network inherits performance properties of the Kuramoto model, where all-to-all coupling is performed in linear time with respect to the number of nodes and parameters for synchronization are abundant. The latter implies that the network is generically successful since the system learns via sychronization. Secondly, the learning capabilities of the oscillator network, which describe a type of collective intelligence, can be explained using Kuramoto model's order parameter. In summary, this work provides the foundation for utilizing nature's oscillator networks as a new class of information processing systems.</description>

      <title>2064 global population crisis scenario predicted by the most general dynamic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is currently no consensus on how the global population will evolve in the next decades and in the next century. The reason for this uncertainty is the absence of reliable population dynamic models. In this paper, we remedy to this situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear differential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is able to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the global population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years until now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst) plateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth regimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various limits. Besides showing that this is, indeed, the most general population dynamic model, we use it to explore its solutions projected into the future. In particular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which assumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the past decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the resource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden rise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as 2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in today, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates of the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce by half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new aggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so as to avoid the doomsday scenarios.</description>

      <title>Temporal horizons in forecasting: a performance-learnability trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When training autoregressive models to forecast dynamical systems, a critical question arises: how far into the future should the model be trained to predict? Too short a horizon may miss long-term trends, while too long a horizon can impede convergence due to accumulating prediction errors. In this work, we formalize this trade-off by analyzing how the geometry of the loss landscape depends on the training horizon. We prove that for chaotic systems, the loss landscape's roughness grows exponentially with the training horizon, while for limit cycles, it grows linearly, making long-horizon training inherently challenging. However, we also show that models trained on long horizons generalize well to short-term forecasts, whereas those trained on short horizons suffer exponentially (resp. linearly) worse long-term predictions in chaotic (resp. periodic) systems. We validate our theory through numerical experiments and discuss practical implications for selecting training horizons. Our results provide a principled foundation for hyperparameter optimization in autoregressive forecasting models.</description>
