      <title>Imitation dynamics and the replicator equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary game theory has impacted many fields of research by providing a mathematical framework for studying the evolution and maintenance of social and moral behaviors. This success is owed in large part to the demonstration that the central equation of this theory - the replicator equation - is the deterministic limit of a stochastic imitation (social learning) dynamics. Here we offer an alternative elementary proof of this result, which holds for the scenario where players compare their instantaneous (not average) payoffs to decide whether to maintain or change their strategies, and only more successful individuals can be imitated.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear trend of COVID-19 infection time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a nonlinear method of time series analysis that allows us to obtain multiple nonlinear trends without harmonics from a given set of numerical data. We propose to apply the method to recognize the ongoing status of COVID-19 infection with an analytical equation for nonlinear trends. We found that there is only a single nonlinear trend, and this result justifies the use of a week-based infection growth rate. In addition, the fit with the obtained analytical equation for the nonlinear trend holds for a duration of more than three months for the Delta variant infection time series. The fitting also visualizes the transition to the Omicron variant.</description>

      <title>Locating influential nodes in hypergraphs via fuzzy collective influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex contagion phenomena, such as the spread of information or contagious diseases, often occur among the population due to higher-order interactions between individuals. Individuals who can be represented by nodes in a network may play different roles in the spreading process, and thus finding the most influential nodes in a network has become a crucial topic in network science for applications such as viral marketing, rumor suppression, and disease control. To solve the problem of identifying nodes that have high influence in a complex system, we propose a higher-order distance-based fuzzy centrality methods (HDF and EHDF) that are customized for a hypergraph which can characterize higher-order interactions between nodes via hyperedges. The methods we proposed assume that the influence of a node is reliant on the neighboring nodes with a certain higher-order distance. We compare the proposed methods with the baseline centrality methods to verify their effectiveness. Experimental results on six empirical hypergraphs show that the proposed methods could better identify influential nodes, especially showing plausible performance in finding the top influential nodes. Our proposed theoretical framework for identifying influential nodes could provide insights into how higher-order topological structure can be used for tasks such as vital node identification, influence maximization, and network dismantling.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Common Social and Physical Features of Flash-Flood Vulnerability Hotspots in Urban Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flash flooding events, with their intense and sudden nature, present unique challenges for disaster researchers and emergency planners. To quantify the extent to which hotspots of flash flooding share similar social and physical features, the research uses community scale crowdsourced data and k means clustering. Crowdsourced data offers the potential to allocate limited resources, to improve spatial understanding, and to minimize the future effects of natural hazards. The research evaluates the impacts of Tropical Storm Imelda on Houston Metropolitan and Hurricane Ida on New York City. It develops a combined flash flood impact index based on FEMA claims, 311 calls, and Waze traffic reports which is able to capture a combination of crowdsourced data for the societal impact of flash flooding. In addition, k means clustering offers an essential tool for evaluating attributes associated with flash flooding events by grouping data into k number clusters of features. Thus, k means clustering evaluates the significance of a community's socio demographic, social capital, and physical features to the combined flood impact index. To ensure accessibility and replicability to different types of communities, our research uses publicly available datasets to understand how socio demographic data, social capital, and physical connectivity and development affect flash flood resilience. The findings reveal the intricate relationships associated with flash flooding impact as a combination of socio demographic and physical features. For instance, the cluster with the highest scores of the flash flood impact index from Tropical Storm Imelda had the highest percentage of minority population and lower income while the cluster with the second highest score flash flood impact index had the highest percentage of impervious surface and number of POIs.</description>

Abstract: The growing interaction between traditional knowledge and formal sciences emerges as a relevant field of research. In this perspective, the aim of this article is to investigate the intersections between Physics and traditional knowledge in the ceramics practices of Vila Cuera, in Bragan\c{c}a, state of Para. Using an ethnographic approach, complemented by qualitative analysis, we realize that ceramists use their sensitive intuition and, masterfully, apply thermodynamic principles in the production of handmade ceramics. The results highlight the value of Ethnophysics, underlining that, long before the formal structuring of science as we know it, traditional societies already practiced and understood natural phenomena in tune with contemporary physical principles. We conclude that there is an inherent link between Physics and traditional knowledge with regard to the traditional ceramics practice, grounded on empirical observations and ancestral wisdom, that dialogues with science in a complementary relationship. The study highlights the importance of valuing and recognizing the knowledge of traditional populations by highlighting the knowledge doings of cultures and institutionalized science.</description>

Abstract: The correlation-based financial networks, constructed with the correlation relationships among the time series of fluctuations of daily logarithmic prices of stocks, are intensively studied. However, these studies ignore the importance of negative correlations. This paper is the first time to consider the negative and positive correlations separately, and accordingly to construct weighted temporal antinetwork and network among stocks listed in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. For (anti)networks during the first 24 years of the 21st century, the node's degree and strength, the assortativity coefficient, the average local clustering coefficient, and the average shortest path length are analyzed systematically. This paper unveils some essential differences in these topological measurements between antinetwork and network. The findings of the differences between antinetwork and network have an important role in understanding the dynamics of a financial complex system. The observation of antinetwork is of great importance in optimizing investment portfolios and risk management. More importantly, this paper proposes a new direction for studying complex systems, namely the correlation-based antinetwork.</description>

      <title>Towards a Theoretical Foundation of Process Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Process science is a highly interdisciplinary field of research. Despite numerous proposals, process science lacks an adequate understanding of the core concepts of the field, including notions such as process, event, and system. A more systematic framework to cope with process science is mandatory. We suggest such a framework using an example. The framework itself addresses three aspects: architecture, statics, and dynamics. Corresponding formal concepts, based on established scientific theories, together provide an integrated framework for understanding processes in the world. We argue that our foundations have positive implications not only for theoretical research, but also for empirical research, e.g., because hypothesized relationships can be explicitly tested. It is now time to start a discussion about the foundations of our field.</description>

      <title>Local dominance unveils clusters in networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.15497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clusters or communities can provide a coarse-grained description of complex systems at multiple scales, but their detection remains challenging in practice. Community detection methods often define communities as dense subgraphs, or subgraphs with few connections in-between, via concepts such as the cut, conductance, or modularity. Here we consider another perspective built on the notion of local dominance, where low-degree nodes are assigned to the basin of influence of high-degree nodes, and design an efficient algorithm based on local information. Local dominance gives rises to community centers, and uncovers local hierarchies in the network. Community centers have a larger degree than their neighbors and are sufficiently distant from other centers. The strength of our framework is demonstrated on synthesized and empirical networks with ground-truth community labels. The notion of local dominance and the associated asymmetric relations between nodes are not restricted to community detection, and can be utilised in clustering problems, as we illustrate on networks derived from vector data.</description>

      <title>Simulating Opinion Dynamics with Networks of LLM-based Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09618v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately simulating human opinion dynamics is crucial for understanding a variety of societal phenomena, including polarization and the spread of misinformation. However, the agent-based models (ABMs) commonly used for such simulations often over-simplify human behavior. We propose a new approach to simulating opinion dynamics based on populations of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our findings reveal a strong inherent bias in LLM agents towards producing accurate information, leading simulated agents to consensus in line with scientific reality. This bias limits their utility for understanding resistance to consensus views on issues like climate change. After inducing confirmation bias through prompt engineering, however, we observed opinion fragmentation in line with existing agent-based modeling and opinion dynamics research. These insights highlight the promise and limitations of LLM agents in this domain and suggest a path forward: refining LLMs with real-world discourse to better simulate the evolution of human beliefs.</description>

      <title>Compressing the chronology of a temporal network with graph commutators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies of dynamics on temporal networks often represent the network as a series of "snapshots," static networks active for short durations of time. We argue that successive snapshots can be aggregated if doing so has little effect on the overlying dynamics. We propose a method to compress network chronologies by progressively combining pairs of snapshots whose matrix commutators have the smallest dynamical effect. We apply this method to epidemic modeling on real contact tracing data and find that it allows for significant compression while remaining faithful to the epidemic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Transit Gap: A Comparative Study of On-Demand Bus Services and Urban Climate Resilience in South End, Charlotte, NC and Avondale, Chattanooga, TN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban design significantly impacts sustainability, particularly in the context of public transit efficiency and carbon emissions reduction. This study explores two neighborhoods with distinct urban designs: South End, Charlotte, NC, featuring a dynamic mixed-use urban design pattern, and Avondale, Chattanooga, TN, with a residential suburban grid layout. Using the TRANSIT-GYM tool, we assess the impact of increased bus utilization in these different urban settings on traffic and CO2 emissions. Our results highlight the critical role of urban design and planning in transit system efficiency. In South End, the mixed-use design led to more substantial emission reductions, indicating that urban layout can significantly influence public transit outcomes. Tailored strategies that consider the unique urban design elements are essential for climate resilience. Notably, doubling bus utilization decreased daily emissions by 10.18% in South End and 8.13% in Avondale, with a corresponding reduction in overall traffic. A target of 50% bus utilization saw emissions drop by 21.45% in South End and 14.50% in Avondale. At an idealistic goal of 70% bus utilization, South End and Avondale witnessed emission reductions of 37.22% and 27.80%, respectively. These insights are crucial for urban designers and policymakers in developing sustainable urban landscapes.</description>
