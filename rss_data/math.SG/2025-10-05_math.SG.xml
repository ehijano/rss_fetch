      <title>Random Hamiltonians I: Probability measures and random walks on the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of probability measures on the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$. We show that these measures are Borel measures with respect to the topology induced by the Hofer metric. Further, we show that these measures turn any Hofer-Lipschitz function into a random variable with finite expectation. These measures have (for suitable choices of parameters) several desirable properties, such as full support on $\text{Ham}(M,\omega)$, explicit estimates of the measure of Hofer-balls, and certain controls under the action of the group. We also define a family of probability measures on the space of autonomous Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. These measures have similar properties and give rise to a random walk on the group $\text{Ham}(M,\omega)$. Finally, we show that under certain limits this construction gives rise to probability measures on the space of Hamiltonian homeomorphisms and on the metric completion of $\text{Ham}(M,\omega)$ with respect to the Hofer metric and the spectral metric.</description>

      <title>Non-squeezing and capacities for some calibrated geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was shown by Barron--Shafiee that an analogue of Gromov's non-squeezing theorem holds for affine maps which preserve a power $\omega^k$ of the symplectic form $\omega$ on $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. In the present paper, we state and prove in two ways an improved version of their result which is closer to the classical affine non-squeezing theorem. One proof closely follows their argument, and the other consists of a reduction to the classical case by showing that, except for the case $k = n$, every linear map that preserves $\omega^k$ must be symplectic or anti-symplectic.
  We then study when a calibration form satisfies an (affine) non-squeezing theorem. Particular focus is given to the special Lagrangian case, where we are able to establish an affine non-squeezing theorem for the holomorphic volume form $\Omega = dz^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dz^n$. The classical symplectic affine rigidity theorem states roughly that a non-singular linear map is symplectic or anti-symplectic if and only if it preserves the "capacity" of every ellipsoid. We establish an affine special Lagrangian version of this theorem under the additional assumption that the map is complex-linear. We also discuss some natural future questions.</description>

      <title>Nodal resolution of quasiregular curves via bubble trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a version of Gromov's compactness theorem for quasiregular curves into calibrated manifolds with bounded geometry. In our main theorem, given an $n$-dimensional calibration $\omega$ on manifold $N$, we associate to a weak-$\star$ limit $\mu = \lim_{k \to \infty} \star F_k^*\omega$ of measures induced by a sequence $(F_k \colon X\to N)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ of $K$-quasiregular $\omega$-curves on a nodal manifold $X$, a bubble tree $\widehat X$ over $X$, a sequence of mappings $(\widehat F_\ell \colon X \to N)_{\ell \in \mathbb{N}}$ converging locally uniformly to a quasiregular curve $\widehat F\colon \widehat X\to N$ which realizes the measure $\mu$, that is, $\mu = \pi_*(\star \widehat F^*\omega)$, where $\pi \colon \widehat X\to X$ is the natural projection. We call the sequence $(\widehat F_\ell)_{\ell \in \mathbb{N}}$ a nodal resolution of the sequence $(F_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$. As a corollary we obtain a normality criterion for families of quasiregular curves. Classic interpretations of bubbling via Gromov--Hausdorff convergence and pinching maps also follow.</description>

      <title>Non-Simple knots in Contact 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new families of examples of non-simple prime Legendrian and transversal knots in tight Lens spaces, which demonstrate that the botany of Legendrians in Lens space is rich. In fact, there are more non-isotopic Legendrians that are topologically isotopic to the $n$-twist knot in a Lens space $L(\alpha, \beta)$ than in $S^3$. We also include connect sum formulas for rational variants of classical invariants, $\mathrm{tb}_\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathrm{rot}_\mathbb{Q}$, and $\mathrm{sl}_\mathbb{Q}$, which indicate that prime knots are the right playground to look for exotic behaviour.</description>

      <title>Non-degenerate mixed maps and contact structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry and topology of real analytic maps $\mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^k$, where $n &gt; k$, regarded as mixed maps, defined below. Firstly, we give two natural families of mixed isolated complete intersection singularities, called mixed ICIS, which are interesting on their own. We consider the notion of (partial) non-degeneracy for mixed maps; we prove that these define mixed ICIS and that, under suitable conditions, admit a local Milnor fibration. Then, building on previous constructions due to Oka, we obtain natural contact structures and adapted open books on a particular class of mixed links. Finally, we look at mixed links that are diffeomorphic to holomorphic ones, and we address the problem of comparing different contact structures.</description>

      <title>A Gromov-Witten approach to $G$-equivariant birational invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07322v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2404.19088, we initiated a program linking birational invariants with smooth ones and offering new interpretations of classical invariants, such as the Kervaire-Milnor invariants. Here, we rely on the profound geometric reasoning provided by Lupercio and Uribe in the early 00s to establish a connection between Chen-Ruan cohomology and several $G$-birational invariants introduced in the pioneering works Kontsevich, Kresch, Pestun, Tschinkel, along with presenting applications. Combined with the theory of atoms by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Pantev, and Yu, the proposal in this paper program will lead to a theory of equivariant atoms.</description>
