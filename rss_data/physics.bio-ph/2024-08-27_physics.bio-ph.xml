      <title>Easy-Plane Alignment of Anisotropic Biofluid Crystals in a Magnetic Field: Implications for Rod Orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the orientation in a uniform magnetic field of rod-like anisotropic biofluid crystals with an easy plane that makes an oblique angle with the crystal's c-axis. For a sufficiently strong field, these crystalline rods orient themselves such that the crystal's easy plane is parallel to the magnetic field, the rod's direction being defined as the direction of the crystal's c-axis. As the rod rotates about the crystal's hard axis there will therefore be a range of angles that the rod makes with the magnetic field. We detail this behavior by first providing illustrations of hemozoin crystals at various orientations. These illustrations clearly demonstrate that the orientation angle that the crystalline rod makes with respect to the magnetic field varies from about 30 deg to 150 deg. We also derive an analytical expression for the probability density function for the orientation angle. We find that the orientation angles are not uniformly distributed between the limits of 30 deg and 150 deg, but rather tend to cluster near these limits. This suggests experimental tests and addresses confusion about the rod orientation found in past literature. The relevance to other anisotropic biofluid crystals, such as those produced by gout, is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Peptide Classification from Statistical Analysis of Nanopore Translocation Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein characterization using nanopore-based devices promises to be a breakthrough method in basic research, diagnostics, and analytics. Current research includes the use of machine learning to achieve this task. In this work, a comprehensive statistical analysis of nanopore current signals is performed and demonstrated to be sufficient for classifying up to 42 peptides with 70 % accuracy. Two sets of features, the statistical moments and the catch22 set, are compared both in their representations and after training small classifier neural networks. We demonstrate that complex features of the events, captured in both the catch22 set and the central moments, are key in classifying peptides with otherwise similar mean currents. These results highlight the efficacy of purely statistical analysis of nanopore data and suggest a path forward for more sophisticated classification techniques.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of bacterial rheotaxis in non-Newtonian fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteria often exhibit upstream swimming, which can cause the contamination of biomedical devices and the infection of organs including the urethra or lungs. This process, called rheotaxis, has been studied extensively in Newtonian fluids. However, most microorganisms thrive in non-Newtonian fluids that contain suspended polymers such as mucus and biofilms. Here, we investigate the rheotatic behavior of E. coli near walls in non-Newtonian fluids. Our experiments demonstrate that bacterial upstream swimming is enhanced by an order of magnitude in shear-thinning polymeric fluids relative to Newtonian fluids. This result is explained by direct numerical simulations, revealing a torque that promotes the alignment of bacteria against the flow. From this analysis, we develop a theoretical model that accurately describes experimental rheotatic data in both Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids.</description>

      <title>Giant enhancement of bacterial upstream swimming in macromolecular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many bacteria live in natural and clinical environments with abundant macromolecular polymers. Macromolecular fluids commonly display viscoelasticity and non-Newtonian rheological behavior; it is unclear how these complex-fluid properties affect bacterial transport in flows. Here we combine high-resolution microscopy and numerical simulations to study bacterial response to shear flows of various macromolecular fluids. In stark contrast to the case in Newtonian shear flows, we found that flagellated bacteria in macromolecular flows display a giant capacity of upstream swimming (a behavior resembling fish swimming against current) near solid surfaces: The cells can counteract flow washing at shear rates up to ~65 $s^{-1}$, one order of magnitude higher than the limit for cells swimming in Newtonian flows. The significant enhancement of upstream swimming depends on two characteristic complex-fluid properties, namely viscoelasticity and shear-thinning viscosity; meanwhile, increasing the viscosity with a Newtonian polymer can prevent upstream motion. By visualizing flagellar bundles and modeling bacterial swimming in complex fluids, we explain the phenomenon as primarily arising from the augmentation of a "weathervane effect" in macromolecular flows due to the presence of a viscoelastic lift force and a shear-thinning induced azimuthal torque promoting the alignment of bacteria against the flow direction. Our findings shed light on bacterial transport and surface colonization in macromolecular environments, and may inform the design of artificial helical microswimmers for biomedical applications in physiological conditions.</description>

      <title>The untapped power of a general theory of organismal metabolism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What makes living things special is how they manage matter, energy, and entropy. A general theory of organismal metabolism should therefore be quantified in these three currencies while capturing the unique way they flow between individuals and their environments. We argue that such a theory has quietly arrived -- 'Dynamic Energy Budget' (DEB) theory -- which conceptualises organisms as a series of macrochemical reactions that use energy to transform food into structured biomass and bioproducts while producing entropy. We show that such conceptualisation is deeply rooted in thermodynamic principles and that, with the help of a small set of biological assumptions, it underpins the emergence of fundamental ecophysiological phenomena, most notably the three-quarter power scaling of metabolism. Building on the subcellular nature of the theory, we unveil the eco-evolutionary relevance of coarse-graining biomass into qualitatively distinct, stoichiometricially fixed pools with implicitly regulated dynamics based on surface area-volume relations. We also show how generalised enzymes called 'synthesising units' and an information-based state variable called 'maturity' capture transitions between ecological and physiological metabolic interactions, and thereby transitions between unicellular and multicellular metabolic organisation. Formal theoretical frameworks make the constraints imposed by the laws of nature explicit, which in turn leads to better research hypotheses and avoids errors in reasoning. DEB theory uniquely applies thermodynamic formalism to organismal metabolism, linking biological processes across different scales through the transformation of matter and energy, the production of entropy, and the exchange of information. We propose ways in which the theory can inform trans-disciplinary efforts at the frontiers of the life sciences.</description>

      <title>RiD-kit: Software package designed to do enhanced sampling using reinforced dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing an efficient method to accelerate the speed of molecular dynamics is a central theme in the field of molecular simulation. One category among the methods are collective-variable-based methods, which rely on predefined collective variables (CVs). The difficulty of selecting a few important CVs hinders the methods to be applied to large systems easily. Here we present a CV-based enhanced sampling method RiD-kit, which could handle a large number of CVs and perform efficient sampling. The method could be applied to various kinds of systems, including biomolecules, chemical reactions and materials. In this protocol, we guide the users through all phases of the RiD-kit workflow, from preparing the input files, setting the simulation parameters and analyzing the results. The RiD-kit workflow provides an efficient and user-friendly command line tool which could submit jobs to various kinds of platforms including the high-performance computers (HPC), cloud server and local machines.</description>

Abstract: Lipid membranes have complex compositions and modeling the thermodynamic properties of multi-component lipid systems remains a remote goal. In this work we attempt to describe the thermodynamics of binary lipid mixtures by mapping coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to two-dimensional simple fluid mixtures. By computing and analysing the density fluctuations of this model lipid bilayer we determine the numerical value of the quadratic coupling term appearing in a model of regular solutions for the DPPC-DLiPC pair of lipids at three different compositions. Our methodology is general and discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop control of active nematic flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living things enact control of non-equilibrium, dynamical structures through complex biochemical networks, accomplishing spatiotemporally-orchestrated physiological tasks such as cell division, motility, and embryogenesis. While the exact minimal mechanisms needed to replicate these behaviors using synthetic active materials are unknown, controlling the complex, often chaotic, dynamics of active materials is essential to their implementation as engineered life-like materials. Here, we demonstrate the use of external feedback control to regulate and control the spatially-averaged speed of a model active material with time-varying actuation through applied light. We systematically vary the controller parameters to analyze the steady-state flow speed and temporal fluctuations, finding the experimental results in excellent agreement with predictions from both a minimal coarse-grained model and full nematohydrodynamic simulations. Our findings demonstrate that proportional-integral control can effectively regulate the dynamics of active nematics in light of challenges posed by the constituents, such as sample aging, protein aggregation, and sample-to-sample variability. As in living things, deviations of active materials from their steady-state behavior can arise from internal processes and we quantify the important consequences of this coupling on the controlled behavior of the active nematic. Finally, the interaction between the controller and the intrinsic timescales of the active material can induce oscillatory behaviors in a regime of parameter space that qualitatively matches predictions from our model. This work underscores the potential of feedback control in manipulating the complex dynamics of active matter, paving the way for more sophisticated control strategies in the design of responsive, life-like materials.</description>

      <title>Stability distillation hypothesis for the origin of life</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through in-depth thinking and reasoning about the conditions required for cells to maintain unchanged material distribution, it is concluded that life metabolic reactions require high information content. However, the self-replication of a few macromolecules such as RNA and DNA can only retain information, but cannot generate information. When thinking about the possible ways in which this information is generated, one possible way is to maintain the distribution of substances in the cell through selective permeability and active transport of membranes. This mechanism still plays an important role in today's cells but it is difficult to generate enough information. Another possible way is to generate information through stability-distillation, which continuously changes the molecular frequency distribution in the system through periodic changes in the environment and generates information from a consequentialist perspective. Unlike the RNA world hypothesis, under this hypothesis, life does not need to originate from a few self-replicating macromolecules, making the entire hypothesis more reasonable.</description>

      <title>Unclocklike oscillators with frequency memory for the entrainment of biological clocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entrainment experiments on the vertebrate segmentation clock have revealed that embryonic oscillators actively change their internal frequency to adapt to the driving signal. This is neither consistent with a one-dimensional clock model nor with a limit-cycle model, but rather suggests a new "unclocklike" behavior. In this work, we propose simple, biologically realistic descriptions of such internal frequency adaptation, where a phase oscillator activates a memory variable controlling the oscillator's frequency. We study two opposite limits for the control of the memory variable, one with a smooth phase-averaging memory field, and the other with a pulsatile, phase-dependent activation. Both models recapitulate intriguing properties of the entrained segmentation clock, such as very broad Arnold tongues and an entrainment phase plateauing with detuning. We compute analytically multiple properties of such systems, such as entrainment phases and cycle shapes. We further describe new phenomena, including hysteresis in entrainment, bistability in the frequency of the entrained oscillator, and probabilistic entrainment. Our work shows that oscillators with frequency memory can exhibit new classes of unclocklike properties, that can be tested through experimental entrainment.</description>

      <title>Qualitatively Distinct Signaling in Cells: The Informational Landscape of Amplitude and Frequency Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cells continuously sense their surroundings to detect modifications and generate responses. Very often changes in extracellular concentrations initiate signaling cascades that eventually result in changes in gene expression. Increasing stimulus strengths can be encoded in increasing concentration amplitudes or increasing activation frequencies of intermediaries of the pathway. In this paper we show that the different way in which amplitude and frequency encoding map environmental changes endow cells with qualitatively different information transmission capabilities. While amplitude encoding is optimal for a limited range of stimuli strengths, frequency encoding can transmit information with equal reliability over much broader ranges. The qualitative difference between the two strategies stems from the scale invariant discriminating power of the first transducing step in frequency codification. The apparently redundant combination of both strategies in some cell types may then serve the purpose of expanding the span over which stimulus strengths can be reliably discriminated. In this paper we discuss a possible example of this mechanism in yeast.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When legged robots physically interact with obstacles in applications such as search and rescue through rubble and planetary exploration across Martain rocks, even the most advanced ones struggle because they lack a fundamental framework to model the robot-obstacle physical interaction paralleling artificial potential fields for obstacle avoidance. To remedy this, recent studies established a novel framework - potential energy landscape modeling - that explains and predicts the destabilizing transitions across locomotor modes from the physical interaction between robots and obstacles, and governs a wide range of complex locomotion. However, this framework was confined to the laboratory because we lack methods to obtain the potential energy landscape in unknown environments. Here, we explore the feasibility of introducing this framework to such environments. We showed that a robot can reconstruct the potential energy landscape for unknown obstacles by measuring the obstacle contact forces and resulting torques. To elaborate, we developed a minimalistic robot capable of sensing contact forces and torques when propelled against a pair of grass-like obstacles. Despite the forces and torques not being fully conservative, they well-matched the potential energy landscape gradients, and the reconstructed landscape well-matched ground truth. In addition, we found that using normal forces and torques and head oscillation inspired by cockroach observations further improved the estimation of conservative ones. Our study will finally inspire free-running robots to achieve low-effort, "zero-shot" traversing clustered, large obstacles in real-world applications by sampling contact forces and torques and reconstructing the landscape around its neighboring states in real time.</description>

Abstract: Multiphase field models have emerged as an important computational tool for understanding biological tissue while resolving single-cell properties. While they have successfully reproduced many experimentally observed behaviors of living tissue, the theoretical underpinnings have not been fully explored. We show that a two-dimensional version of the model, which is commonly employed to study tissue monolayers, can be derived from a three-dimensional version in the presence of a substrate. We also show how viscous forces, which arise from friction between different cells, can be included in the model. Finally, we numerically simulate a tissue monolayer, and find that intercellular friction tends to solidify the tissue.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic dissipation does not bound replicator growth and decay rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a well-known paper, Jeremy England derived a bound on the free energy dissipated by a self-replicating system [England, "Statistical physics of self-replication", The Journal of Chemical Physics, 2013]. This bound is usually interpreted as a universal relationship that connects thermodynamic dissipation to replicator per-capita decay and growth rates. We argue from basic thermodynamic principles against this interpretation. In fact, we suggest that such a relationship cannot exist in principle, because it is impossible for a thermodynamically-consistent replicator to undergo both per-capita growth and per-capita decay back into reactants. On the other hand, a replicator may undergo per-capita decay into separate waste products, but in that case replication and decay are two independent physical processes, and there is no universal relationship that connects their thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cell segmentation is essential in biomedical research for analyzing cellular morphology and behavior. Deep learning methods, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have revolutionized cell segmentation by extracting intricate features from images. However, the robustness of these methods under microscope optical aberrations remains a critical challenge. This study evaluates cell image segmentation models under optical aberrations from fluorescence and bright field microscopy. By simulating different types of aberrations, including astigmatism, coma, spherical aberration, trefoil, and mixed aberrations, we conduct a thorough evaluation of various cell instance segmentation models using the DynamicNuclearNet (DNN) and LIVECell datasets, representing fluorescence and bright field microscopy cell datasets, respectively. We train and test several segmentation models, including the Otsu threshold method and Mask R-CNN with different network heads (FPN, C3) and backbones (ResNet, VGG, Swin Transformer), under aberrated conditions. Additionally, we provide usage recommendations for the Cellpose 2.0 Toolbox on complex cell degradation images. The results indicate that the combination of FPN and SwinS demonstrates superior robustness in handling simple cell images affected by minor aberrations. In contrast, Cellpose 2.0 proves effective for complex cell images under similar conditions. Furthermore, we innovatively propose the Point Spread Function Image Label Classification Model (PLCM). This model can quickly and accurately identify aberration types and amplitudes from PSF images, assisting researchers without optical training. Through PLCM, researchers can better apply our proposed cell segmentation guidelines.</description>
