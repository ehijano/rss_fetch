      <title>How the physics culture shapes the experiences of undergraduate women physics majors: A comparative case study of three physics departments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present comparative case study of three physics department culture from different institutions using the experiences undergraduate women. The three studies conducted in the United States include Johnson's 2020 study in a small physics department at a small predominantly White liberal arts college, Santana and Singh's 2023 study at a large predominantly White research institution, and Santana and Singh's 2024 study in a medium-sized physics department at a small predominantly White private liberal arts college. Using synergistic frameworks such as Standpoint Theory, Domains of Power, and the Holistic Ecosystem for Learning Physics in an Inclusive and Equitable Environment and reflections from undergraduate women, we aim to understand how those in the position of power, e.g., instructors, have important roles in establishing and maintaining safe, equitable, and inclusive environments for undergraduate students. Their accounts help us contrast the experiences of undergraduate women in physics departments with very different cultures. This comparative analysis is especially important for reflecting upon what can be done to improve the physics culture so that historically marginalized students such as women and ethnic and racial minority students in physics feel supported and thrive. In particular, this comparative case study can be invaluable to understand the positive and negative aspects of the physics culture as they impact undergraduate women majoring in physics within these three departments. This analysis can help other physics departments contemplate strategies to improve the physics culture so that all undergraduate physics majors have validating experiences while navigating their physics journey regardless of their identities.</description>

      <title>How to quantify an examination? Evidence from physics examinations via complex networks</title>

Abstract: Given the untapped potential for continuous improvement of examinations, quantitative investigations of examinations could guide efforts to considerably improve learning efficiency and evaluation and thus greatly help both learners and educators. However, there is a general lack of quantitative methods for investigating examinations. To address this gap, we propose a new metric via complex networks; i.e., the knowledge point network (KPN) of an examination is constructed by representing the knowledge points (concepts, laws, etc.) as nodes and adding links when these points appear in the same question. Then, the topological quantities of KPNs, such as degree, centrality, and community, can be employed to systematically explore the structural properties and evolution of examinations. In this work, 35 physics examinations from the NCEE examination spanning from 2006 to 2020 were investigated as an evidence. We found that the constructed KPNs are scale-free networks that show strong assortativity and small-world effects in most cases. The communities within the KPNs are obvious, and the key nodes are mainly related to mechanics and electromagnetism. Different question types are related to specific knowledge points, leading to noticeable structural variations in KPNs. Moreover, changes in the KPN topology between examinations administered in different years may offer insights guiding college entrance examination reforms. Based on topological quantities such as the average degree, network density, average clustering coefficient, and network transitivity, the Fd is proposed to evaluate examination difficulty. All the above results show that our approach can comprehensively quantify the knowledge structures and examination characteristics. These networks may elucidate comprehensive examination knowledge graphs for educators and guide improvements in teaching.</description>
