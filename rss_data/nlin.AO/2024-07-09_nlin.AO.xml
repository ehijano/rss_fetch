      <title>Designing self-adaptive network with thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For real-world complex system constantly enduring perturbation, to achieve survival goal in changing yet unknown environments, the central problem is designing a self-adaptation strategy instead of fixed control strategies, which enables system to adjust its internal multi-scale structure according to environmental feedback. Inspired by thermodynamics, we develop a self-adaptive network utilizing only macroscopic information to achieve desired landscape through reconfiguring itself in unknown environments. By continuously estimating environment entropy, our designed self-adaptive network can adaptively realize desired landscape represented by topological measures. The adaptability of this network is achieved under several scenarios, including confinement on phase space and geographic constraint. The adaptation process is described by relative entropy corresponding to the Boltzmann H function, which decreases with time following unique power law distinguishing our self-adaptive network from memoryless systems. Moreover, we demonstrate the transformability of our self-adaptive network, as a critical mechanism of complex system resilience, allowing for transitions from one target landscape to another. Compared to data-driven methods, our self-adaptive network is understandable without careful choice of learning architecture and parameters. Our designed self-adaptive network could help to understand system intelligence through the lens of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Exploring localization in nonlinear oscillator systems through network-based predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localized vibrations, arising from nonlinearities or symmetry breaking, pose a challenge in engineering, as the resulting high-amplitude vibrations may result in component failure due to fatigue. During operation, the emergence of localization is difficult to predict, partly because of changing parameters over the life cycle of a system. This work proposes a novel, network-based approach to predicting an imminent localized vibration. Synthetic measurement data is used to generate a functional network, which captures the dynamic interplay of the machine parts, complementary to their geometric coupling. Analysis of these functional networks reveals an impending localized vibration and its location. The method is demonstrated using a model system for a bladed disk, a ring composed of coupled nonlinear Duffing oscillators. Results indicate that the proposed method is robust against small parameter uncertainties, added measurement noise, and the length of the measurement data samples. The source code for this work is available.</description>
