      <title>Intricate Magnetism and Topological Hall Effect Observed in Cr$_{0.83}$Te</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the magnetic, electrical, and magnetotransport (Hall effect) properties of the hexagonal itinerant ferromagnet Cr$_{0.83}$Te. Further, a comprehensive study of the magneto-entropy scaling behavior has been done around the Curie temperature of $T_C \approx$ 338 K. A maximum entropy change (-$\Delta S_{m}^{max}$) of 2.77 $J/kg-K$ and relative cooling power (RCP) of 88.29 $J/kg$ near the T$_C$ have been achieved under an applied magnetic field of 5 Tesla. The critical exponents, $\beta$ = 0.4739(4), $\gamma$ = 1.2812(3), and $\delta$ = 3.7037(5), have been extracted using the magneto-entropy scaling analysis. The obtained critical exponents indicate the presence of intricate magnetic interactions in Cr$_{0.83}$Te. On the other hand, the magnetotransport study reveals a topological Hall effect attributed to the noncoplanar spin structure coexisting with a robust magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Further, we observe that the extrinsic skew-scattering mechanism originated anomalous Hall effect. Our experimental findings of the anomalous and topological Hall effect properties in the presence of intriguing high-temperature itinerant ferromagnetism and magnetocaloric effect in Cr$_{0.83}$Te can offer potential technological applications at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Effective uniaxial dielectric function tensor and optical phonons in ($\bar{2}01$)-plane oriented $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films with equally-distributed six-fold rotation domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films grown on $c$-plane sapphire have been shown to exhibit six $(\bar{2}01)$-plane oriented domains, which are equally-spaced-by-rotation around the surface normal and equally-sized-by-volume that render the film optical response effectively uniaxial. We derive and discuss an optical model suitable for ellipsometry data analysis of such films. We model mid- and far-infrared ellipsometry data from undoped and electrically insulating films with an effective uniaxial dielectric tensor based on projections of all phonon modes within the rotation domains parallel and perpendicular to the sample normal, i.e., to the reciprocal lattice vector $\mathbf{g}_{\bar{2}01}$. Two effective response functions are described by model, and found sufficient to calculate ellipsometry data that best-match measured ellipsometry data from a representative film. We propose to render either effective dielectric functions, or inverse effective dielectric functions, each separately for electric field directions parallel and perpendicular to $\mathbf{g}_{\bar{2}01}$, by sums of Lorentz oscillators, which permit to determine either sets of transverse optical phonon mode parameters, or sets of longitudinal optical phonon mode parameters, respectively. Transverse optical modes common to both dielectric functions can be traced back to single crystal modes with $B_{\mathrm{u}}$ character, while modes with $A_{\mathrm{u}}$ character only appear within the dielectric function for polarization perpendicular to the sample surface. The thereby obtained parameter sets reveal all phonon modes anticipated from averaging over the six-fold rotation domains of single crystal $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, but with slightly shifted transverse optical, and completely different longitudinal optical phonon modes.</description>

      <title>Building Workflows for Interactive Human in the Loop Automated Experiment (hAE) in STEM-EELS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the structural, chemical, and physical properties of matter on the nano- and atomic scales has become possible with the recent advances in aberration-corrected electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). However, the current paradigm of STEM-EELS relies on the classical rectangular grid sampling, in which all surface regions are assumed to be of equal a priori interest. This is typically not the case for real-world scenarios, where phenomena of interest are concentrated in a small number of spatial locations. One of foundational problems is the discovery of nanometer- or atomic scale structures having specific signatures in EELS spectra. Here we systematically explore the hyperparameters controlling deep kernel learning (DKL) discovery workflows for STEM-EELS and identify the role of the local structural descriptors and acquisition functions on the experiment progression. In agreement with actual experiment, we observe that for certain parameter combinations the experiment path can be trapped in the local minima. We demonstrate the approaches for monitoring automated experiment in the real and feature space of the system and monitor knowledge acquisition of the DKL model. Based on these, we construct intervention strategies, thus defining human-in the loop automated experiment (hAE). This approach can be further extended to other techniques including 4D STEM and other forms of spectroscopic imaging.</description>

      <title>A Pathway to Efficient Simulations of Charge Density Waves in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides: A Case Study for TiSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge density waves (CDWs) in transition metal dichalcogenides are the subject of growing scientific interest due to their rich interplay with exotic phases of matter and their potential technological applications. Here, using density functional theory with advanced meta-generalized gradient approximations (meta-GGAs) and linear response time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with state-of-the-art exchange-correlation kernels, we investigate the electronic, vibrational, and optical properties in 1T-TiSe2 with and without CDW. In both bulk and monolayer TiSe2, the electronic bands and phonon dispersions in either normal (semi-metallic) or CDW (semiconducting) phase are described well via meta-GGAs, which separate the valence and conduction bands just as HSE06 does but with significantly more computational feasibility. Instead of the underestimated gap with standard exchange-correlation approximations and the overestimated gap with screened hybrid functional HSE06, the band gap of the monolayer TiSe2 CDW phase calculated by the meta-GGA MVS (151 meV) is consistent with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) gap of 153 meV measured at 10 K. In addition, the gap of bulk TiSe2 CDW phase reaches 67 meV within the TASK approximation, close to the ARPES gap of 82 meV. Regarding excitations of many-body nature, for bulk TiSe2 in normal and CDW phases, the experimentally observed humps of electron energy loss spectroscopy and plasmon peak are successfully reproduced in TDDFT, without an obvious kernel dependence. To unleash the full scientific and technological potential of CDWs in transition metal dichalcogenides, the chemical doping, heterostructure engineering, and pump-probe techniques are needed. Our study opens the door to simulating these complexities in CDW compounds from first principles by revealing meta-GGAs as an accurate low-cost alternative to HSE06.</description>

      <title>Generalized Pitaevskii relation between rectifying and linear responses: its application to reciprocal magnetization induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optics has regained attention in recent years, especially in the context of optospintronics and topological materials. Nonlinear responses involved in various degrees of freedom manifest their intricacy more pronounced than linear responses. However, for a certain class of nonlinear responses, a connection can be established with linear-response coefficients, enabling the exploration of diverse nonlinear-response functionality in terms of the linear-response counterpart. Our study quantum-mechanically elucidates the relation between such nonlinear and linear responses we call the Pitevskii relation and identifies the condition for the relation to hold. Following the obtained general formulation, we systematically identify the Pitaevskii relations such as the inverse magnetoelectric effect and inverse natural optical activity unique to systems manifesting the space-inversion-symmetry breaking. These results provide a systematic understanding of intricate nonlinear responses and may offer further implications to ultrafast spintronics.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Secondary and Backscattered Electron Energy Spectra and Yields Analysis: from Theory to Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, experimental microscopy and spectroscopy have made significant progress in the study of the morphological, optical, electronic and transport properties of materials. These developments include higher spatial resolution, shorter acquisition times, more efficient monochromators and electron analysers, improved contrast imaging and advancements in sample preparation techniques. These advances have driven the need for more accurate theoretical descriptions and predictions of material properties. Computer simulations based on first principles and Monte Carlo methods have emerged as a rapidly growing field for modeling the interaction of charged particles, such as electron, proton and ion beams, with various systems, such as slabs, nanostructures and crystals. This report delves into the theoretical and computational approaches to modeling the physico-chemical mechanisms that occur when charged beams interact with a medium. These mechanisms encompass single and collective electronic excitation, ionization of the target atoms and the generation of a secondary electron cascade that deposits energy into the irradiated material. We show that the combined application of ab initio methods, which are able to model the dynamics of interacting many-fermion systems, and Monte Carlo methods, which capture statistical fluctuations in energy loss mechanisms by random sampling, proves to be an optimal strategy for the accurate description of charge transport in solids. This joint quantitative approach enables the theoretical interpretation of excitation, loss and secondary electron spectra, the analysis of the chemical composition and dielectric properties of solids and contributes to our understanding of irradiation-induced damage in materials, including those of biological significance.</description>

      <title>Seashell-inspired polarization-sensitive tonotopic metasensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bioinspiration has widely been demonstrated to be a powerful approach for the design of innovative structures and devices. Recently, this concept has been extended to the field of elasticity, dynamics, and metamaterials. In this paper, we propose a seashell-inspired metasensor that can simultaneously perform spatial frequency mapping and act as a polarizer. The structure emerges from a universal parametric design that encompasses diverse spiral geometries with varying circular cross sections and curvature radii, all leading to tonotopic behavior. Adoption of an optimization process leads to a planar geometry that enables us to simultaneously achieve tonotopy for orthogonally polarized modes, leading to the possibility to control polarization as well as the spatial distribution of frequency maxima along the spiral axis. We demonstrate the versatility of the device and discuss the possible applications in the field of acoustics and sensing.</description>

      <title>Tuning Magnetic and Optical Properties in MnxZn1-xPS3 Single Crystals by the Alloying Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials has shown great promise and interest in tuning the magnetic and electronic properties as well as studying magneto-optical effects. The current work investigates the control of magneto-optical interactions in alloyed MnxZn1-xPS3 lamellar semiconductor single crystals, with the Mn/Zn ratio regulating the coupling strength. Magnetic susceptibility results show a retention of AFM order followed by a decrease in N\'eel temperatures down to ~ 40% Mn concentration, below which a paramagnetic behavior is observed. Absorption measurements reveal an increase in bandgap energy with higher Zn(II) concentration, and the presence of Mn(II) d-d transition below the absorption edge. DFT+U approach qualitatively explained the origin and the position of the experimentally observed mid band-gap states in pure MnPS3, and corresponding peaks visible in the alloyed systems MnxZn1-xPS3. Accordingly, emission at 1.3 eV in all alloyed compounds results from recombination from a 4T1g Mn(II) excited state to a hybrid p-d state at the valence band. Most significant, temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) intensity trends demonstrate strong magneto-optical coupling in compositions with x &gt; 0.65. This study underscores the potential of tailored alloy compositions as a means to control magnetic and optical properties in 2D materials, paving the way for advances in spin-based technologies.</description>

      <title>The photoinduced hidden metallic phase of monoclinic VO2 driven by local nucleation via a self-amplification process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) in vanadium dioxide (VO2) has garnered extensive attention for its potential applications in ultrafast switches, neuronal network architectures, and storage technologies. However, a significant controversy persists regarding the formation of the IMT, specifically concerning whether a complete structural phase transition from monoclinic (M1) to rutile (R) phase is necessary. Here we employ the real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) to track the dynamic evolution of atomic and electronic structures in photoexcited VO2, revealing the emergence of a long-lived monoclinic metal phase (MM) under low electronic excitation. The emergence of the metal phase in the monoclinic structure originates from the dissociation of the local V-V dimer, driven by the self-trapped and self-amplified dynamics of photoexcited holes, rather than by a pure electron-electron correction. On the other hand, the M1-to-R phase transition does appear at higher electronic excitation. Our findings validate the existence of MM phase and provide a comprehensive picture of the IMT in photoexcited VO2.</description>

      <title>Low-symmetry polymorph of GaP upends bonding paradigms of metallic high-pressure III-V compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pressure-induced polymorphism of binary octect compounds has long been considered a settled problem although the possible atomic disordering of some phases remains a puzzling observation. Taking GaP as a case study, we conclude, through x-ray microdiffraction and first-principles calculations, that its high-pressure phase II (previously reported as being disordered) adopts in fact an ordered base-centered monoclinic structure previously unknown in this class of compounds. The formation of layered patterns with variable degrees of interlayer dimerization, as observed in GaP, marks a paradigm shift of our understanding of ordering in octect high-pressure phases which calls for a more extensive re-examination. A rich polymorphism with fine tuning of chemical and physical properties can be envisioned.</description>

      <title>Respective Roles of Electron-Phonon and Electron-Electron Interactions in the Transport and Quasiparticle Properties of SrVO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral and transport properties of strongly correlated metals, such as SrVO$_3$ (SVO), are widely attributed to electron-electron ($e$-$e$) interactions, with lattice vibrations (phonons) playing a secondary role. Here, using first-principles electron-phonon ($e$-ph) and dynamical mean field theory calculations, we show that $e$-ph interactions play an essential role in SVO: they govern the electron scattering and resistivity in a wide temperature range down to 30 K, and induce an experimentally observed kink in the spectral function. In contrast, the $e$-$e$ interactions control quasiparticle renormalizations and low temperature transport, and enhance the $e$-ph coupling. We clarify the origin of the near $T^2$ temperature dependence of the resistivity by analyzing the $e$-$e$ and $e$-ph limited transport regimes. Our work disentangles the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in a prototypical correlated metal, revealing the dominant role of $e$-ph interactions in SVO.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Study of Penta-CN2 Quantum Dots for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of our research is to investigate the electrocatalytic properties of novel metal-free quantum dots (QDs) composed of the recently discovered 2D material penta-CN2, with the aim of replacing costly and scarce catalysts such as Pt and Pd. Employing a first-principles density functional theory (DFT) based approach, the geometries of the three penta-CN2 quantum dots (QDs) of increasing sizes, 3 x 3, 3 x 4, 4 x 4 are optimized. Through comprehensive analysis, our research extensively explored the structural stability of penta-CN2 QDs, delved into their electronic properties, and assessed their catalytic performance concerning the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER). Notably, the H-adsorbed penta-CN2 QDs exhibit a significant reduction in the HOMO-LUMO gap (E_{g}) ranging from 35% to 49% compared to the pristine QD. Next, we investigated their catalytic performance relevant to HER, using well-known descriptors: (i) adsorption energy, (ii) over-potential, (iii) Gibbs free energy and (iv) exchange current density along with the volcano curve. As far as size dependence of the catalytic performance is concerned, the value of Delta G^{(av)} is minimum for 3 x 3 penta-CN2 QD, with those of 3 x 4 and 4 x 4 QDs being slightly larger. Our calculations predict a high value of exchange current density 2.24 x 10^{-3} A-cm^{-2} for one of the sites (N11 for 3 x 3 QD), which we believe will lead to significantly enhanced HER properties. Our research outcomes hold great promise in advancing the discovery of abundant, non-toxic, and cost-effective catalysts for HER, playing a vital role in facilitating large-scale hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Point defects in CdTe and CdTeSe alloy: a first principles investigation with DFT+U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CdTe and its alloy CdTeSe are widely used in optoelectronic devices, such as radiation detectors and solar cells, due to their superior electrical properties. However, the formation of defects and defect complexes in these materials can significantly affect their performance. As a result, understanding the defect formation and recombination processes in CdTe and CdTeSe alloy is of great importance. In recent years, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the properties of defects in semiconductors. In this paper, we use DFT+U calculations to comprehensively study the properties of intrinsic defects as well as extrinsic defects induced by commonly used dopants, such as Cu and group V elements, in CdTe and CdTeSe alloy. This work provides insights into the effects of these defects on the electrical and optical properties of the material.</description>

      <title>Topology-engineered orbital Hall effect in two-dimensional ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in manipulation of orbital angular momentum (OAM) within the paradigm of orbitronics present a promising avenue for the design of future electronic devices. In this context, the recently observed orbital Hall effect (OHE) occupies a special place. Here, focusing on both the second-order topological and quantum anomalous Hall insulators in two-dimensional ferromagnets, we demonstrate that topological phase transitions present an efficient and straightforward way to engineer the OHE, where the OAM distribution can be controlled by the nature of the band inversion. Using first-principles calculations, we identify Janus RuBrCl and three septuple layers of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ as experimentally feasible examples of the proposed mechanism of OHE engineering by topology.

      <title>Ultra-high spin emission from antiferromagnetic FeRh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An antiferromagnet emits spin currents when time-reversal symmetry is broken. This is typically achieved by applying an external magnetic field below and above the spin-flop transition or by optical pumping. In this work we apply optical pump-THz emission spectroscopy to study picosecond spin pumping from metallic FeRh as a function of temperature. Intriguingly we find that in the low-temperature antiferromagnetic phase the laser pulse induces a large and coherent spin pumping, while not crossing into the ferromagnetic phase. With temperature and magnetic field dependent measurements combined with atomistic spin dynamics simulations we show that the antiferromagnetic spin-lattice is destabilised by the combined action of optical pumping and picosecond spin-biasing by the conduction electron population, which results in spin accumulation. We propose that the amplitude of the effect is inherent to the nature of FeRh, particularly the Rh atoms and their high spin susceptibility. We believe that the principles shown here could be used to produce more effective spin current emitters. Our results also corroborate the work of others showing that the magnetic phase transition begins on a very fast picosecond timescale, but this timescale is often hidden by measurements which are confounded by the slower domain dynamics.</description>

      <title>Accounting for the Quantum Capacitance of Graphite in Constant Potential Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations at a constant electric potential are an essential tool to study electrochemical processes, providing microscopic information on the structural, thermodynamic, and dynamical properties. Despite the numerous advances in the simulation of electrodes, they fail to accurately represent the electronic structure of materials such as graphite. In this work, we introduce a simple parameterization method that allows to tune the metallicity of the electrode based on a quantum chemistry calculation of the density of states. As a first illustration, we study the interface between graphite electrodes and two different liquid electrolytes, an aqueous solution of NaCl and a pure ionic liquid, at different applied potentials. We show that the simulations reproduce qualitatively the experimentally-measured capacitance; in particular, they yield a minimum of capacitance at the point of zero charge, which is due to the quantum capacitance contribution. An analysis of the structure of the adsorbed liquids allows to understand why the ionic liquid displays a lower capacitance despite its large ionic concentration. In addition to its relevance for the important class of carbonaceous electrodes, this method can be applied to any electrode materials (e.g. 2D materials, conducting polymers, etc), thus enabling molecular simulation studies of complex electrochemical devices in the future.</description>

      <title>Evolving Genetic Programming Tree Models for Predicting the Mechanical Properties of Green Fibers for Better Biocomposite Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced modern technology and industrial sustainability theme have contributed implementing composite materials for various industrial applications. Green composites are among the desired alternatives for the green products. However, to properly control the performance of the green composites, predicting their constituents properties are of paramount importance. This work presents an innovative evolving genetic programming tree models for predicting the mechanical properties of natural fibers based upon several inherent chemical and physical properties. Cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and moisture contents as well as the Microfibrillar angle of various natural fibers were considered to establish the prediction models. A one-hold-out methodology was applied for training/testing phases. Robust models were developed to predict the tensile strength, Young's modulus, and the elongation at break properties of the natural fibers. It was revealed that Microfibrillar angle was dominant and capable of determining the ultimate tensile strength of the natural fibers by 44.7% comparable to other considered properties, while the impact of cellulose content in the model was only 35.6%. This in order would facilitate utilizing artificial intelligence in predicting the overall mechanical properties of natural fibers without experimental efforts and cost to enhance developing better green composite materials for various industrial applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fully nonlinear (geometric and material) system of Field Dislocation Mechanics is reviewed to establish an exact analogy with the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (ideal MHD) under suitable physically simplifying circumstances. Weak solutions with various conservation properties have been established for ideal MHD recently by Faraco, Lindberg, and Szekelyhidi using the techniques of compensated compactness of Tartar and Murat and convex integration; by the established analogy, these results would seem to be transferable to the idealization of Field Dislocation Mechanics considered. A dual variational principle is designed and discussed for this system of PDE, with the technique transferable to the study of MHD as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement in metals (HE) is a serious challenge for the use of high strength materials in engineering practice and a major barrier to the use of hydrogen for global decarbonization. Here we describe the factors and variables that determine HE susceptibility and provide an overview of the latest understanding of HE mechanisms. We discuss hydrogen uptake and how it can be managed. We summarize hydrogen trapping and the techniques used for its characterization. We also review literature that argues that hydrogen trapping can be used to decrease HE susceptibility. We discuss the future research that is required to advance the understanding of HE and hydrogen trapping and to develop HE-resistant alloys.</description>

      <title>Optical and Transport Properties of Plasma Mixtures from Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the charged particle transport properties of warm dense matter / hot dense plasma mixtures is a challenge for analytical models. High accuracy ab initio methods are more computationally expensive, but can provide critical insight by explicitly simulating mixtures. In this work, we investigate the transport properties and optical response of warm dense carbon-hydrogen mixtures at varying concentrations under either conserved electronic pressure or mass density at a constant temperature. We compare options for mixing the calculated pure species properties to estimate the results of the mixtures. We find that a combination of the Drude model with the Matthiessen's rule works well for DC electron transport and low frequency optical response. This breaks down at higher frequencies, where a volumetric mix of pure-species AC conductivities works better.</description>

Abstract: We develop a framework for on-the-fly machine learned force field molecular dynamics simulations based on the multipole featurization scheme that overcomes the bottleneck with the number of chemical elements. Considering bulk systems with up to 6 elements, we demonstrate that the number of density functional theory calls remains approximately independent of the number of chemical elements, in contrast to the increase in the smooth overlap of atomic positions scheme.</description>

      <title>Spin-Energy Entanglement of a Time-Focused Neutron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intra-particle entanglement of individual particles such as neutrons could enable a new class of scattering probes that are sensitive to entanglement in quantum systems and materials. In this work, we present experimental results demonstrating quantum contextuality as a result of entanglement between the spin and energy modes (i.e., degrees of freedom) of single neutrons in a beam using a pair of resonant radio-frequency neutron spin flippers in the MIEZE configuration (Modulated IntEnsity with Zero Effort). We verified the mode-entanglement by measuring a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) contextuality witness $S$ defined in the spin and energy subsystems, observing a clear breach of the classical bound of $|S| \leq 2$, obtaining $S = 2.40 \pm 0.02$. These entangled beams could enable novel approaches for directly probing dynamics and entanglement in quantum materials whose low-energy excitation scales match those of the incident entangled neutron.</description>

      <title>Computational Discovery of Fast Interstitial Oxygen Conductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New highly oxygen-active materials may enhance many energy-related technologies by enabling efficient oxygen-ion transport at lower temperatures, e.g., below 400 Celsius. Interstitial oxygen conductors have the potential to realize such performance but have received far less attention than vacancy-mediated conductors. Here, we combine physically-motivated structure and property descriptors, ab initio simulations, and experiments to demonstrate an approach to discover new fast interstitial oxygen conductors. Multiple new families were found which adopt completely different structures from known oxygen conductors. From these families, we synthesized and studied oxygen kinetics in La4Mn5Si4O22+d (LMS), a representative member of perrierite/chevkinite family. We found LMS has higher oxygen ionic conductivity than the widely used yttria-stabilized ZrO2, and among the highest surface oxygen exchange rates at intermediate temperature of known materials. The fast oxygen kinetics is the result of simultaneously active interstitial and interstitialcy diffusion pathways. We propose that the essential features for forming an effective interstitial oxygen conductor are the availability of electrons and structural flexibility enabling sufficient accessible volume. This work provides a powerful approach for understanding and discovering new interstitial oxygen conductors.</description>

      <title>Multiband $k \cdot p$ theory for hexagonal germanium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The direct bandgap found in hexagonal germanium and some of its alloys with silicon allows for an optically active material within the group-IV semiconductor family with various potential technological applications. However, there remain some unanswered questions regarding several aspects of the band structiure, including the strength of the electric dipole transitions at the center of the Brillouin zone. Using the $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$ method near the $\Gamma$ point, including 10 bands, and taking spin-orbit coupling into account, we obtain a self-consistent model that produces the correct band curvatures, with previously unknown inverse effective mass parameters, to describe 2H-Ge via fitting to {\it ab initio} data and to calculate effective masses for electrons and holes. To understand the weak dipole coupling between the lowest conduction band and the top valance band, we start from a spinless 12-band model and show that when adding spin-orbit coupling, the lowest conduction band hybridizes with a higher-lying conduction band, which cannot be explained by the spinful 10-band model. With the help of L\"owdin's partitioning, we derive the effective low-energy Hamiltonian for the conduction bands for the possible spin dynamics and nanostructure studies and in a similar manner, we give the best fit parameters for the valance-band-only model that can be used in the transport studies. Finally, using the self-consistent 10-band model, we include the effects of a magnetic field and predict the electron and hole g-factor of the conduction and valance bands.</description>

      <title>Controlling high-harmonic generation from strain engineered monolayer phosphorene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phosphorene, a well-studied 2D allotrope of phosphorus, features unique properties such as widely tunable bandgap, high carrier mobility, and remarkable intrinsic in-plane anisotropy. Utilizing these structural and electronic properties, we investigate ultrafast electron dynamics and high harmonic generation (HHG) from phosphorene subject to band structure engineering through external strain, based on ab initio time-dependent density-functional theory approach. We show that strong field processes in such systems can be optimized and controlled by biaxial tensile and compressive strain engineering, that results in electronic structure modification. While -10% strain resulted in closing of band gap, 2% strain increased the gap by 22% with respect to 0.9 eV in pristine phosphorene, consequently affecting the high harmonic yield. With reduction of gap, by applying strain from 2% to -10%, the valence band near $\Gamma-$point becomes more flat and discreet, resulting in large electronic density of states and enhanced electronic excitation, which reflects in their ultrafast sub-cycle dynamics under laser excitation. Moreover, due to its intrinsic in-plane anisotropy, harmonic yield with laser polarization along the armchair (AC) direction is found to be higher than that of the zigzag (ZZ) direction for all the strain cases. Nearly, an order of magnitude enhancement of harmonic intensity is achieved for -10% strain along AC direction. The current study expands the research possibilities of phosphorene into a previously unexplored domain, indicating its potential for future utilization in extreme-ultraviolet and attosecond nanophotonics, and also for efficient table-top HHG sources.</description>

      <title>BAMBOO: a predictive and transferable machine learning force field framework for liquid electrolyte development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the widespread applications of machine learning force field (MLFF) on solids and small molecules, there is a notable gap in applying MLFF to complex liquid electrolytes. In this work, we introduce BAMBOO (ByteDance AI Molecular Simulation Booster), a novel framework for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with a demonstration of its capabilities in the context of liquid electrolytes for lithium batteries. We design a physics-inspired graph equivariant transformer architecture as the backbone of BAMBOO to learn from quantum mechanical simulations. Additionally, we pioneer an ensemble knowledge distillation approach and apply it on MLFFs to improve the stability of MD simulations. Finally, we propose the density alignment algorithm to align BAMBOO with experimental measurements. BAMBOO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting key electrolyte properties such as density, viscosity, and ionic conductivity across various solvents and salt combinations. Our current model, trained on more than 15 chemical species, achieves the average density error of 0.01 g/cm$^3$ on various compositions compared with experimental data. Moreover, our model demonstrates transferability to molecules not included in the quantum mechanical dataset. We envision this work as paving the way to a "universal MLFF" capable of simulating properties of common organic liquids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of a crumpled phase for self-avoiding elastic surfaces was postulated more than three decades ago using simple Flory-like scaling arguments. Despite much effort, its stability in a microscopic environment has been the subject of much debate. In this paper we show how a crumpled phase develops reliably and consistently upon subjecting a thin spherical shell to active fluctuations. We find a master curve describing how the relative volume of a shell changes with the strength of the active forces, that applies for every shell independent of size and elastic constants. Furthermore, we extract a general expression for the onset active force beyond which a shell begins to crumple. Finally, we calculate how the size exponent varies along the crumpling curve.</description>

      <title>Elastic instability behind brittle fracture in soft solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that nucleation of brittle cracks in initially flawless soft elastic solids is preceded by a nonlinear elastic instability, which cannot be captured without accounting for geometrical precise description of finite elastic deformation. As a prototypical problem we consider a homogeneous elastic body subjected to tension and assume that it is weakened by the presence of a free surface which then serves as a site of crack nucleation. We show that in this maximally simplified setting, brittle fracture emerges from a symmetry breaking elastic instability activated by softening and involving large elastic rotations. The implied bifurcation of the homogeneous elastic equilibrium is highly unconventional for nonlinear elasticity as it exhibits an extraordinary sensitivity to geometry, reminiscent of the transition to turbulence in fluids. We trace the post-bifurcational development of this instability beyond the limits of applicability of scale free continuum elasticity and use a phase-field approach to capture the scale dependent sub-continuum strain localization, signaling the formation of actual cracks.</description>

      <title>Optical properties and electronic correlations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ bilayer nickelates under high pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the optical properties of La3Ni2O7 bilayer nickelates by using density functional theory including a Coulomb repulsion term. Convincing agreement with recent experimental ambient-pressure spectra is achieved for U=3eV, which permits tracing the microscopic origin of the characteristic features. Simultaneous consistency with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction suggests the notion of rather moderate electronic correlations in this novel high-Tc superconductor. Oxygen vacancies form predominantly at the inner apical sites and renormalize the optical spectrum quantitatively, while the released electrons are largely accommodated by a defect state. We show that the structural transition occurring under high pressure coincides with a significant enhancement of the Drude weight and a reduction of the out-of-plane interband contribution that act as a fingerprint of the emerging hole pocket. Finally, we investigate the role of the 2-2 versus 1-3 layer stacking and compare the bilayer nickelate to La4Ni3O10, La3Ni2O6, and NdNiO2, unveiling general trends in the optical spectrum as a function of the formal Ni valence in Ruddlesden-Popper versus reduced Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.</description>

Abstract: Surface polaritons in an anisotropic media posses a strong dependence of the wavevector on the propagation direction, which is called the isofrequency contour. This can lead to the fact that polariton propagation will be possible in a limited range of angles in the boundary plane. Notable examples are Dyakonov surface waves at the boundary of two dielectrics and hyperbolic plasmons in a hyperbolic metamaterial. Exact closed-form solutions of the polariton dispersion equation are known only in special cases: in a weakly anisotropic medium, and in an arbitrary medium for highly symmetric directions of polariton propagation. This work provides an universal exact solution in algebraic form for surface polariton at the interface of an arbitrary isotropic and an uniaxial media for the case of the optic axis parallel to the boundary. As an example, it was used to analyze the shapes of isofrequency contours of surface polaritons. The work brings together previously scattered results of studies of various types of surface polaritons in uniaxial media.</description>
