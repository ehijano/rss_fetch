      <title>UV Luminosity Functions from HST and JWST: A Possible Resolution to the High-Redshift Galaxy Abundance Puzzle and Implications for Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of high redshift galaxies by the James Webb Space Telescope suggest the presence of a bright population of galaxies that is more abundant than predicted by most galaxy formation models. These observations have led to a rethinking of these models, and numerous astrophysical and cosmological solutions have been proposed, including cosmic strings, topological defects that may be remnants of a specific phase transition in the very early moments of the Universe. In this paper, we integrate cosmic strings, a source of nonlinear and non-Gaussian perturbations, into the semi analytical code Zeus21, allowing us to efficiently predict the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF). We conduct a precise study of parameter degeneracies between star-formation astrophysics and cosmic-string phenomenology. Our results suggest that cosmic strings can boost the early-galaxy abundance enough to explain the measured UVLFs from the James Webb and Hubble Space Telescopes from redshift z = 4 to z = 17 without modifying the star-formation physics. In addition, we set a new upper bound on the string tension of $G\mu \lessapprox 10^{-8}$ ($95\%$ credibility), improving upon previous limits from the cosmic microwave background. Although with current data there is some level of model and prior dependence to this limit, it suggests that UVLFs are a promising avenue for future observational constraints on cosmic-string physics.</description>

      <title>Clues from $\mathcal{Q}$--A null test designed for line intensity mapping cross-correlation studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the auto power spectrum of cosmological tracers from line-intensity mapping (LIM) data is often limited by instrumental noise, residual foregrounds, and systematics. Cross-power spectra between multiple lines offer a robust alternative, mitigating noise bias and systematics. However, inferring the auto spectrum from cross-correlations relies on two key assumptions: that all tracers are linearly biased with respect to the matter density field, and that they are strongly mutually correlated. In this work, we introduce a new diagnostic statistic, \(\mathcal{Q}\), which serves as a data-driven null test of these assumptions. Constructed from combinations of cross-spectra between four distinct spectral lines, \(\mathcal{Q}\) identifies regimes where cross-spectrum-based auto-spectrum reconstruction is unbiased. We validate its behavior using both analytic toy models and simulations of LIM observables, including star formation lines ([CII], [NII], [CI],[OIII]) and the 21-cm signal. We explore a range of redshifts and instrumental configurations, incorporating noise from representative surveys. Our results demonstrate that the criterion \( \mathcal{Q} \approx 1 \) reliably selects the modes where cross-spectrum estimators are valid, while significant deviations are an indicator that the key assumptions have been violated. The \( \mathcal{Q} \) diagnostic thus provides a simple yet powerful data-driven consistency check for multi-tracer LIM analyses.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on 3-forms dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3-forms are natural candidates for describing the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe, as they can inherently reproduce a positive cosmological constant when lacking an evolving potential. When such a potential is present, a 3-form field may exhibit either quintessence-like or phantom-like behaviour. In this paper, we consider a 3-form model with a Gaussian potential, which features stable, ghost-free phantom-like behaviour within its convergence region and leads to an LSBR late-time attractor. We constrain this model observationally by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis employing a comprehensive cosmological dataset, including Planck PR4 cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae data, low-$z$ Cepheid calibrators, and DES Y1 large-scale structure observations. We demonstrate that the 3-form model successfully increases the predicted Hubble parameter of CMB and BAO data from $67.89\pm0.36{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ of $\Lambda$CDM model to $68.29^{+0.56}_{-0.61}{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ without fine-tuning of the model parameters, thus reducing the tension with the late-time observation. Furthermore, we verify the sub-dominance of the 3-form field perturbation via both analytical and numerical analyses. Thus, the 3-form field does serve as a promising candidate of phantom-like dark energy from both theoretical and observational points of view.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Roman Grism Redshift Efficiency of Type Ia Supernova Host Galaxies for the High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey (HLTDS) for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will discover thousands of high redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) to make generation-defining cosmological constraints on dark energy. To construct the Roman SN Hubble diagram, a strategy to obtain redshifts must be determined. While the nominal HLTDS will use only the Roman prism, in this work we consider the utility of the Roman grism observations from overlap with the High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey for SNIa cosmology. We determine a galaxy grism redshift recovery rate by simulating dispersed grism images and measuring redshifts with the Grizli software, obtaining an $H$-band 50% redshift recovery at magnitude 20.61 and 90% recovery at magnitude 19.27. To estimate the total number of spectroscopic redshifts expected for Roman SN cosmology, we also consider a Roman prism SN redshift efficiency and a ground-based telescope redshift efficiency for host-galaxies. We apply these redshift efficiencies to SNIa catalog level simulations and predict that $\sim$6800 SNe will have a SN or host spectroscopic redshift. Second, we evaluate the size of potential systematics related to modeling the grism redshift efficiency by considering the impact of additional dependencies on stellar mass and host galaxy color. We estimate the largest potential size of this systematic to be 0.0066$\pm$0.002 and -0.0266$\pm$0.007, roughly 42.9 and 49.6% of the statistical uncertainty for $w_0$ and $w_a$ respectively. Lastly, we consider the effects of assuming different redshift sources on the HLTDS survey strategy optimization by measuring relative changes to the dark energy Figure of Merit.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Phase-Space and Field-Level Cosmology: The Strength of Semi-Analytic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-analytic models are a widely used approach to simulate galaxy properties within a cosmological framework, relying on simplified yet physically motivated prescriptions. They have also proven to be an efficient alternative for generating accurate galaxy catalogs, offering a faster and less computationally expensive option compared to full hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that using only galaxy $3$D positions and radial velocities, we can train a graph neural network coupled to a moment neural network to obtain a robust machine learning based model capable of estimating the matter density parameters, $\Omega_{\rm m}$, with a precision of approximately 10%. The network is trained on ($25 h^{-1}$Mpc)$^3$ volumes of galaxy catalogs from L-Galaxies and can successfully extrapolate its predictions to other semi-analytic models (GAEA, SC-SAM, and Shark) and, more remarkably, to hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, and SWIFT-EAGLE). Our results show that the network is robust to variations in astrophysical and subgrid physics, cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and the different halo-profile treatments used across simulations. This suggests that the physical relationships encoded in the phase-space of semi-analytic models are largely independent of their specific physical prescriptions, reinforcing their potential as tools for the generation of realistic mock catalogs for cosmological parameter inference.</description>

      <title>Improved Identification of Strongly Lensed Gravitational Waves with Host Galaxy Locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian framework that enhances the identification of strongly lensed gravitational waves (GWs) by incorporating informative positional priors from the Euclid galaxy lens catalog. The core of our method introduces a two-step reweighting scheme: first, gravitational wave parameter estimation is performed under a uniform sky prior; the resulting posterior is then used to reweight galaxy positions within the Euclid catalog, constructing an astrophysically informed positional prior. Comparing this Euclid-informed prior against a uniform prior within our framework reveals distinct behaviors. While the posterior estimates of the intrinsic waveform parameters show little sensitivity to the prior change, the Bayes factor for lensing identification exhibits significant prior dependence. Crucially, for truly lensed event pairs, the Bayes factor systematically increases, whereas for unlensed pairs it decreases. This dual effect is vital for robust discrimination. Our analysis demonstrates that this multi-messenger approach significantly improves the confidence of lensing searches. For lensed pairs, the method boosts the Bayes factor by an average factor of $\sim 10$, while effectively suppressing false positives for unlensed coincidences. This underscores the critical importance of prior specification and showcases the substantial gains achievable by synergizing gravitational-wave data with electromagnetic survey information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether the recent DESI DR2 measurements provide or not evidences for dynamical dark energy by exploring the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM model and its extensions with free $\sum m_{\nu}$ and $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$. Using a comprehensive MCMC analysis with a wide range of cosmological datasets including DESI~DR2 BAO and Ly$\alpha$ data, CMB compressed likelihoods, BBN, cosmic chronometers, and multiple Type~Ia supernova compilations, we assess the statistical preference for departures from $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Inflation at the End of 2025: Constraints on $r$ and $n_s$ Using the Latest CMB and BAO Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflation elegantly provides initial conditions for the standard model of cosmology, while solving the horizon, flatness, and magnetic monopole problems. Inflationary models make predictions for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the spectral index $n_s$ of initial density fluctuations. In light of relevant data releases this year, we present constraints on these two parameters using the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation data (BAO) available. Using data from Planck, the South Pole Telescope, Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and BICEP/Keck experiments, we derive $n_s=0.9682\,\pm\,0.0032$ and a 95% upper limit of $r&lt;0.034$. This upper limit on $r$ is consistent with the official BICEP/Keck result given the numerical precision of the analyses and our choice to impose the self-consistency relation for single field slow-roll inflation on the tensor power spectrum; the $r$ constraint is not impacted by the additional CMB data. While adding DESI BAO data to the CMB data has a negligible impact on $r$, the $n_s$ constraint shifts upward to $0.9728\,\pm\,0.0029$, which favours monomial inflaton potentials with $N_\star\sim 50$ over Starobinsky $R^2$ or Higgs inflation with $N_\star = 51$ and $N_\star = 55$, respectively. This shift is caused by marginally significant differences between the CMB and DESI data that remain unexplained in the context of the standard model. We show that a class of polynomial $\alpha$-attractor models can predict the CMB and CMB+DESI $n_s$ results with $N_\star=47.1$ and $N_\star=55.1$, respectively. While future data will improve our sensitivity to $r$, robust $n_s$ constraints are just as crucial to differentiate between inflation models. We make the data needed to reproduce the new CMB and BAO results and visualisation tools for $r$-$n_s$ figures to compare to any inflation model available https://github.com/Lbalkenhol/r_ns_2025 .</description>

      <title>Model independent approach towards measuring expansion and growth factor from next generation galaxy clustering and lensing angular power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we perform Fisher forecasts on the expansion and the growth factors following model independent approaches from 3x2pt joint analysis of the galaxy lensing, clustering, and their cross-correlated spectra at the linear, and extending as well to non linear scales. For that, instead of choosing a specific model for the matter power spectrum, the main ingredient of these probes, we express it by parametrizing its components, such as the expansion and the growth factor, and those of the standard halo model and excursion set theory in several z bins, besides to the different bias and non-linear bias modelling functions. We apply the technique to Euclid, Rubin and SKA public specifications in the range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.8 and show that one can then obtain model-independent constraints of the expansion E(z i ) and the growth factor G(z i ). We also show the change in gain in precision at each z- shell when going from pessimistic cut at linear scales to more optimistic non-linear settings, or the difference between using each survey alone or a combination of all of them, or the impact from fixing or adding more degrees of freedom in the non-linear modeling. We found that, in the most agnostic case, one can still reach high precision on E(z i ) in the order of the percent level when combining the three surveys at once while the growth factor G(z i ) has for the same settings one order of magnitude weaker constraints. We also found for both factors, an improvement that can reach one order of magnitude in precision when passing from linear to non-linear scales. We conclude that we will be able to constrain the two important factors of the background evolution and structure formation of the Universe when using non linear scales and the combined power of future surveys even in the most agnostic approaches.</description>

      <title>Applying the BF method on the DESI evidence for dynamical dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the DESI, when combined with CMB data and Type Ia supernovae observations, indicate a preference for dynamical dark energy when considering the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model, over the standard {\Lambda}CDM or the wCDM model. However, the Bayes factor, a key metric for model comparison, remains inconclusive on which model is preferred. This paper applies the BF method, that integrates both Bayesian and frequentist approaches to DESI data to address the limitations of purely frequentist or Bayesian methods. It consists in considering the Bayes factor as a random variable and calculates its distribution, that results from values computed in a frequentist approach after perturbing the data following the model considered. We apply this hybrid method to DESI data, comparing the CPL and w models under various prior conditions, including weak and strong priors, and theory-informed priors. We find that, when the traditional bayes factor is considered, that weak priors favor the w model over CPL, while strong priors favor CPL. Additionally, theory-informed priors further enhance the preference for the w model. While when we apply the BF method, the preference for CPL over w is seen in all cases albeit with similar but reduced impact on the p-value from the different prior considerations. We also tried to generalize further, by perturbing as well the covariance matrix following the model considered, and found that, in general, the current data in that case is not stringent enough to disentangle between the two models. Our results demonstrate that varying the Bayes factor as a random variable, providing that the covariance matrix is kept as model independent, provides a robust model comparison, reducing the impact of prior dependence as well as offering quantitative assessment of the preferences of the competing models.(abridged)</description>

      <title>On the validity of the continuity equation in a modified gravity framework with CMB, DES 3x2pt and tomographic ISW data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we propose a phenomenological modification to the continuity equation at the linear perturbation level and test it using combinations of the CMB temperature, polarization and lensing potential angular spectrum, the ISW-galaxy cross power spectrum and the 3$\times$2pt lensing and galaxy clustering from DES survey. We investigate two parametrisations of this modification, both proportional to a new parameter $A_c$, which is assumed to be either constant in time, or proportional to the scale factor $a$, in order to be more relevant at late times. We find DES and ISW data to be consistent with the standard continuity equation when $A_c$ is constant, but 2--3$\sigma$ hints of a non-zero modification appear when Planck data is included. The model $A_c \propto a$ results in stronger tensions. We also test the effects of including the common extra parameters $\mu$ and $\eta$ that modify the Poisson equation and Weyl potential. Although $A_c$, $\mu$ and $\eta$ are correlated, we still find non-zero $A_c$ when Planck data is included or without Planck if $A_c \propto a$ and only either $\eta$ or $\mu$ are allowed to vary. We conclude that violations of the continuity equation should be considered with care when testing additional deviations from general relativity.</description>

      <title>Inflation in light of ACT/SPT: a new perspective from Weyl gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the South Pole Telescope (SPT) have placed the strictest constraints on the primordial scalar perturbation spectrum, reporting a spectral index of $n_s\sim0.967-0.98$ at 95% confidence level. This result indicates a stronger scale invariance of the scalar perturbation than earlier estimates, posing challenges for numerous inflation models. In this work, we propose an appealing inflationary scenario from the Weyl scale-invariant gravity theory dominated by the higher-order curvatures. Specifically, the exponential curvature extensions are introduced to suppress the mass divergence of the inflaton. We find such scenario naturally yields leading-order predictions of $n_s\simeq1-3/(2N)\sim0.97-0.975$ or $n_s\simeq1-5/(3N)\sim0.967-0.972$ for various models, in excellent agreement with the ACT/SPT constraints. This result builds a concrete bridge between theoretical and observational scale invariance, implying an enduring cosmic echo of the primordial symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We derive updated Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraints on annihilating dark matter, and present forecasts for upcoming CMB surveys. We show that the addition of recent temperature, polarization, and lensing data from ground-based experiments yields only minor improvements ($\approx 10\%$) compared to Planck bounds, confirming that the sensitivity remains dominated by the large-scale E-mode polarization. Forecasts, using a LiteBIRD-like setup, indicate that pairing a low-noise, wide-sky satellite at $\ell &lt; 200$ with high-resolution ground observations nearly saturates the cosmic-variance limit, improving bounds by $\approx 60\%$, where our derived 95th percentile limit is $p_{\rm ann} &lt; 1.27{\times}10^{-28}\,\mathrm{cm^{3}\,s^{-1}\,GeV^{-1}}$. We also consider the inclusion of B-mode polarization for a realistic future experiment.</description>

      <title>Evidence of galaxy cluster rotation in the cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first robust evidence for the rotational kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (rkSZ) effect, produced by the Thomson scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons off rotating intracluster gas. By combining CMB intensity and polarization measurements from the $\it{Planck}$ satellite with spectroscopic member-galaxy redshifts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in a sample of 25 X-ray cross-matched, low-redshift ($0.02&lt; z&lt; 0.09)$, massive ($10^{13.9}\lesssim M_{\rm 500c}/M_\odot \lesssim 10^{14.6}$) galaxy clusters, we detect a dipolar rkSZ signature aligned with the estimated rotation direction of each cluster, ruling out a chance fluctuation at 99.98% confidence (3.6$\sigma$). The significance of this measurement is enhanced by several new methodological improvements for isolating the rkSZ signal from primary CMB fluctuations and noise. The amplitude and shape of the signal are qualitatively consistent with predictions from state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations. These results establish a new tool with which to probe the dynamical state of galaxy clusters using CMB data.</description>

      <title>The meaning of "Big Bang"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What does ``Big Bang'' actually mean? What was the origin of these two words? It has often been said that the expression ``Big Bang'' began as an insult. Even if this were true, it would be just an irrelevant part of the whole issue. There are many more aspects hidden under this name, and which are seldom explained. They will be discussed in this work. In order to frame the analysis, help will be sought from the highly authoritative voices of two exceptional writers: William Shakespeare and Umberto Eco. Both Shakespeare and Eco have explored the tension existing between words and the realities they name. With the conclusion that names are, in general, just labels, simple stickers put to identify things. And this includes those given to great theorems or spectacular discoveries. Not even ``Pythagoras' theorem'' was discovered by Pythagoras, as is now well-known. Stigler's law of eponymy is recalled to further substantiate those statements. These points will be at the heart of the investigation carried out here, concerning the very important concept of ``Big Bang''. Everybody thinks to know what ``the Big Bang'' is, but only very few do know it, in fact. When Fred Hoyle first pronounced these two words together, on a BBC radio program, listeners were actually left with the false image that Hoyle was trying to destroy. That is, the tremendous explosion of Lema\^itre's primeval atom (or cosmic egg), which scattered all its enormous matter and energy content throughout the rest of the Universe. This image is absolutely wrong! As will be concluded, today the label ``Big Bang'' is used in several different contexts: (a) the Big Bang Singularity; (b) as the equivalent of cosmic inflation; (c) speaking of the Big Bang cosmological model; (d) to name a very popular TV program; and more.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave parameter estimation to the Moon and back: massive binaries and the case of GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the prospects of the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), a proposed deci-Hz GW detector, to observe binary black holes (BBHs) and enable multiband science with ground-based detectors. We assess the detectability of the events observed by current instruments up to the GWTC-4.0 data release, and of simulated populations consistent with the latest reconstruction by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We find that LGWA alone would have been able to observe more than one third of the events detected so far, and that it could detect $\sim\!90$ events merging in the ground-based band per year out to redshifts $z\sim3-5$. Current detectors at design sensitivity and 100% duty cycle could detect thousands of BBHs per year, with one to a few hundred multiband counterparts in LGWA. Third-generation (3G) detectors can observe most of the BBHs detected by LGWA merging in their frequency band in the simulated mass range $7\,{\rm M}_\odot\lesssim M_{\rm tot}\lesssim 600\,{\rm M}_\odot$, enabling systematic joint analyses of hundreds of events. The short time to merger from the deci-Hz band to the Hz-kHz band (typically months to a year) allows for early warning, targeted follow-up, and archival searches. Multiband observations of intermediate-mass BBHs in the deci-Hz band are particularly promising. We perform an injection study for a GW231123-like system (the most massive BBH detection to date, which accumulates $\sim 10^5$ inspiral cycles in LGWA) and show that deci-Hz observations can measure the chirp mass even better than 3G instruments and yield good sky localization and inclination measurement, even with a single observatory. Opening the deci-Hz band would substantially improve the prospects of GW astronomy for intermediate-mass BBHs.</description>

      <title>Dark matter mounds from the collapse of supermassive stars: a general-relativistic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the importance of a fully relativistic treatment of the dephasing of gravitational waves induced by dark-matter overdensities in extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). However, a general-relativistic description of the dark matter phase-space distribution is currently available only for the case of a dark matter "spike" arising from adiabatic black hole growth. Here we develop a fully general-relativistic formalism for the more realistic scenario in which a supermassive stellar progenitor collapses to a black hole and produces a shallower dark matter overdensity, or "mound". We follow self-consistently the evolution of the supermassive star, its collapse, and the subsequent growth of the resulting black hole, together with the collisionless dark matter orbits. We find that in the regime where the collapse becomes non-adiabatic, the dark matter distribution function is significantly reshaped, with a clear depletion in the low-binding-energy region of phase space. Our results provide a more realistic prediction for the dark matter phase-space distribution around supermassive black holes, which is an essential step in our programme to use future EMRI observations to extract information about both the nature of dark matter and the formation history of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Constraining Gravitational Dark Matter with LHAASO and Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use diffuse Galactic high energy gamma ray data from LHAASO and Fermi-LAT to constrain gravitationally produced decaying dark matter (DM). Focusing on four benchmark candidates: a dark photon, a heavy right-handed neutrino (RHN), a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB), and a non-minimally coupled scalar we derive bounds on the DM mass and its couplings to the visible sector. For dark photons, RHNs, and pNGBs, the combined data constrain the relevant interaction strength to $\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{-30})$ for DM masses $\gtrsim\mathcal{O}$(TeV), while the non-minimally coupled scalar is limited to $\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{-10})$. Moreover, photon-dark photon oscillations yield strong constraints for massive dark photon beyond 10 GeV, closing a region of parameter space previously left unconstrained.</description>

      <title>Spectrally Resolved Gas Kinematics in Cygnus A: XRISM Detects AGN Jet-induced Velocity Dispersion in Multi-temperature Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report spectral analysis on a 170 ks XRISM \textit{Resolve} exposure of the core of Cygnus A. Analyzing the full field of view spectrum in the $1.7-12.0$ keV band, we find evidence for two-temperature cluster gas. The hotter ($kT = 5.53 \pm 0.13$ keV) gas has a velocity dispersion of $261 \pm 13$ km s$^{-1}$ and a bulk velocity of $120 \pm 20$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the central galaxy. The cooler gas ($kT = 2.0^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ keV) has an even broader velocity dispersion of $440 \pm 130$ km s$^{-1}$, with a systematic uncertainty of $120$ km s$^{-1}$. The relative line-of-sight velocity between the hotter and cooler gas can be as high as $450 \pm 140$ km s$^{-1}$. We interpret the high velocity dispersions as a combination of turbulence and bulk motion due to the cocoon shock. The upper limit on the non-thermal pressure fraction for the hotter gas is $7.7 \pm 0.7\%$. We associate the cooler gas with the central region ($&lt;35$ kpc) and the hotter phase with the gas surrounding it ($35-100$ kpc). The total energy due to the kinetic motion is $5.1 \times 10^{60}$ erg, consistent with the energy associated with the central radio source. The kinetic energy injection rate is $6.9 \times 10^{44}-7.4 \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ under varying assumptions of injection timescales. The range of injection power is higher than the cooling luminosity, and thus the heating and cooling rates in Cygnus A are unbalanced.</description>

      <title>MorphZ: Enhancing evidence estimation through the Morph approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Morph approximation, a class of product approximations of probability densities that selects low-order disjoint parameter blocks by maximizing the sum of their total correlations. We use the posterior approximation via Morph as the importance distribution in optimal bridge sampling. We denote this procedure by MorphZ, which serves as a post-processing estimator of the marginal likelihood. The MorphZ estimator requires only posterior samples together with the prior and likelihood, and is fully agnostic to the choice of sampler. We evaluate MorphZ's performance across statistical benchmarks, pulsar timing array (PTA) models, compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational-wave (GW) simulations and the GW150914 event. Across these applications, spanning low to high dimensionalities, MorphZ yields accurate evidence at substantially reduced computational cost relative to standard approaches, and can improve these estimates even when posterior coverage is incomplete. Its bridge sampling relative error diagnostic provides conservative uncertainty estimates. Because MorphZ operates directly on posterior draws, it complements exploration-oriented samplers by enabling fast and reliable evidence estimation, while it can be seamlessly integrated into existing inference workflows.</description>

      <title>A Nonlocal Realization of MOND that Interpolates from Cosmology to Gravitationally Bound Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal modifications of gravity derive from corrections to the quantum gravitational stress tensor which grow nonperturbatively strong during primordial inflation and may persist to the current epoch. Phenomenological constructions have been given that realize MOND in gravitationally bound systems and, separately, reproduce all the cosmological phenomena usually ascribed to dark matter, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, baryon acoustic oscillations and linearized structure formation. In this work we exhibit a single model that interpolates between the two regimes.</description>

      <title>Cosmological and lunar laser ranging constraints on evolving dark energy in a nonminimally coupled curvature-matter gravity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a cosmological solution to the field equations of a modified gravity model where curvature and matter are nonminimally coupled. The current Universe's accelerated expansion is driven by a cosmological constant while the impact of the nonminimal coupling on the expansion history is recast as an effective equation of state for evolving dark energy. The model is analyzed under a tracking solution that follows the minimum of the effective potential for a scalar field that captures the modified theory's effects. We determine the conditions for the existence of this minimum and for the validity of the tracking solution. Cosmological constraints on the parameters of the model are obtained by resorting to recent outcomes of data from the DESI collaboration in combination with the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey supernovae compilations, which give compatible results that point to the presence of a dynamical behavior for dark energy. The gravity model violates the equivalence principle since it gives rise to a fifth force that implies the Earth and Moon fall differently towards the Sun. The cosmological constraints are intersected with limits resulting from a test of the equivalence principle in the Earth-Moon system based on lunar laser ranging data. We find that a variety of model parameters are consistent with both of these constraints, all while producing a dynamical evolution of dark energy with similarities to that found in recent DESI results.</description>

      <title>Subtracting compact binary foregrounds utilizing anisotropic statistic for third-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical foreground from compact-binary coalescence signals is expected to be a dominant part of total gravitational wave (GW) energy density in the frequency band of the third-generation detectors. The detection of any other subdominant stochastic GW background (GWB), especially a primordial GWB, will be disturbed by the astrophysical foreground, which needs to be cleaned for further studies of other stochastic GWB. Although previous studies have proposed several cleaning methods, the foreground from subthreshold binary neutron stars (BNS) has been a major obstacle to remove. In this paper, we propose the novel idea to acquire better estimation of the unresolved foreground, by using the information about its anisotropies. We simulate the BNS population and compute its angular power spectrum and shot noise. We find that the shot noise from BNS is too faint to observe after subtracting loud signals due to the limited angular resolution of the third-generation detectors. This justifies the approximation regarding the unresolved foreground as an isotropic component. We also discuss the angular resolution necessary to make our method valid for the foreground subtraction.</description>

      <title>Efficient pulsar distance measurement with multiple nanohertz gravitational-wave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have reported evidence for a nanohertz gravitational-wave (GW) background. As radio telescope sensitivity improves, PTAs are also expected to detect continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries. Nanohertz GWs generate both Earth and pulsar terms in the timing data, and the time delay between the two terms encodes the pulsar distance. Precise pulsar distance measurements are critical to fully exploiting pulsar-term information, which can improve the measurement precision of GW sources' sky position parameters and thus enhance the GW sky-localization capability. In this work, we propose a new pulsar distance estimation method by using pulsar-term phase information from GWs. We construct two-dimensional distance posteriors for pulsar pairs based on the simulated GW signals and combine them to constrain individual pulsar distances. Compared with the existing one-dimensional method, our approach reduces the impact of source-parameter uncertainties on pulsar distance measurements. Considering four GW sources and a PTA of 20 pulsars with a white-noise level of 20 ns, we find that a significant fraction of pulsars at distances $\lesssim 1.4$ kpc can achieve sub-parsec distance precision over a 15-year observation.</description>

      <title>A remarkable Gaia-assisted discovery of a temporally varying, triple-lensed quasar at z=2.67</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed quasars are viable cosmic tools for constraining a diversity of fundamental astrophysical phenomena; They enable identification of faint, low-mass supermassive black holes, provide unique constraints on the intervening intergalactic or interstellar medium in their sightlines, and can be used to determine key cosmological quantities such as the Hubble constant, $H_0$. However, they are rare phenomena, and it has proven difficult to define efficient, unbiased selection methods.} In this study, we report the spectroscopic identification of a remarkable triple-lensed quasar system at $z=2.67$, identified based on its astrometric measurements from the {\em Gaia} mission, as well as a larger spectroscopic follow-up survey of {\em Gaia}-detected candidate lensed quasars. We characterize in detail the three mirror images of the quasar and their spatial and temporal spectroscopic coverage, with focus on the emission-line properties which shows variation across sigthlines and temporal evolution over the $\sim 11$months spectroscopic campaign. We construct a lens model of the foreground source from a combination of the multiple spectra and deep optical imaging, providing a robust halo mass of $M_{\rm h} = (2.78 \pm 0.05)\times 10^{10}M_\odot$. Based on the lens model, the time delay between each sightline is translated into an intrinsic quasar time, allowing us to construct a quasar timeseries over $\sim18$months with monthly cadence. Over months timescales the broad emission lines vary in both velocity offset and equivalent width (EW) as well as an overall increase in ionization. This exemplary triple-lensed quasars demonstrates the viability of identifying such rare lens configurations based purely on the astrometric measurements from the {\em Gaia} mission, which we here provide optimized selection criteria for, for future studies.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the ionizing properties of 1721 galaxies at $5.6&lt;z&lt;6.5$ using deep JWST/NIRCam photometric imaging from the NEP, JADES, and PRIMER surveys spanning an unmasked area $\sim550$arcmin$^2$ across UV magnitudes $-22\lesssim M_{\rm UV}\lesssim-17.5$. Our $90\%$ stellar mass complete sample suggests little relation of UV slope with magnitude, $\beta_{\rm UV}=(-0.040\pm0.022)M_{\rm UV}-2.88^{+0.43}_{-0.44}$, implying $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}\simeq5\%$ based on calibrations from the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS). We measure a constant ionizing photon production efficiency with UV magnitude, $\log_{10}(\xi_{\rm ion, 0}/\rm Hz\,erg^{-1}) = -0.006^{+0.019}_{-0.017}~M_{\rm UV} + 25.05^{+0.39}_{-0.34}$, consistent with HST canonical values. The total production rate of photons escaping into the IGM is computed as $\log_{10}(\dot{n}_{\rm ion}/\rm s^{-1}Mpc^{-3})=50.31^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ for $M_{\rm UV}&lt;-17$ galaxies from our star forming and smouldering UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), which differ in the faint-end slope ($\alpha_{\rm SFG}=-2.2\pm0.2$; $\alpha_{\rm sm}=-1.7\pm0.2$). Extrapolating to the latest UVLF turnover limits from the massive lensing galaxy cluster Abell S1063 ($M_{\rm UV, lim}=-13.5$) implies that a recombination-weighted HII clumping factor $C_{\rm HII, rec}=6.2^{+4.1}_{-2.1}$ is required to produce fully stably reionized at $z\simeq6$. A clumping factor of this magnitude resolves the ionizing photon budget crisis. Our methodology paves the way for indirect clumping measurements from galaxies which will provide insight into earlier stages of the EoR when the Ly$\alpha$-forest becomes saturated and more direct quasar measurements become impossible.</description>

      <title>Measuring the neutron star equation of state from EMRIs in dark matter environments with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in vacuum are largely insensitive to the internal structure of the small compact companion. We show that this conclusion can change when the central black hole is surrounded by a dense dark matter environment. We compute, for the first time, the relativistic dynamical-friction force on a neutron star moving through a collisionless medium and its impact on the evolution of EMRIs embedded in dense dark matter spikes. We then perform a Bayesian parameter-estimation analysis of simulated LISA observations to assess the measurability of both spike properties and the companion's internal structure. We find that, in our fiducial dark matter spike models, EMRIs with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\gtrsim 20$ already allow us to distinguish neutron star from black hole companions, while events with SNR $\gtrsim 400$ make it possible to discriminate between different neutron star equations of state.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Cosmological Phase Transitions: Seeded by Domain Walls and Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous nucleation is central to many familiar first-order phase transitions such as the freezing of water and the solidification of metals, and it can also play a crucial role in cosmology. We examine nucleation seeded by preexisting domain walls and demonstrate its strong impact on the dynamics of cosmological phase transitions. The bubble solutions take the form of spherical caps, and the contact angle is fixed by the ratio of the domain-wall tension to the bubble-wall tension. A larger domain-wall tension, or equivalently a smaller contact angle, reduces the wall-seeded bubble volume and lowers the critical nucleation action. For theories with $\mathbb{Z}_{n\geq 3}$ symmetry, domain-wall junctions naturally appear and we find that they seed nucleation even more efficiently than the walls themselves. Using a two-scalar-field model as an illustration, we compute nucleation temperatures for both homogeneous and heterogeneous channels and show that junction-seeded nucleation occurs at a higher temperature and is the dominant mechanism that completes the first-order cosmological phase transition.</description>

      <title>Detection prospects for heavy WIMP dark matter near supermassive black holes, particularly in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work analyzes the detection prospects for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) in dark matter (DM) density spikes around nearby supermassive black holes (SMBHs) by observations in very high energy gamma-ray band. Such spikes are unique targets, which provide a possibility to discover the basic thermal s-wave annihilating WIMP with any mass up to the theoretical unitarity limit ~ 100 TeV. All relevant SMBHs were checked, and only MW* and M31* were identified as worthwhile objects. Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) sensitivity to heavy WIMPs in M31* was estimated. It was obtained that CTA will be able to probe a major part of TeV-scale WIMP parameter space in case of optimistic spike density configuration in M31*. In certain scenarios, M31* may yield even stronger constraints than MW*. Relevant systematic uncertainties were explored.</description>

Abstract: The standard paradigm of cosmology assumes two distinct dark components, namely dark matter and dark energy. However, the necessity of splitting the dark-side world into two sectors has not been experimentally or theoretically proven. Unified dark fluid models provide an alternative in which a single fluid accounts for both phenomena. It is shown in Wang et al. 2024 that a PAge-like unified dark fluid (PUDF) can explain both the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and late-universe data, with the fitting quality not much worse than the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. Using the Planck 2018 CMB, baryon acoustic oscillations measurement from the dark energy spectroscopic instrument (DESI) data release 2, dark energy survey 5-year supernova data, and cosmic-chronometer data, we update the constraints on PUDF and clarify its physical implications. We show that PUDF can reproduce the primary CMB anisotropies, the background expansion history, and linear growth that are very close to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction. Nevertheless, the combined datasets still favor $\Lambda$CDM, largely due to the significant tension between CMB and DESI + SNe data, which exceeds the $4\sigma$ level in PUDF and remains non-negligible in the $w$CDM framework. Using mock data generated from the Planck best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model, we find that PUDF and $\Lambda$CDM cannot be statistically distinguished, indicating that the precision of current data is insufficient to separate the two models. Overall, the apparent preference for $\Lambda$CDM may be driven by dataset inconsistencies rather than a genuine physical difference, leaving unified dark fluid models as viable alternatives within current observational limits.</description>

      <title>Caustic fringes for wave dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave dark matter is composed of particles sufficiently light that their de Broglie wavelength exceeds the average inter-particle separation. A typical wave dark matter halo exhibits granular substructures due to wave interference. In this paper, we explore the wave interference effects around caustics. These are locations of formally divergent density in cold collisionless systems. Examples include splashback in galaxy clusters, and tidal shells in merging galaxies, where the pile-up of dark matter close to apogee gives rise to caustics. We show that wave interference modifies the density profile in the vicinity of the caustics, giving rise to a fringe pattern well-described by the Airy function. This follows from approximating the gravitational potential as linear close to apogee. This prediction is verified in a series of numerical simulations in which the gravitational potential is computed exactly. We provide a formula expressing the fringe separation in terms of the wave dark matter mass and halo parameters, which is useful for interpreting and stacking data. The fringe separation near caustics can be significantly larger than the naive de Broglie scale (the latter set by the system's velocity dispersion). This opens up the possibility of detecting caustic fringes for a wide range of wave dark matter masses.</description>

      <title>Cosmic sign-reversal: non-parametric reconstruction of interacting dark energy with DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A direct interaction between dark energy and dark matter provides a natural and important extension to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the vacuum energy ($w=-1$) interacting with cold dark matter using the cosmological data from DESI DR2, Planck CMB, and three SNIa samples (PP, DESY5, and Union3). By discretizing the coupling function $\beta(z)$ into 20 redshift bins and assuming a Gaussian smoothness prior, we reconstruct $\beta(z)$ without assuming any specific parameterization. The mean reconstructed $\beta(z)$ changes sign during cosmic evolution, indicating an energy transfer from cold dark matter to dark energy at early times and a reverse flow at late times. At high redshifts, $\beta(z)$ shows a $\sim 2\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. At low redshifts, the results depend on the SNIa sample: CMB+DESI and CMB+DESI+PP yield $\beta(z)$ consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, while CMB+DESI+DESY5 and CMB+DESI+Union3 prefer negative $\beta$ at $\sim2\sigma$. Both $\chi^2$ tests and Bayesian analyses favor the $\beta(z)$ model, with CMB+DESI DR2+DESY5 showing the most significant support through the largest improvement in goodness of fit ($\Delta\chi^2_{\rm MAP}=-17.76$) and strongest Bayesian evidence ($\ln\mathcal{B} = 5.98 \pm 0.69$). Principal component analysis reveals that the data effectively constrain three additional degrees of freedom in the $\beta(z)$ model, accounting for most of the improvement in goodness of fit. Our results demonstrate that the dynamical dark energy preference in current data can be equally well explained by such a sign-reversal interacting dark energy, highlighting the need for future observations to break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>The Most Probable Behaviour of the Dark Energy Equation of State Indicates a Thawing Quintessence Field: Tomographic Alcock-Paczy\'nski Test with Redshift-Space Correlation Function II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply an extended Alcock-Paczy\'nski (AP) test to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data to constrain the dark energy models with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of the dark energy equation of state. The extended AP test method uses the full shape of redshift-space two-point correlation funcion(CF) as the standard shape in order to measure the expansion history of the universe. We calibrate the standard shape by using the cosmology-dependent nonlinear evolution of the CF shape in the Multiverse simulations. Further validation of the method and calibration of possible systematics are performed based on mock samples from the Horizon Run 4 simulation. Using the AP test alone, we constrain the flat CDM plus CPL-type dark energy model (flat $w^{\rm CPL}$CDM) to have $\Omega_m=0.290_{-0.031}^{+0.029}$, $w_0=-0.800_{-0.100}^{+0.208}$, and $w_a=-0.238_{-0.972}^{+0.650}$. When combined with other results from the low-redshift universe, such as the Pantheon$+$ supernova compilation and DESI BAO data, the constraint on dark energy becomes $w_0=-0.857_{-0.042}^{+0.051}$, and $w_a=-0.153_{-0.356}^{+0.347}$. The best-fit $w^{CPL}(z)$ suggests no phantom-divide crossing at $z&lt;0.7$, and the dark energy behaviour is consistent with a thawing quintessence field. It is only when the CMB data are combined with late-time cosmological probes that a phantom-divide crossing at low redshift is favored.</description>

      <title>Direct multi-model dark-matter search with gravitational-wave interferometers using data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27022v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave detectors can probe the existence of dark matter with exquisite sensitivity. Here, we perform a search for three kinds of dark matter -- dilatons (spin-0), dark photons (spin-1) and tensor bosons (spin-2) -- using three independent methods on the first part of the most recent data from the fourth observing run of LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA. Each form of dark matter could have interacted with different standard-model particles in the instruments, causing unique differential strains on the interferometers. While we do not find any evidence for a signal, we place the most stringent upper limits to-date on each of these models. For scalars with masses between $[4\times 10^{-14},1.5\times 10^{-13}]$ eV that couple to photons or electrons, our constraints improve upon those from the third observing run by one order of magnitude, with the tightest limit of $\sim 10^{-20}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ at a mass of $\sim2\times 10^{-13}\text{ eV}$. For vectors with masses between $[7\times 10^{-13},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV that couple to baryons, our constraints supersede those from MICROSCOPE and E\"ot-Wash by one to two orders of magnitude, reaching a minimum of $\sim 5\times 10^{-24}$ at a mass of $\sim 10^{-12}$ eV. For tensors with masses of $[4\times 10^{-14},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV (the full mass range analyzed) that couple via a Yukawa interaction, our constraints surpass those from fifth-force experiments by four to five orders of magnitude, achieving a limit as low as $\sim 8\times 10^{-9}$ at $\sim2\times 10^{-13}$ eV. Our results show that gravitational-wave interferometers have become frontiers for new physics and laboratories for direct multi-model dark-matter detection.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1): VIS processing and data products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15303</link>

Abstract: This paper describes the VIS Processing Function (VIS PF) of the Euclid ground segment pipeline, which processes and calibrates raw data from the VIS camera. We present the algorithms used in each processing element, along with a description of the on-orbit performance of VIS PF, based on Performance Verification (PV) and Q1 data. We demonstrate that the principal performance metrics (image quality, astrometric accuracy, photometric calibration) are within pre-launch specifications. The image-to-image photometric scatter is less than $0.8\%$, and absolute astrometric accuracy compared to Gaia is $5$ mas Image quality is stable over all Q1 images with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $0.\!^{\prime\prime}16$. The stacked images (combining four nominal and two short exposures) reach $I_\mathrm{E} = 25.6$ ($10\sigma$, measured as the variance of $1.\!^{\prime\prime}3$ diameter apertures). We also describe quality control metrics provided with each image, and an appendix provides a detailed description of the provided data products. The excellent quality of these images demonstrates the immense potential of Euclid VIS data for weak lensing. VIS data, covering most of the extragalactic sky, will provide a lasting high-resolution atlas of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum of vacuum bubbles in a first-order phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) during a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in a dark sector has been of recent interest. A quantity that characterizes a black hole is its spin. We carry out the first step towards determining the spin of such PBHs, by calculating the spin of spherical false vacuum bubbles induced by cosmological perturbations. The angular momentum is given by the product of density and velocity perturbations. We carefully track the evolution of background quantities and calculate the transfer functions during the FOPT. We find that the dimensionless spin parameter $s = J/(G_{\rm N} M^2)$ of false vacuum bubbles of mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$, take a wide range of values from ${\cal{O}}(10^{-5})$ to ${\cal{O}}(10)$ for FOPTs between 10 keV and 100 GeV and a dark sector that is 0.1 to 0.4 times cooler than the visible sector. We also find a scaling relation between the root-mean-square value of the spin, the FOPT time scale, the bubble wall velocity, and the dark sector-to-visible sector temperature ratio.</description>

      <title>Restrictions on Initial Conditions in Cosmological Scenarios and Implications for Simulations of Primordial Black Holes and Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical relativity simulations provide a means by which to study the evolution and end point of strong over-densities in cosmological spacetimes. Specific applications include studies of primordial black hole formation and the robustness of inflation. Here we adopt a toy model previously used in asymptotically flat spacetimes to show that, for given values of the over-density and the mean curvature, solutions to the Hamiltonian constraint need not exist, and if they do exist they are not unique. Specifically, pairs of solutions exist on two branches, corresponding to strong-field and weak-field solutions, that join at a maximum beyond which solutions cease to exist. As a result, there is a limit to the extent to which an over-density can be balanced by intrinsic rather than extrinsic curvature on the initial slice. Even below this limit, iterative methods to construct initial data may converge to solutions on either one of the two branches, depending on the starting guess, leading to potentially inconsistent physical results in the evolution.</description>

      <title>Self-lensing of moving gravitational-wave sources can break the microlensing crossing timescale degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a moving gravitational-wave (GW) source travels behind a massive astrophysical object, its signal is gravitationally lensed, showing a waveform distortion similar to a Paczy\'{n}ski curve. We present a first study of the lensing signature of a massive black hole (MBH) on a frequency-dependent GW signal from a moving binary merger. For both light and GW sources in a Keplerian circular orbit around a MBH lens, the self-lensing geometry breaks the microlensing degeneracy in the Einstein radius crossing timescale $t_{\rm E}$. The duration of the curve ($2 t_{\rm E}$) becomes independent on the MBH mass $M_{\rm MBH}$, and provides a direct measure of the distance $d_{\rm LS}$ to the MBH. However, $M_{\rm MBH}$ remains unknown. We show that, in GW signals, the redshifted mass $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ can additionally be obtained from the interference pattern, by measuring the modulation period $T$, the GW frequency $f$, and $t_{\rm E}$: $M_{{\rm MBH},z}\simeq 2.5\times 10^6\,M_\odot\,(t_{\rm E}/[100\,{\rm s}])\,(f\,T)^{-1}$. If this lensing signature is not considered, it may be confused with other waveform distortions, especially in the modeling of overlapping signals in next generation ground-based GW detectors. The observation of one of these curves and its associated parameters may help (1) constrain the orbital distance $d_{\rm LS}$ of sources, especially around low-mass MBHs at the center of star clusters and galaxies, (2) additionally estimate the mass $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ of these MBHs, and (3) infer the orbital inclination of the binary. Simultaneously obtaining $d_{\rm LS}$ and $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ through self-lensing can help constrain the astrophysical environments where GW signals come from.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Model Selection with an Application to Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological parameter inference and model selection from a Bayesian perspective. Type Ia supernova data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES-SN5YR) are used to test the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and CPL cosmological models. Posterior inference is performed via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo using the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) implemented in NumPyro and analyzed with ArviZ in Python. Bayesian model comparison is conducted through Bayes factors computed using the bridgesampling library in R. The results indicate that all three models demonstrate similar predictive performance, but $w$CDM shows stronger evidence relative to $\Lambda$CDM and CPL. We conclude that, under the assumptions and data used in this study, $w$CDM provides a better description of cosmological expansion.</description>
