      <title>Mid-career pitfall of consecutive success in science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The creativity of scientists often manifests as localized hot streaks of significant success. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of these influential phases can enhance the effectiveness of support systems and funding allocation, fostering groundbreaking discoveries worthy of accolades. Historically, analyses have suggested that hot streaks occur randomly over time. However, our research, through meticulous examination, reveals that these phases are not flatly distributed but are more frequent at the early and late stages of scientists' careers. Notably, both early and late hot streaks are marked by dense tie collaborations, with the former typically involving close partnerships with particular authors and the latter being characterized by involvement in large-scale projects compared with single-top or ordinary papers. This pattern indicates that mid-career researchers lack both intimate relations and resources to keep big projects, leading to``mid-career pitfal'' of consecutive success. This insight holds profound implications for the development of policies and initiatives aimed at bolstering innovative research and discovery.</description>

      <title>Information Dissemination Model Based on User Attitude and Public Opinion Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the information dissemination process in social networks is a challenging problem. Despite numerous attempts to address this issue, existing studies often assume that user attitudes have only one opportunity to alter during the information dissemination process. Additionally, these studies tend to consider the transformation of user attitudes as solely influenced by a single user, overlooking the dynamic and evolving nature of user attitudes and the impact of the public opinion environment. In this paper, we propose a novel model, UAPE, which considers the influence of the aforementioned factors on the information dissemination process. Specifically, UAPE regards the user's attitude towards the topic as dynamically changing, with the change jointly affected by multiple users simultaneously. Furthermore, the joint influence of multiple users can be considered as the impact of the public opinion environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves an accuracy range of 91.62% to 94.01%, surpassing the performance of existing research.</description>

      <title>RA-ICM: A Novel Independent Cascade Model Incorporating User Relationships and Attitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of social networks has a wide range of social effects, which facilitates the study of social issues. Accurately forecasting the information propagation process within social networks is crucial for promptly understanding the event direction and effectively addressing social problems in a scientific manner. The relationships between non-adjacent users and the attitudes of users significantly influence the information propagation process within social networks. However, existing research has ignored these two elements, which poses challenges for accurately predicting the information propagation process. This limitation significantly hinders the study of emotional contagion and influence maximization in social networks. To address these issues, by considering the relationships between non-adjacent users and the influence of user attitudes, we propose a new information propagation model based on the independent cascade model. Experimental results obtained from six real Weibo datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which is reflected in increased prediction accuracy and reduced time complexity. Furthermore, the information dissemination trend in social networks predicted by the proposed model closely resembles the actual information propagation process, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Socio-spatial segregation and human mobility: A review of empirical evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social segregation, the spatial and social separation between individuals from different backgrounds, can affect sustainable urban development and social cohesion. The literature has traditionally focused on residential segregation, examining how individuals' residential locations are distributed differently across neighborhoods based on income, ethnicity, and education. However, this approach overlooks the complexity of spatial segregation because daily activities often extend far beyond residential areas. Over the past one to two decades, emerging mobility data sources have enabled a new understanding of socio-spatial segregation by considering daily activities such as work, school, shopping, and leisure visits. From traditional surveys to GPS trajectories, diverse data sources reveal that day-to-day movements can impact segregation by reducing or amplifying segregation levels obtained when considering residential aspects alone. This literature review focuses on three critical questions: (a) to what extent do individual mobility patterns contribute to segregation? (b) Which factors explain the role played by mobility in segregation? and (c) What insights are gained by incorporating extensive mobility data into segregation research? Our literature review contributes to an improved understanding of socio-spatial segregation at the individual level and offers actionable insights into reducing segregation and addressing research gaps in the field.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Cutting of Complex Networks Performed by Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several interesting approaches have been reported in the literature on complex networks, random walks, and hierarchy of graphs. While many of these works perform random walks on stable, fixed networks, in the present work we address the situation in which the connections traversed by each step of a uniformly random walks are progressively removed, yielding a successively less interconnected structure that may break into two components, therefore establishing a respective hierarchy. The sizes of each of these pairs of sliced networks, as well as the permanence of each connected component, are studied in the present work. Several interesting results are reported, including the tendency of geometrical networks sometimes to be broken into two components with comparable large sizes.</description>

      <title>Nurses as agents for achieving Environmentally Sustainable Health Systems: A bibliometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: To analyze the current scientific knowledge and research lines focused on environmentally sustainable health systems, including the role of nurses. Background: There seem to be differences between creating interventions focused on environmentally sustainable health systems, including nurses, and the scarcity of research on this topic, framed on the Sustainable Development Goals. Methods: A bibliometric analysis was carried out, via three databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and Pubmed), and the guideline recommendations were followed to select bibliometric data. Results: The search resulted in 159 publications, significantly increasing the trends from 2017 to 2021 (p=0.028). The most relevant countries in this area were the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Sweden. Also, the top articles were from relevant journals, indexed in Journal Citation Report, and the first and the second quartile linked to the nursing field and citations (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: Education is key to achieving environmentally sustainable health systems via institutions and policies. Implications for nursing management: There is a lack of experimental data and policies on achieving or maintaining environmentally sustainable health care systems, indicating that nurses have an important role and should be consulted and included in decision-making policies regarding sustainability in the healthcare systems.</description>

      <title>Monitoring the evolution of antisemitic discourse on extremist social media using BERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Racism and intolerance on social media contribute to a toxic online environment which may spill offline to foster hatred, and eventually lead to physical violence. That is the case with online antisemitism, the specific category of hatred considered in this study. Tracking antisemitic themes and their associated terminology over time in online discussions could help monitor the sentiments of their participants and their evolution, and possibly offer avenues for intervention that may prevent the escalation of hatred. Due to the large volume and constant evolution of online traffic, monitoring conversations manually is impractical. Instead, we propose an automated method that extracts antisemitic themes and terminology from extremist social media over time and captures their evolution. Since supervised learning would be too limited for such a task, we created an unsupervised online machine learning approach that uses large language models to assess the contextual similarity of posts. The method clusters similar posts together, dividing, and creating additional clusters over time when sub-themes emerge from existing ones or new themes appear. The antisemitic terminology used within each theme is extracted from the posts in each cluster. Our experiments show that our methodology outperforms existing baselines and demonstrates the kind of themes and sub-themes it discovers within antisemitic discourse along with their associated terminology. We believe that our approach will be useful for monitoring the evolution of all kinds of hatred beyond antisemitism on social platforms.</description>

      <title>Promoting Fair Vaccination Strategies Through Influence Maximization: A Case Study on COVID-19 Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic saw more severe outcomes for racial minority groups and economically-deprived communities. Such disparities can be explained by several factors, including unequal access to healthcare, as well as the inability of low income groups to reduce their mobility due to work or social obligations. Moreover, senior citizens were found to be more susceptible to severe symptoms, largely due to age-related health reasons. Adapting vaccine distribution strategies to consider a range of demographics is therefore essential to address these disparities. In this study, we propose a novel approach that utilizes influence maximization (IM) on mobility networks to develop vaccination strategies which incorporate demographic fairness. By considering factors such as race, social status, age, and associated risk factors, we aim to optimize vaccine distribution to achieve various fairness definitions for one or more protected attributes at a time. Through extensive experiments conducted on Covid-19 spread in three major metropolitan areas across the United States, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in reducing disease transmission and promoting fairness in vaccination distribution.</description>

      <title>Non-robustness of diffusion estimates on networks with measurement error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network diffusion models are used to study things like disease transmission, information spread, and technology adoption. However, small amounts of mismeasurement are extremely likely in the networks constructed to operationalize these models. We show that estimates of diffusions are highly non-robust to this measurement error. First, we show that even when measurement error is vanishingly small, such that the share of missed links is close to zero, forecasts about the extent of diffusion will greatly underestimate the truth. Second, a small mismeasurement in the identity of the initial seed generates a large shift in the locations of expected diffusion path. We show that both of these results still hold when the vanishing measurement error is only local in nature. Such non-robustness in forecasting exists even under conditions where the basic reproductive number is consistently estimable. Possible solutions, such as estimating the measurement error or implementing widespread detection efforts, still face difficulties because the number of missed links are so small. Finally, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations on simulated networks, and real networks from three settings: travel data from the COVID-19 pandemic in the western US, a mobile phone marketing campaign in rural India, and in an insurance experiment in China.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Crypto Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency is a fast-moving space, with a continuous influx of new projects every year. However, an increasing number of incidents in the space, such as hacks and security breaches, threaten the growth of the community and the development of technology. This dynamic and often tumultuous landscape is vividly mirrored and shaped by discussions within Crypto Twitter, a key digital arena where investors, enthusiasts, and skeptics converge, revealing real-time sentiments and trends through social media interactions. We present our analysis on a Twitter dataset collected during a formative period of the cryptocurrency landscape. We collected 40 million tweets using cryptocurrency-related keywords and performed a nuanced analysis that involved grouping the tweets by semantic similarity and constructing a tweet and user network. We used sentence-level embeddings and autoencoders to create K-means clusters of tweets and identified six groups of tweets and their topics to examine different cryptocurrency-related interests and the change in sentiment over time. Moreover, we discovered sentiment indicators that point to real-life incidents in the crypto world, such as the FTX incident of November 2022. We also constructed and analyzed different networks of tweets and users in our dataset by considering the reply and quote relationships and analyzed the largest components of each network. Our networks reveal a structure of bot activity in Crypto Twitter and suggest that they can be detected and handled using a network-based approach. Our work sheds light on the potential of social media signals to detect and understand crypto events, benefiting investors, regulators, and curious observers alike, as well as the potential for bot detection in Crypto Twitter using a network-based approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A closed-loop control model to analyze the impact of recommendation systems on opinion dynamics within social networks is introduced. The core contribution is the development and formalization of model-free and model-based approaches to recommendation system design, integrating the dynamics of social interactions within networks via an extension of the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model. Comparative analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies in maximizing user engagement and their potential for influencing opinion formation processes.</description>

      <title>Redefining Event Types and Group Evolution in Temporal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Groups -- such as clusters of points or communities of nodes -- are fundamental when addressing various data mining tasks. In temporal data, the predominant approach for characterizing group evolution has been through the identification of ``events". However, the events usually described in the literature, e.g., shrinks/growths, splits/merges, are often arbitrarily defined, creating a gap between such theoretical/predefined types and real-data group observations. Moving beyond existing taxonomies, we think of events as ``archetypes" characterized by a unique combination of quantitative dimensions that we call ``facets". Group dynamics are defined by their position within the facet space, where archetypal events occupy extremities. Thus, rather than enforcing strict event types, our approach can allow for hybrid descriptions of dynamics involving group proximity to multiple archetypes. We apply our framework to evolving groups from several face-to-face interaction datasets, showing it enables richer, more reliable characterization of group dynamics with respect to state-of-the-art methods, especially when the groups are subject to complex relationships. Our approach also offers intuitive solutions to common tasks related to dynamic group analysis, such as choosing an appropriate aggregation scale, quantifying partition stability, and evaluating event quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05961v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms steadily gain popularity as they provide users with fast responses to their queries. The swiftness of these responses is contingent on a mixture of query-specific and user-related elements. This paper scrutinizes these contributing factors within the context of six highly popular CQA platforms, identified through their standout answering speed. Our investigation reveals a correlation between the time taken to yield the first response to a question and several variables: the metadata, the formulation of the questions, and the level of interaction among users. Additionally, by employing conventional machine learning models to analyze these metadata and patterns of user interaction, we endeavor to predict which queries will receive their initial responses promptly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: YouTube Shorts, a new section launched by YouTube in 2021, is a direct competitor to short video platforms like TikTok. It reflects the rising demand for short video content among online users. Social media platforms are often flooded with short videos that capture different perspectives and emotions on hot events. These videos can go viral and have a significant impact on the public's mood and views. However, short videos' affective computing was a neglected area of research in the past. Monitoring the public's emotions through these videos requires a lot of time and effort, which may not be enough to prevent undesirable outcomes. In this paper, we create the first multimodal dataset of short video news covering hot events. We also propose an automatic technique for audio segmenting and transcribing. In addition, we improve the accuracy of the multimodal affective computing model by about 4.17% by optimizing it. Moreover, a novel system MSEVA for emotion analysis of short videos is proposed. Achieving good results on the bili-news dataset, the MSEVA system applies the multimodal emotion analysis method in the real world. It is helpful to conduct timely public opinion guidance and stop the spread of negative emotions. Data and code from our investigations can be accessed at: http://xxx.github.com.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twitter data has been widely used by researchers across various social and computer science disciplines. A common aim when working with Twitter data is the construction of a random sample of users from a given country. However, while several methods have been proposed in the literature, their comparative performance is mostly unexplored. In this paper, we implement four common methods to collect a random sample of Twitter users in the US: 1% Stream, Bounding Box, Location Query, and Language Query. Then, we compare the methods according to their tweet- and user-level metrics as well as their accuracy in estimating US population with and without using inclusion probabilities of various demographics. Our results show that the 1% Stream method performs differently than others in tweet- and user-level metrics, and best for the construction of a population representative sample. We discuss the conditions under which the 1% Stream method may not be suitable and suggest the Bounding Box method as the second-best method to use.</description>

      <title>On the Detection of Reviewer-Author Collusion Rings From Paper Bidding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major threat to the peer-review systems of computer science conferences is the existence of "collusion rings" between reviewers. In such collusion rings, reviewers who have also submitted their own papers to the conference work together to manipulate the conference's paper assignment, with the aim of being assigned to review each other's papers. The most straightforward way that colluding reviewers can manipulate the paper assignment is by indicating their interest in each other's papers through strategic paper bidding. One potential approach to solve this important problem would be to detect the colluding reviewers from their manipulated bids, after which the conference can take appropriate action. While prior work has developed effective techniques to detect other kinds of fraud, no research has yet established that detecting collusion rings is even possible. In this work, we tackle the question of whether it is feasible to detect collusion rings from the paper bidding. To answer this question, we conduct empirical analysis of two realistic conference bidding datasets, including evaluations of existing algorithms for fraud detection in other applications. We find that collusion rings can achieve considerable success at manipulating the paper assignment while remaining hidden from detection: for example, in one dataset, undetected colluders are able to achieve assignment to up to 30% of the papers authored by other colluders. In addition, when 10 colluders bid on all of each other's papers, no detection algorithm outputs a group of reviewers with more than 31% overlap with the true colluders. These results suggest that collusion cannot be effectively detected from the bidding using popular existing tools, demonstrating the need to develop more complex detection algorithms as well as those that leverage additional metadata (e.g., reviewer-paper text-similarity scores).</description>

      <title>Modeling the amplification of epidemic spread by misinformed populations</title>

Abstract: Understanding how misinformation affects the spread of disease is crucial for public health, especially given recent research indicating that misinformation can increase vaccine hesitancy and discourage vaccine uptake. However, it is difficult to investigate the interaction between misinformation and epidemic outcomes due to the dearth of data-informed holistic epidemic models. Here, we propose an epidemic model that incorporates a large, mobility-informed physical contact network as well as the distribution of misinformed individuals across counties derived from social media data. Our model allows us to simulate and estimate various scenarios to understand the impact of misinformation on epidemic spreading. Using this model, we estimate that misinformation could have led to 47 million additional COVID-19 infections in the U.S. in a worst-case scenario.</description>

      <title>Bridging or Breaking: Impact of Intergroup Interactions on Religious Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While exposure to diverse viewpoints may reduce polarization, it can also have a backfire effect and exacerbate polarization when the discussion is adversarial. Here, we examine the question whether intergroup interactions around important events affect polarization between majority and minority groups in social networks. We compile data on the religious identity of nearly 700,000 Indian Twitter users engaging in COVID-19-related discourse during 2020. We introduce a new measure for an individual's group conformity based on contextualized embeddings of tweet text, which helps us assess polarization between religious groups. We then use a meta-learning framework to examine heterogeneous treatment effects of intergroup interactions on an individual's group conformity in the light of communal, political, and socio-economic events. We find that for political and social events, intergroup interactions reduce polarization. This decline is weaker for individuals at the extreme who already exhibit high conformity to their group. In contrast, during communal events, intergroup interactions can increase group conformity. Finally, we decompose the differential effects across religious groups in terms of emotions and topics of discussion. The results show that the dynamics of religious polarization are sensitive to the context and have important implications for understanding the role of intergroup interactions.</description>

      <title>MIM-Reasoner: Learning with Theoretical Guarantees for Multiplex Influence Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiplex influence maximization (MIM) asks us to identify a set of seed users such as to maximize the expected number of influenced users in a multiplex network. MIM has been one of central research topics, especially in nowadays social networking landscape where users participate in multiple online social networks (OSNs) and their influences can propagate among several OSNs simultaneously. Although there exist a couple combinatorial algorithms to MIM, learning-based solutions have been desired due to its generalization ability to heterogeneous networks and their diversified propagation characteristics. In this paper, we introduce MIM-Reasoner, coupling reinforcement learning with probabilistic graphical model, which effectively captures the complex propagation process within and between layers of a given multiplex network, thereby tackling the most challenging problem in MIM. We establish a theoretical guarantee for MIM-Reasoner as well as conduct extensive analyses on both synthetic and real-world datasets to validate our MIM-Reasoner's performance.</description>

      <title>Communication network dynamics in a large organizational hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most businesses impose a supervisory hierarchy on employees to facilitate management, decision-making, and collaboration, yet routine inter-employee communication patterns within workplaces tend to emerge more naturally as a consequence of both supervisory relationships and the needs of the organization. What then is the relationship between a formal organizational structure and the emergent communications between its employees? Understanding the nature of this relationship is critical for the successful management of an organization. While scholars of organizational management have proposed theories relating organizational trees to communication dynamics, and separately, network scientists have studied the topological structure of communication patterns in different types of organizations, existing empirical analyses are both lacking in representativeness and limited in size. In fact, much of the methodology used to study the relationship between organizational hierarchy and communication patterns comes from analyses of the Enron email corpus, reflecting a uniquely dysfunctional corporate environment. In this paper, we develop new methodology for assessing the relationship between organizational hierarchy and communication dynamics and apply it to Microsoft Corporation, currently the highest valued company in the world, consisting of approximately 200,000 employees divided into 88 teams. This reveals distinct communication network structures within and between teams. We then characterize the relationship of routine employee communication patterns to these team supervisory hierarchies, while empirically evaluating several theories of organizational management and performance. To do so, we propose new measures of communication reciprocity and new shortest-path distances for trees to track the frequency of messages passed up, down, and across the organizational hierarchy.</description>

      <title>BeMap: Balanced Message Passing for Fair Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fairness in graph neural networks has been actively studied recently. However, existing works often do not explicitly consider the role of message passing in introducing or amplifying the bias. In this paper, we first investigate the problem of bias amplification in message passing. We empirically and theoretically demonstrate that message passing could amplify the bias when the 1-hop neighbors from different demographic groups are unbalanced. Guided by such analyses, we propose BeMap, a fair message passing method, that leverages a balance-aware sampling strategy to balance the number of the 1-hop neighbors of each node among different demographic groups. Extensive experiments on node classification demonstrate the efficacy of BeMap in mitigating bias while maintaining classification accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/xiaolin-cs/BeMap.</description>

      <title>Visual Political Communication in a Polarized Society: A Longitudinal Study of Brazilian Presidential Elections on Instagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In today's digital age, images have emerged as powerful tools for politicians to engage with their voters on social media platforms. Visual content possesses a unique emotional appeal that often leads to increased user engagement. However, research on visual communication remains relatively limited, particularly in the Global South. This study aims to bridge this gap by employing a combination of computational methods and qualitative approach to investigate the visual communication strategies employed in a dataset of 11,263 Instagram posts by 19 Brazilian presidential candidates in 2018 and 2022 national elections. Through two studies, we observed consistent patterns across these candidates on their use of visual political communication. Notably, we identify a prevalence of celebratory and positively toned images. They also exhibit a strong sense of personalization, portraying candidates connected with their voters on a more emotional level. Our research also uncovers unique contextual nuances specific to the Brazilian political landscape. We note a substantial presence of screenshots from news websites and other social media platforms. Furthermore, text-edited images with portrayals emerge as a prominent feature. In light of these results, we engage in a discussion regarding the implications for the broader field of visual political communication. This article serves as a testament to the pivotal role that Instagram has played in shaping the narrative of two fiercely polarized Brazilian elections, casting a revealing light on the ever-evolving dynamics of visual political communication in the digital age. Finally, we propose avenues for future research in the realm of visual political communication.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Entanglement of Homophily and Heterophily in Semi-supervised Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown prominent performance in semi-supervised node classification by leveraging knowledge from the graph database. However, most existing GNNs follow the homophily assumption, where connected nodes are more likely to exhibit similar feature distributions and the same labels, and such an assumption has proven to be vulnerable in a growing number of practical applications. As a supplement, heterophily reflects dissimilarity in connected nodes, which has gained significant attention in graph learning. To this end, data engineers aim to develop a powerful GNN model that can ensure performance under both homophily and heterophily. Despite numerous attempts, most existing GNNs struggle to achieve optimal node representations due to the constraints of undirected graphs. The neglect of directed edges results in sub-optimal graph representations, thereby hindering the capacity of GNNs. To address this issue, we introduce AMUD, which quantifies the relationship between node profiles and topology from a statistical perspective, offering valuable insights for Adaptively Modeling the natural directed graphs as the Undirected or Directed graph to maximize the benefits from subsequent graph learning. Furthermore, we propose Adaptive Directed Pattern Aggregation (ADPA) as a new directed graph learning paradigm for AMUD. Empirical studies have demonstrated that AMUD guides efficient graph learning. Meanwhile, extensive experiments on 16 benchmark datasets substantiate the impressive performance of ADPA, outperforming baselines by significant margins of 3.96.</description>
