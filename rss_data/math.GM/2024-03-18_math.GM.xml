      <title>Proof of Aperiodicity of hat tile using the Golden Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein tile is a novel type of non-periodic tile that can cover the plane without repeating itself. It has a simple shape that resembles a fedora. This research paper unveils the aperiodicity of the newly discovered Einstein tile using the golden ratio, marking a paradigm shift in the field of geometric tiling. This Through rigorous analysis, mathematical modeling, and computational simulations, we provide compelling evidence that the Einstein tile defies conventional periodicity, lacking any repeating pattern or translational symmetry. The unique properties of the Einstein tile open up new avenues for exploring aperiodic tiling systems and their implications in various scientific and technological domains. From cryptography to materials science, the aperiodicity of the Einstein tile presents exciting opportunities for advancements in diverse fields, expanding our understanding of tiling theory and inspiring future explorations into aperiodic structures.</description>

      <title>p-composites of the main sequence of odd numbers as building blocks for $\pi(x)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prime-counting function $\pi(x)$ which returns the number of primes smaller or equal to a given number is a topic of interest in number theory. An algorithm based on a cyclic group isomorphic to $Z/nZ$, the so-called $Z$-functions, was proposed in view to outperform its pieers. The approach suggests a time complexity $\mathcal{O}(x^{1/2})$ in agreement with optimality of a 2-D squared adaptive-recursive algorithm. The present work is a presentation of various approaches as ascending factorization, the main sequence of odd numbers and partial sequences, T-series, counting function of prime composites, $Z$-modular forms and combinatorial aspects.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Extension of the General Leibniz Product rule for Fractional Indices and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a reformulation of the Leibniz product rule as a finite sum that expresses the fractional derivative of the product of two differentiable functions. This paper then proves the cases for when the product consists of an arbitrary differentiable function and a Sheffer sequence , and the case for when the product consists of an arbitrary differentiable function and a confluent hypergeometric limiting function with a positive integer order. Finally, this paper provides example expressions for certain Sheffer sequences: any Apell sequence, the falling factorial, the rising factorial, the exponential polynomial, and the Associated Laguerre polynomial.</description>

      <title>An extension of Wilson's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{N}[k]$ be the multiset containing the $\binom{n-1}{k}$ products of $k$-subsets of $\{1,\ldots, n-1\}$. We show that if $n\geq (2c+3)^2$, then \begin{gather*}\left((-1)^c+\sum_{M\in \mathcal{N}[n-1-c]}M\right)\cdot(c+1)\equiv 0\pmod{n},\end{gather*} if and only if $n=(c+1)p$, where $p$ is prime. This provides a combinatorial extension of Wilson's Theorem, which is the special case where $c=0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, random and stochastic processes are defined on fractal curves. Fractal calculus is used to define cumulative distribution function, probability density function, moments, variance and correlation function of stochastic process on fractal curve. A new framework which is a generalization of mean square calculus is formulated.

      <title>Entropy-Maximizing Dynamics of Continuous Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By assuming the existence of the growth optimal portfolio (GOP), the stationarity of GOP-volatilities, and the maximization of relative entropy, the paper applies the benchmark approach to the modeling of the long-term dynamics of continuous markets. It reveals conservation laws, where the GOP is shown to follow a time-transformed squared Bessel process of dimension four. Moreover, it predicts the convergence of the averages of the GOP-volatilities with respect to the driving independent Brownian motions toward a common level.</description>

      <title>A Rapidly Converging Machin-like Formula for $\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple recurrent formula to generate the Machin-like expression for calculating $\pi/4$. The method works for any denominator in the starting term and always provides a finite decomposition. We show that the terms in the Machin-like formula decrease so rapidly that the Lehmer's measure can be made arbitrarily small only by selecting the first term. We introduce the concept of the partial Machin-like formula. While the growth of the integer numbers may quickly render the computer implementation impractical, the same reason restricts the total contribution of the high terms. If the required precision is known in advance, the subset of the expression may be selected to satisfy it. We also present the Python program to compute the terms of the Machin-like formula (full and partial), and its Lehmer's measure.</description>

      <title>Fixed points of generalized contractions on O-metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of O-metric spaces generalize several existing metric-types in literature including metric spaces, b-metric spaces, and ultra metric spaces. In this paper, we discuss the properties of the topology induced by an O-metric and establish in the setting, fixed point theorems of contractions and generalized contractions. The proofs of the theorems rely heavily on polygon O-inequalities which are a natural generalization of the triangle inequality, and the construction of which leads to the notion of O-series following a pattern of functions.</description>

      <title>Inverse application of the generalized Littlewood theorem concerning integrals of the logarithm of analytic functions: an easy method to establish equalities between different analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we have established and used the generalized Littlewood theorem concerning contour integrals of the logarithm of analytical function to obtain new criteria equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis. Later, the same theorem was applied to calculate certain infinite sums and study the properties of zeroes of a few analytical functions. In this Note, we discuss what, in a sense, are inverse applications of this theorem. We first prove an easy Lemma that if two meromorphic on the whole complex plane functions $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ have the same zeroes and poles, taking into account their orders, and have appropriate asymptotic for large $|z|$, then for some integer $n$, $d^n \ln(f(z)/dz^n = d^n\ln(g(z)/dz^n$. The use of this Lemma enables easy proofs of many identities between elliptic functions and their transformation rules. In particular, we show how for any complex number $a$, $\wp(z)-a$, where $\wp(z)$ is Weierstrass $\wp$-function, can be presented as a product and ratio of three elliptic $\theta_1$-functions of certain arguments.</description>

      <title>Equality of the Casoratian and the Wronsikian for some sets of functions and an application in difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Casoratian determinants are very important in the study of linear difference equation, just as the Wronskian determinants are very important in the study of linear ordinary differential equations. The Casoratian and Wronskian determinants of a given set of functions are generally different. In this paper, we show that the Wroskian $ W[1, x, x^2,...,x^n ]$ and the Casoratian $ C[1,x, x^2,...,x^n ] $ of the set of functions $ \{1, x, x^2,...,x^n: \, n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ are equal to each other and independent of the variable $x$. Furthermore, we show that $ W[p_1, p_2,...,p_n, p_{n+1} ]= C[p_1, p_2,..., p_n, p_{n+1} ]$ for any basis $ \mathcal{B} = \{ p_1, p_2,..., p_n, p_{n+1} \}$ of the vector space spanned by $ \{ 1, x, x^2,...,x^n \}$. Finally, we point out some applications of such a Casoratian in the general solution of some types of homogeneous linear difference equations.</description>

      <title>Trigonometry and Analytic Tools in Olympiad Geometry Problems, Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first part of a series of papers aiming to show how trigonometry and analytic tools can help into tackling demanding Olympiad geometry problems. We present several novel techniques for tackling hard problems from various international and national mathematical competitions, and develop the appropriate theoretical background.
  Several insightful examples and practice problems are included for the reader to sharpen their problem solving skills. The number of asterisks next to each problem indicate its (subjective) difficulty level, ranging from (*) (early IMO problem) to (***) (hard IMO problem), or ocassionaly (****) (too hard for an IMO problem). Lastly, at the end of the paper we devote a section on providing some historical information on mathematicians whose names appeared in the paper.</description>

      <title>Constrained Multi-Relational Hyper-Graphons with Maximum Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work has two contributions. The first one is extending the Large Deviation Principle for uniform hyper-graphons from Lubetzky and Zhao \cite{lubetzky2015replica} to the multi-relational setting where each hyper-graphon can have different arities. This extension enables the formulation of the most typical possible world in Relational Probabilistic Logic with symmetric relational symbols in terms of entropy maximization subjected to constraints of quantum sub-hypergraph densities. The second contribution is to prove the most typical constrained multi-relational hyper-graphons (the most typical possible worlds) are computable by proving the solutions of the maximum entropy subjected by quantum sub-hypergraph densities in the space of multi-relational hyper-graphons are step functions except for in a zero measure set of combinations of quantum hyper-graphs densities with multiple relations. This result proves in a very general context the conjecture formulated by Radin et al.\ \cite{radin2014asymptotics} that states the constrained graphons with maximum entropy are step functions.</description>

The aim of this study established to devote and derive certain basic properties including analytic properties, recurrence matrix relations, differential properties, new integral representations, $k$-Beta transform, Laplace transform, fractional k-Fourier transform, fractional integral properties, the $k$-Riemann-Liouville and $k$-Weyl fractional integral and derivative operators an extended version of $_{r+1}R_{s,k}$ matrix function. We establish its relationships with other well known special matrix functions which have some particular cases in the context of three parametric Mittag-Leffer matrix function, $k$-Konhauser and $k$-Laguerre matrix polynomials. Finally, some special cases of the established formulas are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional pulses: relatively undistorted quasi-spherical waves, Fourier-Bessel integrals, and plane-waves decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical description of a class of unidirectional axisymmetric localized pulses, is given. The equivalence of their representations in the form of relatively undistorted quasi-spherical waves, in the form of Fourier-Bessel integrals and in the form of a superposition of plane waves with wave vectors having positive projections on a given direction is established.</description>

      <title>Convexity properties related to Gauss hypergeometric function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the convexity property on $(0,1)$ of the functions $\varphi_{a,b,c}$ and $1/\varphi_{a,b,c}$, where $$\varphi_{a,b,c}(x)= \frac{c-\log(1-x)}{\,_2F_1(a,b,a+b,x)},$$ whenever $a,b\geq 0$ and $a+b\leq 1$. We Show that $\varphi_{a,b,c}$ (respectively $1/\varphi_{a,b,c}$) is strictly convex on $(0,1)$ if and only if $c\leq -2\gamma-\psi(a)-\psi(b),$ (respectively $c\geq\alpha_0$) and $\varphi_{a,b,c}$ (respectively $1/\varphi_{a,b,c}$) is strictly concave on $(0,1)$ if and only if $c\geq c(a,b)$ (respectively $c\in[\delta_-,\delta_+]$), where $\psi$ is the Polygamma function. This generalizes some problems posed by Yang and Tian and complete the study of convexity properties of functions studied by the author in [bouali]. As applications of the convexity and concavity, we establish among other inequalities, that for all $x\in(0,1)$, $a,b\in[0,1]$, $a+b\leq 1$ and $c\geq c(a,b)$ $$c+\frac{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(a+b)}\leq \frac{c-\log(1-x)}{\,_2F_1(a,b,a+b,x)}+\frac{c-\log(x)}{\,_2F_1(a,b,a+b,1-x)}\leq\frac{(2c+2\log 2)}{\,_2{F}_1(a,b;a+b;1/2)},$$ and for all $x\in(0,1)$, $a,b\in[0,1]$, $a+b\leq 1$ and $c\in [\delta_-,\delta_+]$ $$\frac1c+\frac{\Gamma(a+b)}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}\leq \frac{\,_2F_1(a,b,a+b,x)}{c-\log(1-x)}+\frac{\,_2F_1(a,b,a+b,1-x)}{c-\log(x)}\leq\frac{\,_2{F}_1(a,b;a+b;1/2)}{(2c+2\log 2)}.$$</description>

Abstract: In this study, we derive the infinite product representation of the $\operatorname{sinc}(\mathrm{z})$ function by expressing it in a trigonometric form, evoking similarities to Morrie's Law and Euler's Product formula, along with their generalizations. The results presented in this investigation are entirely novel and are believed to introduce new insights into the topic.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional generalized gamma function and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a new two-dimensional generalization of the gamma function based on the product of the one-dimensional generalized beta function and the one-dimensional generalized gamma function. As will become clear later, this generalization is also a generalization the famous formula that gives the connection between the classical gamma and beta functions. Next we present properties of this generalization, some series for the generalized beta function. As a practical application of the two-dimensional generalized gamma function, we will show how it can be used to represent a fairly wide class of double integrals in the form of functional series.</description>

      <title>Series for even powers of Pi by generalization Euler's method for solving the Basel Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present series expansions for even powers of the number $\pi$. This is accomplished by generalizing Euler's method for solving the Basel Problem, which was published in 1735. We employ elementary symmetric polynomials, transform them into nested sums, and thereby derive nice series formulas for even powers of the number $\pi$ such as \[ \frac{\pi^2}{3!}= \sum_{\ell_1=1}^\infty\frac{1}{\ell_1^2} \;;\quad\quad \frac{\pi^4}{5!} = \sum_{\ell_2=2}^\infty \sum_{\ell_1=1}^{\ell_2-1} \frac{1}{\ell_1^2\cdot\ell_2^2} \;;\quad\quad \frac{\pi^6}{7!}= \sum_{\ell_3=3}^\infty \sum_{\ell_2=2}^{\ell_3-1} \sum_{\ell_1=1}^{\ell_2-1}\frac{1}{\ell_1^2\cdot\ell_2^2\cdot\ell_3^2} \;;\quad\cdots \] Many of these formulas do not seem to be widely known.

  In dieser Abhandlung stellen wir ein Verfahren vor, das die Berechnung von Reihen f\"ur geradzahlige Potenzen von $\pi$ erm\"oglicht. Die Grundidee ist eine Verallgemeinerung des Verfahrens von Euler, mit dem er 1735 das Basler Problem l\"oste. Wir stellen elementar-symmetrische Polynome durch mehrfach verschachtelte Summen dar und leiten davon Reihen f\"ur geradzahlige Potenzen der Kreiszahl $\pi$ ab. Die meisten der angegebenen Reihen scheinen nicht so bekannt zu sein.</description>
