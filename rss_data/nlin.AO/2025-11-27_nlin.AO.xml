      <title>Topological Defects in Spiral Wave Chimera States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chimera states, where coherent and incoherent domains coexist, represent a key self-organization phenomenon in the study of synchronization in complex systems. We introduce a topological analysis method based on winding numbers to characterize the dynamics of spiral wave chimeras in a two-dimensional phase oscillator network. Our investigation reveals distinct scaling laws governing the system's evolution across the phase lag $\alpha$. Perturbation analysis in the limit $\alpha \to 0$ demonstrates that the incoherent core radius scales linearly with $\alpha$. In contrast, within the stable chimera regime, the average total positive winding number $\overline{n_+}$ follows a clear exponential growth law $\overline{n_+} = ae^{b\alpha}$. This divergence suggests a physical crossover from geometric core expansion to active topological excitation. Furthermore, we identify a statistical transition in the defect distribution from binomial-like to Poisson-like behavior at a critical threshold $\alpha^*$, which we interpret as a shift from a constrained regime to an unconstrained state analogous to a BKT binding-unbinding transition. These results indicate that topological defects are not randomly distributed but possess quantifiable statistical order, proposing $\overline{n_+}$ as a robust physical quantity to analyze the topological structure and complexity of chimera states.</description>

      <title>A Network Dynamical Systems Approach to SDGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a complex, interdependent framework where progress in one area can synergistically promote or competitively inhibit progress in others. For policymakers in international development, a critical challenge is identifying "leverage points" - specific goals where limited resource allocation yields the maximum system-wide benefit. This study addresses this challenge by modeling the SDGs as a Networked Dynamical System (NDS). Using empirical data from Our World in Data (2018), we construct a weighted interaction network of 16 SDG indicators. We employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression to derive coupling weights empirically. Unlike previous static analyses, we simulate the temporal evolution of development indicators using an extended Lotka-Volterra model. To ensure numerical stability and sophistication, we upgrade the simulation method from standard Euler integration to the Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4) method. Our simulation, applied to a case study of Mexico, reveals that SDG 4 (Quality Education) acts as a critical driver, suggesting that prioritizing education yields the most significant positive spillover effects across the development network. Furthermore, we perform sensitivity analysis and explore the power-law relationship between investment and stability.</description>

      <title>Lotka-Volterra-type kinetic equations for interacting species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine a kinetic framework for modeling the time evolution of size distribution densities of two populations governed by predator-prey interactions. The model builds upon the classical Boltzmann-type equations, where the dynamics arise from elementary binary interactions between the populations. The model uniquely incorporates a linear redistribution operator to quantify the birth rates in both populations, inspired by wealth redistribution operators. We prove that, under a suitable scaling regime, the Boltzmann formulation transitions to a system of coupled Fokker-Planck-type equations. These equations describe the evolution of the distribution densities and link the macroscopic dynamics of their mean values to a Lotka-Volterra system of ordinary differential equations, with parameters explicitly derived from the microscopic interaction rules. We then determine the local equilibria of the Fokker-Planck system, which are Gamma-type densities, and investigate the problem of relaxation of its solutions toward these kinetic equilibria, in terms of their moments' dynamics. The results establish a bridge between kinetic modeling and classical population dynamics, offering a multiscale perspective on predator-prey systems.</description>
