      <title>A Spectral Contraction Framework for Periodic Solutions in Nonsmooth Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a contraction-based framework to establish the existence and exponential stability of periodic solutions in planar nonsmooth dynamical systems governed by Filippov differential inclusions. The method integrates a time- and state-dependent weighted metric with Clarke's generalized Jacobian and a uniform jump condition across switching manifolds to guarantee global exponential contraction on compact, forward-invariant sets. This work generalizes classical contraction results from smooth one-dimensional systems to two-dimensional systems with discontinuities and sliding behavior. A fixed-point argument ensures the existence and uniqueness of an attracting periodic orbit. The framework offers a robust analytic tool for stability analysis in piecewise-smooth systems, with applications in hybrid control, nonsmooth mechanics, and computational dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that there exists a group which is not finitely generated, but admits a minimal sofic shift. This answers a question of Doucha, Melleray and Tsankov. The group is of the form $(F_4 \times F_2) \rtimes F_{\infty}$. The construction itself is based on simulation theory and properties of Thompson's~$V$.</description>

      <title>Upper bound of the number of limit cycles for symmetric scalar piecewise linear differential equations with three zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the dynamics of a continuous observable and non-controllable three-dimensional symmetric piecewise linear system with three zones can be reduced to the study of the existence of limit cycles for the piecewise differential equation $x'=ax+(b-a)\mathop{\rm sat}(x)+\mu\sin t$, where $\operatorname{sat}$ stands for the normalized saturation function. This paper proves that the number of limit cycles of the equation is finite independently of $a,b,\mu$. Moreover, it is proven that the maximum number of limit cycles is exactly one or three for certain values of the parameters. Using Melnikov theory for a certain deformation of the equation, it is proven that for small values of the perturbation parameter, there are exactly three, five or one limit cycles, depending on the values of $\mu$. This strengthens the conjecture that the equation has at most five limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Designing Robust Software Sensors for Nonlinear Systems via Neural Networks and Adaptive Sliding Mode Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the state variables in a dynamical system is critical for effective control, diagnosis, and supervision, especially when direct measurements of all states are infeasible. This paper presents a novel approach to designing software sensors for nonlinear dynamical systems expressed in their most general form. Unlike traditional model-based observers that rely on explicit transformations or linearization, the proposed framework integrates neural networks with adaptive Sliding Mode Control (SMC) to design a robust state observer under a less restrictive set of conditions. The learning process is driven by available sensor measurements, which are used to correct the observer's state estimate. The training methodology leverages the system's governing equations as a physics-based constraint, enabling observer synthesis without access to ground-truth state trajectories. By employing a time-varying gain matrix dynamically adjusted by the neural network, the observer adapts in real-time to system changes, ensuring robustness against noise, external disturbances, and variations in system dynamics. Furthermore, we provide sufficient conditions to guarantee estimation error convergence, establishing a theoretical foundation for the observer's reliability. The methodology's effectiveness is validated through simulations on challenging examples, including systems with non-differentiable dynamics and varying observability conditions. These examples, which are often problematic for conventional techniques, serve to demonstrate the robustness and broad applicability of our approach. The results show rapid convergence and high accuracy, underscoring the method's potential for addressing complex state estimation challenges in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Reversibility, balance and expansivity of non-uniform cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-uniform cellular automata (NUCA) are an extension of cellular automata (CA), which transform cells according to multiple different local rules. A NUCA is defined by a configuration of local rules called a local rule distribution. We examine what properties of uniform CA can be recovered by restricting the rule distribution to be (uniformly) recurrent, focusing on only 1D NUCA.
  We show that a bijective NUCA with a uniformly recurrent rule distribution is reversible. We also show that if a NUCA is surjective and has a recurrent rule distribution, or if it is bijective, then it is balanced. We present an example of a NUCA which has a non-empty and non-residual set of equicontinuity points, and one which is not sensitive but has no equicontinuity points. Finally, we show that (positively) expansive NUCA are sensitive.</description>

      <title>On the surjunctivity and the Garden of Eden theorem for non-uniform cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-uniform cellular automata (NUCA) are an extension of cellular automata with multiple local rules in different cells. We show that if the distribution of local rules is uniformly recurrent, or recurrent in the one-dimensional case, the Garden of Eden theorem holds. We also show that for any non-recurrent distribution, there is a substitution of local rules that defines a NUCA which does not satisfy the Garden of Eden theorem. Finally, we show that a rule distribution asymptotic to recurrent distribution defines a surjunctive NUCA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SymFlux, a novel deep learning framework that performs symbolic regression to identify Hamiltonian functions from their corresponding vector fields on the standard symplectic plane. SymFlux models utilize hybrid CNN-LSTM architectures to learn and output the symbolic mathematical expression of the underlying Hamiltonian. Training and validation are conducted on newly developed datasets of Hamiltonian vector fields, a key contribution of this work. Our results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in accurately recovering these symbolic expressions, advancing automated discovery in Hamiltonian mechanics.</description>

      <title>KPFlow: An Operator Perspective on Dynamic Collapse Under Gradient Descent Training of Recurrent Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient Descent (GD) and its variants are the primary tool for enabling efficient training of recurrent dynamical systems such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Neural ODEs and Gated Recurrent units (GRUs). The dynamics that are formed in these models exhibit features such as neural collapse and emergence of latent representations that may support the remarkable generalization properties of networks. In neuroscience, qualitative features of these representations are used to compare learning in biological and artificial systems. Despite recent progress, there remains a need for theoretical tools to rigorously understand the mechanisms shaping learned representations, especially in finite, non-linear models. Here, we show that the gradient flow, which describes how the model's dynamics evolve over GD, can be decomposed into a product that involves two operators: a Parameter Operator, K, and a Linearized Flow Propagator, P. K mirrors the Neural Tangent Kernel in feed-forward neural networks, while P appears in Lyapunov stability and optimal control theory. We demonstrate two applications of our decomposition. First, we show how their interplay gives rise to low-dimensional latent dynamics under GD, and, specifically, how the collapse is a result of the network structure, over and above the nature of the underlying task. Second, for multi-task training, we show that the operators can be used to measure how objectives relevant to individual sub-tasks align. We experimentally and theoretically validate these findings, providing an efficient Pytorch package, \emph{KPFlow}, implementing robust analysis tools for general recurrent architectures. Taken together, our work moves towards building a next stage of understanding of GD learning in non-linear recurrent models.</description>

      <title>Generative Lagrangian data assimilation for ocean dynamics under extreme sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing ocean dynamics from observational data is fundamentally limited by the sparse, irregular, and Lagrangian nature of spatial sampling, particularly in subsurface and remote regions. This sparsity poses significant challenges for forecasting key phenomena such as eddy shedding and rogue waves. Traditional data assimilation methods and deep learning models often struggle to recover mesoscale turbulence under such constraints. We leverage a deep learning framework that combines neural operators with denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to reconstruct high-resolution ocean states from extremely sparse Lagrangian observations. By conditioning the generative model on neural operator outputs, the framework accurately captures small-scale, high-wavenumber dynamics even at $99\%$ sparsity (for synthetic data) and $99.9\%$ sparsity (for real satellite observations). We validate our method on benchmark systems, synthetic float observations, and real satellite data, demonstrating robust performance under severe spatial sampling limitations as compared to other deep learning baselines.</description>

      <title>Linear and Regular Kepler-Manev Dynamics via Projective Transformations: A Geometric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a geometric formulation for transforming nonconservative mechanical Hamiltonian systems and introduces a new method for regularizing and linearizing central force dynamics -- in particular, Kepler and Manev dynamics -- through a projective transformation. The transformation is formulated as a configuration space diffeomorphism (rather than a submersion) that is lifted to a cotangent bundle (phase space) symplectomorphism and used to pullback the original mechanical Hamiltonian system, Riemannian kinetic energy metric, and other key geometric objects. Full linearization of both Kepler and Manev dynamics (in any finite dimension) is achieved by a subsequent conformal scaling of the projectively-transformed Hamiltonian vector field. Two such conformal scalings are given, both achieving linearization. Arbitrary conservative and nonconservative perturbations are included, with closed-form solutions readily obtained in the unperturbed Kepler or Manev cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider approximation properties of real points by uniformly distributed sequences. Under some assumptions on the approximation functions, we prove a Khintchine-type $0$-$1$ dichotomy law. We establish a new connection between uniform distribution and the ubiquity property. Namely, we show that a bound on the discrepancy of the sequence implies the ubiquity property, which helps to obtain divergence results. We further obtain Hausdorff dimension results for weighted sets. The key tools in proving these results are the weighted ubiquitous systems and weighted mass transference principle introduced recently by Kleinbock \&amp; Wang, and Wang \&amp; Wu respectively.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modelling of Oscillatory Dynamics in Circular Traffic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous analytical model of traffic dynamics on a circular track, demonstrating the emergence of standing oscillations resulting from microscopic driver behaviour, delay responses, and proximity pressure. Without relying on simulation, we derive a series of coupled delay differential equations to model vehicular interactions. By introducing a mnemonic-based symbolic system, we establish a mathematical framework incorporating stochastic initial conditions, non-uniform reaction times, and cognitive lag. A full linear stability analysis is conducted using Fourier decomposition and modal perturbation techniques. Our results identify critical thresholds for harmonic induction, delineate the bounds of safe following distances, and reveal hysteresis in driver overcorrection. The analysis concludes with implications for autonomous vehicle control and potential suppression strategies for oscillatory instability. All derivations are purely symbolic and analytically proven.</description>

      <title>PINN-Obs: Physics-Informed Neural Network-Based Observer for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State estimation for nonlinear dynamical systems is a critical challenge in control and engineering applications, particularly when only partial and noisy measurements are available. This paper introduces a novel Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Network-based Observer (PINN-Obs) for accurate state estimation in nonlinear systems. Unlike traditional model-based observers, which require explicit system transformations or linearization, the proposed framework directly integrates system dynamics and sensor data into a physics-informed learning process. The observer adaptively learns an optimal gain matrix, ensuring convergence of the estimated states to the true system states. A rigorous theoretical analysis establishes formal convergence guarantees, demonstrating that the proposed approach achieves uniform error minimization under mild observability conditions. The effectiveness of PINN-Obs is validated through extensive numerical simulations on diverse nonlinear systems, including an induction motor model, a satellite motion system, and benchmark academic examples. Comparative experimental studies against existing observer designs highlight its superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Generalized Nonlinear Models Offer Basis Free SINDy With Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) has become a standard methodology for inferring governing equations of dynamical systems from observed data using statistical modeling. However, classical SINDy approaches rely on predefined libraries of candidate functions to model nonlinearities, which limits flexibility and excludes robust uncertainty quantification. This paper proposes Bayesian Generalized Nonlinear Models (BGNLMs) as a principled alternative for more flexible statistical modeling. BGNLMs employ spike-and-slab priors combined with binary inclusion indicators to automatically discover relevant nonlinearities without predefined basis functions. Moreover, BGNLMs quantify uncertainty in selected bases and final model predictions, enabling robust exploration of the model space. In this paper, the BGNLM framework is applied to several three-dimensional (3D) SINDy problems.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving space discretization of differential and nonlocal constitutive relations for port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structure-preserving space discretization of port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems defined with differential constitutive relations. Using the concept of Stokes-Lagrange structure to describe these relations, these are reduced to a finite-dimensional Lagrange subspace of a pH system thanks to a structure-preserving Finite Element Method.
  To illustrate our results, the 1D nanorod case and the shear beam model are considered, which are given by differential and implicit constitutive relations for which a Stokes-Lagrange structure along with boundary energy ports naturally occur.
  Then, these results are extended to the nonlinear 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations written in a vorticity-stream function formulation. It is first recast as a pH system defined with a Stokes-Lagrange structure along with a modulated Stokes-Dirac structure. A careful structure-preserving space discretization is then performed, leading to a finite-dimensional pH system. Theoretical and numerical results show that both enstrophy and kinetic energy evolutions are preserved both at the semi-discrete and fully-discrete levels.</description>

      <title>On the Borel complexity of the space of left-orderings of nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give the first examples of nonabelian left-orderable groups such that the conjugacy orbit equivalence relation on its space of orders has infinity orbits, yet it is smooth in the Borel sense. The examples are all nilpotent groups and we provide a sufficient condition so that the space of orders of a nilpotent group has a smooth conjugacy orbit relation. We also show with different examples that nilpotence is not a sufficient condition for smoothness.</description>

      <title>Temperature induced tipping in a two box ocean circulation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate tipping points are critical thresholds in Earth's climate system where a small change can cause abrupt and potentially irreversible shifts towards a new state. Tipping points in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) are of much scientific concern because of the large-scale impacts on Earth's climate. A two-box model representing the AMOC, introduced by oceanographer Paola Cessi (1994), revealed a multistable system, and was used to develop a tipping analysis framework to capture critical thresholds under freshwater forcing. Sustained increases in planetary energy uptake motivate the inspection of the model, shifting the focus to thermal dynamics. In this paper, we demonstrate that tipping can occur in the model where the temperature gradient acts as the forcing parameter instead of the freshwater forcing parameter.</description>

      <title>Area spectral rigidity for axially symmetric and Radon domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that $(a)$ any finitely smooth axially symmetric strictly convex domain, with everywhere positive curvature and sufficiently close to an ellipse, and $(b)$ any finitely smooth centrally symmetric strictly convex domain, even-rationally integrable, with everywhere positive curvature and sufficiently close to an ellipse is area spectrally rigid. This means that any area-isospectral family of domains in these classes is necessarily equi-affine. We use the same technique -- adapted to symplectic billiards -- of the paper by De Simoi, Kaloshin, and Wei (2017). The novelty is that the result holds for axially symmetric domains, as in the cited paper, as well as for a subset of centrally symmetric ones.</description>

Abstract: We study chain-recurrence and chain-transitivity in compact dynamical systems without any regularity assumptions on the map. We prove that every compact system has a chain-recurrent point and a closed, invariant, chain-transitive subsystem. The proofs do not use any form of the Axiom of Choice.</description>

      <title>Attractor sets and Julia sets in low dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:1810.02834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $X$ is the attractor set of a conformal IFS in dimension two or three, we prove that there exists a quasiregular semigroup $G$ with Julia set equal to $X$. We also show that in dimension two, with a further assumption similar to the open set condition, the same result can be achieved with a semigroup generated by one element. Consequently, in this case the attractor set is quasiconformally equivalent to the Julia set of a rational map.</description>

      <title>Interpolating with generalized Assouad dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\phi$-Assouad dimensions are a family of dimensions which interpolate between the upper box and Assouad dimensions. They are a generalization of the well-studied Assouad spectrum with a more general form of scale sensitivity that is often closely related to "phase-transition" phenomena in sets.
  In this article we establish a number of key properties of the $\phi$-Assouad dimensions which help to clarify their behaviour. We prove for any bounded doubling metric space $F$ and $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $\overline{\operatorname{dim}}_{\mathrm{B}}F&lt;\alpha\leq\operatorname{dim}_{\mathrm{A}} F$ that there is a function $\phi$ so that the $\phi$-Assouad dimension of $F$ is equal to $\alpha$. We further show that the "upper" variant of the dimension is fully determined by the $\phi$-Assouad dimension, and that homogeneous Moran sets are in a certain sense generic for these dimensions.
  Further, we study explicit examples of sets where the Assouad spectrum does not reach the Assouad dimension. We prove a precise formula for the $\phi$-Assouad dimensions for Galton--Watson trees that correspond to a general class of stochastically self-similar sets, including Mandelbrot percolation. This result follows from two results which may be of general interest: a sharp large deviations theorem for Galton--Watson processes with bounded offspring distribution, and a Borel--Cantelli-type lemma for infinite structures in random trees. Finally, we obtain results on the $\phi$-Assouad dimensions of overlapping self-similar sets and decreasing sequences with decreasing gaps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a complex H\'enon map and $\mu$ its unique measure of maximal entropy. We prove that $\mu$ is exponentially mixing of all orders for all (not necessarily bounded) plurisubharmonic observables, and that all plurisubharmonic functions satisfy the central limit theorem with respect to $\mu$. Our results hold more generally for every H\'enon-Sibony map on $\mathbb{C}^k$.</description>

      <title>Estimating Varying Parameters in Dynamical Systems: A Modular Framework Using Switch Detection, Optimization, and Sparse Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16198v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The estimation of static parameters in dynamical systems and control theory has been extensively studied, with significant progress made in estimating varying parameters in specific system types. Suppose, in the general case, we have data from a system with parameters that depend on an independent variable such as time or space. Further, suppose the system's model structure is known, but our aim is to identify functions describing parameter-varying elements as they change with respect to time or another variable. Focusing initially on the subclass of problems where parameters are discretely switching piecewise constant functions, we develop an algorithmic framework for detecting discrete parameter switches and fitting a piecewise constant model to data using optimization-based parameter estimation. Our modular framework allows for customization of switch detection, numerical integration, and optimization sub-steps to suit user requirements. Binary segmentation is used for switch detection, with Nelder-Mead and Powell methods employed for optimization. To address broader problems, we extend our framework using dictionary-based sparse regression with trigonometric and polynomial functions to obtain continuously varying parameter functions. Finally, we assess the framework's robustness to measurement noise. We demonstrate its capabilities across several examples, including time-varying promoter-gene expression, a genetic toggle switch, a parameter-switching manifold, the heat equation with a time-varying diffusion coefficient, and the advection-diffusion equation with a continuously varying parameter.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of approaching real numbers with rational numbers with prime denominator and with a single numerator allowed for each denominator. We obtain basic results, both probabilistic and deterministic, draw connections to twisted diophantine approximation, and present a simple application, related to possible correlations between trace functions and dynamical sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a holomorphic automorphism of a compact K\"ahler manifold with simple action on cohomology and $\mu$ its unique measure of maximal entropy. We prove that $\mu$ is exponentially mixing of all orders for all d.s.h.\ observables, i.e., functions that are locally differences of plurisubharmonic functions. As a consequence, every d.s.h.\ observable satisfies the central limit theorem with respect to $\mu$.</description>
