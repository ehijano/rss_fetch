      <title>Autonomous Industrial Control using an Agentic Framework with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As chemical plants evolve towards full autonomy, the need for effective fault handling and control in dynamic, unpredictable environments becomes increasingly critical. This paper proposes an innovative approach to industrial automation, introducing validation and reprompting architectures utilizing large language model (LLM)-based autonomous control agents. The proposed agentic system, comprising of operator, validator, and reprompter agents, enables autonomous management of control tasks, adapting to unforeseen disturbances without human intervention. By utilizing validation and reprompting architectures, the framework allows agents to recover from errors and continuously improve decision-making in real-time industrial scenarios. We hypothesize that this mechanism will enhance performance and reliability across a variety of LLMs, offering a path toward fully autonomous systems capable of handling unexpected challenges, paving the way for robust, adaptive control in complex industrial environments. To demonstrate the concept's effectiveness, we created a simple case study involving a temperature control experiment embedded on a microcontroller device, validating the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>MA-DV2F: A Multi-Agent Navigation Framework using Dynamic Velocity Vector Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose MA-DV2F: Multi-Agent Dynamic Velocity Vector Field. It is a framework for simultaneously controlling a group of vehicles in challenging environments. DV2F is generated for each vehicle independently and provides a map of reference orientation and speed that a vehicle must attain at any point on the navigation grid such that it safely reaches its target. The field is dynamically updated depending on the speed and proximity of the ego-vehicle to other agents. This dynamic adaptation of the velocity vector field allows prevention of imminent collisions. Experimental results show that MA-DV2F outperforms concurrent methods in terms of safety, computational efficiency and accuracy in reaching the target when scaling to a large number of vehicles.

      <title>Learning Collective Dynamics of Multi-Agent Systems using Event-based Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel problem: vision-based perception to learn and predict the collective dynamics of multi-agent systems, specifically focusing on interaction strength and convergence time. Multi-agent systems are defined as collections of more than ten interacting agents that exhibit complex group behaviors. Unlike prior studies that assume knowledge of agent positions, we focus on deep learning models to directly predict collective dynamics from visual data, captured as frames or events. Due to the lack of relevant datasets, we create a simulated dataset using a state-of-the-art flocking simulator, coupled with a vision-to-event conversion framework. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of event-based representation over traditional frame-based methods in predicting these collective behaviors. Based on our analysis, we present event-based vision for Multi-Agent dynamic Prediction (evMAP), a deep learning architecture designed for real-time, accurate understanding of interaction strength and collective behavior emergence in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>RoundTable: Investigating Group Decision-Making Mechanism in Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of Multi-Agent Systems in eliciting cross-agent communication and enhancing collective intelligence through group decision-making in a decentralized setting. Unlike centralized mechanisms, where a fixed hierarchy governs social choice, decentralized group decision-making allows agents to engage in joint deliberation. Our research focuses on the dynamics of communication and decision-making within various social choice methods. By applying different voting rules in various environments, we find that moderate decision flexibility yields better outcomes. Additionally, exploring the linguistic features of agent-to-agent conversations reveals indicators of effective collaboration, offering insights into communication patterns that facilitate or hinder collaboration. Finally, we propose various methods for determining the optimal stopping point in multi-agent collaborations based on linguistic cues. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how decentralized decision-making and group conversation shape multi-agent collaboration, with implications for the design of more effective MAS environments.</description>

      <title>AI Multi-Agent Interoperability Extension for Managing Multiparty Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel extension to the existing Multi-Agent Interoperability specifications of the Open Voice Interoperability Initiative (originally also known as OVON from the Open Voice Network). This extension enables AI agents developed with different technologies to communicate using a universal, natural language-based API or NLP-based standard APIs. Focusing on the management of multiparty AI conversations, this work introduces new concepts such as the Convener Agent, Floor-Shared Conversational Space, Floor Manager, Multi-Conversant Support, and mechanisms for handling Interruptions and Uninvited Agents. Additionally, it explores the Convener's role as a message relay and controller of participant interactions, enhancing both scalability and security. These advancements are crucial for ensuring smooth, efficient, and secure interactions in scenarios where multiple AI agents need to collaborate, debate, or contribute to a discussion. The paper elaborates on these concepts and provides practical examples, illustrating their implementation within the conversation envelope structure.</description>

      <title>NeKo: Toward Post Recognition Generative Correction Large Language Models with Task-Oriented Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Construction of a general-purpose post-recognition error corrector poses a crucial question: how can we most effectively train a model on a large mixture of domain datasets? The answer would lie in learning dataset-specific features and digesting their knowledge in a single model. Previous methods achieve this by having separate correction language models, resulting in a significant increase in parameters. In this work, we present Mixture-of-Experts as a solution, highlighting that MoEs are much more than a scalability tool. We propose a Multi-Task Correction MoE, where we train the experts to become an ``expert'' of speech-to-text, language-to-text and vision-to-text datasets by learning to route each dataset's tokens to its mapped expert. Experiments on the Open ASR Leaderboard show that we explore a new state-of-the-art performance by achieving an average relative $5.0$% WER reduction and substantial improvements in BLEU scores for speech and translation tasks. On zero-shot evaluation, NeKo outperforms GPT-3.5 and Claude-Opus with $15.5$% to $27.6$% relative WER reduction in the Hyporadise benchmark. NeKo performs competitively on grammar and post-OCR correction as a multi-task model.</description>

      <title>Game-theoretic LLM: Agent Workflow for Negotiation Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05990v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the rationality of large language models (LLMs) in strategic decision-making contexts, specifically within the framework of game theory. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs across a spectrum of complete-information and incomplete-information games. Our findings reveal that LLMs frequently deviate from rational strategies, particularly as the complexity of the game increases with larger payoff matrices or deeper sequential trees.
  To address these limitations, we design multiple game-theoretic workflows that guide the reasoning and decision-making processes of LLMs. These workflows aim to enhance the models' ability to compute Nash Equilibria and make rational choices, even under conditions of uncertainty and incomplete information. Experimental results demonstrate that the adoption of these workflows significantly improves the rationality and robustness of LLMs in game-theoretic tasks. Specifically, with the workflow, LLMs exhibit marked improvements in identifying optimal strategies, achieving near-optimal allocations in negotiation scenarios, and reducing susceptibility to exploitation during negotiations. Furthermore, we explore the meta-strategic considerations of whether it is rational for agents to adopt such workflows, recognizing that the decision to use or forgo the workflow constitutes a game-theoretic issue in itself.
  Our research contributes to a deeper understanding of LLMs' decision-making capabilities in strategic contexts and provides insights into enhancing their rationality through structured workflows. The findings have implications for the development of more robust and strategically sound AI agents capable of navigating complex interactive environments.

      <title>SniffySquad: Patchiness-Aware Gas Source Localization with Multi-Robot Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gas source localization is pivotal for the rapid mitigation of gas leakage disasters, where mobile robots emerge as a promising solution. However, existing methods predominantly schedule robots' movements based on reactive stimuli or simplified gas plume models. These approaches typically excel in idealized, simulated environments but fall short in real-world gas environments characterized by their patchy distribution. In this work, we introduce SniffySquad, a multi-robot olfaction-based system designed to address the inherent patchiness in gas source localization. SniffySquad incorporates a patchiness-aware active sensing approach that enhances the quality of data collection and estimation. Moreover, it features an innovative collaborative role adaptation strategy to boost the efficiency of source-seeking endeavors. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves an increase in the success rate by $20\%+$ and an improvement in path efficiency by $30\%+$, outperforming state-of-the-art gas source localization solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient traffic signal control is critical for modern urban mobility, but traditional systems often struggle to adapt to complex city traffic patterns. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, or MARL, offers adaptive solutions, yet online MARL methods require extensive real-time interactions, which are costly and time-intensive. Offline MARL addresses these issues by using historical traffic data, but it faces challenges due to the diverse behavior policies in real-world datasets, where different controllers complicate learning.</description>

      <title>Learning Interpretable Network Dynamics via Universal Neural Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering governing equations of complex network dynamics is a fundamental challenge in contemporary science with rich data, which can uncover the mysterious patterns and mechanisms of the formation and evolution of complex phenomena in various fields and assist in decision-making. In this work, we develop a universal computational tool that can automatically, efficiently, and accurately learn the symbolic changing patterns of complex system states by combining the excellent fitting ability from deep learning and the equation inference ability from pre-trained symbolic regression. We conduct intensive experimental verifications on more than ten representative scenarios from physics, biochemistry, ecology, epidemiology, etc. Results demonstrate the outstanding effectiveness and efficiency of our tool by comparing with the state-of-the-art symbolic regression techniques for network dynamics. The application to real-world systems including global epidemic transmission and pedestrian movements has verified its practical applicability. We believe that our tool can serve as a universal solution to dispel the fog of hidden mechanisms of changes in complex phenomena, advance toward interpretability, and inspire more scientific discoveries.</description>

      <title>Eavesdropping on Semantic Communication: Timing Attacks and Countermeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication is a new paradigm that considers the meaning of transmitted information to optimize communication. One possible application is the remote monitoring of a process under communication costs: scheduling updates based on semantic considerations can significantly reduce transmission frequency while maintaining high-quality tracking performance. However, semantic scheduling also opens a timing-based side-channel that an eavesdropper may exploit to obtain information about the state of the remote process, even if the content of updates is perfectly secure. In this work, we study an eavesdropping attack against pull-based semantic scheduling for the tracking of remote Markov processes. We provide a theoretical framework for defining the effectiveness of the attack and of possible countermeasures, as well as a practical heuristic that can provide a balance between the performance gains offered by semantic communication and the information leakage.</description>

      <title>Bounded Rationality Equilibrium Learning in Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) tractably model behavior in large agent populations. The literature on learning MFG equilibria typically focuses on finding Nash equilibria (NE), which assume perfectly rational agents and are hence implausible in many realistic situations. To overcome these limitations, we incorporate bounded rationality into MFGs by leveraging the well-known concept of quantal response equilibria (QRE). Two novel types of MFG QRE enable the modeling of large agent populations where individuals only noisily estimate the true objective. We also introduce a second source of bounded rationality to MFGs by restricting agents' planning horizon. The resulting novel receding horizon (RH) MFGs are combined with QRE and existing approaches to model different aspects of bounded rationality in MFGs. We formally define MFG QRE and RH MFGs and compare them to existing equilibrium concepts such as entropy-regularized NE. Subsequently, we design generalized fixed point iteration and fictitious play algorithms to learn QRE and RH equilibria. After a theoretical analysis, we give different examples to evaluate the capabilities of our learning algorithms and outline practical differences between the equilibrium concepts.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-Agent Collaborative Manipulation for Long-Horizon Quadrupedal Pushing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, quadrupedal locomotion has achieved significant success, but their manipulation capabilities, particularly in handling large objects, remain limited, restricting their usefulness in demanding real-world applications such as search and rescue, construction, industrial automation, and room organization. This paper tackles the task of obstacle-aware, long-horizon pushing by multiple quadrupedal robots. We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with three levels of control. The high-level controller integrates an RRT planner and a centralized adaptive policy to generate subgoals, while the mid-level controller uses a decentralized goal-conditioned policy to guide the robots toward these sub-goals. A pre-trained low-level locomotion policy executes the movement commands. We evaluate our method against several baselines in simulation, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches, with 36.0% higher success rates and 24.5% reduction in completion time than the best baseline. Our framework successfully enables long-horizon, obstacle-aware manipulation tasks like Push-Cuboid and Push-T on Go1 robots in the real world.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Predictive Maintenance in Mining Mobile Machinery through a TinyML-enabled Hierarchical Inference Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mining machinery operating in variable environments faces high wear and unpredictable stress, challenging Predictive Maintenance (PdM). This paper introduces the Edge Sensor Network for Predictive Maintenance (ESN-PdM), a hierarchical inference framework across edge devices, gateways, and cloud services for real-time condition monitoring. The system dynamically adjusts inference locations--on-device, on-gateway, or on-cloud--based on trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and battery life, leveraging Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) techniques for model optimization on resource-constrained devices. Performance evaluations showed that on-sensor and on-gateway inference modes achieved over 90\% classification accuracy, while cloud-based inference reached 99\%. On-sensor inference reduced power consumption by approximately 44\%, enabling up to 104 hours of operation. Latency was lowest for on-device inference (3.33 ms), increasing when offloading to the gateway (146.67 ms) or cloud (641.71 ms). The ESN-PdM framework provides a scalable, adaptive solution for reliable anomaly detection and PdM, crucial for maintaining machinery uptime in remote environments. By balancing accuracy, latency, and energy consumption, this approach advances PdM frameworks for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>On the limits of agency in agent-based models</title>

Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) offers powerful insights into complex systems, but its practical utility has been limited by computational constraints and simplistic agent behaviors, especially when simulating large populations. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) could enhance ABMs with adaptive agents, but their integration into large-scale simulations remains challenging. This work introduces a novel methodology that bridges this gap by efficiently integrating LLMs into ABMs, enabling the simulation of millions of adaptive agents. We present LLM archetypes, a technique that balances behavioral complexity with computational efficiency, allowing for nuanced agent behavior in large-scale simulations. Our analysis explores the crucial trade-off between simulation scale and individual agent expressiveness, comparing different agent architectures ranging from simple heuristic-based agents to fully adaptive LLM-powered agents. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our approach through a case study of the COVID-19 pandemic, simulating 8.4 million agents representing New York City and capturing the intricate interplay between health behaviors and economic outcomes. Our method significantly enhances ABM capabilities for predictive and counterfactual analyses, addressing limitations of historical data in policy design. By implementing these advances in an open-source framework, we facilitate the adoption of LLM archetypes across diverse ABM applications. Our results show that LLM archetypes can markedly improve the realism and utility of large-scale ABMs while maintaining computational feasibility, opening new avenues for modeling complex societal challenges and informing data-driven policy decisions.</description>

      <title>Programming Distributed Collective Processes in the eXchange Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent trends like the Internet of Things (IoT) suggest a vision of dense and multi-scale deployments of computing devices in nearly all kinds of environments. A prominent engineering challenge revolves around programming the collective adaptive behaviour of such computational ecosystems. This requires abstractions able to capture concepts like ensembles (dynamic groups of cooperating devices) and collective tasks (joint activities carried out by ensembles). In this work, we consider collections of devices interacting with neighbours and that execute in nearly-synchronised sense-compute-interact rounds, where the computation is given by a single program mapping sensing values and incoming messages to output and outcoming messages. To support programming whole computational collectives, we propose the abstraction of a distributed collective process, which can be used to define at once the ensemble formation logic and its collective task. We formalise the abstraction in the eXchange Calculus (XC), a core functional language based on neighbouring values (maps from neighbours to values) where state and interaction is handled through a single primitive, exchange, and provide a corresponding implementation in the FCPP language. Then, we exercise distributed collective processes using two case studies: multi-hop message propagation and distributed monitoring of spatial properties. Finally, we discuss the features of the abstraction and its suitability for different kinds of distributed computing applications.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics for Utility Maximizing Agents: Exploring the Impact of the Resource Penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a continuous-time nonlinear model of opinion dynamics with utility-maximizing agents connected via a social influence network. A distinguishing feature of the proposed model is the inclusion of an opinion-dependent resource-penalty term in the utilities, which limits the agents from holding opinions of large magnitude. This model is applicable in scenarios where the opinions pertain to the usage of resources, such as money, time, computational resources etc. Each agent myopically seeks to maximize its utility by revising its opinion in the gradient ascent direction of its utility function, thus leading to the proposed opinion dynamics. We show that, for any arbitrary social influence network, opinions are ultimately bounded. For networks with weak antagonistic relations, we show that there exists a globally exponentially stable equilibrium using contraction theory. We establish conditions for the existence of consensus equilibrium and analyze the relative dominance of the agents at consensus. We also conduct a game-theoretic analysis of the underlying opinion formation game, including on Nash equilibria and on prices of anarchy in terms of satisfaction ratios. Additionally, we also investigate the oscillatory behavior of opinions in a two-agent scenario. Finally, simulations illustrate our findings.</description>

      <title>Reducing Leximin Fairness to Utilitarian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two prominent objectives in social choice are utilitarian - maximizing the sum of agents' utilities, and leximin - maximizing the smallest agent's utility, then the second-smallest, etc. Utilitarianism is typically computationally easier to attain but is generally viewed as less fair. This paper presents a general reduction scheme that, given a utilitarian solver, produces a distribution over outcomes that is leximin in expectation. Importantly, the scheme is robust in the sense that, given an approximate utilitarian solver, it produces an outcome that is approximately-leximin (in expectation) - with the same approximation factor. We apply our scheme to several social choice problems: stochastic allocations of indivisible goods, giveaway lotteries, and fair lotteries for participatory budgeting.</description>

      <title>TranSPORTmer: A Holistic Approach to Trajectory Understanding in Multi-Agent Sports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding trajectories in multi-agent scenarios requires addressing various tasks, including predicting future movements, imputing missing observations, inferring the status of unseen agents, and classifying different global states. Traditional data-driven approaches often handle these tasks separately with specialized models. We introduce TranSPORTmer, a unified transformer-based framework capable of addressing all these tasks, showcasing its application to the intricate dynamics of multi-agent sports scenarios like soccer and basketball. Using Set Attention Blocks, TranSPORTmer effectively captures temporal dynamics and social interactions in an equivariant manner. The model's tasks are guided by an input mask that conceals missing or yet-to-be-predicted observations. Additionally, we introduce a CLS extra agent to classify states along soccer trajectories, including passes, possessions, uncontrolled states, and out-of-play intervals, contributing to an enhancement in modeling trajectories. Evaluations on soccer and basketball datasets show that TranSPORTmer outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific models in player forecasting, player forecasting-imputation, ball inference, and ball imputation. https://youtu.be/8VtSRm8oGoE</description>

      <title>StoryAgent: Customized Storytelling Video Generation via Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of AI-Generated Content (AIGC) has spurred research into automated video generation to streamline conventional processes. However, automating storytelling video production, particularly for customized narratives, remains challenging due to the complexity of maintaining subject consistency across shots. While existing approaches like Mora and AesopAgent integrate multiple agents for Story-to-Video (S2V) generation, they fall short in preserving protagonist consistency and supporting Customized Storytelling Video Generation (CSVG). To address these limitations, we propose StoryAgent, a multi-agent framework designed for CSVG. StoryAgent decomposes CSVG into distinct subtasks assigned to specialized agents, mirroring the professional production process. Notably, our framework includes agents for story design, storyboard generation, video creation, agent coordination, and result evaluation. Leveraging the strengths of different models, StoryAgent enhances control over the generation process, significantly improving character consistency. Specifically, we introduce a customized Image-to-Video (I2V) method, LoRA-BE, to enhance intra-shot temporal consistency, while a novel storyboard generation pipeline is proposed to maintain subject consistency across shots. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in synthesizing highly consistent storytelling videos, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our contributions include the introduction of StoryAgent, a versatile framework for video generation tasks, and novel techniques for preserving protagonist consistency.</description>
