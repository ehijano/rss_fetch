      <title>Characterization of a modified clinical linear accelerator for ultra-high dose rate electron beam delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Irradiations at Ultra High Dose Rate (UHDR) regimes, exceeding 40 Gy/s in single fractions lasting less than 200 ms, have shown an equivalent antitumor effect compared to conventional radio-therapy with reduced harm to normal tissues. This work details the hardware and software modi-fications implemented to deliver 10 MeV UHDR electron beams with a Linear Accelerator Elekta SL 18 MV and the beam characteristics obtained. GafChromic EBT XD films and an Advanced Markus chamber were used for the dosimetry characterization, while a silicon sensor assessed the machine's beam pulses stability and repeatability. Dose per pulse, average dose rate and instantaneous dose rate in the pulse were evaluated for four experimental settings, varying the source-to-surface dis-tance and the beam collimation, i.e. with and without the use of a cylindrical applicator. Results showed dose per pulse from 0.6 Gy to a few tens of Gy and average dose rate up to 300 Gy/s. The obtained results demonstrate the possibility to perform in-vitro radiobiology experiments and test of new technologies for beam monitoring and dosimetry at the upgraded LINAC, thus contributing to the electron UHDR research field.</description>

      <title>Correlating Stroke Risk with Non-Invasive Tracing of Brain Blood Dynamic via a Portable Speckle Contrast Optical Spectroscopy Laser Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16571</link>

Abstract: Stroke poses a significant global health threat, with millions affected annually, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Current stroke risk assessment for the general population relies on markers such as demographics, blood tests, and comorbidities. A minimally invasive, clinically scalable, and cost-effective way to directly measure cerebral blood flow presents an opportunity. This opportunity has potential to positively impact effective stroke risk assessment prevention and intervention. Physiological changes in the cerebral vascular system, particularly in response to carbon dioxide level changes and oxygen deprivation, such as during breath-holding, can offer insights into stroke risk assessment. However, existing methods for measuring cerebral perfusion reserve, such as blood flow and blood volume changes, are limited by either invasiveness or impracticality. Here, we propose a transcranial approach using speckle contrast optical spectroscopy (SCOS) to non-invasively monitor regional changes in brain blood flow and volume during breath-holding. Our study, conducted on 50 individuals classified into two groups (low-risk and higher-risk for stroke), shows significant differences in blood dynamic changes during breath-holding between the two groups, providing physiological insights for stroke risk assessment using a non-invasive quantification paradigm. Given its cost-effectiveness, scalability, portability, and simplicity, this laser-centric tool has significant potential in enhancing the pre-screening of stroke and mitigating strokes in the general population through early diagnosis and intervention.</description>

      <title>Complex-valued neural networks to speed-up MR Thermometry during Hyperthermia using Fourier PD and PDUNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperthermia (HT) in combination with radio- and/or chemotherapy has become an accepted cancer treatment for distinct solid tumour entities. In HT, tumour tissue is exogenously heated to temperatures between 39 and 43 $^\circ$C for 60 minutes. Temperature monitoring can be performed non-invasively using dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the slow nature of MRI leads to motion artefacts in the images due to the movements of patients during image acquisition. By discarding parts of the data, the speed of the acquisition can be increased - known as undersampling. However, due to the invalidation of the Nyquist criterion, the acquired images might be blurry and can also produce aliasing artefacts. The aim of this work was, therefore, to reconstruct highly undersampled MR thermometry acquisitions with better resolution and with fewer artefacts compared to conventional methods. The use of deep learning in the medical field has emerged in recent times, and various studies have shown that deep learning has the potential to solve inverse problems such as MR image reconstruction. However, most of the published work only focuses on the magnitude images, while the phase images are ignored, which are fundamental requirements for MR thermometry. This work, for the first time, presents deep learning-based solutions for reconstructing undersampled MR thermometry data. Two different deep learning models have been employed here, the Fourier Primal-Dual network and the Fourier Primal-Dual UNet, to reconstruct highly undersampled complex images of MR thermometry. The method reduced the temperature difference between the undersampled MRIs and the fully sampled MRIs from 1.3 $^\circ$C to 0.6 $^\circ$C in full volume and 0.49 $^\circ$C to 0.06 $^\circ$C in the tumour region for an acceleration factor of 10.</description>

      <title>Low-dose, high-resolution CT of infant-sized lungs via propagation-based phase contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many lung diseases require detailed visualisation for accurate diagnosis and treatment. High-resolution computed tomography (CT) is the gold-standard technique for non-invasive lung disease detection, but it presents a risk to the patient through the relatively high ionising radiation dose required. Utilising the X-ray phase information may allow improvements in image resolution at equal or lower radiation levels than current clinical imaging. Propagation-based phase-contrast imaging requires minimal adaption of existing medical systems, and is well suited to lung imaging due to the strong phase gradients introduced by the lung-air material interfaces. Herein, propagation-based phase contrast CT is demonstrated for large animals, namely lambs, as a model for paediatric patients, using monochromatic radiation and a photon-counting detector at the Imaging and Medical Beamline of the Australian Synchrotron. Image quality, normalised against radiation dose, was optimised as a function of the beam energy and propagation distance, with the optimal conditions used to test the available image quality at very low radiation dose. The resulting CT images demonstrate superior resolution to existing high-resolution CT systems, pushing dose to the quantum limit to comply with current Australian guidelines for infant chest CT exposure of $&lt;2.5\:\text{mSv}$ effective dose. Constituent raw projections are shown to have significant proportions of pixels with zero photon counts that would create severe information loss in conventional CT. Phase retrieval enabled clear visualisation of minor lung airways at doses up to 1,225$\pm$31\% times lower than conventional CT reconstruction, at a voxel size of just 75$\mathrm{\mu}$m.</description>

      <title>Thyroidiomics: An Automated Pipeline for Segmentation and Classification of Thyroid Pathologies from Scintigraphy Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The objective of this study was to develop an automated pipeline that enhances thyroid disease classification using thyroid scintigraphy images, aiming to decrease assessment time and increase diagnostic accuracy. Anterior thyroid scintigraphy images from 2,643 patients were collected and categorized into diffuse goiter (DG), multinodal goiter (MNG), and thyroiditis (TH) based on clinical reports, and then segmented by an expert. A ResUNet model was trained to perform auto-segmentation. Radiomic features were extracted from both physician (scenario 1) and ResUNet segmentations (scenario 2), followed by omitting highly correlated features using Spearman's correlation, and feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with XGBoost as the core. All models were trained under leave-one-center-out cross-validation (LOCOCV) scheme, where nine instances of algorithms were iteratively trained and validated on data from eight centers and tested on the ninth for both scenarios separately. Segmentation performance was assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), while classification performance was assessed using metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC AUC), and area under the precision-recall curve (PRC AUC). ResUNet achieved DSC values of 0.84$\pm$0.03, 0.71$\pm$0.06, and 0.86$\pm$0.02 for MNG, TH, and DG, respectively. Classification in scenario 1 achieved an accuracy of 0.76$\pm$0.04 and a ROC AUC of 0.92$\pm$0.02 while in scenario 2, classification yielded an accuracy of 0.74$\pm$0.05 and a ROC AUC of 0.90$\pm$0.02. The automated pipeline demonstrated comparable performance to physician segmentations on several classification metrics across different classes, effectively reducing assessment time while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy.
