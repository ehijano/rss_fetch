      <title>Scenario Synthesis and Macroeconomic Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce methodology to bridge scenario analysis and model-based risk forecasting, leveraging their respective strengths in policy settings. Our Bayesian framework addresses the fundamental challenge of reconciling judgmental narrative approaches with statistical forecasting. Analysis evaluates explicit measures of concordance of scenarios with a reference forecasting model, delivers Bayesian predictive synthesis of the scenarios to best match that reference, and addresses scenario set incompleteness. This underlies systematic evaluation and integration of risks from different scenarios, and quantifies relative support for scenarios modulo the defined reference forecasts. The framework offers advances in forecasting in policy institutions that supports clear and rigorous communication of evolving risks. We also discuss broader questions of integrating judgmental information with statistical model-based forecasts in the face of unexpected circumstances.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Thai inflation from univariate Bayesian regression perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the forecasting performance of Bayesian shrinkage priors in predicting Thai inflation in a univariate setup, with a particular interest in comparing those more advance shrinkage prior to a likelihood dominated/noninformative prior. Our forecasting exercises are evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Quantile-Weighted Continuous Ranked Probability Scores (qwCRPS), and Log Predictive Likelihood (LPL). The empirical results reveal several interesting findings: SV-augmented models consistently underperform compared to their non-SV counterparts, particularly in large predictor settings. Notably, HS, DL and LASSO in large-sized model setting without SV exhibit superior performance across multiple horizons. This indicates that a broader range of predictors captures economic dynamics more effectively than modeling time-varying volatility. Furthermore, while left-tail risks (deflationary pressures) are well-controlled by advanced priors (HS, HS+, and DL), right-tail risks (inflationary surges) remain challenging to forecast accurately. The results underscore the trade-off between model complexity and forecast accuracy, with simpler models delivering more reliable predictions in both normal and crisis periods (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic). This study contributes to the literature by highlighting the limitations of SV models in high-dimensional environments and advocating for a balanced approach that combines advanced shrinkage techniques with broad predictor coverage. These insights are crucial for policymakers and researchers aiming to enhance the precision of inflation forecasts in emerging economies.</description>

      <title>Shocking concerns: public perception about climate change and the macroeconomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public perceptions of climate change arguably contribute to shaping private adaptation and support for policy intervention. In this paper, we propose a novel Climate Concern Index (CCI), based on disaggregated web-search volumes related to climate change topics, to gauge the intensity and dynamic evolution of collective climate perceptions, and evaluate its impacts on the business cycle. Using data from the United States over the 2004:2024 span, we capture widespread shifts in perceived climate-related risks, particularly those consistent with the postcognitive interpretation of affective responses to extreme climate events. To assess the aggregate implications of evolving public concerns about the climate, we estimate a proxy-SVAR model and find that exogenous variation in the CCI entails a statistically significant drop in both employment and private consumption and a persistent surge in stock market volatility, while core inflation remains largely unaffected. These results suggest that, even in the absence of direct physical risks, heightened concerns for climate-related phenomena can trigger behavioral adaptation with nontrivial consequences for the macroeconomy, thereby demanding attention from institutional players in the macro-financial field.</description>

      <title>Just Ask Them Twice: Choice Probabilities and Identification of Ex ante returns and Willingness-To-Pay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03009v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the exciting developments in the stated preference literature is the use of probabilistic stated preference experiments to estimate semi-parametric population distributions of ex ante returns and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a choice attribute. This relies on eliciting several choices per individual, and estimating separate demand functions, at the cost of possibly long survey instruments. This paper shows that the distributions of interest can be recovered from at most two stated choices, without requiring ad-hoc parametric assumptions. Hence, it allows for significantly shorter survey instruments. The paper also shows that eliciting probabilistic stated choices allows identifying much richer objects than we have done so far, and therefore, provides better tools for ex ante policy evaluation. Finally, it showcases the feasibility and relevance of the results by studying the preference of high ability students in Cote d'Ivoire for public sector jobs exploiting a unique survey on this population. Our analysis supports the claim that public sector jobs might significantly increase the cost of hiring elite students for the private sector.</description>

      <title>Individual Shrinkage for Random Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel approach to random effects estimation and individual-level forecasting in micropanels, targeting individual accuracy rather than aggregate performance. The conventional shrinkage methods used in the literature, such as the James-Stein estimator and Empirical Bayes, target aggregate performance and can lead to inaccurate decisions at the individual level. We propose a complementary class of shrinkage estimators with individual weights (IW) that leverage an individual's own past history, instead of the cross-sectional dimension. This approach overcomes the "tyranny of the majority" inherent in existing methods, while relying on weaker assumptions. We discuss the theoretical optimality of IW and recommend using feasible weights determined through a Minimax Regret analysis in practice.</description>

      <title>Free Discontinuity Regression: With an Application to the Economic Effects of Internet Shutdowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sharp, multidimensional changepoints-abrupt shifts in a regression surface whose locations and magnitudes are unknown-arise in settings as varied as gene-expression profiling, financial covariance breaks, climate-regime detection, and urban socioeconomic mapping. Despite their prevalence, there are no current approaches that jointly estimate the location and size of the discontinuity set in a one-shot approach with statistical guarantees. We therefore introduce Free Discontinuity Regression (FDR), a fully nonparametric estimator that simultaneously (i) smooths a regression surface, (ii) segments it into contiguous regions, and (iii) provably recovers the precise locations and sizes of its jumps. By extending a convex relaxation of the Mumford-Shah functional to random spatial sampling and correlated noise, FDR overcomes the fixed-grid and i.i.d. noise assumptions of classical image-segmentation approaches, thus enabling its application to real-world data of any dimension. This yields the first identification and uniform consistency results for multivariate jump surfaces: under mild SBV regularity, the estimated function, its discontinuity set, and all jump sizes converge to their true population counterparts. Hyperparameters are selected automatically from the data using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate, and large-scale simulations up to three dimensions validate the theoretical results and demonstrate good finite-sample performance. Applying FDR to an internet shutdown in India reveals a 25-35% reduction in economic activity around the estimated shutdown boundaries-much larger than previous estimates. By unifying smoothing, segmentation, and effect-size recovery in a general statistical setting, FDR turns free-discontinuity ideas into a practical tool with formal guarantees for modern multivariate data.</description>

      <title>Extending the Scope of Inference About Predictive Ability to Machine Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of machine learning methods for predictive purposes has increased dramatically over the past two decades, but uncertainty quantification for predictive comparisons remains elusive. This paper addresses this gap by extending the classic inference theory for predictive ability in time series to modern machine learners, such as the Lasso or Deep Learning. We investigate under which conditions such extensions are possible. For standard out-of-sample asymptotic inference to be valid with machine learning, two key properties must hold: (I) a zero-mean condition for the score of the prediction loss function and (ii) a "fast rate" of convergence for the machine learner. Absent any of these conditions, the estimation risk may be unbounded, and inferences invalid and very sensitive to sample splitting. For accurate inferences, we recommend an 80%-20% training-test splitting rule. We illustrate the wide applicability of our results with three applications: high-dimensional time series regressions with the Lasso, Deep learning for binary outcomes, and a new out-of-sample test for the Martingale Difference Hypothesis (MDH). The theoretical results are supported by extensive Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application evaluating the MDH of some major exchange rates at daily and higher frequencies.</description>

      <title>Policy Relevant Treatment Effects with Multidimensional Unobserved Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a unified framework for bounding policy relevant treatment effects using instrumental variables. In this framework, the treatment selection may depend on multidimensional unobserved heterogeneity. We derive bilinear constraints on the target parameter by extracting information from identifiable estimands. We apply a convex relaxation method to these bilinear constraints and provide conservative yet computationally simple bounds. Our convex-relaxation bounds extend and robustify the bounds by Mogstad, Santos, and Torgovitsky (2018) which require the threshold-crossing structure for the treatment: if this condition holds, our bounds are simplified to theirs for a large class of target parameters; even if it does not, our bounds include the true parameter value whereas theirs may not and are sometimes empty. Linear shape restrictions can be easily incorporated to narrow the proposed bounds. Numerical and simulation results illustrate the informativeness of our convex-relaxation bounds.</description>

      <title>When the Universe is Too Big: Bounding Consideration Probabilities for Plackett-Luce Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widely used Plackett-Luce ranking model assumes that individuals rank items by making repeated choices from a universe of items. But in many cases the universe is too big for people to plausibly consider all options. In the choice literature, this issue has been addressed by supposing that individuals first sample a small consideration set and then choose among the considered items. However, inferring unobserved consideration sets (or item consideration probabilities) in this "consider then choose" setting poses significant challenges, because even simple models of consideration with strong independence assumptions are not identifiable, even if item utilities are known. We apply the consider-then-choose framework to top-$k$ rankings, where we assume rankings are constructed according to a Plackett-Luce model after sampling a consideration set. While item consideration probabilities remain non-identified in this setting, we prove that we can infer bounds on the relative values of consideration probabilities. Additionally, given a condition on the expected consideration set size and known item utilities, we derive absolute upper and lower bounds on item consideration probabilities. We also provide algorithms to tighten those bounds on consideration probabilities by propagating inferred constraints. Thus, we show that we can learn useful information about consideration probabilities despite not being able to identify them precisely. We demonstrate our methods on a ranking dataset from a psychology experiment with two different ranking tasks (one with fixed consideration sets and one with unknown consideration sets). This combination of data allows us to estimate utilities and then learn about unknown consideration probabilities using our bounds.</description>

      <title>Design-Based Inference under Random Potential Outcomes via Riesz Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for design-based causal inference that accommodates stochastic potential outcomes, thereby extending the classical Neyman-Rubin setup in which outcomes are treated as fixed. In our formulation, each unit's potential outcome is modelled as a function $\tilde{y}_i(z, \omega)$, where $\omega$ denotes latent randomness external to the treatment assignment. Building on recent work that connects design-based estimation with the Riesz representation theorem, we construct causal estimators by embedding potential outcomes in a Hilbert space and defining treatment effects as linear functionals. This allows us to derive unbiased and consistent estimators, even when potential outcomes exhibit random variation. The framework retains the key advantage of design-based analysis, namely, the use of a known randomisation scheme for identification, while enabling inference in settings with inherent stochasticity. We establish large-sample properties under local dependence, provide a variance estimator compatible with sparse dependency structures, and illustrate the method through a simulation. Our results unify design-based reasoning with random-outcome modelling, broadening the applicability of causal inference in complex experimental environments.</description>
