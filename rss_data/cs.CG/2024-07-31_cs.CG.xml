      <title>Fast Static and Dynamic Approximation Algorithms for Geometric Optimization Problems: Piercing, Independent Set, Vertex Cover, and Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop simple and general techniques to obtain faster (near-linear time) static approximation algorithms, as well as efficient dynamic data structures, for four fundamental geometric optimization problems: minimum piercing set (MPS), maximum independent set (MIS), minimum vertex cover (MVC), and maximum-cardinality matching (MCM). Highlights of our results include the following:
  * For $n$ axis-aligned boxes in any constant dimension $d$, we give an $O(\log \log n)$-approximation algorithm for MPS that runs in $O(n^{1+\delta})$ time for an arbitrarily small constant $\delta&gt;0$. This significantly improves the previous $O(\log\log n)$-approximation algorithm by Agarwal, Har-Peled, Raychaudhury, and Sintos (SODA~2024), which ran in $O(n^{d/2}\mathop{\rm polylog} n)$ time.
  * Furthermore, we show that our algorithm can be made fully dynamic with $O(n^{\delta})$ amortized update time. Previously, Agarwal et al.~(SODA~2024) obtained dynamic results only in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and achieved only $O(\sqrt{n}\mathop{\rm polylog} n)$ amortized expected update time.
  * For $n$ axis-aligned rectangles in $\mathbb{R}^2$, we give an $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for MIS that runs in $O(n^{1+\delta})$ time. Our result significantly improves the running time of the celebrated algorithm by Mitchell (FOCS~2021) (which was about $O(n^{21})$), and answers one of his open questions. Our algorithm can also be made fully dynamic with $O(n^{\delta})$ amortized update time.
  * For $n$ (unweighted or weighted) fat objects in any constant dimension, we give a dynamic $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for MIS with $O(n^{\delta})$ amortized update time.
  * For disks in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or hypercubes in any constant dimension, we give the first fully dynamic $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms for MVC and MCM with $O(\mathop{\rm polylog}n)$ amortized update time.</description>

      <title>Mean of Means: A 10-dollar Solution for Human Localization with Calibration-free and Unconstrained Camera Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate human localization is crucial for various applications, especially in the Metaverse era. Existing high precision solutions rely on expensive, tag-dependent hardware, while vision-based methods offer a cheaper, tag-free alternative. However, current vision solutions based on stereo vision face limitations due to rigid perspective transformation principles and error propagation in multi-stage SVD solvers. These solutions also require multiple high-resolution cameras with strict setup constraints. To address these limitations, we propose a probabilistic approach that considers all points on the human body as observations generated by a distribution centered around the body's geometric center. This enables us to improve sampling significantly, increasing the number of samples for each point of interest from hundreds to billions. By modeling the relation between the means of the distributions of world coordinates and pixel coordinates, leveraging the Central Limit Theorem, we ensure normality and facilitate the learning process. Experimental results demonstrate human localization accuracy of 95% within a 0.3m range and nearly 100% accuracy within a 0.5m range, achieved at a low cost of only 10 USD using two web cameras with a resolution of 640x480 pixels.</description>
