      <title>Order-by-disorder without quantum zero-point fluctuations in the pyrochlore Heisenberg ferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Order-by-disorder, whereby fluctuations lift an accidental classical ground state degeneracy to stabilize a subset of ordered states, is a recurrent and prominent theme in the field of frustrated magnetism where magnetic moments, or spins, are subject to competing interactions. Thus far, such a phenomenon has been discussed in systems where the quantum ground state is not a product state. In this circumstance, both thermal and quantum fluctuations act to lift the accidental classical degeneracy, begging the question whether one mechanism of order-by-disorder is possible without the other. In this paper, we present results exposing a novel route to order-by-disorder, without quantum zero-point fluctuations, in a family of ferromagnetic Heisenberg materials with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction as the leading perturbation. We prove that any colinear ferromagnetic state is an exact eigenstate, even in the presence of the anisotropic DM interaction, while thermal fluctuations give rise to a preference in the magnetization direction. Here, we present in detail an example of the pyrochlore Heisenberg ferromagnet with DM interactions. Using both linear spin-wave theory and classical Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the magnetization can spontaneously rotate at intermediate temperature(s) within the colinear ferromagnetic phase when the DM interaction is large. Additionally, we find that in the large DM regime, the ferromagnetic ground state becomes unstable within the framework of non-linear spin-wave theory. Our results show that thermal order-by-disorder is possible even in the absence of quantum zero-point fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum criticality and pseudocriticality across the fixed-point annihilation in the anisotropic spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-boson models are simple examples of quantum dissipative systems, but also serve as effective models in quantum magnetism and exhibit nontrivial quantum criticality. Recently, they have been established as a platform to study the nontrivial renormalization-group (RG) scenario of fixed-point annihilation, in which two intermediate-coupling RG fixed points collide and generate an extremely slow RG flow near the collision. For the Bose Kondo model, a single $S=1/2$ spin where each spin component couples to an independent bosonic bath with power-law spectrum $\propto \omega^s$ via dissipation strengths $\alpha_i$, $i\in\{x,y,z\}$, such phenomena occur sequentially for the U(1)-symmetric model at $\alpha_z=0$ and the SU(2)-symmetric case at $\alpha_z = \alpha_{xy}$, as the bath exponent $s&lt;1$ is tuned. Here we use an exact wormhole quantum Monte Carlo method to show how fixed-point annihilations within symmetry-enhanced parameter manifolds affect the anisotropy-driven criticality across them. We find a tunable transition between two long-range-ordered localized phases that can be continuous or strongly first-order, and even becomes weakly first-order in an extended regime close to the fixed-point collision. We extract critical exponents at the continuous transition, but also find scaling behavior at the symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, for which the inverse correlation-length exponent is given by the bath exponent $s$. In particular, we provide direct numerical evidence for pseudocritical scaling on both sides of the fixed-point collision, which manifests in an extremely slow drift of the correlation-length exponent. In addition, we also study the crossover behavior away from the SU(2)-symmetric case and determine the phase boundary of an extended U(1)-symmetric critical phase for $\alpha_z &lt; \alpha_{xy}$.</description>

      <title>The de Haas-van Alphen quantum oscillations in the kagome metal RbTi3Bi5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome system usually attracts great interest in condensed matter physics due to its unique structure hosting various exotic states such as superconductivity (SC), charge density wave (CDW), and nontrivial topological states. Topological semimetal RbTi3Bi5 consisting of the kagome layer of Ti shares a similar crystal structure to topological correlated materials AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) but with the absence of CDW and SC. Systematic de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation measurements are performed on the single crystals of RbTi3Bi5 to pursue nontrivial topological physics and exotic states. Combining with theoretical calculations, detailed Fermi surface topology and band structure are investigated. A two-dimensional (2D) Fermi pocket \b{eta} is revealed with a light-effective mass in consistent with the semimetal predictions. Landau Fan of RbTi3Bi5 reveals a zero Berry phase for the \b{eta} oscillation in contrast to that of CsTi3Bi5. These results suggest the kagome RbTi3Bi5 is a good candidate to explore nontrivial topological exotic states and topological correlated physics.</description>

      <title>Novel Dipole-Lattice coupling in the Quantum-Spin-Liquid Material $\kappa$-Cu-CN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of molecular Mott insulators on triangular lattice provided a few S=1/2 triangular quantum spin liquid candidates, with $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ being the most studied material of this group. The large number experimental work presented a conflicting set of evidence, some suggesting spin liquid behavior, while other pointing on deceased magnetization reminding of a valence bond solid with orphan spins. In this work we use Raman scattering spectroscopy to probe both local charge on molecular sites and lattice phonons as a function of temperature down to 6K. Based on the analysis of the increasing width of Gaussian line shape of the BEDT-TTF charge sensitive vibration $\nu_2$ on colling below 40 K we suggest a development of disordered fluctuating charge disproportionation on (BEDT-TTF)$_2$ dimers of amplitude as small as 0.06$e$. The lattice phonons show strong anomalous broadening on cooling only in (c,c) scattering channel, associated with the developing charge disproportionation. We suggest an interpretation, where the coupling of disordered charge dipoles on dimers to the lattice results in anisotropic modulation of charge transfer integrals between dimer lattice sites. Such fluctuation would results in fluctuations of magnetic coupling between spins which can produce short lived charge ordered spin-singlet pairs.</description>

      <title>Strain tunable electronic ground states in two-dimensional iridate thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phases of matter such as superconducting, ferromagnetic and Wigner crystal states are often driven by the two-dimensionality (2D) of correlated systems. Meanwhile, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is a fundamental element leading to nontrivial topology which gives rise to quantum phenomena such as the large anomalous Hall effect and nontrivial superconductivity. However, the search for controllable platforms with both 2D and SOC has been relatively overlooked so far. Here, we control and study the electronic ground states of iridate ultrathin films having both 2D and SOC by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) calculations. The metallicity of SrIrO$_3$ ultrathin films is controlled down to a monolayer by dimensional and strain manipulation. Our results suggest that the iridate ultrathin films can be a controllable 2D SOC platform exhibiting a variety of phenomena for future functional devices.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate broken-helix and broken-fanlike states in axion insulator candidate EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zintl phase EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$ has garnered growing attention as an axion insulator candidate, triggered by the identification of a commensurate double-${\mathbf Q}$ broken-helix state in previous studies, however, its periodicity and symmetry remain subjects of debate. Here, we perform resonant x-ray scattering experiments on EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$, revealing an incommensurate nature of the broken-helix state, where both the wave number and the amplitude of the helical modulation exhibit systematic sample dependence. Furthermore, the application of an in-plane magnetic field brings about a broken-fanlike state preserving the double-${\mathbf Q}$ nature, which could be attributed to multiple-spin interactions in momentum space. We propose that the itinerant character of EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$, possibly induced by Eu deficiency, gives rise to the helical modulation and impedes the realization of a theoretically-predicted axion state with the collinear antiferromagnetic order.</description>

      <title>Internal consistency of multi-tier $GW$+EDMFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-tier $GW$+EDMFT scheme is an ab-initio method for calculating the electronic structure of correlated materials. While the approach is free from ad-hoc parameters, it requires a selection of appropriate energy windows for describing low-energy and strongly correlated physics. In this study, we test the consistency of the multi-tier description by considering different low-energy windows for a series of cubic SrXO$_3$ (X=V,Cr,Mn) perovskites. Specifically, we compare the 3-orbital $t_{2g}$ model, the 5-orbital $t_{2g}+e_g$ model, the 12-orbital $t_{2g}+O_p$ model, and (in the case of SrVO$_3$) the 14-orbital $t_{2g}+e_g+O_p$ model and compare the results to available photoemission and X-ray absorption measurements. The multi-tier method yields consistent results for the $t_{2g}$ and $t_{2g}+e_g$ low-energy windows, while the models with $O_p$ states produce stronger correlation effects and mostly agree well with experiment, especially in the unoccupied part of the spectrum.
  We also discuss the consistency between the fermionic and bosonic spectral functions and the physical origin of satellite features, and present momentum-resolved charge susceptibilities.</description>

      <title>Resolving chiral transitions in Rydberg arrays with quantum Kibble-Zurek mechanism and finite-time scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental realization of the quantum Kibble-Zurek mechanism in arrays of trapped Rydberg atoms has brought the problem of commensurate-incommensurate transition back into the focus of active research. Relying on equilibrium simulations of finite intervals, direct chiral transitions at the boundary of the period-3 and period-4 phases have been predicted. Here, we study how these chiral transitions can be diagnosed experimentally with critical dynamics. We demonstrate that chiral transitions can be distinguished from the floating phases by comparing Kibble-Zurek dynamics on arrays with different numbers of atoms. Furthermore, by sweeping in the opposite direction and keeping track of the order parameter, we identify the location of conformal points. Finally, combining forward and backward sweeps, we extract all critical exponents characterizing the transition.</description>

      <title>Charge-order melting in the one-dimensional Edwards model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use infinite matrix-product-state techniques to study the time evolution of the charge-density-wave (CDW) order after a quench or a light pulse in a fundamental fermion-boson model. The motion of fermions in the model is linked to the creation of bosonic excitations, which counteracts the melting of the CDW order. For low-energy quenches corresponding to a change of the boson relaxation rate, we find behavior similar to that in an effective $t$-$V$ model. When the boson energy is quenched instead or a light pulse is applied to the system, the transient dynamics are more complex, with the CDW order first quickly decreasing to an intermediate value while the density-wave-like order of the bosons rises. In the case of pulse irradiation, the subsequent time-evolution of the CDW order depends strongly on the photon frequency. For frequencies slightly below the boson energy, we observe a temporary increase of the CDW order parameter. Our results reveal the complex physics of driven Mott insulators in low-dimensional systems with strong correlations.</description>

      <title>Particle-hole asymmetric phases in doped twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite much theoretical work, developing a comprehensive ab initio model for twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has proven challenging due to the inherent trade-off between accurately describing the band structure and incorporating the interactions within the Hamiltonian, particularly given the topological obstruction -- so-called fragile topology -- to the description of the model in terms of localized symmetric Wannier functions within the flat band manifold. Here, we circumvent this obstruction by using an extended 8-orbital model, for which localized Wannier orbitals have been formulated by Carr et al. [1]. We constructed an extended multi-orbital Hubbard model, and performed Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations to explore its phase diagram across commensurate fillings from -3 to 3. We found several nearly-degenerate insulating states at charge neutrality, all of which exhibit orbital orders. Crucially, TBG near magic angle is known to be particle-hole asymmetric, which is naturally captured by the single-particle band structure of our model and is reflected in the distinction between the symmetry broken states obtained at electron and hole dopings away from the charge neutral point. At filling -1 and +2, quantum anomalous hall states are obtained, while for the rest of the integer fillings away from charge neutrality, we found the system to realize metallic states with various orbital, valley and spin orderings. We also observed that most of the Hartree--Fock ground states exhibit a generalized valley Hund's-like rule, resulting in valley polarization. Importantly, we show that the incorporation of the intra-valley and inter-valley exchange interactions is crucial to properly stabilize the ordered symmetry-broken states. In agreement with experiments, we find significant particle-hole asymmetry, which underscores the importance of using particle-hole asymmetric models.</description>

      <title>Dynamical decoding of the competition between charge density waves in a kagome superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ hosts a variety of charge density wave (CDW) phases, which play a fundamental role in the formation of other exotic electronic instabilities. However, identifying the precise structure of these CDW phases and their intricate relationships remain the subject of intense debate, due to the lack of static probes that can distinguish the CDW phases with identical spatial periodicity. Here, we unveil the competition between two coexisting $2\times2\times2$ CDWs in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ harnessing time-resolved X-ray diffraction. By analyzing the light-induced changes in the intensity of CDW superlattice peaks, we demonstrate the presence of both phases, each displaying a significantly different amount of melting upon excitation. The anomalous light-induced sharpening of peak width further shows that the phase that is more resistant to photo-excitation exhibits an increase in domain size at the expense of the other, thereby showcasing a hallmark of phase competition. Our results not only shed light on the interplay between the multiple CDW phases in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, but also establish a non-equilibrium framework for comprehending complex phase relationships that are challenging to disentangle using static techniques.</description>

      <title>Site Symmetry and Multiorbital Flat Bands on Kagome and Pyrochlore Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands in electronic band structures are intriguing platforms for strong correlation and topological physics, primarily due to the suppressed kinetic energy of electrons. Various methods have been developed to create flat bands, utilizing lattice geometry or finely tuned parameters. Despite this, the investigation of orbital symmetry in multiorbital materials is a relatively new area of focus. In this work, we propose a site symmetry based systematic approach to emerging multiorbital flat bands in lattices made of corner-connecting motifs such as the kagome and pyrochlore lattices. As a conceptual advance, the one-orbital flat bands are shown to originate as mutual eigenstates of isolated molecular motifs. Further developing the mutual eigenstate method for multiorbitals transforming differently under the site symmetries such as mirror and inversion, we derive multiorbital flat bands from the skew-symmetric interorbital Hamiltonian and introduce an isolated molecule enabled group-theoretic description of the flat band wavefunctions. Realizations of the multiorbital flatbands in relevant materials are shown to be possible under the Slater-Koster formalism. Our findings provide new directions for exploring flatband electronic structures for novel correlated and topological quantum states.</description>

      <title>Anomalous continuum scattering and higher-order van Hove singularity in the strongly anisotropic S = 1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The S = 1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) stands out as a paradigmatic example of frustrated quantum magnetism. An ongoing challenge involves understanding the influence of exchange anisotropy on the collective behavior within such systems. Using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and advanced calculation techniques, we have studied the low and high temperature spin dynamics of Ba2La2CoTe2O12 (BLCTO): a Co2+-based Jeff = 1/2 TLAF that exhibits 120 deg order below TN = 3.26 K. The spin Hamiltonian was determined by fitting the energy-resolved paramagnetic excitations measured at T &gt; TN, revealing an exceptionally strong easy-plane XXZ exchange anisotropy. Below TN, the excitation spectrum exhibits a high energy continuum having a larger spectral weight than the single-magnon modes. Combined with advanced theoretical calculations of magnetic excitations based on magnons and spinons, this observation suggests a scenario characterized by a spinon confinement length that markedly exceeds the lattice spacing. We conjecture that this phenomenon arises due to the proximity to a quantum melting point, which persists even in the presence of strong easy-plane XXZ anisotropy. Finally, we highlight characteristic flat features in the excitation spectrum, which are connected to higher-order van Hove singularities in the magnon dispersion and are directly induced by easy-plane XXZ anisotropy. Our results provide a rare experimental insight into the nature of highly anisotropic S = 1/2 TLAFs between the Heisenberg and XY limits.</description>

      <title>Out of Time Order Correlation of the Hubbard Model with Random Local Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The out of time order correlator (OTOC) serves as a powerful tool for investigating quantum information spreading and chaos in complex systems. We present a method employing non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and coherent potential approximation (CPA) combined with diagrammatic perturbation on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour to calculate the OTOC for correlated fermionic systems subjected to both random disorder and electrons interaction. Our key finding is that random disorder enhances the OTOC decay in the Hubbard model for the metallic phase in the weak coupling limit. However, the current limitation of our perturbative solver restricts the applicability to weak interaction regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing both dynamic and static correlation accurately is a primary goal in electronic structure theory. Non-orthogonal configuration interaction (NOCI) is a versatile tool for treating static correlation, offering chemical insights by combining diverse reference states. Nevertheless, achieving quantitative accuracy requires the inclusion of missing dynamic correlation. This work introduces a framework for compressing orthogonal single and double excitations into an NOCI of a much smaller dimension. This compression is repeated with each Slater determinant in a reference NOCI, resulting in another NOCI that includes all its single and double excitations (NOCISD), effectively recovering the missing dynamic correlations from the reference. This compressed NOCISD is further refined through a selection process using metric and energy tests (SNOCISD). We validate the effectiveness of SNOCISD through its application to the dissociation of the nitrogen molecule and the hole-doped two-dimensional Hubbard model at various interaction strengths.</description>

      <title>Charge and spin fluctuations in superconductors with intersublattice and interorbital interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiband superconductors have featured one of the main challenges to achieve a comprehensive understanding of unconventional superconductivity. Here, the multiband character is studied separately as orbital and sublattice degrees of freedom, as they have different effects for the superconducting and magnetic or charge orders. We build on the framework of the matrix random-phase approximation (RPA), which accounts for the RPA Feynman diagrams and also vertex corrections, to treat the electron-electron interactions in an off-site degenerate Hubbard model. As a result, systems without a sublattice degree of freedom tend to be dominated by spin fluctuations, while systems with multiple sublattice sites and orbitals have the charge fluctuations favored. Finally, we explicitly demonstrate that the known suppression of the superconducting pairing strength $\lambda$ by spin fluctuations from repulsive interactions at zero momentum transfer $\boldsymbol{q}$ is countered by the finite-$\boldsymbol{q}$ pairing, which always improves $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Quantum critical fluctuations generate intensely magnetic field-resilient superconductivity in UTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum critical phase boundaries (QCPBs) -- where a continuous phase transition occurs at zero temperature -- have been found to nucleate novel electronic states in a number of strongly correlated materials. Emergent electronic phases, such as unconventional superconductivity, frequently occur in close proximity to a QCPB. However, the antagonism between magnetic field and superconductivity generally suppresses such superconductive phases to modest magnetic field ranges, except in notable cases such as the high-$T_\text{c}$ cuprates. Here we show that the heavy fermion Kondo-lattice system UTe$_2$ possesses a QCPB at remarkably high magnetic fields $\sim$ 50 T, underpinning an extremely high field superconducting state that persists to fields $&gt; \sim$ 70 T despite its relatively modest transition temperature of $T_\text{c} \approx$ 2 K. Whereas previous studies found this superconducting state to exist exclusively inside a field-polarised paramagnetic host-phase accessed following a first-order metamagnetic transition, for magnetic field tilt angles in the rotation plane connecting the reciprocal (010) and (101) vectors, we find an extended region of this superconductivity outside the field-polarised state. In this special rotation plane we also observe a pronounced suppression of the metamagnetic transition towards zero temperature, revealing that the metamagnetic transition surface ends at a QCPB. The superconducting $T_\text{c}$ exhibits a strong angular dependence and is enhanced close to the QCPB, where the onset of superconductivity is stretched over a surprisingly large magnetic field range reaching as low as 30 T. We model our data by a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory, and show how an extended quantum critical line -- rather than a more conventional QCPB at a singular point -- anchors the remarkable high magnetic field phase landscape of UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Topological protection revealed by real-time longitudinal and transverse studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology provides an essential concept for achieving unchanged (or protected) quantum properties in the presence of perturbations. A challenge facing realistic applications is that the level of protection displayed in real systems is subject to substantial variations. Some key differences stem from mechanisms influencing the reconstruction behaviors of extended dissipationless modes. Despite various insightful results on potential causes of backscattering, the edge-state-based approach is limited because the bulk states, as shown by breakdown tests, contribute indispensably. This study investigates the influence of bulk reconstruction where dissipationless modes are global objects instead of being restricted to the sample edge. An integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) hosted in a Corbino sample geometry is adopted and brought continuously to the verge of a breakdown. A detection technique is developed to include two independent setups capable of simultaneously capturing the onset of dissipation in both longitudinal and transverse directions. The real-time correspondence between orthogonal results confirms two facts. 1. Dissipationless charge modes undergo frequent reconstruction in response to electrochemical potential changes, causing dissipationless current paths to expand transversely into the bulk while preserving chirality. A breakdown only occurs when a backscattering emerges between reconfigured dissipationless current paths bridging opposite edge contacts. 2. Impurity screening is vital in enhancing protection, and topological protection is subject to an intriguing interplay of disorder, electron-electron interaction, and topology. The proposed reconstruction mechanism qualitatively explains the robustness variations, beneficial for developing means for optimization.</description>

Abstract: The advent of logical quantum processors marks the beginning of the early stages of error-corrected quantum computation. As a bridge between the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era and the fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) era, these devices and their successors have the potential to revolutionize the solution of classically challenging problems. An important application of quantum computers is to calculate observables of quantum systems. This problem is crucial for solving quantum many-body and optimization problems. However, due to limited error correction capabilities, this new era are still susceptible to noise, thereby necessitating new quantum algorithms with polynomial complexity as well as noisy-resilency. This paper proposes a new noise-resilient and ansatz-free algorithm, called Quantum Zeno Monte Carlo. It utilizes the quantum Zeno effect and Monte Carlo integration for multi-step adiabatic transitions to the target eigenstates. It can efficiently find static as well as dynamic physical properties such as ground state energy, excited state energies, and Green's function without the use of variational parameters. This algorithm offers a polynomial computational cost and quantum circuit depth that is significantly lower than the quantum phase estimation.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Fixed-Point Structure of Asymptotically Safe QED with a Pauli Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test the physical viability of a recent proposal for an asymptotically safe modification of quantum electrodynamics (QED), whose ultraviolet physics is dominated by a non-perturbative Pauli spin-field coupling. We focus in particular on its compatibility with the absence of dynamical generation of fermion mass in QED. Studying the renormalization group flow of chiral four-fermion operators and their fixed points, we discover a distinct class of behavior compared to the standard picture of fixed-point annihilation at large gauge couplings and the ensuing formation of chiral condensates. Instead, transcritical bifurcations, where the fixed points merely exchange infrared stability, are observed. Provided that non-chiral operators remain irrelevant, our theory accommodates a universality class of light fermions for $N_{\text{f}} &gt; 1$ irreducible Dirac flavors. On the contrary, in the special case of $N_{\text{f}} = 1$ flavor, this comes only at the expense of introducing one additional relevant parameter.</description>

      <title>Magnetothermopower of nodal line semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for materials with large thermopower is of great practical interest. Dirac and Weyl semimetals have recently proven to exhibit superior thermoelectric properties, particularly when subjected to a quantizing magnetic field. Here we consider whether a similar enhancement arises in nodal line semimetals, for which the conduction and valence band meet at a line or ring in momentum space. We compute the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients for arbitrary temperature and magnetic field and we find a wealth of different scaling regimes. Most strikingly, when a sufficiently strong magnetic field is applied along the direction of the nodal line, the large degeneracy of states leads to a large, linear-in-$B$ thermopower that is temperature-independent even at low temperatures. Our results suggest that nodal line semimetals may offer significant opportunity for efficient, low-temperature thermoelectrics.</description>

      <title>Quantum 2D Liouville Path-Integral Is a Sum over Geometries in AdS$_3$ Einstein Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a renowned solution of the modular bootstrap that defines the UV complete quantum Liouville theory. We triangulate the path-integral of this Liouville CFT on any 2D surface $\mathcal{M}$, by proposing a shrinkable boundary condition for this special CFT that allows small holes to close, analogous to the proposal in rational CFTs [1-3]. This is essentially a tensor network that admits an interpretation of a state-sum of a 3D topological theory constructed with quantum 6j symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, and it reduces to a sum over 3D geometries weighted by the Einstein-Hilbert action to leading order in large $c$. The boundary conditions of quantum Liouville theory specifies a very special sum over bulk geometries to faithfully reproduce the CFT path-integral. The triangulation coincides with producing a network of geodesics in the AdS bulk, which can be changed making use of the pentagon identity and orthogonality condition satisfied by the 6j symbols, and arranged into a precise holographic tensor network.</description>

      <title>On the computation of lattice sums without translational invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a framework for the efficient computation of oscillatory multidimensional lattice sums in geometries with boundaries, a problem intersecting pure and applied mathematics with immediate applications in condensed matter physics and topological quantum physics. The challenge in evaluating the arising sums results from the combination of singular long-range interactions with the loss of translational invariance caused by the boundaries, rendering standard tools ineffective. Our work shows that these lattice sums can be generated from a generalization of the Riemann zeta function to multidimensional non-periodic lattice sums. We put forth a new representation of this zeta function together with a numerical algorithm that ensures super-exponential convergence across an extensive range of geometries. Notably, our method's runtime is influenced only by the complexity of the considered geometries and not by the sheer number of particles, providing the foundation for efficient simulations of macroscopic condensed matter systems. We showcase the practical utility of our method by computing interaction energies in a three-dimensional crystal structure with $3\times 10^{23}$ particles. Our method's accuracy is thoroughly assessed through a detailed error analysis that both uses analytical results and numerical experiments. A reference implementation is provided online along with the article</description>

      <title>Doped Mott phase and charge correlations in monolayer 1T-NbSe$_2$</title>

Abstract: The doped Hubbard model is one of the paradigmatic platforms to engineer exotic quantum many-body states, including charge-ordered states, strange metals and unconventional superconductors. While undoped and doped correlated phases have been experimentally realized in a variety twisted van der Waals materials, experiments in monolayer materials, and in particular 1T transition metal dichalcogenides, have solely reached the conventional insulating undoped regime. Correlated phases in monolayer two-dimensional materials have much higher associated energy scales than their twisted counterparts, making doped correlated monolayers an attractive platform for high temperature correlated quantum matter. Here, we demonstrate the realization of a doped Mott phase in a van der Waals dichalcogenide 1T-NbSe$_2$ monolayer. The system is electron doped due to electron transfer to a monolayer van der Waals substrate via proximity, leading to a correlated triangular lattice with both half-filled and fully-filled sites. We analyze the distribution of the half-filled and filled sites and show the arrangement is unlikely to be controlled by disorder alone, and we show that the presence of competing non-local many-body correlations would account for the charge correlations found experimentally. Our results establish 1T-NbSe$_2$ as a potential monolayer platform to explore correlated doped Mott physics in a frustrated lattice.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a topological chiral spin liquid in the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland Heisenberg model with an additional spin chirality interaction, using numerically unbiased exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods. We establish a quantum phase diagram where conventional phases, including dimer singlet, plaquette singlet, N{\' e}el and collinear phase, can be clearly identified by suitable local order parameters. Among them a $SU(2)_1$ chiral spin liquid emerges in the highly frustrated region, which is unambiguously identified by two topologically degenerate ground states, modular matrix, and characteristic level counting in entanglement spectrum, featuring the same topological order of $\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin state. The phase boundaries among the different orders are determined by the energy level crossing analysis and wave function fidelity susceptibility.</description>

Abstract: Ca$_2$FeMnO$_6$ (CFMO) double perovskite was studied using first principles density functional theory and tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonian modeling using extended Hubbard model. We have shown by electronic structure analysis that charge- and magnetic-ordering are driven by charge disproportionation at low temperature caused by partial localization of O-$2p$ ligand holes at alternate Fe sites that creates Jahn-Teller distortion, which leads to metal to insulator transition (MIT) in CFMO. Our results suggests MIT was triggered by negative charge-transfer energy of self-hole doping, responsible for symmetry lowering transitions. Notably, the band-gap was found to fundamentally controlled by the strength of the charge-transfer energy, and not by the Mott-Hubbard interactions, which can be modeled by composition, pressure or stoichiometry modulations. The fundamental insights presented in this work will help understand similar physics and mechanisms in other class of perovskites and correlated metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shortcuts to adiabaticity provide fast protocols for quantum state preparation in which the use of auxiliary counterdiabatic controls circumvents the requirement of slow driving in adiabatic strategies. While their development is well established in simple systems, their engineering and implementation are challenging in many-body quantum systems with many degrees of freedom. We show that the equation for the counterdiabatic term, equivalently the adiabatic gauge potential, is solved by introducing a Krylov basis. The Krylov basis spans the minimal operator subspace in which the dynamics unfolds and provides an efficient way to construct the counterdiabatic term. We apply our strategy to paradigmatic single- and many-particle models. The properties of the counterdiabatic term are reflected in the Lanczos coefficients obtained in the course of the construction of the Krylov basis by an algorithmic method. We examine how the expansion in the Krylov basis incorporates many-body interactions in the counterdiabatic term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How much information a fermionic state contains? To address this fundamental question, we define the complexity of a particle-conserving many-fermion state as the entropy of its Fock space probability distribution, minimized over all Fock representations. The complexity characterizes the minimum computational and physical resources required to represent the state and store the information obtained from it by measurements. Alternatively, the complexity can be regarded a Fock space entanglement measure describing the intrinsic many-particle entanglement in the state. We establish universal lower bound for the complexity in terms of the single-particle correlation matrix eigenvalues and formulate a finite-size complexity scaling hypothesis. Remarkably, numerical studies on interacting lattice models suggest a general model-independent complexity hierarchy: ground states are exponentially less complex than average excited states which, in turn, are exponentially less complex than generic states in the Fock space. Our work has fundamental implications on how much information is encoded in fermionic states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constrain a broad class of teleportation protocols using insights from locality. In the "standard" teleportation protocols we consider, all outcome-dependent unitaries are Pauli operators conditioned on linear functions of the measurement outcomes. We find that all such protocols involve preparing a "resource state" exhibiting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order with Abelian protecting symmetry $\mathcal{G}_{k}= (\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)^k$. The $k$ logical states are teleported between the edges of the chain by measuring the corresponding $2k$ string order parameters in the bulk and applying outcome-dependent Paulis. Hence, this single class of nontrivial SPT states is both necessary and sufficient for the standard teleportation of $k$ qubits. We illustrate this result with several examples, including the cluster state, variants thereof, and a nonstabilizer hypergraph state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly interacting non-equilibrium systems are of great fundamental interest, yet their inherent complexity make then notoriously hard to analyze. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model, which by itself evades solvability, can be solved exactly at any interaction strength in the presence of loss tuned to a rate matching the hopping amplitude. Remarkably, the full solvability of the corresponding Liouvillian, and the integrability of the pertinent effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, survives the addition of disorder and generic boundary conditions. By analyzing the Bethe ansatz solutions we find that even weak interactions change the qualitative features of the system, leading to an intricate dynamical phase diagram featuring non-Hermitian Mott-skin effects, disorder induced localization, highly degenerate exceptional points, and a Bose glass-like phase of fragmented condensates. We discuss realistic implementations of this model with cold atoms.</description>
