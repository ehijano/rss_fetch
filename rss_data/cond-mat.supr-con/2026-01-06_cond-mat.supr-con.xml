      <title>AI-Guided Computational Design of a Room-Temperature, Ambient- Pressure Superconductor Candidate: Grokene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Grokene, a novel two-dimensional superlattice derived from graphene, which was identified through an AI-guided materials discovery workflow utilizing a large language model. Grokene is predicted to exhibit ambient-pressure, room-temperature superconductivity, with computational simulations revealing a high electron-phonon coupling constant and a substantial logarithmic-averaged phonon frequency (~1650 K), leading to a mean-field critical temperature of approximately 325 K. Full isotropic Eliashberg solutions further support a critical temperature around 310 K, underscoring its strong potential for room-temperature superconductivity. However, the strict two-dimensional nature of Grokene introduces phase fluctuations, limiting the observable superconducting transition to a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature of about 120 K in monolayers. To elevate TBKT toward room temperature, strategies such as few-layer stacking, substrate or gate engineering, and optimization of superlattice structure and doping levels are proposed. Our integrated workflow, combining AI-driven materials discovery with advanced many-body theories (DFPT/EPW, Eliashberg, and RPA), provides a systematic and reproducible framework for exploring novel superconductors. We suggest that experimental synthesis and comprehensive characterization of Grokene will be essential to assess these computational predictions and to explore routes toward practical superconductivity under ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Strain-triggered high-temperature superconducting transition in two-dimensional carbon allotrope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driving non-superconducting materials into a superconducting state through specific modulation is a key focus in the field of superconductivity. Pressure is a powerful method that can switch a three-dimensional (3D) material between non-superconducting and superconducting states. In the two-dimensional (2D) case, strain engineering plays a similar role to pressure. However, purely strain-induced superconductivity in 2D systems remains exceedingly scarce. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that a superconducting transition can be induced solely by applying biaxial tensile strain in a 2D carbon allotrope, THO-graphene, which is composed of triangles, hexagons, and octagons. Free-standing THO-graphene is non-superconducting. Surprisingly, the electron-phonon coupling in strained THO-graphene is enhanced strong enough to pair electrons and realize superconductivity, with the highest superconducting transition temperature reaching 45 K. This work not only provides a notable example of controlling metal-superconductor transition in 2D system just via strain, but also sets a new record of superconducting transition temperature for 2D elemental superconductors.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Thermodynamic, Elastic, and Optical properties of LaRh2X2 (X = Al, Ga, In) low Tc Superconductors through First-Principles Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LaRh2X2 (X = Al, Ga, In) compounds crystallize in a tetragonal layered ThCr2Si2-type structure and belong to a family of low critical temperature superconductors. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations implemented in the CASTEP code, we systematically investigated their structural, mechanical, elastic, electronic, vibrational, thermophysical, and optical properties for the first time. The optimized structural parameters show good agreement with available experimental data. The Born stability criteria and negative formation energies confirm the mechanical and thermodynamic stability of these materials. Poisson and Pugh ratios indicate a ductile nature, while low Debye and melting temperatures together with low Vickers hardness suggest that the compounds are relatively soft. The electronic band structures and density of states reveal metallic behavior. Charge density distribution and Mulliken population analysis indicate mixed covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding. The calculated Fermi surfaces contain both hole-like and electron-like sheets, suggesting possible multiband characteristics. Phonon dispersion analysis confirms the dynamical stability of LaRh2Al2 and LaRh2Ga2, while LaRh2In2 shows dynamical instability associated with a possible structural phase transition. Optical property analysis indicates that these superconductors may be promising candidates for high-density optical data storage applications. The estimated electron-phonon coupling constant of about 0.56 indicates that LaRh2X2 compounds are weakly coupled low critical temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Tripling of the Superconducting Critical Current Density in BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ Retained After Pressure Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting performance is tunable not only via chemical modification or defect engineering, but also through external parameters such as pressure, though this method remains less readily accessible. In this work, we study how compression influences vortex dynamics and critical currents in an iron-based superconductor. Specifically, we perform magnetization measurements using an off-the-shelf pressure cell to investigate the effects of hydrostatic pressures up to 1.08 GPa on the magnetic properties of BaFe$_2$(As$_{0.62}$P$_{0.38}$)$_2$ crystals across a range of temperatures $T$ and magnetic fields $H$. Although these pressures minimally affect the superconducting critical temperature, they produce a clear increase in the critical current density $J_c(T,H)$, a pronounced reduction in the rate of thermally activated vortex motion $S(T,H)$, and can change the dominant vortex pinning mechanism. Furthermore, the effects of pressure are irreversible: after pressurization and subsequent release at room temperature, the crystals retain their enhanced critical current densities. The second magnetization peak vanishes at 22 K after the pressure cycle, which we attribute to a transition from predominantly $\delta \kappa$ pinning to a mixed mechanism of $\delta T_c$ and surface pinning. Lastly, a threefold increase in $J_c$ and more than 40\% reduction in $S$ at 8~K and 0.5~T was achieved after $1-2$ pressure cycles. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of pressure cycling for improving $J_c$, which may offer a simpler alternative to approaches such as chemical doping or the introduction of artificial pinning centers.</description>

      <title>Isotropic Superconductivity in Room-temperature Superconductor LaSc$_{2}$H$_{24}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of LaSc$_{2}$H$_{24}$ represents a milestone in the quest for room-temperature superconductivity, yet the microscopic mechanism underlying its superior performance remains unclear. Through a comprehensive revisit of theoretical calculations, we uncover a pivotal transition from the anisotropic two-gap superconductivity of LaH$_{10}$ to the isotropic single-gap superconductivity in LaSc$_{2}$H$_{24}$ upon the introduction of scandium, thereby enhancing the superconducting critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$). This enhancement is rooted in a critical dual role of Sc $3d$ electrons: i) the Sc-derived Jahn-Teller effect promotes hydrogen metallization via the elongation of specific interlayer H-H bonds and enhances electron-phonon coupling (EPC) through the softening of associated phonon modes; ii) Sc $3d$ electrons reconstruct the electronic structure into an MgB$_{2}$-like configuration, generating novel Sc-H-Sc $\sigma$- and $\pi$-bonding states with EPC strengths comparable to LaH$_{10}$. Crucially, the pronounced hybridization between Sc and the hydrogen cages effectively unifies these two contributions on the Fermi surface. This Sc-induced gap unification bridges the high-EPC H-H states with widespread Sc-H states, establishing an isotropic single-gap nature with a large overall EPC strength. Our findings identify this Sc-induced gap unification as the fundamental mechanism for achieving room-temperature superconductivity in LaSc$_{2}$H$_{24}$, offering a theoretical blueprint for the future design of superior superconducting hydrides.</description>

      <title>Common sublattice-pure van Hove singularities in the kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome materials offer a versatile platform for exploring correlated and topological quantum states, where van Hove singularities (VHSs) play a pivotal role in driving electronic instabilities, exhibiting distinct behaviors depending on electron filling and interaction settings. In the recently discovered kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs), unconventional charge density wave order, superconductivity, and electronic chirality emerge, yet the nature of VHSs near the Fermi level ($\textit{E}$$_{F}$) and their connection to these exotic orders remain elusive. Here, using high-resolution polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we uncover a universal electronic structure across $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ that is distinct from density-functional theory predictions that show noticeable discrepancies. We identify multiple common sublattice-pure VHSs near $\textit{E}$$_{F}$, arising from strong V-$\textit{d}$/Sb-$\textit{p}$ hybridization, which significantly promote bond-order fluctuations and likely drive the observed charge density wave order. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for hybridization-driven VHS formation in kagome metals and establish a unified framework for understanding the intertwined electronic instabilities in $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$.</description>

      <title>Fast and Slow Sound Excitations in Nematic Aerogel in superfluid 3He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nematic aerogel (nAG) supports so-called polar phase in liquid 3He. The experiments by [Dmitriev et al, JETP Lett. 112, 780 (2020)] showed that the onset of polar phase inside the nAG is accompanied by emergence of a sound wave with frequency quickly growing with cooling down from transition temperature and reaching a plateau. To describe this behavior, we start by calculating the elastic properties of the dry nematic AG that appear to depend only on Young's modulus of the parent material (e.g. mullite), the volume fraction of the solid phase and the aspect ratio of the representative volume of nAG. The elastic constants are then used to solve elasto-hydrodynamic equations for various sound vibrations of nAG filled with 3He. The (isotropic) first sound and anisotropic second sound in the polar phase are strongly hybridized with fourth sound and standard elastic modes in nAG. The hybrid second and the transverse fourth sound start with zero velocity at the transition, similar to pure 3He, and quickly grow with lowering temperature until they hit the sample finite size cutoff.</description>

      <title>Orbital Separation of Charge Order and Superconductivity in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a combined x-ray absorption (XAS) and oxygen $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of charge order in underdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ ($x=0.125$) under uniaxial $c$-axis pressure. We find that compressive $c$-axis strain modifies the charge order only within the superconducting state, with a striking polarization dependence: suppression in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ channel and enhancement in the $d_{z^2}$ channel. X-ray absorption spectra reveal concomitant strain-induced modifications of the oxygen pre-edge and upper Hubbard band, consistent with increased $d_{z^2}$ orbital admixture. Our results suggest that $c$-axis pressure drives an orbital separation between superconductivity, rooted in $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states, and charge order, which gradually shifts to the $d_{z^2}$ channel. This orbital separation reveals a way for superconductivity and charge order to coexist in the cuprates with minimal competition. Furthermore, it suggests that the multi-order phase diagram of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ cannot be realistically described within single band models usually used to describe cuprate physics.</description>

      <title>Fermi-surface-sheet dependent electron-phonon coupling in a borocarbide superconductor YNi$_2$B$_2$C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation measurements and band-structure calculations for YNi$_2$B$_2$C. Our improved band structure successfully explained the origins of the large dHvA frequencies $\beta$ and $\zeta$, which were inexplicable in previous works. By comparing experimental effective masses with band masses, we determined the electron-phonon coupling for each orbit. The results showed a clear Fermi-surface-sheet dependence of the electron-phonon coupling strength, especially highlighting that the coupling for the band-28 sheet is very weak, almost absent for the orbit with $B \parallel c$. This finding is consistent with previous observations of dHvA oscillations from this orbit in the mixed state down to very low fields. Amidst growing interest in high-temperature superconductivity driven by electron-phonon coupling in hydrides under high pressure, this study provides foundational data pivotal to precisely understanding electron-phonon coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal trichalcogenides distinguish themselves from other two-dimensional materials in nanoscience and materials science due to their remarkable range of intrinsic properties, including various electronic, optical, and magnetic behaviors. Here, we report a comprehensive study of superconductivity in disordered ZrTe$_{3-x}$ ($x$ = 0.2) with suppressed charge density wave. We observe a type-II bulk anisotropic superconductivity with a superconducting transition at $T_c$ = 3.59(4) \si{K}. Angle-dependent upper critical field measurements and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition confirm the inherent quasi-two-dimensional nature of superconductivity in this disordered system.</description>

      <title>Superconducting diode effect in fractal superconductors: fractional-order Ginzburg-Landau theory for Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a fractional-order Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework for nonreciprocal superconducting transport in Josephson junctions formed by fractal superconductors or superconducting media with nonlocal correlations, separated by a noncentrosymmetric normal layer. We show that nonreciprocity and the superconducting diode effect arise from the interplay between the Lifshitz invariant and fractional kinetics, with the latter serving as an effective, symmetry-consistent representation of fractal geometry and finite-range memory. Two complementary approaches are pursued. In a fractional integral GL formulation, spatial integration on a fractal space yields analytic solutions and reveals how rectification scales with the dimensionality of the fractal media and the strength of the Lifshitz-like drift. In a fractional derivative-based formulation derived via the Agrawal variational principle with left/right Caputo operators, we obtain a gauge-invariant free energy, the corresponding GL equations, and a current density. We use fractional orders as effective parameters that represent nonlocal and memory effects induced by fractal microstructure. Within a two-mode plane-wave approximation we derive a compact current-phase relation and an expression for the diode efficiency, and we map the rectification amplitude across the fractional kinetic and the Lifshitz/memory order. An exact single-sided solution in terms of Prabhakar functions further confirms robust, tunable nonreciprocity, including a near-ideal diode response. This identifies a pathway to near-perfect superconducting diodes by engineering fractal (fractional-kinetic) transport achieved by tuning the fractional orders and Lifshitz strength without invoking magnetic fields or geometric ratchets. In the integer limit of local kinetics and Lifshitz-like drift, both constructions reduce to the standard $\varphi_0$ Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Visualizing the low-energy electronic structure of the triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ through quasiparticle interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification, control and theoretical modelling of spin-triplet superconductors (STC) remain a central theme in quantum materials research. Intrinsic STC are rare but offer rich condensate properties and unique surface properties allowing insights into the nature of the spin-triplet order, and promising applications in quantum technologies. Owing to interactions, the order parameter in STCs can often be intertwined with other symmetry breaking orders like charge/spin density waves (CDW/SDW) or pair density waves (PDW) complicating their phase diagrams. UTe2 stands out as the only known odd-parity, STC that harbors such intertwined orders on the surface and possible topological surface states composed of Majorana fermions. While the (0-11) facet is the most heavily studied, the fermiology of this surface that gives rise to such exotic phenomena is still lacking and continues to be an area of active interest. Here, we employ low-temperature spectroscopic imaging to reveal the Fermi surface of UTe2 through quasiparticle interference. We find scattering originating from the uranium-derived bands that play a major role in the formation of the CDW and the PDW phases. Tunneling spectroscopy further reveals spectral signatures of the CDW gap, corroborating its onset temperature. Suppressing the CDW with a magnetic field, highlights the presence of small, circular Fermi pockets that disperse strongly near the Fermi energy. We discuss the nature of the interference patterns and the origin of the small Fermi pockets in the context of the calculated band structure and the unconventional CDW phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing magnetic fluctuations is one of the keys to understanding the origin of superconductivity in the spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ which exhibits two superconducting (SC) phases (SC1 and SC2) under pressure: SC1 where a superconducting transition temperature of $T_{\rm c}$ decreases with pressure while $T_{\rm c}$ of SC2 rises with pressure. Previously, D. Ambika et al. [Phys. Rev. B 105, L220403 (2022)] have reported the possible coexistence of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations in UTe$_2$ under pressure from their nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. To delve the relationship between the magnetic fluctuations and the two SC phases, we have carried out detailed $^{125}$Te NMR measurements on a single crystal of UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}$ = 1.6 K at various pressures ranging from 0 to 2.05 GPa. By comparing the temperature $T$ dependence of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates divided by temperature 1/$T_1T$ with that of the Knight shift $K$ for magnetic fields along the $a$, $b$, and $c$ directions, we evidence the enhancement of AFM spin fluctuations with increasing pressure. Based on the results, we suggest that FM spin fluctuations are more favorable for SC1 and AFM spin fluctuations are crucial for SC2. Our findings will inspire further study on this material to understand the peculiar SC phases in detail.</description>

      <title>Electronic Nematicity Revealed by Polarized Ultrafast Spectroscopy in Bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>

Abstract: We report a polarized ultrafast pump-probe study of the normal-state electronic dynamics in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals at ambient pressure. While both nickelates exhibit density-wave (DW) transitions accompanied by the opening of a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck, their electronic responses display strikingly different symmetry properties. La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ maintains an isotropic optical response across the entire temperature range. In contrast, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ exhibits a pronounced twofold ($C_2$) anisotropy in its low-temperature electronic dynamics. This electronic nematicity, evident in both the relaxation dynamics and the effective gap scales, competes with a secondary isotropic order emerging below 115 K. The presence of macroscopic electronic anisotropy in the bilayer system, and its absence in the trilayer system, suggests an intimate relation between electronic nematic fluctuations and superconducting pairing in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ that worth for deeper explorations.</description>

      <title>Multiple nodal superconducting phases and order-parameter evolution in pressurized UTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-triplet superconductivity (SC) offers a unique avenue for realizing non-Abelian Majorana zero modes and thus the fault-tolerant topological quantum computation, and has attracted a broad audience for both fundamental research and potential applications. The recently discovered heavy-fermion spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ has sparked great interest for its ultrahigh upper critical field and reentrant SC phases in the proximity to a field-polarized magnetic state. Despite extensive studies on the phase diagrams and competing orders induced by pressure and magnetic field, limited has been known about its SC order parameters and their evolution with these control parameters, largely due to the lack of appropriate symmetry-sensitive detections. Here, we report comprehensive point-contact spectroscopy measurements of pressurized UTe$_2$ on the (0~0~1) surface. The observation of Andreev bound state strongly suggests the presence of a $p_z$ component in the SC order parameters. Quantitative analysis based on an extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model unveils $B_{2u}$ or $B_{3u}$ as the most likely representation for both ambient and pressurized UTe$_2$, and remarkably, the multiple SC phases can be distinguished by a single parameter $\langle \Delta_{z}\rangle/\langle\Delta_{x(y)}\rangle$, the relative weight between the $p_z$-wave and $p_{x(y)}$-wave pairings. These findings not only impose stringent constraints on the superconducting order parameter in UTe$_2$, but also provide key spectroscopic evidence for the existence of multiple SC phases tuned through pressure.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in a three dimensional $U(1) \times U(1)$ lattice London superconductor: Metallic superfluid and charge-4e superconducting states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.3311</link>
      <description>arXiv:1006.3311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a three-dimensional lattice $U(1) \times U(1)$ and $[U(1)]^N$ superconductors in the London limit, with individually conserved condensates. The $U(1) \times U(1)$ problem, generically, has two types of intercomponent interactions of different characters. First, the condensates are interacting via a minimal coupling to the same fluctuating gauge field. A second type of coupling is the direct dissipationless drag represented by a local intercomponent current-current coupling term in the free energy functional. In this work, we present a study of the phase diagram of a $U(1) \times U(1)$ superconductor which includes both of these interactions. We study phase transitions and two types of competing paired phases which occur in this general model: (i) a metallic superfluid phase (where there is order only in the gauge invariant phase difference of the order parameters), (ii) a composite superconducting phase where there is order in the phase sum of the order parameters which has many properties of a single-component superconductor but with a doubled value of electric charge. We investigate the phase diagram with particular focus on what we call ``preemptive phase transitions.'' These are phase transitions unique to multicomponent condensates with competing topological objects. A sudden proliferation of one kind of topological defects may come about due to a fluctuating background of topological defects in other sectors of the theory. For $U(1) \times U(1)$ theory with unequal bare stiffnesses where components are coupled by a non-compact gauge field only, we study how this scenario leads to a merger of two $U(1)$ transitions into a single $U(1) \times U(1)$ discontinuous phase transition. We also report a general form of vortex-vortex bare interaction potential and possible phase transitions in an $N$-component London superconductor with individually conserved condensates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonsymmorphic symmetries can enforce band connectivity that obstructs a single-band Wannier description. We show that a fractional translation $\mathcal{L}$ connecting distinct high-symmetry Wyckoff positions generically renders the Wannier center of an individual band gauge ill-defined, requiring a symmetry-enforced multiband object -- a Wannier complex. We formulate a real-space topological classification of Wannier complexes and show that, when $\mathcal{L}$ is combined with certain point-group symmetries (notably $C_4$ and $C_3$), all symmetry-allowed Wannier-complex configurations carry a nontrivial quantized total electric polarization. This yields boundary phenomena that persist across symmetry-preserving deformations of the Hamiltonian, including parameter regimes with and without bulk gaps. We demonstrate the mechanism in minimal tight-binding models exhibiting M{\"o}bius-twisted Wilson-loop structures and higher-order corner modes, and propose experimental signatures in a dielectric photonic crystal and a first-principles electronic platform octa-graphene, accompanied by a three-dimensional extension.</description>

Abstract: The bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has recently emerged as a promising system for high-$T_c$ superconductivity. In this work, we investigate the fate of the superconducting properties in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under pressure, focusing on the effects of structural deformation and apical oxygen vacancies. Employing a low-energy effective $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model for the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals within the slave-boson mean-field approach, we demonstrate that the pairing strength is significantly enhanced in the high-pressure tetragonal $I4/mmm$ phase compared to the ambient pressure orthorhombic $Amam$ phase. Furthermore, by simulating random configurations of apical oxygen vacancies, we show that oxygen vacancies suppress both pairing strength and superfluid density. These results underscore the critical role of pressure and oxygen stoichiometry in tuning the SC of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing key insights into optimizing its high-$T_c$ behavior.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling study of the pairing mechanism in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the bilayer perovskite nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has been reported to exhibit high-temperature superconductivity near $80$ K under a moderate pressure of about $14$GPa. To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</description>

      <title>Higher critical currents yet faster vortex creep in EuBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films containing coherent artificial pinning centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electromagnetic properties of type-II superconductors depend on vortices -- magnetic flux lines whose motion introduces dissipation that can be mitigated by pinning from material defects. The material disorder landscape is tuned by the choice of materials growth technique and incorporation of impurities that serve as vortex pinning centers. For example, metal organic deposition (MOD) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) produce high-quality superconducting films with uncorrelated versus correlated disorder, respectively. Here, we study vortex dynamics in PLD-grown EuBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films containing varying concentrations of BaHfO$_3$ inclusions and compare our results with those of MOD-grown (Y,Gd)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films. Despite both systems exhibiting behavior consistent with strong pinning theory, which predicts the critical current density $J_c$ based on vortex trapping by randomly distributed spherical inclusions, we find striking differences in the vortex dynamics owing to the correlated versus uncorrelated disorder. Specifically, we find that the EuBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films grown without inclusions exhibit surprisingly slow vortex creep, comparable to the slowest creep rates achieved in (Y,Gd)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films containing high concentrations of BaHfO$_3$. Whereas adding inclusions to (Y,Gd)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ is effective in slowing creep, BaHfO$_3$ increases creep in EuBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ even while concomitantly improving $J_c$. Lastly, we find evidence of variable range hopping and that $J_c$ is maximized at the BaHfO$_3$ concentration that hosts creep of large vortex bundles or a Bose glass state.</description>

      <title>Electronic structures and superconductivity in Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has motivated extensive efforts to explore higher $T_c$ superconductors. Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% ($\sim$ 2/3) Nd doping level and then falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap. Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital, demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through the bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors undergo a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition driven by vortex-antivortex unbinding, yet experimental signatures beyond transport remain limited. Here, we show that the spin-lattice relaxation rate provides a direct probe of this transition. In a 2-dimensional $s$-wave superconductor, $1/T_1T$ develops a Hebel-Slichter-like peak around $T_{\rm{BKT}}$, originating from the emergence of coherence peaks in the density of states, while no peak appears at the pair formation scale $T_{\rm{BCS}}$. We further extend our analysis to the $d$-wave superconductor. Our results highlight spin-lattice relaxation rate as a sensitive tool to detect the superconducting BKT transition and open routes to exploring its manifestation in unconventional pairing states.</description>

      <title>Insights Into Radiation Damage in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ From Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of radiation damage in YBa$_2$Cu$3$O${7-\delta}$ (YBCO) is essential for assessing the performance of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes in compact fusion reactors. Existing empirical interatomic potentials have been used to model radiation damage in stoichiometric YBCO, but fail to describe oxygen-deficient compositions, which are ubiquitous in industrial Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide conductors and strongly influence superconducting properties. In this work, we demonstrate that modern machine-learned interatomic potentials enable predictive modelling of radiation damage in YBCO across a wide range of oxygen stoichiometries, with higher fidelity than previous empirical models. We employ two recently developed approaches: an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential and a tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP). Both models accurately reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies, forces, and threshold displacement energy distributions, providing a reliable description of atomic-scale collision processes. Molecular dynamics simulations of 5 keV cascades predict enhanced peak defect production and recombination relative to a widely used empirical potential, indicating different cascade evolution. By explicitly varying oxygen deficiency, we show that total defect production depends only weakly on stoichiometry, offering insight into the robustness of radiation damage processes in oxygen-deficient YBCO. Finally, fusion-relevant 300 keV cascade simulations reveal amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length, consistent with electron microscopy observations of neutron-irradiated HTS tapes. These results establish machine-learned interatomic potentials as efficient and predictive tools for investigating radiation damage in YBCO across relevant compositions and irradiation conditions.</description>

      <title>Projected branes as platforms for crystalline, superconducting, and higher-order topological phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projected branes are constituted by only a small subset of sites of a higher-dimensional crystal, otherwise placed on a hyperplane oriented at an irrational or a rational slope therein, for which the effective Hamiltonian is constructed by systematically integrating out the sites of the parent lattice that fall outside such branes [Commun. Phys. 5, 230 (2022)]. Specifically, when such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension. In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$) symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects, besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order topological insulator with the characteristic corner-localized zero modes in its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline branes that feature a quantized localizer index and endpoint zero-energy modes only when one of its end points passes through a corner of the parent crystal. Possible designer quantum and meta material-based platforms to experimentally harness our theoretically proposed topological branes are discussed.</description>

      <title>Integrable Model of a Superconductor with non-Fermi liquid and Mott Phases</title>

Abstract: We present and analyze an exactly solvable interacting fermionic pairing model, which features interactions that entangle states at momenta $\mathbf{k}$ and $-\mathbf{k}$. These interactions give rise to novel correlated ground states, leading to a rich phase diagram that includes superconducting, multiple metallic, and Mott-insulating phases. At finite interaction strengths, we observe the emergence of multiple many-body Fermi surfaces, which violate Luttinger's theorem and challenge the conventional Landau-Fermi liquid paradigm. A distinguishing feature of our model is that it remains quantum integrable, even with the addition of pairing interactions of various symmetries, setting it apart from the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. Our results provide an analytically tractable framework for studying strong correlation effects that give rise to fractionalized excitations and unconventional superconductivity, offering valuable insights into a broad class of integrable many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Information supercurrents and spin waves in chiral active matter: Universality of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16884v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent minimalist modeling indicates that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this article, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative phase rigidity supercurrents, a mapping we confirm empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity. Generalizing this framework to three dimensions ($S^1\to S^2$), we show that polar alignment on the unit sphere is geometrically equivalent to the Gilbert damping term in spintronics, and that the two-dimensional Kuramoto coupling term naturally appears in the tangent-plane projection of spin relaxation. This constraint generates inertial spin waves (ferromagnetic magnons) from the overdamped active bath, recovering the macroscopic transport predicted by Toner-Tu theory without invoking microscopic inertia. Our results show that all polar chiral agents who seek to align on the unit sphere strictly constitute a dissipative spintronic fluid, where phase gradient transport is ensured by the Goldstone modes of the underlying broken symmetry.</description>
