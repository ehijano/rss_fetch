      <title>Cooperation and competition of basepairing and electrostatic interactions in mixtures of DNA nanostars and polylysine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase separation in biomolecular mixtures can result from multiple physical interactions, which may act either complementarily or antagonistically. In the case of protein--nucleic acid mixtures, charge plays a key role but can have contrasting effects on phase behavior. Attractive electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged macromolecules are screened by added salt, reducing the driving force for coacervation. By contrast, base-pairing interactions between nucleic acids are diminished by charge repulsion and thus enhanced by added salt, promoting associative phase separation. To explore this interplay, we combine experiment and theory to map the complex phase behavior of a model solution of poly-L-lysine (PLL) and self-complementary DNA nanostars (NS) as a function of temperature, ionic strength, and macromolecular composition. Despite having opposite salt dependences, we find that electrostatics and base pairing cooperate to stabilize NS--PLL coacervation at high ionic strengths and temperatures, leading to two-phase or three-phase coexistence under various conditions. We further observe a variety of kinetic pathways to phase separation at different salt concentrations, resulting in the formation of nonequilibrium aggregates or droplets whose compositions evolve on long timescales. Finally, we show that the cooperativity between electrostatics and base pairing can be used to create multiphase coacervates that partition various NS species at intermediate salt concentrations. Our results illustrate how the interplay between distinct interaction modes can greatly increase the complexity of the phase behavior relative to systems with a single type of interaction.</description>

      <title>Protein folding classes -- High-dimensional geometry of amino acid composition space revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, the distributions of protein structure classes (or folding types) of experimentally determined structures from a legacy dataset and a comprehensive database (SCOP) are modeled precisely with geometric constructs such as convex polytopes in high-dimensional amino acid composition space. This is a follow-up of a previous non-statistical, geometry-motivated modeling of protein classes with ellipsoidal models, which are superseded presently in three important respects: (1) as a paradigm shift descriptive 'distribution model' of experimental data is de-coupled from, and serves as the basis for, possible future predictive 'domain model' generalizable to proteins in the same class for which 3D structures have yet to be determined experimentally, (2) the geometric and analytic characteristics of class distributions are obtained via exact computational geometry calculations, and (3) the full data from a comprehensive database are included in such calculations, eschewing training set selection and biases. In contrast to statistical and machine-learning approaches, the analytical, non-statistical geometry models of protein class distributions demonstrated in this study furnish complete and precise information on their size and relative disposition in the high-dimensional space (vis-\`a-vis any overlaps leading to ambiguity and limits in classification). Intended principally as accurate and summary description of the complex relationships between amino acid composition and protein classes, and suitably as a basis for predictive modeling where permissible, the results suggest that pen-ultimately they may be useful adjuncts for validating sequence-based protein structure predictions and contribute to theoretical and fundamental understanding of secondary structure formation and protein folding, demonstrating the role of high dimensional amino acid composition space in protein studies.</description>

      <title>A Collaborative Framework Integrating Large Language Model and Chemical Fragment Space: Mutual Inspiration for Lead Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization algorithm is essential in computer-aided drug design by progressively exploring chemical space to design lead compounds with high affinity to target protein. However current methods face inherent challenges in integrating domain knowledge, limiting their performance in identifying lead compounds with novel and valid binding mode. Here, we propose AutoLeadDesign, a lead compounds design framework that inspires extensive domain knowledge encoded in large language models with chemical fragments to progressively implement efficient exploration of vast chemical space. The comprehensive experiments indicate that AutoLeadDesign outperforms baseline methods. Significantly, empirical lead design campaigns targeting two clinically relevant targets (PRMT5 and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) demonstrate AutoLeadDesign's competence in de novo generation of lead compounds achieving expert-competitive design efficacy. Structural analysis further confirms their mechanism-validated inhibitory patterns. By tracing the process of design, we find that AutoLeadDesign shares analogous mechanisms with fragment-based drug design which traditionally rely on the expert decision-making, further revealing why it works. Overall, AutoLeadDesign offers an efficient approach for lead compounds design, suggesting its potential utility in drug design.</description>

      <title>The effect of stereochemical constraints on the structural properties of folded proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proteins are composed of chains of amino acids that fold into complex three-dimensional structures. Several key features, such as the radius of gyration, fraction of core amino acids $f_{\rm core}$, packing fraction $\langle \phi\rangle$ of core amino acids, and structure factor $S(q)$ define the structure of folded proteins. It is well-known that folded proteins are compact with a radius of gyration $R_g(N) \sim N^{\nu}$ that obeys power-law scaling with the number of amino acids $N$ and $\nu \sim 1/3$, $f_{\rm core} \approx 0.09$, and $\langle \phi \rangle \approx 0.55$. We also investigate the {\it internal} scaling of the radius of gyration $R_g(n)$ versus the chemical separation $n$ between amino acids for subchains of length $n$ and show that it does not obey simple power-law scaling with $\nu \sim 1/3$. Instead, $R_g(n) \sim n^{\nu_{1,2}}$ with a larger exponent $\nu_1 &gt; 1/3$ for small $n$ and smaller exponent $\nu_{2} &lt; 1/3$ for large $n$. To develop a minimal model for proteins that recapitulates these defining structural features, we carry out collapse simulations for a series of coarse-grained models with increasing complexity. We show that a model, which coarse-grains amino acids into a single spherical backbone bead and several variable-sized side-chain beads and enforces bend- and dihedral-angle constraints for the backbone, recapitulates $R_g(n)$, $f_{\rm core}$, $\langle \phi \rangle$, and $S(q)$ for more than $2500$ x-ray crystal structures of proteins.</description>

      <title>MolPIF: A Parameter Interpolation Flow Model for Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in deep learning for molecular generation show promise in accelerating drug discovery. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) have recently shown impressive performance across diverse chemical tasks, with their success often ascribed to the paradigm of modeling in a low-variance parameter space. However, the Bayesian inference-based strategy imposes limitations on designing more flexible distribution transformation pathways, making it challenging to adapt to diverse data distributions and varied task requirements. Furthermore, the potential for simpler, more efficient parameter-space-based models is unexplored. To address this, we propose a novel Parameter Interpolation Flow model (named PIF) with detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference procedures. We then develop MolPIF for structure-based drug design, demonstrating its superior performance across diverse metrics compared to baselines. This work validates the effectiveness of parameter-space-based generative modeling paradigm for molecules and offers new perspectives for model design.</description>
