      <title>Accelerating Regular Path Queries over Graph Database with Processing-in-Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular path queries (RPQs) in graph databases are bottlenecked by the memory wall. Emerging processing-in-memory (PIM) technologies offer a promising solution to dispatch and execute path matching tasks in parallel within PIM modules. We present Moctopus, a PIM-based data management system for graph databases that supports efficient batch RPQs and graph updates. Moctopus employs a PIM-friendly dynamic graph partitioning algorithm, which tackles graph skewness and preserves graph locality with low overhead for RPQ processing. Moctopus enables efficient graph update by amortizing the host CPU's update overhead to PIM modules. Evaluation of Moctopus demonstrates superiority over the state-of-the-art traditional graph database.</description>

      <title>Schema-Aware Multi-Task Learning for Complex Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional text-to-SQL parsers are not good at synthesizing complex SQL queries that involve multiple tables or columns, due to the challenges inherent in identifying the correct schema items and performing accurate alignment between question and schema items. To address the above issue, we present a schema-aware multi-task learning framework (named MTSQL) for complicated SQL queries. Specifically, we design a schema linking discriminator module to distinguish the valid question-schema linkings, which explicitly instructs the encoder by distinctive linking relations to enhance the alignment quality. On the decoder side, we define 6-type relationships to describe the connections between tables and columns (e.g., WHERE_TC), and introduce an operator-centric triple extractor to recognize those associated schema items with the predefined relationship. Also, we establish a rule set of grammar constraints via the predicted triples to filter the proper SQL operators and schema items during the SQL generation. On Spider, a cross-domain challenging text-to-SQL benchmark, experimental results indicate that MTSQL is more effective than baselines, especially in extremely hard scenarios. Moreover, further analyses verify that our approach leads to promising improvements for complicated SQL queries.</description>

      <title>KIF: A Framework for Virtual Integration of Heterogeneous Knowledge Bases using Wikidata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a knowledge integration framework (called KIF) that uses Wikidata as a lingua franca to integrate heterogeneous knowledge bases. These can be triplestores, relational databases, CSV files, etc., which may or may not use the Wikidata dialect of RDF. KIF leverages Wikidata's data model and vocabulary plus user-defined mappings to expose a unified view of the integrated bases while keeping track of the context and provenance of their statements. The result is a virtual knowledge base which behaves like an "extended Wikidata" and which can be queried either through an efficient filter interface or using SPARQL. We present the design and implementation of KIF, discuss how we have used it to solve a real integration problem in the domain of chemistry (involving Wikidata, PubChem, and IBM CIRCA), and present experimental results on the performance and overhead of KIF.</description>

      <title>Interactive Trimming against Evasive Online Data Manipulation Attacks: A Game-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the exponential growth of data and its crucial impact on our lives and decision-making, the integrity of data has become a significant concern. Malicious data poisoning attacks, where false values are injected into the data, can disrupt machine learning processes and lead to severe consequences. To mitigate these attacks, distance-based defenses, such as trimming, have been proposed, but they can be easily evaded by white-box attackers. The evasiveness and effectiveness of poisoning attack strategies are two sides of the same coin, making game theory a promising approach. However, existing game-theoretical models often overlook the complexities of online data poisoning attacks, where strategies must adapt to the dynamic process of data collection.
  In this paper, we present an interactive game-theoretical model to defend online data manipulation attacks using the trimming strategy. Our model accommodates a complete strategy space, making it applicable to strong evasive and colluding adversaries. Leveraging the principle of least action and the Euler-Lagrange equation from theoretical physics, we derive an analytical model for the game-theoretic process. To demonstrate its practical usage, we present a case study in a privacy-preserving data collection system under local differential privacy where a non-deterministic utility function is adopted. Two strategies are devised from this analytical model, namely, Tit-for-tat and Elastic. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, which showcase the effectiveness and accuracy of these two strategies.</description>

      <title>Finding Smallest Witnesses for Conjunctive Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A witness is a sub-database that preserves the query results of the original database but of much smaller size. It has wide applications in query rewriting and debugging, query explanation, IoT analytics, multi-layer network routing, etc. In this paper, we study the smallest witness problem (SWP) for the class of conjunctive queries (CQs) without self-joins.
  We first establish the dichotomy that SWP for a CQ can be computed in polynomial time if and only if it has {\em head-cluster property}, unless $\texttt{P} = \texttt{NP}$. We next turn to the approximated version by relaxing the size of a witness from being minimum. We surprisingly find that the {\em head-domination} property - that has been identified for the deletion propagation problem \cite{kimelfeld2012maximizing} - can also precisely capture the hardness of the approximated smallest witness problem. In polynomial time, SWP for any CQ with head-domination property can be approximated within a constant factor, while SWP for any CQ without such a property cannot be approximated within a logarithmic factor, unless $\texttt{P} = \texttt{NP}$.
  We further explore efficient approximation algorithms for CQs without head-domination property: (1) we show a trivial algorithm which achieves a polynomially large approximation ratio for general CQs; (2) for any CQ with only one non-output attribute, such as star CQs, we show a greedy algorithm with a logarithmic approximation ratio; (3) for line CQs, which contain at least two non-output attributes, we relate SWP problem to the directed steiner forest problem, whose algorithms can be applied to line CQs directly. Meanwhile, we establish a much higher lower bound, exponentially larger than the logarithmic lower bound obtained above. It remains open to close the gap between the lower and upper bound of the approximated SWP for CQs without head-domination property.</description>
