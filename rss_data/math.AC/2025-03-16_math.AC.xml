      <title>On Quasi-$F$-Purity of Excellent Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an analogue to Quasi-$F$-splittings, Quasi-$F$-purity, which is definable over rings that are not necessarily $F$-finite. We show that this property is equivalent to being Quasi-$F$-split in the complete local and $F$-finite case. We then exhibit that it is stable under completion, direct limit, and local/finite \'etale extension.</description>

      <title>Computing Certificates of Strictly Positive Polynomials in Archimedean Quadratic Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New results on computing certificates of strictly positive polynomials in Archimedean quadratic modules are presented. The results build upon (i) Averkov's method for generating a strictly positive polynomial for which a membership certificate can be more easily computed than the input polynomial whose certificate is being sought, and (ii) Lasserre's method for generating a certificate by successively approximating a nonnegative polynomial by sums of squares. First, a fully constructive method based on Averkov's result is given by providing details about the parameters; further, his result is extended to work on arbitrary subsets, in particular, the whole Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, producing globally strictly positive polynomials. Second, Lasserre's method is integrated with the extended Averkov construction to generate certificates. Third, the methods have been implemented and their effectiveness is illustrated. Examples are given on which the existing software package RealCertify appears to struggle, whereas the proposed method succeeds in generating certificates. Several situations are identified where an Archimedean polynomial does not have to be explicitly included in a set of generators of an Archimedean quadratic module. Unlike other approaches for addressing the problem of computing certificates, the methods/approach presented is easier to understand as well as implement.</description>

      <title>Edge ideals with linear quotients and without homological linear quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A monomial ideal $I$ is said to have homological linear quotients if for each $k\geq 0$, the homological shift ideal $\mathrm{HS}_k(I)$ has linear quotients. It is a well-known fact that if an edge ideal $I(G)$ has homological linear quotients, then $G$ is co-chordal. We construct a family of co-chordal graphs $\{\mathrm{H}_n^c\}_{n\geq 6}$ and propose a conjecture that an edge ideal $I(G)$ has homological linear quotients if and only if $G$ is co-chordal and $\mathrm{H}_n^c$-free for any $n\geq 6$. In this paper, we prove one direction of the conjecture. Moreover, we study possible patterns of pairs $(G,k)$ of a co-chordal graph $G$ and integer $k$ such that $\mathrm{HS}_k(I(G))$ has linear quotients.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal successive minima, partial jets and convex geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two sets of invariants for a line bundle at a point: infinitesimal successive minima and asymptotic partial jet separation. They are inspired by the local analogue of Ambro-Ito, and by the jet-theoretic interpretation of the Seshadri constant respectively. Under mild restrictions the two sets are equal. Moving to convex geometry, we prove that the lengths of the maximal simplex inside the generic infinitesimal Newton-Okounkov body (iNObody) of the line bundle at the point are precisely the successive minima. As application we characterize when this body is simplicial, and give examples when it is not. When the point is very general the convex body has a shape that we call Borel-fixed, a property inspired by generic initial ideals. Borel-fixed convex bodies satisfy simplicial lower bounds and polytopal upper bounds determined by their widths. For the generic iNObody of the line bundle at very general points these widths are again the infinitesimal successive minima.</description>

      <title>On Some Hereditary and Super Classes of Directly Finite Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuing recent studies of both the hereditary and super properties of certain classes of Abelian groups, we explore in-depth what is the situation in the quite large class consisting of directly finite Abelian groups. Trying to connect some of these classes, we specifically succeeded to prove the surprising criteria that a relatively Hopfian group is hereditarily only when it is extended Bassian, as well as that, a relatively Hopfian group is super only when it is extended Bassian. In this aspect, additional relevant necessary and sufficient conditions in a slightly more general context are also proved.</description>

      <title>Maximal ideal space of some Banach algebras of Dirichlet series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{H}^\infty$ be the set of all Dirichlet series $f=\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a_n}{n^s}$ (where $a_n\in \mathbb{C}$ for each $n$) that converge at each $s\in {\mathbb{C}}_+$, such that $\|f\|_{\infty}:=\sup_{s\in {\mathbb{C}}_+}|f(s)|&lt;\infty$. Let $\mathscr{B}\subset \mathscr{H}^\infty$ be a Banach algebra containing the Dirichlet polynomials (Dirichlet series with finitely many nonzero terms) with a norm $\|\cdot\|_{\mathscr{B}}$ such that the inclusion $\mathscr{B} \subset \mathscr{H}^\infty$ is continuous. For $m\in \mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,\cdots\}$, let $\partial^{-m}\mathscr{B}$ denote the Banach algebra consisting of all $f\in \mathscr{B}$ such that $f',\cdots, f^{(m)}\in \mathscr{B}$, with pointwise operations and the norm $\|f\|_{\partial^{-m}\mathscr{B}}=\sum_{\ell=0}^m \frac{1}{\ell!}\|f^{(\ell)}\|_{\mathscr{B}}$. Assuming that the Wiener $1/f$ property holds for $\mathscr{B}$ (that is, $\inf_{s\in {\mathbb{C}}_+} |f(s)|&gt;0$ implies $\frac{1}{f}\in \mathscr{B}$), it is shown that for all $m\in \mathbb{N}$, the maximal ideal space $M(\partial^{-m}\mathscr{B})$ of $\partial^{-m}\mathscr{B}$ is homeomorphic to $\overline{\mathbb{D}}^{\mathbb{N}}$, where $\overline{\mathbb{D}}=\{z\in \mathbb{C}:|z|\le 1\}$. Examples of such Banach algebras are $\mathscr{H}^\infty$, the subalgebra $\mathscr{A}_u$ of $\mathscr{H}^\infty$ consisting of uniformly continuous functions in ${\mathbb{C}}_+$, and the Wiener algebra $\mathscr{W}$ of Dirichlet series with $\|f\|_{\mathscr{W}}:=\sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n|&lt;\infty$. Some consequences (existence of logarithms, projective freeness, infinite Bass stable rank) are given as applications.</description>

      <title>Local cohomology tables of sequentially almost Cohen-Macaulay modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.07536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a polynomial ring over a field. We introduce the concept of sequentially almost Cohen-Macaulay modules and describe the extremal rays of the cone of local cohomology tables of finitely generated graded $R$-modules which are sequentially almost Cohen-Macaulay, and describe some cases when the local cohomology table of a module of dimension 3 has a nontrivial decomposition.</description>

      <title>The GroebnerWalk.jl package for OSCAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing Gr\"obner bases is known to have a very high upper bound on computation time with respect to input length. Due to the connection between polyhedral geometry and Gr\"obner bases through the Gr\"obner fan, one can attempt an incremental approach to compute Gr\"obner bases. First computing a Gr\"obner basis with respect to an `easy' term order and transforming that result to a Gr\"obner basis with respect to the desired term order by using information about this polyhedral fan is done by a family of algorithms termed as Gr\"obner walk. We implemented two variants of the Gr\"obner walk in the computer algebra system OSCAR and compared their performance with classical Gr\"obner basis methods already found in OSCAR.</description>
