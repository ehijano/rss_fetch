      <title>Stochastic Monotone Inclusion with Closed Loop Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study in a Hilbertian setting, first and second-order monotone inclusions related to stochastic optimization problems with decision dependent distributions. The studied dynamics are formulated as monotone inclusions governed by Lipschitz perturbations of maximally monotone operators where the concept of equilibrium plays a central role. We discuss the relationship between the $\mathbb{W}_1$-Wasserstein Lipschitz behavior of the distribution and the so-called coarse Ricci curvature. As an application, we consider the monotone inclusions associated with stochastic optimisation problems involving the sum of a smooth function with Lipschitz gradient, a proximable function and a composite term.</description>

      <title>Well-conditioned Primal-Dual Interior-point Method for Accurate Low-rank Semidefinite Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe how the low-rank structure in an SDP can be exploited to reduce the per-iteration cost of a convex primal-dual interior-point method down to $O(n^{3})$ time and $O(n^{2})$ memory, even at very high accuracies. A traditional difficulty is the dense Newton subproblem at each iteration, which becomes progressively ill-conditioned as progress is made towards the solution. Preconditioners have previously been proposed to improve conditioning, but these can be expensive to set up, and become ineffective as the preconditioner itself becomes increasingly ill-conditioned at high accuracies. Instead, we present a \emph{well-conditioned reformulation} of the Newton subproblem that is cheap to set up, and whose condition number is guaranteed to remain bounded over all iterations of the interior-point method. In theory, applying an inner iterative method to the reformulation reduces the per-iteration cost of the outer interior-point method to $O(n^{3})$ time and $O(n^{2})$ memory. We also present a \emph{well-conditioned preconditioner} that theoretically increases the outer per-iteration cost to $O(n^{3}r^{3})$ time and $O(n^{2}r^{2})$ memory, where $r$ is an upper-bound on the solution rank, but in practice greatly improves the convergence of the inner iterations.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Scalable Iterative Solution of a Socio-Economic Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow with Two-Stage Post-Contingency Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fast and scalable iterative methodology for solving the security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) problem is proposed using problem decomposition and the inverse matrix modification lemma. The SCOPF formulation tackles system security operational planning by using short- and long-term post-contingency limits, probability of branch outages, and preventive and corrective actions, a probabilistic corrective-SCOPF problem formulation. Using two post-contingency states and contingency probabilities, the SCOPF could provide good system security at a lower cost than only preventive actions as the typical `N-1'-formulation does. Additional security is ensured using a post-contingency load-shedding limit constraint based on system operator policy. The proposed methodology is applied to a range of test systems containing up to 10,000 buses with a computational time of up to 3375 s for all 12,706 branch contingencies. Calculating contingency power flows takes 1.3% of the total solution time using the proposed methodology exploiting the inverse matrix modification lemma.</description>

      <title>Learning Firmly Nonexpansive Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven approach for constructing firmly nonexpansive operators. We demonstrate its applicability in Plug-and-Play methods, where classical algorithms such as forward-backward splitting, Chambolle--Pock primal-dual iteration, Douglas--Rachford iteration or alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM), are modified by replacing one proximal map by a learned firmly nonexpansive operator. We provide sound mathematical background to the problem of learning such an operator via expected and empirical risk minimization. We prove that, as the number of training points increases, the empirical risk minimization problem converges (in the sense of Gamma-convergence) to the expected risk minimization problem. Further, we derive a solution strategy that ensures firmly nonexpansive and piecewise affine operators within the convex envelope of the training set. We show that this operator converges to the best empirical solution as the number of points in the envelope increases in an appropriate sense. Finally, the experimental section details practical implementations of the method and presents an application in image denoising.</description>

      <title>Implementable Semismooth* Newton Methods for Generalized Equations are G-Semismooth Newton Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semismooth* Newton methods have been proposed in recent years targeting multi-valued inclusion problems and have been successfully implemented to deal with several concrete generalized equations. In this paper, we show that these executable implementations are exactly the applications of G-semismooth Newton methods for solving nonsmooth equations localized from these generalized equations. This new understanding expands the breadth of G-semismooth Newton methods in theory, and more importantly, facilitates the design and implementation of practical Newton-type algorithms for solving generalized equations.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Control Framework for Airborne Wind Energy Systems with a Flexible Tether</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish an optimal control framework for airborne wind energy systems (AWESs) with flexible tethers. The AWES configuration, consisting of a six-degree-of-freedom aircraft, a flexible tether, and a winch, is formulated as an index-1 differential-algebraic system of equations (DAE). We achieve this by adopting a minimal coordinate representation that uses Euler angles to characterize the aircraft's attitude and employing a quasi-static approach for the tether. The presented method contrasts with other recent optimization studies that use an index-3 DAE approach. By doing so, our approach avoids related inconsistency condition problems. We use a homotopy strategy to solve the optimal control problem that ultimately generates optimal trajectories of the AWES with a flexible tether. We furthermore compare with a rigid tether model by investigating the resulting mechanical powers and tether forces. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the presented methodology and the necessity to incorporate the flexibility of the tether when solving the optimal control problem.</description>

      <title>Combining Gradient Information and Primitive Directions for High-Performance Mixed-Integer Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider bound-constrained mixed-integer optimization problems where the objective function is differentiable w.r.t.\ the continuous variables for every configuration of the integer variables. We mainly suggest to exploit derivative information when possible in these scenarios: concretely, we propose an algorithmic framework that carries out local optimization steps, alternating searches along gradient-based and primitive directions. The algorithm is shown to match the convergence properties of a derivative-free counterpart. Most importantly, the results of thorough computational experiments show that the proposed method clearly outperforms not only the derivative-free approach but also a state-of-the-art solver both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Corrections to and improvements on results from "The Laplacian spectrum of large graphs sampled from graphons"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we correct the proof of Proposition 4 in our paper "The Laplacian Spectrum of Large Graphs Sampled from Graphons" (arXiv:2004.09177) and we improve several results therein. To this end, we prove a new concentration lemma about degrees and Laplacian eigenvalues. This lemma allows us to improve several bounds and to dispense from assuming that the graphon is bounded away from zero in several results. This extension leads, in particular, to correct the proof of Proposition 4. Additionally, we extend Proposition 4 to graphs that are sampled from graphons by using deterministic latent variables.</description>

      <title>Improving Observed Decisions Quality using Inverse Optimization: A Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many applied optimization settings, parameters that define the constraints may not guarantee the best possible solution, and superior solutions might exist that are infeasible for the given parameter values. Removing such constraints, re-optimizing, and evaluating the new solution may be insufficient, as the optimizer's preferences in selecting the existing solutions might be lost. To address this issue, we present an inverse optimization-based model that takes an observed solution as input and aims to improve upon it by projecting onto desired hyperplanes or expanding the feasible set while balancing the distance to the observed decision to preserve the optimizer's preferences.
  We demonstrate the applicability of the model in the context of radiation therapy treatment planning, an essential component of cancer treatment. Radiation therapy treatment planning is typically guided by expert-driven guidelines that define the optimization problem but remain mostly general. Our model provides an automated framework that learns new plans from available plans based on given clinical criteria, optimizing the desired effect without compromising the remaining constraints.
  The proposed approach is applied to a cohort of four prostate cancer patients, and the results demonstrate improvements in dose-volume histograms while maintaining comparable target coverage to clinically acceptable plans. By optimizing the parameters of the treatment planning problem and exploring the Pareto frontier, our methodology uncovers previously unattainable solutions that enhance organ-at-risk sparing without sacrificing target coverage. The framework's ability to handle multiple organs-at-risk and various dose-volume constraints highlights its flexibility and potential for application to diverse radiation therapy treatment planning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Electric Bus Scheduling with Non-Linear Charging, Power Grid Bottlenecks, and Dynamic Recharge Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public transport operators are gradually electrifying their bus fleets, predominantly with battery-powered drive trains. These buses commonly have to be scheduled to recharge in-service, which gives rise to a number of challenges. A major problem is that the relationship between charging time and replenished driving range is non-linear, which is often approximately modeled. We examine the associated approximation error and show how it can result in a gross over- or underestimation of the fleet size. Moreover, we demonstrate that commonly used piecewise linear underestimations of the charge curve do not result in an underestimation of the predicted charge states in electric vehicle scheduling and routing models.
  Furthermore, since power grid upgrades are currently not keeping up with an ever growing electricity demand, operators are introducing active charge management tools to dynamically adjust the charging speed depending on the amount of available energy. It is therefore imperative to extend electric bus scheduling models to account for these developments.
  We propose a novel mixed-integer programming formulation for the electric bus scheduling problem featuring an improved approximation of the non-linear battery charging behavior as well as dynamic recharge speeds to accommodate grid load limits. The idea is to linearly interpolate what we call the charge increment function, which is closely related to the derivative of the commonly used charge curve. This provides very good error control and integrates easily into integer programming models. We demonstrate the practical usefulness of our model on a diverse library of real-life instances.</description>

      <title>Real-time Estimation of Bound Water Concentration during Lyophilization with Temperature-based State Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lyophilization (aka freeze drying) has been shown to provide long-term stability for many crucial biotherapeutics, e.g., mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, allowing for higher storage temperature. The final stage of lyophilization, namely secondary drying, entails bound water removal via desorption, in which accurate prediction of bound water concentration is vital to ensuring the quality of the lyophilized product. This article proposes a novel technique for real-time estimation of the residual moisture during secondary drying in lyophilization. A state observer is employed, which combines temperature measurement and mechanistic understanding of heat transfer and desorption kinetics, without requiring any online concentration measurement. Results from both simulations and experimental data show that the observer can accurately estimate the concentration of bound water in real time for all possible concentration levels, operating conditions, and measurement noise. This framework can also be applied for monitoring and control of the residual moisture in other desorption-related processes.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Coverage Control: From Discrete Assignments to Continuous Multi-agent Distribution Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-agent spatial coverage control problem encompasses a broad research domain, dealing with both dynamic and static deployment strategies, discrete-task assignments, and spatial distribution-matching deployment. Coverage control may involve the deployment of a finite number of agents or a continuum through centralized or decentralized, locally-interacting schemes. All these problems can be solved via a different taxonomy of deployment algorithms for multiple agents. Depending on the application scenario, these problems involve from purely discrete descriptions of tasks (finite loads) and agents (finite resources), to a mixture of discrete and continuous elements, to fully continuous descriptions of the same. Yet, it is possible to find common features that underline all the above formulations, which we aim to illustrate here. By doing so, we aim to point the reader to novel references related to these problems. The short article outline is the following: Static coverage via concurrent area partitioning and assignment; Static coverage as a discrete task assignment; and Continuum task assignment for large-scale swarms.</description>

      <title>LinSATNet: The Positive Linear Satisfiability Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encoding constraints into neural networks is attractive. This paper studies how to introduce the popular positive linear satisfiability to neural networks. We propose the first differentiable satisfiability layer based on an extension of the classic Sinkhorn algorithm for jointly encoding multiple sets of marginal distributions. We further theoretically characterize the convergence property of the Sinkhorn algorithm for multiple marginals. In contrast to the sequential decision e.g.\ reinforcement learning-based solvers, we showcase our technique in solving constrained (specifically satisfiability) problems by one-shot neural networks, including i) a neural routing solver learned without supervision of optimal solutions; ii) a partial graph matching network handling graphs with unmatchable outliers on both sides; iii) a predictive network for financial portfolios with continuous constraints. To our knowledge, there exists no one-shot neural solver for these scenarios when they are formulated as satisfiability problems.

      <title>A trustworthy blockchain-based energy trading scheme for V2G operations in distributed power grids via integrated scheduling and trading framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) and the deployment of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology pose significant challenges for distributed power grids, particularly in fostering trust and ensuring effective coordination among stakeholders. In this paper, we developed an integrated scheduling and trading framework to conduct transparent and efficacious coordination in V2G operations. In blockchain implementation, we propose a cyber-physical blockchain architecture that enhances transaction efficiency and scalability by leveraging smart charging points (SCPs) for rapid transaction validation through a fast-path practical byzantine fault tolerance (fast-path PBFT) consensus mechanism. From the energy dispatching perspective, a game-theoretical pricing strategy is employed and smart contracts are utilized for autonomous decision-making between EVs and operators, aiming to optimize the trading process and maximize economic benefits. Numerical evaluation of blockchain consensus shows the effect of the fast-path PBFT consensus in improving systems scalability with a balanced trade-off in robustness. A case study, utilizing real-world data from the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), demonstrates significant reductions in EV charging costs and the framework potential to support auxiliary grid services.</description>

Abstract: The key challenge of personalized federated learning (PerFL) is to capture the statistical heterogeneity properties of data with inexpensive communications and gain customized performance for participating devices. To address these, we introduced personalized federated learning in multi-tier architecture (PerMFL) to obtain optimized and personalized local models when there are known team structures across devices. We provide theoretical guarantees of PerMFL, which offers linear convergence rates for smooth strongly convex problems and sub-linear convergence rates for smooth non-convex problems. We conduct numerical experiments demonstrating the robust empirical performance of PerMFL, outperforming the state-of-the-art in multiple personalized federated learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Hyperparameter Optimization for Driving Strategies Based on Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on hyperparameter optimization for autonomous driving strategies based on Reinforcement Learning. We provide a detailed description of training the RL agent in a simulation environment. Subsequently, we employ Efficient Global Optimization algorithm that uses Gaussian Process fitting for hyperparameter optimization in RL. Before this optimization phase, Gaussian process interpolation is applied to fit the surrogate model, for which the hyperparameter set is generated using Latin hypercube sampling. To accelerate the evaluation, parallelization techniques are employed. Following the hyperparameter optimization procedure, a set of hyperparameters is identified, resulting in a noteworthy enhancement in overall driving performance. There is a substantial increase of 4\% when compared to existing manually tuned parameters and the hyperparameters discovered during the initialization process using Latin hypercube sampling. After the optimization, we analyze the obtained results thoroughly and conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness and generalization capabilities of the learned autonomous driving strategies. The findings from this study contribute to the advancement of Gaussian process based Bayesian optimization to optimize the hyperparameters for autonomous driving in RL, providing valuable insights for the development of efficient and reliable autonomous driving systems.</description>

Abstract: The reformulation-linearization technique (RLT) is a prominent approach to constructing tight linear relaxations of non-convex continuous and mixed-integer optimization problems. The goal of this paper is to extend the applicability and improve the performance of RLT for bilinear product relations. First, a method for detecting bilinear product relations implicitly contained in mixed-integer linear programs is developed based on analyzing linear constraints with binary variables, thus enabling the application of bilinear RLT to a new class of problems. Our second contribution addresses the high computational cost of RLT cut separation, which presents one of the major difficulties in applying RLT efficiently in practice. We propose a new RLT cutting plane separation algorithm which identifies combinations of linear constraints and bound factors that are expected to yield an inequality that is violated by the current relaxation solution. This algorithm is applicable to RLT cuts generated for all types of bilinear terms, including but not limited to the detected implicit products. A detailed computational study based on implementations in two solvers evaluates the performance impact of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Zero-Sum State-Blind Stochastic Games with Vanishing Stage Duration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In stochastic games with stage duration h, players act at times 0, h, 2h, and so on. The payoff and leaving probabilities are proportional to h. As h approaches 0, such discrete-time games approximate games played in continuous time. The behavior of the values when h tends to 0 was already studied in the case of stochastic games with perfect observation of the state. We examine the same question for the case of state-blind stochastic games. Our main finding is that, as h approaches 0, the value of any state-blind stochastic game with stage duration h converges to the unique viscosity solution of a partial differential equation.</description>

      <title>An efficient algorithm for solving linear equality-constrained LQR problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05433v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for solving linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) problems with linear equality constraints, also known as constrained LQR (CLQR) problems. Our method's sequential runtime is linear in the number of stages and constraints, and its parallel runtime is logarithmic in the number of stages. The main technical contribution of this paper is the derivation of parallelizable techniques for eliminating the linear equality constraints while preserving the standard positive (semi-)definiteness requirements of LQR problems.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Objective-Function-Free Adaptive Regularization Method with Optimal Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fully stochastic second-order adaptive-regularization method for unconstrained nonconvex optimization is presented which never computes the objective-function value, but yet achieves the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ complexity bound for finding first-order critical points. The method is noise-tolerant and the inexactness conditions required for convergence depend on the history of past steps. Applications to cases where derivative evaluation is inexact and to minimization of finite sums by sampling are discussed. Numerical experiments on large binary classification problems illustrate the potential of the new method.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Online Nonstochastic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This text presents an introduction to an emerging paradigm in control of dynamical systems and differentiable reinforcement learning called online nonstochastic control. The new approach applies techniques from online convex optimization and convex relaxations to obtain new methods with provable guarantees for classical settings in optimal and robust control.
  The primary distinction between online nonstochastic control and other frameworks is the objective. In optimal control, robust control, and other control methodologies that assume stochastic noise, the goal is to perform comparably to an offline optimal strategy. In online nonstochastic control, both the cost functions as well as the perturbations from the assumed dynamical model are chosen by an adversary. Thus the optimal policy is not defined a priori. Rather, the target is to attain low regret against the best policy in hindsight from a benchmark class of policies.
  This objective suggests the use of the decision making framework of online convex optimization as an algorithmic methodology. The resulting methods are based on iterative mathematical optimization algorithms, and are accompanied by finite-time regret and computational complexity guarantees.</description>

      <title>On Updating Static Output Feedback Controllers Under State-Space Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel update of a nominal stabilizing static output feedback (SOF) controller for a perturbed linear system. In almost every classical feedback controller design problem, a stabilizing feedback controller is designed given a stabilizable unstable system. In realistic scenarios, the system model is usually imperfect and subject to perturbations. A typical approach to attenuate the impacts of such perturbations on the system stability is repeating the whole controller design procedure to find an updated stabilizing SOF controller. Such an approach can be inefficient and occasionally infeasible. Using the notion of minimum destabilizing real perturbation (MDRP), we construct a simple norm minimization problem (a least-squares problem) to propose an efficient update of a nominal stabilizing SOF controller that can be applied to various control engineering applications in the case of perturbed scenarios like abrupt changes or inaccurate system models. In particular, considering norm-bounded known or unknown perturbations, this paper presents updated stabilizing SOF controllers and derives sufficient stability conditions. Geometric metrics to quantitatively measure the approach's robustness are defined. Moreover, we characterize the corresponding guaranteed stability regions, and specifically, for the case of norm-bounded unknown perturbations, we propose non-fragility-based robust updated stabilizing SOF controllers. Through extensive numerical simulations, we assess the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On a class of interdiction problems with partition matroids: complexity and polynomial-time algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we consider a class of linear matroid interdiction problems, where the feasible sets for the upper-level decision-maker (referred to as a leader) and the lower-level decision-maker (referred to as a follower) are induced by two distinct partition matroids with a common weighted ground set. Unlike classical network interdiction models where the leader is subject to a single budget constraint, in our setting, both the leader and the follower are subject to several independent capacity constraints and engage in a zero-sum game. While the problem of finding a maximum weight independent set in a partition matroid is known to be polynomially solvable, we prove that the considered bilevel problem is $NP$-hard even when the weights of ground elements are all binary. On a positive note, it is revealed that, if the number of capacity constraints is fixed for either the leader or the follower, then the considered class of bilevel problems admits several polynomial-time solution schemes. Specifically, these schemes are based on a single-level dual reformulation, a dynamic programming-based approach, and a 2-flip local search algorithm for the leader.</description>

      <title>Algorithmically Fair Maximization of Multiple Submodular Objective Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constrained maximization of submodular functions poses a central problem in combinatorial optimization. In many realistic scenarios, a number of agents need to maximize multiple submodular objectives over the same ground set. We study such a setting, where the different solutions must be disjoint, and thus, questions of algorithmic fairness arise. Inspired from the fair division literature, we suggest a simple round-robin protocol, where agents are allowed to build their solutions one item at a time by taking turns. Unlike what is typical in fair division, however, the prime goal here is to provide a fair algorithmic environment; each agent is allowed to use any algorithm for constructing their respective solutions. We show that just by following simple greedy policies, agents have solid guarantees for both monotone and non-monotone objectives, and for combinatorial constraints as general as $p$-systems (which capture cardinality and matroid intersection constraints). In the monotone case, our results include approximate EF1-type guarantees and their implications in fair division may be of independent interest. Further, although following a greedy policy may not be optimal in general, we show that consistently performing better than that is computationally hard.</description>

      <title>Convex relaxation for the generalized maximum-entropy sampling problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalized maximum-entropy sampling problem (GMESP) is to select an order-$s$ principal submatrix from an order-$n$ covariance matrix, to maximize the product of its $t$ greatest eigenvalues, $0&lt;t\leq s &lt;n$. Introduced more than 25 years ago, GMESP is a natural generalization of two fundamental problems in statistical design theory: (i) maximum-entropy sampling problem (MESP); (ii) binary D-optimality (D-Opt). In the general case, it can be motivated by a selection problem in the context of principal component analysis (PCA).
  We introduce the first convex-optimization based relaxation for GMESP, study its behavior, compare it to an earlier spectral bound, and demonstrate its use in a branch-and-bound scheme. We find that such an approach is practical when $s-t$ is very small.</description>
