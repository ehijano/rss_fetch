      <title>The Rabinowitz minimal periodic solution conjecture on partially convex reversible Hamiltonian systems and brake subharmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under weaker regularity and compactness assumptions, we find the mountain-pass essential point, which is a novel extension of the classical Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz mountain pass theorem. We study the reversible superquadratic autonomous Hamiltonian systems whose Hamiltonian $H(p,q)$ is strictly convex in the position $q\in\mathbf{R}^n$ and prove that for every $T&gt;0$, the system has a $T$-periodic brake solution $\bar x$ with minimal period $T$, provided the Hessian $H_{pp}(\bar x(t))\in\mathbf{R}^{n\times n}$ is semi-positive definite for $t\in\mathbf{R}$ or $n=1$. For brake subharmonics of general reversible nonautonomous Hamiltonian systems, we also get some new results.</description>

      <title>On Hamiltonian stationarity of twisted Lagrangian tori in ${\mathbb{C}}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chekanov's exotic tori have been playing an important role in symplectic geometry as they are the only known examples of Lagrangian tori in ${\mathbb{C}}^2$ that are not Hamiltonian isotopic to a product torus. In this paper, we explore the differential geometry of a wider range of tori constructed by twisting simple closed planar curves, which include both certain product tori and Chekanov's exotic tori. In particular, we investigate the minimality of area of such twisted tori under Hamiltonian deformations and show that the only minimal twisted tori are the product ones. This tells us that Chekanov's exotic tori are not area minimal in their Hamiltonian isotopy classes.</description>

      <title>P-adic Gamma classes and overconvergent Frobenius structures for quantum connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the small quantum connection on a monotone symplectic manifold, with p-adic coefficients. We conjecture that this always admits an overconvergent Frobenius structure, whose constant term is given by a characteristic class associated to Morita's p-adic Gamma function. We prove this conjecture for toric Fano varieties and Grassmannians, and also supply additional experimental evidence.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Braids via Generating Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphism of the plane, one can define a generating function for it. In this paper, we show how generating functions retain information about the braid type of collections of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. One the one hand, we show that it is possible to define a filtration keeping track of linking numbers of pairs of fixed points on the Morse complex of the generating function. On the other, we provide a finite-dimensional proof of a Theorem by Alves and Meiwes about the lower-semicontinuity of the topological entropy with respect to the Hofer norm. The technical tools come from work by Le Calvez which was developed in the 90s. In particular, we apply a version of positivity of intersections for generating functions.</description>

      <title>A Bound on the Symplectic Systolic Ratio of Polytopes in Even-Dimensional Euclidean Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symplectic capacities are invariants in symplectic geometry that are used to obstruct symplectic embeddings. From a certain symplectic capacity, the Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity, one can construct the systolic ratio, which measures the difference in the capacity and the Euclidean volume. The systolic ratio of a unit ball is always 1. It was conjectured by Viterbo that the systolic ratio is bounded by 1. This conjecture was disproven by Haim-Kislev recently, and now it is open to determine what bounds one may obtain on the systolic ratio if not 1. In this paper, the author investigates bounds on the systolic ratio of polytopes. In particular, a sharp bound on the systolic ratio of simplices in any dimension is obtained, with the dependence on dimension made explicit.</description>

      <title>Orbits and attainable Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of mechanical Liouville equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the approximate controllability problem for Liouville transport equations along a mechanical Hamiltonian vector field. Such PDEs evolve inside the orbit $$\mathcal{O}(\rho_0):=\left\{\rho_0\circ \Phi\mid \Phi\in {\rm DHam}(T^*M)\right\},\quad \rho_0\in L^r(T^*M,\mathbb{R}), \quad r\in[1,\infty),$$ where $\rho_0$ is the initial density and ${\rm DHam}(T^*M)$ is the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of the cotangent bundle manifold $T^*M$. The approximately reachable densities from $\rho_0$ are thus contained in $\overline{\mathcal{O}(\rho_0)}$, where the closure is taken with respect to the $L^r$-topology. Our first result is a characterization of $\overline{\mathcal{O}(\rho_0)}$ when the manifold $M$ is the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ or the torus $\mathbb{T}^d$ of arbitrary dimension: $\overline{\mathcal{O}(\rho_0)}$ is the set of all the densities whose sub- and super-level sets have the same measure as those of $\rho_0$. This result is an approximate version, in the case of ${\rm DHam}(T^*M)$, of a theorem by J. Moser (Trans. Am. Math. Soc. 120: 286-294, 1965) on the group of diffeomorphisms.
  We then present two examples of systems, respectively on $M=\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\mathbb{T}^d$, where the small-time approximately attainable diffeomorphisms coincide with ${\rm DHam}(T^*M)$, respectively at the level of the group and at the level of the densities.
  The proofs are based on the construction of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms that approximate suitable permutations of finite grids, and Poisson bracket techniques.</description>

      <title>Godbillon-Vey classes of regular Jacobi manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of a Jacobi manifold is a natural generalization of that of a Poisson manifold. A Jacobi manifold has a natural foliation in which each leaf has either a contact structure or a locally conformal symplectic structure. In this paper, we study a characteristic class called the Godbillon-Vey class for Jacobi manifolds with regular foliation and express it explicitly in terms of Jacobi structures.</description>

      <title>Kontsevich graphs act on Nambu--Poisson brackets, IV. When the invisible becomes crucial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kontsevich's graphs allow encoding multi-vectors whose coefficients are differential-polynomial in the coefficients of a given Poisson bracket on an affine real manifold. Encoding formulas by directed graphs adapts to the class of Nambu-determinant Poisson brackets, yet the graph topology becomes dimension-specific. To inspect whether a given Kontsevich graph cocycle $\gamma$ acts (non)trivially -- in the second Poisson cohomology -- on the space of Nambu brackets, taking a vector field solution $\smash{\vec{X}^\gamma_d}$ from dimension $d$ does not work in $d+1$. For $2 \leqslant d \leqslant 4$, the action of tetrahedron $\gamma_3$ on Nambu brackets is known to be a Poisson coboundary, $\dot{P} = [[ P,\smash{\vec{X}^{\gamma_3}_d} (P)]]$. We explore which minimal (sub)sets of graphs, encoding (non)vanishing objects over $\mathbb{R}^d_{\text{aff}}$, generate the topological data that suffice for a solution $\smash{\vec{X}^{\gamma_3}_{d+1}}$ to appear. We detect that there can be no solution in higher dimension without invisible graphs that vanish as formulas in $d=3$, but whose descendants do not all vanish over $d=4$.</description>
