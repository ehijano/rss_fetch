      <title>Breaking the north-south symmetry: dyonic spinning black holes with synchronized gauged scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stationary clouds of a gauged, complex scalar field on a magnetically (and possibly electrically as well) charged Kerr-Newman black hole (BH). The existence of a magnetic charge $Q_m$ promotes a north-south $\textit{asymmetry}$ of the scalar clouds. This breakdown of the clouds' $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry carries through to the spacetime $\textit{geometry}$ for the non-linear continuation of the clouds: a family of magnetically charged (or dyonic) BHs with synchronized gauged scalar hair, which we construct. Their distinct phenomenology is illustrated by their imaging, exhibiting skewed shadows and lensing. Such hairy BHs could, in principle, result from the superradiant instability of magnetically charged Kerr-Newman BHs, unveiling a dynamical mechanism for creating north-south asymmetric BHs from standard $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric electrovacuum BHs.</description>

      <title>Self-Gravity Effects of Ultralight Boson Clouds Formed by Black Hole Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillating clouds of ultralight bosons can grow around spinning black holes through superradiance, extracting energy and angular momentum, and eventually dissipating through gravitational radiation. Gravitational wave detectors like LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and LISA can thus probe the existence of ultralight bosons. In this study, we use fully general-relativistic solutions of the black hole-boson cloud systems to study the self-gravity effects of scalar and vector boson clouds, making only the simplifying assumption that the spacetime is axisymmetric (essentially corresponding to taking an oscillation average). We calculate the self-gravity shift in the cloud oscillation frequency, which determines the frequency evolution of the gravitational wave signal, finding that this effect can be up to twice as large in the relativistic regime compared to non-relativistic estimates. We use this to improve the superrad waveform model, and estimate that this reduces the theoretical phase error to a few cycles over the characteristic timescale of the gravitational wave emission timescale for the louder vector boson signals. We also perform an analysis of the spacetime geometry of these systems, calculating how the cloud changes the innermost stable circular orbit and light-ring around the black hole.</description>

      <title>Analysing one- and two-bit data to reduce memory requirements for F-statistic-based gravitational wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for continuous-wave gravitational radiation in data collected by modern long-baseline interferometers, such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), the Virgo interferometer and the Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector (KAGRA), can be memory intensive. A digitisation scheme is described that reduces the 64-bit interferometer output to a one- or two-bit data stream while minimising distortion and achieving considerable reduction in storage and input/output cost. For the representative example of the coherent, maximum-likelihood matched filter known as the F-statistic, it is found using Monte-Carlo simulations that the injected signal only needs to be ~24 per cent stronger (for one-bit data) and ~6.4 per cent stronger (for two bit data with optimal thresholds) than a 64-bit signal in order to be detected with 90 per cent probability in Gaussian noise. The foregoing percentages do not change significantly when the signal frequency decreases secularly, or when the noise statistics are not Gaussian, as verified with LIGO Science Run 6 data.</description>

      <title>Lorentz violation alleviates gravitationally induced entanglement degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz violation is a significant phenomenon in the framework of quantum physics, with implications for fundamental symmetries. In this paper, we explore the effects of Lorentz violation on quantum entanglement through a black hole spacetime that is coupled with a Lorentz-violating field. We establish the relationship between the Hartle-Hawking vacuum state and the Boulware number states for this case, and employ the near horizon approximation in an appropriate form to rewrite the black hole metric into a Rindler-like form. Subsequently, using this revised metric, the analytical forms of logarithmic negativity and mutual information are derived and plotted as functions of Rob's distance from the $ r=0 $ point. Based on the results, we find that the coupling between spacetime and the Lorentz-violating vector field alleviates gravity-induced entanglement degradation. At high mode frequencies, the effects of Lorentz violation are negligible, but they become significant at low frequencies. This suggests that investigating Lorentz violation at astrophysical scales requires low-frequency detectors, as the low energy of these fields enhances the significance of the Lorentz-violating field's non-zero vacuum expectation value.</description>

      <title>Millilensing induced systematic biases in parameterized tests of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tests of general relativity (GR) can be systematically biased when our waveform models are inaccurate. We here study systematic biases in tests of general relativity induced by neglecting lensing effects for millilensed gravitational-wave signals, where the lens mass is typically in the $10^3M_\odot$--$10^5M_\odot$ range. In particular, we use a nested-sampling Bayesian parameter estimation and model selection analysis of a millilensed signal with an unlensed parameterized post-Einsteinian (ppE) recovery model. We find that the ppE model is significantly biased toward a detection of a deviation from general relativity at signal-to-noise ratios of 30 and higher, especially when the source is aligned with the lens mass (the lensing effect is pronounced) and when its total mass is low (the signal duration is long). We use a toy model and the linear signal and Laplace approximations to provide a semi-analytic explanation for the trends in the systematic errors found in the nested sampling analysis. Moreover, a Bayes factor analysis reveals that the (unlensed) ppE model is weakly favored over the (unlensed) GR model, and a fitting factor study shows there is a significant loss of signal-to-noise ratio when using the (unlensed) ppE model. This implies that although a parameter estimation study may incorrectly infer a deviation from general relativity, a residual signal-to-noise ratio test would reveal that the ppE model is not a good fit to the data. Thus, with current detectors, millilensing-induced systematic biases are unlikely to result in false positive detections of GR deviations.</description>

      <title>Merging L-shaped resonator with Michelson configuration for kilohertz gravitational-wave detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of gravitational waves in kilohertz frequency range is crucial for understanding the physical processes of binary neutron star mergers. In Ref. [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 13}, 021019 (2023)], a new interferometric configuration has been proposed, employing an L-shaped optical resonant cavity as arm cavity. This alteration enhances the detector's response to kHz signals. However, the departure from conventional Michelson configuration necessitates a redesign of its sensing and control scheme, which is currently under study. In this article, we propose replacing linear arm cavities in the conventional Michelson by the L-shaped resonator. This hybrid configuration features an enhanced response at kHz while retaining the same sensing and control scheme as the Michelson setup. At the conceptual level, it exhibits higher sensitivity in the 2-4 kHz range compared to existing configurations.</description>

      <title>Isothermal spheres from grand partition functions in nonextensive statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically study isothermal spheres in the light of nonextensive statistical mechanics. The equations for the isothermal spheres are derived from the grand partition function of the gravitating particle system in the Tsallis statistical mechanics. The effect of nonextensive statistics appears in relatively dense state, which appears at the center of the isothermal sphere. The stability of the isothermal sphere in the general relativistic system is found to be sensitive to the parameter q in the Tsallis statistics.</description>

      <title>Linear Stability of Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter spacetimes III: Quasimodes and sharp decay of gravitational perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this last part of the series we prove that the slow (inverse logarithmic) decay in time of solutions to the linearised Einstein equations on Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter backgrounds obtained in~\cite{Gra.Hol24,Gra.Hol24a} is in fact optimal by constructing quasimode solutions for the Teukolsky system. The main difficulties compared with the case of the scalar wave equation treated in earlier works arise from the first order terms in the Teukolsky equation, the coupling of the Teukolsky quantities at the conformal boundary and ensuring that the relevant quasimode solutions satisfy the Teukolsky-Starobinsky relations. The proof invokes a quasimode construction for the corresponding Regge-Wheeler system (which can be fully decoupled at the expense of a higher order boundary condition) and a reverse Chandrasekhar transformation which generates solutions of the Teukolsky system from solutions of the Regge-Wheeler system. Finally, we provide a general discussion of the well-posedness theory for the higher order boundary conditions that typically appear in the process of decoupling.</description>

      <title>Boson stars and black holes with (complex and) real scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss boson stars and black holes with scalar hair in a model where the complex scalar field forming the boson star and the hair on the black hole, respectively, interacts with a real scalar field via a H\'enon-Heiles-type potential. We demonstrate that black holes and boson stars carrying only a real scalar field with cubic self-interaction are possible and that black holes with both real and complex scalar field branch off from these solutions for sufficiently large interaction between the two fields and/or sufficiently large horizon radius $r_h$. The latter possess lower mass for the same choice of coupling constants than the former, however seem to be thermodynamically preferred only for high enough temperature.</description>

      <title>Cosmic inflation in metric-affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of metric-affine gravity theories, where the metric and connection are independent, we examine actions involving quadratic terms in the Ricci scalar curvature and the Holst invariant. These actions are non-minimally coupled to a scalar field. We explore the behavior of the corresponding effective metric theory, which includes an extra dynamic pseudoscalar degree of freedom. Detailed analysis of inflationary predictions reveals compliance with recent observations across various parameters, potentially allowing a higher tensor-to-scalar ratio. The spectral index's direction of change varies based on parameter positioning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Worldtube excision is a method of reducing computational burden in Numerical Relativity simulations of binary black holes in situations where there is a good analytical model of the geometry around (one or both of) the objects. Two such scenarios of relevance in gravitational-wave astronomy are (1) the case of mass-disparate systems, and (2) the early inspiral when the separation is still large. Here we illustrate the utility and flexibility of this technique with simulations of the fully self-consistent radiative evolution in the model problem of a scalar charge orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole under the effect of scalar-field radiation reaction. We explore a range of orbital configurations, including inspirals with large eccentricity (which we follow through to the final plunge and ringdown) and hyperbolic scattering.</description>

      <title>Foreground signals minimally affect inference of high-mass binary black holes in next generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave observatories are expected to detect over a thousand compact binary coalescence signals daily, with some lasting from minutes to hours. Consequently, multiple signals will overlap in the time-frequency plane, generating a "foreground noise" that predominantly affects the low-frequency range, where binary neutron star inspiral evolution is gradual. This study investigates the impact of such foreground noise on parameter estimation for short-duration binary black hole signals, particularly those with high detector-frame masses and/or located at large redshifts. Our results show a reduction in detection sensitivity by approximately 25\% when the noise power spectrum deviates by up to 50\% from Gaussian noise due to foreground contamination. Despite this, using standard parameter estimation techniques without subtracting overlapping signals, we find that foreground noise has minimal impact, primarily affecting precision. These findings suggest that even in the presence of substantial foreground noise, global-fit techniques, and/or signal subtraction will not be necessary, as accurate recovery of system parameters is achievable with minimal loss in precision.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity with purely virtual particles from asymptotically local quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the local limits of various classes of unitary, nonlocal quantum field theories. While it is easy to build nonlocal models with well-behaved asymptotics in Euclidean space, the Minkowskian correlation functions typically exhibit singular behaviors. We introduce "asymptotically local" quantum field theory (AL-QFT) as the class that encompasses unitary, nonlocal theories with well-defined local limits in Minkowski spacetime. The target models cannot propagate ghosts, but are allowed to contain purely virtual particles (PVPs). In the bubble diagram, the nonlocal deformation generates PVPs straightforwardly. In the triangle diagram, it does so possibly up to multi-threshold corrections, which may be adjusted by tuning the deformation itself. We build examples of AL-QFTs, including a deformation of quantum gravity with purely virtual particles. AL-QFT can serve various purposes, such as suggesting innovative approaches to off-shell physics, providing an alternative formulation for theories with PVPs, or smoothing out nonanalytic behaviors. We discuss its inherent arbitrariness and the implications for renormalizability.</description>

      <title>Hyper-Hermitian Weyl Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-dual double copy is further explored. In previous work, it has been shown that Hyper-Hermitian manifolds also have associated the self-dual gauge theories via Kerr-Schild double copy. The self-dual double copy is generalized in the structure of the kinematic algebra by changing the area-preserving diffeomorphisms algebra by the diffeomorphisms on a surface algebra. This gave rise to the hyper-Hermitian double copy in the Kerr-Schild approach. In the present article, we further study the hyper-Hermitian case using the Weyl double copy formalism. In particular, we have found solutions within this formalism for different hyper-Hermitian metrics. One of the main features is that there will be two Maxwell spinors and one of them is source-free and the other has a source current. This is compatible with the fact that in general the hyper-Hermitian spaces are not Ricci-flat.</description>

      <title>The evolution of two-point correlation function of galaxies with a twin-peak initial power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution equation of two-point correlation function $\xi$ of galaxies can analytically describe the large scale structure of the galaxy distribution, and the solution depends also upon the initial condition. The primeval spectrum of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) contains multi peaks that survived the Silk damping, and, as a relevant portion, two peaks of the primeval BAO spectrum fall into the range of current galaxy surveys. Incorporating this portion, we use a twin-peak initial power spectrum of the galaxies, and obtain the evolution solution from a redshift $z=8$ to $z=0$ in the Gaussian approximation. The outcome $\xi(r)$ at $z=0.6$ still exhibits the 100 Mpc periodic bumps as observed by the WiggleZ survey, a feature largely determined by the Jeans length $\lambda_J$ in the equation. In particular, due to the superposition of the twin peaks in the initial condition, $\xi(r)$ shows a shallow trough at $\sim 70 h^{-1}$Mpc and a deep trough at $\sim 140 h^{-1}$Mpc, agreeing with the observational data, much better than our previous work that used a simple one-peak initial spectrum.</description>

      <title>Detection of Dark Matter using levitated nanoparticles within a Bessel-Gaussian beam via Yukawa coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel experimental approach to detect dark matter by probing Yukawa interactions, commonly referred to as a fifth force, between dark matter and baryonic matter. Our method involves optically levitating nanoparticles within a Bessel-Gaussian beam to detect minute forces exerted by potential dark matter interaction with test masses. The non-diffracting properties of Bessel-Gaussian beams, combined with feedback cooling techniques, provide exceptional sensitivity to small perturbations in the motion of the nanoparticles. This setup allows for precise control over trapping conditions and enhances the detection sensitivity to forces on the order of \(10^{-18}\) N. We explore the parameter space of the Yukawa interaction, focusing on the coupling strength (\(\alpha\)) and interaction range (\(\lambda\)), and discuss the potential of this experiment to place new constraints on dark matter couplings, complementing existing direct detection methods.</description>

      <title>Steepest Growth in the Primordial Power Spectrum from Excited States at a Sudden Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sudden phase transitions during inflation can give rise to strongly enhanced primordial density perturbations on scales much smaller than those directly probed by cosmic microwave background anisotropies. In this paper, we study the effect of the incoming quantum state on the steepest growth found in the primordial power spectrum using a simple model of an instantaneous transition during single-field inflation. We consider the case of a general de Sitter-invariant initial state for the inflaton field (the $\alpha$-vacuum), and also an incoming state perturbed by a preceding transition. For the $\alpha$-vacua we find that $k^6$ growth is possible for $\alpha&gt;0$, while $k^4$ growth is seen for $\alpha\leq0$, including the standard case of an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum state. The features of an enhanced primordial power spectrum on small scales are thus sensitive to the initial quantum state during inflation. We calculate the scalar-induced gravitational wave power spectrum for each case.</description>

      <title>Induced current in high-dimensional AdS bulk in the presence of a cosmic string and brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the vacuum bosonic current associated with a massive charged scalar field propagating in a $(D+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) bulk in the presence of an idealized carrying-magnetic-flux cosmic string and also a brane. We assume that the string is perpendicular to the brane which is parallel to the AdS boundary.
  The brane divides the space in two regions with different properties of vacuum states. We investigate the only non-vanishing azimuthal components of the induced currents in both regions. To develop this analysis we calculate first, for both regions, the positive frequency Wightman functions. These present contributions associated with the presence of a cosmic string only plus the other induced by the brane. In this talk we consider only the contributions induced by the brane.</description>

      <title>Testing Whether Gravity Acts as a Quantum Entity When Measured</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08133v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A defining signature of classical systems is "in principle measurability" without disturbance: a feature manifestly violated by quantum systems. We describe a multi-interferometer experimental setup that can, in principle, reveal the nonclassicality of a spatial superposition-sourced gravitational field if an irreducible disturbance is caused by a measurement of gravity. While one interferometer sources the field, the others are used to measure the gravitational field created by the superposition. This requires neither any specific form of nonclassical gravity, nor the generation of entanglement between any relevant degrees of freedom at any stage, thus distinguishing it from the experiments proposed so far. This test, when added to the recent entanglement-witness based proposals, enlarges the domain of quantum postulates being tested for gravity. Moreover, the proposed test yields a signature of quantum measurement induced disturbance for any finite rate of decoherence, and is device independent.</description>

      <title>Are nonrelativistic ground state $\ell$-boson stars only stable for $\ell=0$ and $\ell=1$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work we analyzed the linear stability of non-relativistic $\ell$-boson stars with respect to radial modes and showed that ground state configurations are stable with respect to these modes, whereas excited states are unstable. In this work we extend the analysis to non-spherical linear mode perturbations. To this purpose, we expand the wave function in terms of tensor spherical harmonics which allows us to decouple the perturbation equations into a family of radial problems. By using a combination of analytic and numerical methods, we show that ground state configurations with $\ell &gt; 1$ possess exponentially in time growing non-radial modes, whereas only oscillating modes are found for $\ell=0$ and $\ell=1$. This leads us to conjecture that nonrelativistic $\ell$-boson stars in their ground state are stable for $\ell=1$ as well as $\ell=0$, while ground state and excited configurations with $\ell &gt; 1$ are unstable.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Magnus effect from scalar dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In fluid dynamics, the Magnus effect is the force perpendicular to the motion of a spinning object as it moves through a medium. In general relativity, an analogous effect exists for a spinning compact object moving through matter, purely as a result of gravitational interactions. In this work we consider a Kerr black hole moving at relativistic velocities through scalar dark matter that is at rest. We simulate the system numerically and extract the total spin-curvature force on the black hole perpendicular to its motion. We confirm that the force scales linearly with the dimensionless spin parameter $a/M$ of the black hole up to $a/M = 0.99$, and measure its dependence on the speed $v$ of the black hole in the range $0.1 \le v \le 0.55$ for a fixed spin. Compared to previous analytic work applicable at small $v$, higher-order corrections in the velocity are found to be important: the total force is nonzero, and the dependence is not linear in $v$. We find that in all cases the total force is in the opposite direction to the hydrodynamical analogue, although at low speeds it appears to approach the expectation that the Weyl and Magnus components cancel. Spin-curvature effects may leave an imprint on gravitational wave signals from extreme mass-ratio inspirals, where the secondary black hole has a nonnegligible spin and moves in the presence of a dark matter cloud. We hope that our simulations can be used to support and extend the limits of analytic results, which are necessary to better quantify such effects in the relativistic regime.</description>

      <title>Charged Black Holes from Interacting Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper charged black holes are obtained assuming that a Born-Infeld electrodynamics may arise from an interaction between the electromagnetic field and a vacuum component. In this context Cauchy horizons do not appear in the maximal analytical extension once an event horizon is formed so that the interior spacetime does not suffer from any sort of instabilities which are well known in the literature. On the contrary, the causal structure exhibits an event horizon -- encapsulating a spacelike singularity -- and a cosmological horizon. We show that the strong cosmic censorship is then restored for a wide range of the parameters including configurations in which the black hole charge is much larger than its mass. We also show that the black hole thus formed described by our solution exhibits an unstable photon sphere analogous to that of the Schwarzschild metric.</description>

      <title>Projected gravitational wave constraints on primordial black hole abundance for extended mass distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the projected minimum constraints set by next-generation gravitational wave detectors Einstein Telescope and LISA on the abundance of primordial black holes relative to dark matter from both resolvable mergers and the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) for extended primordial black hole mass distributions. We consider broad power law distributions for a range of negative and positive exponents $\gamma$ and top-hat distributions (with $\gamma=0$) and use the IMRPhenomXAS waveforms to simulate binary sources up to mass ratios $q_\mathrm{max} = 1000$ and redshifts $z=300$. Our results suggest that accounting for extended mass distributions have the most apparent impact when considering mergers at high redshifts $z &gt; 30$, for which the constraint curves have broader mass windows and shift to higher abundances compared to when a monochromatic distribution is assumed; on the other hand, constraints from low-redshift mergers and the SGWB do not change much with the assumed mass distribution. At high redshifts, astrophysical black holes are not expected to contribute significantly, providing possible smoking-gun evidence for PBHs. Constraints derived from LISA and ET observations would complement each other by probing different PBH mass windows and this holds for the extended mass distributions studied.</description>

      <title>Event Horizon Telescope observations exclude compact objects in baseline mimetic gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mimetic gravity has gained significant appeal in cosmological contexts, but static spherically symmetric space-times within the baseline theory are highly non-trivial: the two natural solutions are a naked singularity and a black hole space-time obtained through an appropriate gluing procedure. We study the shadow properties of these two objects, finding both to be pathological. In particular, the naked singularity does not cast a shadow, whereas the black hole casts a shadow which is too small. We argue that the Event Horizon Telescope images of M87$^{\star}$ and Sgr A$^{\star}$ rule out the baseline version of mimetic gravity, preventing the theory from successfully accounting for the dark sector on cosmological scales. Our results highlight an interesting complementarity between black hole imaging observations and modified gravity theories of cosmological interest.</description>

      <title>Spin-induced Scalar Clouds around Kerr-Newman Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that a scalar field non-minimally coupled to the electromagnetic field can experience a spin-induced tachyonic instability near Kerr-Newman black holes, potentially driving the formation of scalar clouds. In this paper, we construct such scalar clouds for both fundamental and excited modes, detailing their existence domains and wave functions. Our results indicate that a sufficiently strong coupling between the scalar and electromagnetic fields is essential for sustaining scalar clouds. Within the strong coupling regime, black holes that rotate either too slowly or too rapidly are unable to support scalar clouds. Furthermore, we observe that scalar cloud wave functions are concentrated near the black hole's poles. These findings provide a foundation for future investigations of spin-induced scalarized Kerr-Newman black holes.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the impact of the phantom field (or anti-Maxwell field) on the structure of three-dimensional black holes in the presence of the cosmological constant, we present the first extraction of solutions for the phantom BTZ (A)dS black hole. In this study, we analyze the effect of the phantom field on the horizon structure. Furthermore, we compare the BTZ black holes in the presence of both the phantom and Maxwell fields. Additionally, we calculate the conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the phantom BTZ black holes, demonstrating their compliance with the first law of thermodynamics. Subsequently, we assess the effects of the electrical charge and the cosmological constant on the local stability in the canonical ensemble by considering these fields with respect to the heat capacity. We then investigate the global stability area of the BTZ black holes with phantom and Maxwell fields within the grand canonical ensemble using Gibbs free energy. In this analysis, we evaluate the influence of the electrical charge and the cosmological constant on this area.</description>

      <title>The shadow and observational images of the non-singular rotating black holes in loop quantum gravity</title>

Abstract: By considering the celestial light source and the thin disk source, we employ the backward ray-tracing method to carefully study the shadow, inner shadow and observational images of the non-singular rotating black holes in loop quantum gravity. The results show that the increase of quantum parameter $\lambda$ causes the shadow to shrink, while increases the deviation from circularity. And, the shadow's angular diameter of M87* impose stronger constraints on the observed properties of the no-singulgar rotating black holes by comparing with SgrA*. For a celestial light source, the parameter $\lambda$ indeed influences the distortion of light around black hole shadow, but this effect is relatively small and only becomes noticeable when extremely close to the shadow. When a thin accretion disk around black hole, it turns out that for an observer at any position, the parameter $\lambda$ has little effect on the shape of the inner shadow. However, it decreases the size of the inner shadow, reduces the observed light intensity, and narrows the redshifted shadow images, regardless of whether the accretion disk is prograde or retrograde. Meanwhile, it is true that the thin disk images of black hole cannot effectively reflect the internal structure of black hole. Finally, we can conclude that a key observational feature of these non-singular rotating black holes is that the larger the black hole's spin parameter, the smaller the upper limit of $\lambda'$s effect. And, the parameter $\lambda$ decreases the gravitational field's strength, thereby weakens the observed images. This could provide a possible way to constraining black hole parameters, identifying quantum gravity effects, and distinguishing loop quantum gravity black holes, even if it cannot be used to distinguish the non-singular properties of black hole.</description>

Abstract: Spin is one fundamental property of microscopic particles. A lot of theoretical work has postulated the possible coupling between spin and gravitation, which could result in the violation of equivalence principle. In our recent joint mass-and-energy test of the weak equivalence principle with a 10-meter $^{85}$Rb-$^{87}$Rb dual-species atom interferometer, the E${\rm \ddot{o}}$tv${\rm \ddot{o}}$s parameters of four $^{85}$Rb-$^{87}$Rb combinations with specific atomic spin states were measured to the $10^{-10}$-level (\textit{L. Zhou et al., Phys. Rev. A 104, 022822}). Here these experimental results are used to constrain the postulated spin-gravity coupling effects. The bounds on the spin-independent and spin-dependent anomalous passive gravitational mass tensors in L${\rm \ddot{a}}$mmerzahl's model are set to the $10^{-10}$-level, which improves existing bounds by three orders of magnitude. The constraints to the spin-independent electron- and proton-gravity coupling parameters in the gravitational standard-model extension are set to the $10^{-6}\, {\rm GeV}$-level.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational lensing is a crucial tool for exploring cosmic phenomena, providing insights into galaxy clustering, dark matter, and dark energy. Given the substantial computational demands of $N$-body simulations, approximate methods like $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ and $\texttt{turboGL}$ have been proposed as viable alternatives for simulating lensing probability density functions (PDFs). This paper evaluates these methods and their effectiveness across both weak and strong lensing regimes, with a focus in the context where baryonic effects are negligible. Our comparative analysis reveals that these methods are effective for applications where lensing is mild, such as the majority of sources of electromagnetic and gravitational waves. However, both $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ and $\texttt{turboGL}$ break down for large values of convergence and magnification due to their loss of accuracy in capturing small-scale nonlinear matter fields, owing to oversimplified assumptions about internal halo structures and reliance on perturbation theory. $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ yields second-to-fourth moments of the lensing PDFs, which are 6-10% smaller than those resulting from $N$-body simulations in regimes where baryonic effects are minimal. These findings aim to inform future studies on gravitational lensing of point sources, which are increasingly relevant with upcoming supernova and gravitational wave datasets.</description>

Abstract: We study the gauge theory formulation of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and propose Korteweg-de Vries asymptotic conditions that generalize the asymptotic dynamics of the theory. They permit to construct an enlarged set of boundary actions formed by higher order generalizations of the Schwarzian derivative that contain the Schwarzian as lower term in a tower of SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$ invariants. They are extracted from the KdV Hamiltonians and can be obtained recursively. As a result, the conformal symmetry breaking observed in nearly AdS$_{2}$ is characterized by a much larger set of dynamical modes associated to the stationary KdV hierarchy. We study quantum perturbation theory for the generalized Schwarzian action including the symplectic measure and compute the one-loop correction to the partition function. We find that despite the non-linear nature of the higher-Schwarzian contribution, it acquires a manageable expression that renders a curious leading temperature dependence on the entropy $S=\#T^{a}$ for $a$ an odd integer.</description>

      <title>Accretion Efficiency Evolution of Central Supermassive Black Holes in Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ongoing debate regarding the most accurate accretion model for supermassive black holes at the center of quasars has remained a contentious issue in astrophysics. One significant challenge is the variation in calculated accretion efficiency, with values exceeding the standard range of $0.038 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 0.42$. This discrepancy is especially pronounced in high redshift supermassive black holes, necessitating the development of a comprehensive model that can address the accretion efficiency for supermassive black holes in both the low and high redshift ranges. The selection effect was removed from model construction by creating a flux- and volume-limited sample, as the range of values for estimating the accretion efficiency factor varied through different redshifts. In this study, we have focused on low redshift ($z &lt; 0.5$) Palomar-Green quasars (79 quasars) and high redshift ($z \geq 3$) quasars with standard disks from the flux- and volume-limited QUOTAS+QuasarNET dataset (75 quasars) to establish a model for accretion efficiency. By considering the QUOTAS+QuasarNET+DL11 dataset, a peak can be seen around $z \sim 2.708$, and it seems to be related to the peak of the star formation rate ($1 &lt; z_{SFR} &lt; 3$). Consequently, the observed maximum and minimum values of accretion efficiency in standard disks, through the considered bond (3$\sigma$), display a significantly wider range than previously noted and differentiate over time. In redshifts higher than 2.708, the accretion efficiency shows patterns of increase as redshift decreases, while in redshifts lower than 2.708, accretion efficiency is seen to decrease with reducing redshift. This result can potentially lead to a more accurate correlation between the star formation rate in quasars and their relationship with the mass of the central supermassive black holes with a more comprehensive disk model in future studies.</description>

      <title>Some Lower Dimensional Quantum Field Theories Reduced from Chern-Simons Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study symmetry reductions in the context of Euclidean Chern-Simons gauge theories to obtain lower dimensional field theories. Symmetry reduction in certain gauge theories is a common tool for obtaining explicit soliton solutions. Although pure Chern-Simons theories do not admit solitonic solutions, symmetry reduction still leads to interesting results. We establish relations at the semiclassical regime between pure Chern-Simons theories on $S^3$ and the reduced Quantum Field Theories, based on actions obtained by the symmetry reduction of the Chern-Simons action, spherical symmetry being the prominent one. We also discuss symmetry reductions of Chern-Simons theories on the disk, yielding $BF$-theory in two dimensions, which signals a curious relationship between symmetry reductions and the boundary conformal field theories. Finally, we study the Chern-Simons-Higgs instantons and show that under certain circumstances, the reduced action can formally be viewed as the action of a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. We discuss the extent to which the reduced actions have a fermionic nature at the level of the partition function.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional (bi-)scalar gravities from four-dimensional Horndeski</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a classical two-dimensional bi-scalar gravity based on the Kaluza-Klein reduction applied to the four-dimensional Horndeski theory. One of the scalar fields arises from the original four-dimensional theory, while the extra scalar emerges from the reduction process. We also introduce a two-dimensional bi-scalar identity that allows for a more concise and elegant reformulation of the resulting bi-scalar Lagrangian. Additionally, we study the linear perturbations around a static background to demonstrate that the bi-scalar theory may support a single healthy propagating mode. Furthermore, by restricting the scalar fields, we investigate a general single scalar theory that is identical to the two-dimensional Horndeski theory up to a boundary term. Our results provide a framework to map a generic two-dimensional dilaton gravity into four-dimensional Horndeski theory.</description>

      <title>Weyl gauge invariant DBI action in conformal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the analogue of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action in Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions and obtain a general theory of gravity with Weyl gauge symmetry of dilatations (Weyl-DBI). This is done in the {\it Weyl gauge covariant} formulation of conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions, suitable for a gauge theory, which renders this geometry {\it metric}. The Weyl-DBI action has the same gauge invariant expression with {\it dimensionless} couplings in any dimension $d$, so it has no need of a UV regulator (be it an additional field, higher derivative operator or DR subtraction scale) for which reason we argue it is Weyl-anomaly free. For $d=4$, the leading order of a series expansion of the Weyl-DBI action recovers exactly the gauge invariant Weyl quadratic gravity action associated to this geometry, that is Weyl anomaly-free; this is broken spontaneously and Einstein-Hilbert gravity is recovered in the broken phase, with $\Lambda&gt;0$. The series expansion of Weyl-DBI action also contains additional terms of non-perturbative nature that can however be recovered by quantum corrections in Weyl quadratic gravity in $d=4$ in a gauge invariant (geometric) regularisation automatically provided by the Weyl-DBI action. If the Weyl gauge boson is not dynamical the Weyl-DBI action recovers in the leading order the conformal gravity action. All fields and scales are of {\it geometric origin}, with no added matter, scalar field compensators or UV regulators.</description>

      <title>A CMC existence result for expanding cosmological spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a new CMC (constant mean curvature) existence result for cosmological spacetimes, i.e., globally hyperbolic spacetimes with compact Cauchy surfaces satisfying the strong energy condition. If the spacetime contains an expanding Cauchy surface and is future timelike geodesically complete, then the spacetime contains a CMC Cauchy surface. This result settles, under certain circumstances, a conjecture of the authors and a conjecture of Dilts and Holst. Our proof relies on the construction of barriers in the support sense, and the CMC Cauchy surface is found as the asymptotic limit of mean curvature flow. Analogous results are also obtained in the case of a positive cosmological constant $\Lambda &gt; 0$. Lastly, we include some comments concerning the future causal boundary for cosmological spacetimes which pertain to the CMC conjecture of the authors.</description>
