      <title>Recurrent Neural Goodness-of-Fit Test for Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series data are crucial across diverse domains such as finance and healthcare, where accurate forecasting and decision-making rely on advanced modeling techniques. While generative models have shown great promise in capturing the intricate dynamics inherent in time series, evaluating their performance remains a major challenge. Traditional evaluation metrics fall short due to the temporal dependencies and potential high dimensionality of the features. In this paper, we propose the REcurrent NeurAL (RENAL) Goodness-of-Fit test, a novel and statistically rigorous framework for evaluating generative time series models. By leveraging recurrent neural networks, we transform the time series into conditionally independent data pairs, enabling the application of a chi-square-based goodness-of-fit test to the temporal dependencies within the data. This approach offers a robust, theoretically grounded solution for assessing the quality of generative models, particularly in settings with limited time sequences. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method across both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods in terms of reliability and accuracy. Our method fills a critical gap in the evaluation of time series generative models, offering a tool that is both practical and adaptable to high-stakes applications.</description>

      <title>Tensor Decomposition with Unaligned Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a canonical polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition that addresses unaligned observations. The mode with unaligned observations is represented using functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). We introduce a versatile loss function that effectively accounts for various types of data, including binary, integer-valued, and positive-valued types. Additionally, we propose an optimization algorithm for computing tensor decompositions with unaligned observations, along with a stochastic gradient method to enhance computational efficiency. A sketching algorithm is also introduced to further improve efficiency when using the $\ell_2$ loss function. To demonstrate the efficacy of our methods, we provide illustrative examples using both synthetic data and an early childhood human microbiome dataset.</description>

      <title>Feedback Schr{\"o}dinger Bridge Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion bridges for distribution transport problems have heavily relied on matching frameworks, yet existing methods often face a trade-off between scalability and access to optimal pairings during training. Fully unsupervised methods make minimal assumptions but incur high computational costs, limiting their practicality. On the other hand, imposing full supervision of the matching process with optimal pairings improves scalability, however, it can be infeasible in many applications. To strike a balance between scalability and minimal supervision, we introduce Feedback Schr\"{o}dinger Bridge Matching (FSBM), a novel semi-supervised matching framework that incorporates a small portion (less than 8% of the entire dataset) of pre-aligned pairs as state feedback to guide the transport map of non coupled samples, thereby significantly improving efficiency. This is achieved by formulating a static Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem with an additional term capturing the semi-supervised guidance. The generalized EOT objective is then recast into a dynamic formulation to leverage the scalability of matching frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FSBM accelerates training and enhances generalization by leveraging coupled pairs guidance, opening new avenues for training matching frameworks with partially aligned datasets.</description>

      <title>Gradual Domain Adaptation via Manifold-Constrained Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to address the challenge of gradual domain adaptation within a class of manifold-constrained data distributions. In particular, we consider a sequence of $T\ge2$ data distributions $P_1,\ldots,P_T$ undergoing a gradual shift, where each pair of consecutive measures $P_i,P_{i+1}$ are close to each other in Wasserstein distance. We have a supervised dataset of size $n$ sampled from $P_0$, while for the subsequent distributions in the sequence, only unlabeled i.i.d. samples are available. Moreover, we assume that all distributions exhibit a known favorable attribute, such as (but not limited to) having intra-class soft/hard margins. In this context, we propose a methodology rooted in Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) with an adaptive Wasserstein radius. We theoretically show that this method guarantees the classification error across all $P_i$s can be suitably bounded. Our bounds rely on a newly introduced {\it {compatibility}} measure, which fully characterizes the error propagation dynamics along the sequence. Specifically, for inadequately constrained distributions, the error can exponentially escalate as we progress through the gradual shifts. Conversely, for appropriately constrained distributions, the error can be demonstrated to be linear or even entirely eradicated. We have substantiated our theoretical findings through several experimental results.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Machine Learning Approach for Adapting Reduced-Order Models using Projected Gaussian Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) computes the optimal basis modes that span a low-dimensional subspace where the Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) reside. Because a governing equation is often parameterized by a set of parameters, challenges immediately arise when one would like to investigate how systems behave differently over the parameter space (in design, control, uncertainty quantification and real-time operations). In this case, the POD basis needs to be updated so as to adapt ROM that accurately captures the variation of a system's behavior over its parameter space. This paper proposes a Projected Gaussian Process (pGP) and formulate the problem of adapting POD basis as a supervised statistical learning problem, for which the goal is to learn a mapping from the parameter space to the Grassmann Manifold that contains the optimal vector subspaces. A mapping is firstly found between the Euclidean space and the horizontal space of an orthogonal matrix that spans a reference subspace in the Grassmann Manifold. Then, a second mapping from the horizontal space to the Grassmann Manifold is established through the Exponential/Logarithm maps between the manifold and its tangent space. Finally, given a new parameter, the conditional distribution of a vector can be found in the Euclidean space using the Gaussian Process (GP) regression, and such a distribution is projected to the Grassmann Manifold that yields the optimal subspace for the new parameter. The proposed statistical learning approach allows us to optimally estimate model parameters given data (i.e., the prediction/interpolation becomes problem-specific), and quantify the uncertainty associated with the prediction. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed pGP for adapting POD basis against parameter changes.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Causal Effects of T Cell Receptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central question in human immunology is how a patient's repertoire of T cells impacts disease. Here, we introduce a method to infer the causal effects of T cell receptor (TCR) sequences on patient outcomes using observational TCR repertoire sequencing data and clinical outcomes data. Our approach corrects for unobserved confounders, such as a patient's environment and life history, by using the patient's immature, pre-selection TCR repertoire. The pre-selection repertoire can be estimated from nonproductive TCR data, which is widely available. It is generated by a randomized mutational process, V(D)J recombination, which provides a natural experiment. We show formally how to use the pre-selection repertoire to draw causal inferences, and develop a scalable neural-network estimator for our identification formula. Our method produces an estimate of the effect of interventions that add a specific TCR sequence to patient repertoires. As a demonstration, we use it to analyze the effects of TCRs on COVID-19 severity, uncovering potentially therapeutic TCRs that are (1) observed in patients, (2) bind SARS-CoV-2 antigens in vitro and (3) have strong positive effects on clinical outcomes.</description>

      <title>Provable In-context Learning for Mixture of Linear Regressions using Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the in-context learning capabilities of transformers in the context of learning mixtures of linear regression models. For the case of two mixtures, we demonstrate the existence of transformers that can achieve an accuracy, relative to the oracle predictor, of order $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}((d/n)^{1/4})$ in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{d/n})$ in the high SNR regime, where $n$ is the length of the prompt, and $d$ is the dimension of the problem. Additionally, we derive in-context excess risk bounds of order $\mathcal{O}(L/\sqrt{B})$, where $B$ denotes the number of (training) prompts, and $L$ represents the number of attention layers. The order of $L$ depends on whether the SNR is low or high. In the high SNR regime, we extend the results to $K$-component mixture models for finite $K$. Extensive simulations also highlight the advantages of transformers for this task, outperforming other baselines such as the Expectation-Maximization algorithm.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of Clustered Federated Learning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over recent years, Federated Learning (FL) has proven to be one of the most promising methods of distributed learning which preserves data privacy. As the method evolved and was confronted to various real-world scenarios, new challenges have emerged. One such challenge is the presence of highly heterogeneous (often referred as non-IID) data distributions among participants of the FL protocol. A popular solution to this hurdle is Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), which aims to partition clients into groups where the distribution are homogeneous. In the literature, state-of-the-art CFL algorithms are often tested using a few cases of data heterogeneities, without systematically justifying the choices. Further, the taxonomy used for differentiating the different heterogeneity scenarios is not always straightforward. In this paper, we explore the performance of two state-of-theart CFL algorithms with respect to a proposed taxonomy of data heterogeneities in federated learning (FL). We work with three image classification datasets and analyze the resulting clusters against the heterogeneity classes using extrinsic clustering metrics. Our objective is to provide a clearer understanding of the relationship between CFL performances and data heterogeneity scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimizing importance weighting in the presence of sub-population shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distribution shift between the training and test data can severely harm performance of machine learning models. Importance weighting addresses this issue by assigning different weights to data points during training. We argue that existing heuristics for determining the weights are suboptimal, as they neglect the increase of the variance of the estimated model due to the finite sample size of the training data. We interpret the optimal weights in terms of a bias-variance trade-off, and propose a bi-level optimization procedure in which the weights and model parameters are optimized simultaneously. We apply this optimization to existing importance weighting techniques for last-layer retraining of deep neural networks in the presence of sub-population shifts and show empirically that optimizing weights significantly improves generalization performance.</description>

      <title>Spectral Representations for Accurate Causal Uncertainty Quantification with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification for causal effects is essential for robust decision making in complex systems, but remains challenging in non-parametric settings. One promising framework represents conditional distributions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and places Gaussian process priors on them to infer posteriors on causal effects, but requires restrictive nuclear dominant kernels and approximations that lead to unreliable uncertainty estimates. In this work, we introduce a method, IMPspec, that addresses these limitations via a spectral representation of the Hilbert space. We show that posteriors in this model can be obtained explicitly, by extending a result in Hilbert space regression theory. We also learn the spectral representation to optimise posterior calibration. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in uncertainty quantification and causal Bayesian optimisation across simulations and a healthcare application.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Semi-supervised Spectral Algorithm for Regression on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel diffusion-based spectral algorithm to tackle regression analysis on high-dimensional data, particularly data embedded within lower-dimensional manifolds. Traditional spectral algorithms often fall short in such contexts, primarily due to the reliance on predetermined kernel functions, which inadequately address the complex structures inherent in manifold-based data. By employing graph Laplacian approximation, our method uses the local estimation property of heat kernel, offering an adaptive, data-driven approach to overcome this obstacle. Another distinct advantage of our algorithm lies in its semi-supervised learning framework, enabling it to fully use the additional unlabeled data. This ability enhances the performance by allowing the algorithm to dig the spectrum and curvature of the data manifold, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the dataset. Moreover, our algorithm performs in an entirely data-driven manner, operating directly within the intrinsic manifold structure of the data, without requiring any predefined manifold information. We provide a convergence analysis of our algorithm. Our findings reveal that the algorithm achieves a convergence rate that depends solely on the intrinsic dimension of the underlying manifold, thereby avoiding the curse of dimensionality associated with the higher ambient dimension.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Change Detection for Unnormalized Pre- and Post-Change Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of detecting changes when only unnormalized pre- and post-change distributions are accessible. This situation happens in many scenarios in physics such as in ferromagnetism, crystallography, magneto-hydrodynamics, and thermodynamics, where the energy models are difficult to normalize.
  Our approach is based on the estimation of the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) statistics, which is known to produce optimal performance. We first present an intuitively appealing approximation method. Unfortunately, this produces a biased estimator of the CUSUM statistics and may cause performance degradation. We then propose the Log-Partition Approximation Cumulative Sum (LPA-CUSUM) algorithm based on thermodynamic integration (TI) in order to estimate the log-ratio of normalizing constants of pre- and post-change distributions. It is proved that this approach gives an unbiased estimate of the log-partition function and the CUSUM statistics, and leads to an asymptotically optimal performance. Moreover, we derive a relationship between the required sample size for thermodynamic integration and the desired detection delay performance, offering guidelines for practical parameter selection. Numerical studies are provided demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised contrastive learning performs non-linear system identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches have brought tremendous success across many tasks and domains. It has been argued that these successes can be attributed to a link between SSL and identifiable representation learning: Temporal structure and auxiliary variables ensure that latent representations are related to the true underlying generative factors of the data. Here, we deepen this connection and show that SSL can perform system identification in latent space. We propose DynCL, a framework to uncover linear, switching linear and non-linear dynamics under a non-linear observation model, give theoretical guarantees and validate them empirically.</description>

Abstract: By extending the extreme learning machine by additional control inputs, we achieved almost complete reproduction of bifurcation structures of dynamical systems. The learning ability of the proposed neural network system is striking in that the entire structure of the bifurcations of a target one-parameter family of dynamical systems can be nearly reproduced by training on transient dynamics using only a few parameter values. Moreover, we propose a mechanism to explain this remarkable learning ability and discuss the relationship between the present results and similar results obtained by Kim et al.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13914v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an importance sampling method for tractable and efficient estimation of counterfactual expressions in general settings, named Exogenous Matching. By minimizing a common upper bound of counterfactual estimators, we transform the variance minimization problem into a conditional distribution learning problem, enabling its integration with existing conditional distribution modeling approaches. We validate the theoretical results through experiments under various types and settings of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and demonstrate the outperformance on counterfactual estimation tasks compared to other existing importance sampling methods. We also explore the impact of injecting structural prior knowledge (counterfactual Markov boundaries) on the results. Finally, we apply this method to identifiable proxy SCMs and demonstrate the unbiasedness of the estimates, empirically illustrating the applicability of the method to practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Transcriptomics Foundation Models for Perturbation Analysis : one PCA still rules them all</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the relationships among genes, compounds, and their interactions in living organisms remains limited due to technological constraints and the complexity of biological data. Deep learning has shown promise in exploring these relationships using various data types. However, transcriptomics, which provides detailed insights into cellular states, is still underused due to its high noise levels and limited data availability. Recent advancements in transcriptomics sequencing provide new opportunities to uncover valuable insights, especially with the rise of many new foundation models for transcriptomics, yet no benchmark has been made to robustly evaluate the effectiveness of these rising models for perturbation analysis. This article presents a novel biologically motivated evaluation framework and a hierarchy of perturbation analysis tasks for comparing the performance of pretrained foundation models to each other and to more classical techniques of learning from transcriptomics data. We compile diverse public datasets from different sequencing techniques and cell lines to assess models performance. Our approach identifies scVI and PCA to be far better suited models for understanding biological perturbations in comparison to existing foundation models, especially in their application in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Generalization for Least Squares Regression With Simple Spiked Covariances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory has proven to be a valuable tool in analyzing the generalization of linear models. However, the generalization properties of even two-layer neural networks trained by gradient descent remain poorly understood. To understand the generalization performance of such networks, it is crucial to characterize the spectrum of the feature matrix at the hidden layer. Recent work has made progress in this direction by describing the spectrum after a single gradient step, revealing a spiked covariance structure. Yet, the generalization error for linear models with spiked covariances has not been previously determined. This paper addresses this gap by examining two simple models exhibiting spiked covariances. We derive their generalization error in the asymptotic proportional regime. Our analysis demonstrates that the eigenvector and eigenvalue corresponding to the spike significantly influence the generalization error.</description>

      <title>Auditing and Enforcing Conditional Fairness via Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional demographic parity (CDP) is a measure of the demographic parity of a predictive model or decision process when conditioning on an additional feature or set of features. Many algorithmic fairness techniques exist to target demographic parity, but CDP is much harder to achieve, particularly when the conditioning variable has many levels and/or when the model outputs are continuous. The problem of auditing and enforcing CDP is understudied in the literature. In light of this, we propose novel measures of {conditional demographic disparity (CDD)} which rely on statistical distances borrowed from the optimal transport literature. We further design and evaluate regularization-based approaches based on these CDD measures. Our methods, \fairbit{} and \fairlp{}, allow us to target CDP even when the conditioning variable has many levels. When model outputs are continuous, our methods target full equality of the conditional distributions, unlike other methods that only consider first moments or related proxy quantities. We validate the efficacy of our approaches on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Independently-Normalized SGD for Generalized-Smooth Nonconvex Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that many nonconvex machine learning problems meet a so-called generalized-smooth condition that extends beyond traditional smooth nonconvex optimization. However, the existing algorithms designed for generalized-smooth nonconvex optimization encounter significant limitations in both their design and convergence analysis. In this work, we first study deterministic generalized-smooth nonconvex optimization and analyze the convergence of normalized gradient descent under the generalized Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between gradient normalization and function geometry. Then, for stochastic generalized-smooth nonconvex optimization, we propose an independently-normalized stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which leverages independent sampling, gradient normalization and clipping to achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ sample complexity under relaxed assumptions. Experiments demonstrate the fast convergence of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparse PCA via Block-Diagonalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse Principal Component Analysis (Sparse PCA) is a pivotal tool in data analysis and dimensionality reduction. However, Sparse PCA is a challenging problem in both theory and practice: it is known to be NP-hard and current exact methods generally require exponential runtime. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to efficiently approximate Sparse PCA by (i) approximating the general input covariance matrix with a re-sorted block-diagonal matrix, (ii) solving the Sparse PCA sub-problem in each block, and (iii) reconstructing the solution to the original problem. Our framework is simple and powerful: it can leverage any off-the-shelf Sparse PCA algorithm and achieve significant computational speedups, with a minor additive error that is linear in the approximation error of the block-diagonal matrix. Suppose $g(k, d)$ is the runtime of an algorithm (approximately) solving Sparse PCA in dimension $d$ and with sparsity value $k$. Our framework, when integrated with this algorithm, reduces the runtime to $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{d}{d^\star} \cdot g(k, d^\star) + d^2\right)$, where $d^\star \leq d$ is the largest block size of the block-diagonal matrix. For instance, integrating our framework with the Branch-and-Bound algorithm reduces the complexity from $g(k, d) = \mathcal{O}(k^3\cdot d^k)$ to $\mathcal{O}(k^3\cdot d \cdot (d^\star)^{k-1})$, demonstrating exponential speedups if $d^\star$ is small. We perform large-scale evaluations on many real-world datasets: for exact Sparse PCA algorithm, our method achieves an average speedup factor of 93.77, while maintaining an average approximation error of 2.15%; for approximate Sparse PCA algorithm, our method achieves an average speedup factor of 6.77 and an average approximation error of merely 0.37%.</description>

      <title>Heavy-Tailed Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generation quality across many applications, but their ability to capture rare or extreme events in heavy-tailed distributions remains unclear. In this work, we show that traditional diffusion and flow-matching models with standard Gaussian priors fail to capture heavy-tailed behavior. We address this by repurposing the diffusion framework for heavy-tail estimation using multivariate Student-t distributions. We develop a tailored perturbation kernel and derive the denoising posterior based on the conditional Student-t distribution for the backward process. Inspired by $\gamma$-divergence for heavy-tailed distributions, we derive a training objective for heavy-tailed denoisers. The resulting framework introduces controllable tail generation using only a single scalar hyperparameter, making it easily tunable for diverse real-world distributions. As specific instantiations of our framework, we introduce t-EDM and t-Flow, extensions of existing diffusion and flow models that employ a Student-t prior. Remarkably, our approach is readily compatible with standard Gaussian diffusion models and requires only minimal code changes. Empirically, we show that our t-EDM and t-Flow outperform standard diffusion models in heavy-tail estimation on high-resolution weather datasets in which generating rare and extreme events is crucial.</description>

      <title>Unified Convergence Analysis for Score-Based Diffusion Models with Deterministic Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have emerged as powerful techniques for generating samples from high-dimensional data distributions. These models involve a two-phase process: first, injecting noise to transform the data distribution into a known prior distribution, and second, sampling to recover the original data distribution from noise. Among the various sampling methods, deterministic samplers stand out for their enhanced efficiency. However, analyzing these deterministic samplers presents unique challenges, as they preclude the use of established techniques such as Girsanov's theorem, which are only applicable to stochastic samplers. Furthermore, existing analysis for deterministic samplers usually focuses on specific examples, lacking a generalized approach for general forward processes and various deterministic samplers. Our paper addresses these limitations by introducing a unified convergence analysis framework. To demonstrate the power of our framework, we analyze the variance-preserving (VP) forward process with the exponential integrator (EI) scheme, achieving iteration complexity of $\tilde O(d^2/\epsilon)$. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM)-type samplers, which have been underexplored in previous research, achieving polynomial iteration complexity.</description>

      <title>Debiasing Mini-Batch Quadratics for Applications in Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadratic approximations form a fundamental building block of machine learning methods. E.g., second-order optimizers try to find the Newton step into the minimum of a local quadratic proxy to the objective function; and the second-order approximation of a network's loss function can be used to quantify the uncertainty of its outputs via the Laplace approximation. When computations on the entire training set are intractable - typical for deep learning - the relevant quantities are computed on mini-batches. This, however, distorts and biases the shape of the associated stochastic quadratic approximations in an intricate way with detrimental effects on applications. In this paper, we (i) show that this bias introduces a systematic error, (ii) provide a theoretical explanation for it, (iii) explain its relevance for second-order optimization and uncertainty quantification via the Laplace approximation in deep learning, and (iv) develop and evaluate debiasing strategies.</description>

Abstract: The spectrum of the weighted sample covariance shows a asymptotic non random behavior when the dimension grows with the number of samples. In this setting, we prove that the asymptotic spectral distribution $F$ of the weighted sample covariance has a continuous density on $\mathbb{R}^*$. We address then the practical problem of numerically finding this density. We propose a procedure to compute it, to determine the support of $F$ and define an efficient grid on it. We use this procedure to design the $\textit{WeSpeR}$ algorithm, which estimates the spectral density and retrieves the true spectral covariance spectrum. Empirical tests confirm the good properties of the $\textit{WeSpeR}$ algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14485v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), including fully-connected networks and transformers, are highly flexible and powerful function approximators, widely applied in fields like computer vision and natural language processing. However, their inability to inherently respect causal structures can limit their robustness, making them vulnerable to covariate shift and difficult to interpret/explain. This poses significant challenges for their reliability in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce Causal Fully-Connected Neural Networks (CFCNs) and Causal Transformers (CaTs), two general model families designed to operate under predefined causal constraints, as specified by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). These models retain the powerful function approximation abilities of traditional neural networks while adhering to the underlying structural constraints, improving robustness, reliability, and interpretability at inference time. This approach opens new avenues for deploying neural networks in more demanding, real-world scenarios where robustness and explainability is critical.</description>

      <title>ANT: Adaptive Noise Schedule for Time Series Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in diffusion models for generative artificial intelligence have recently propagated to the time series (TS) domain, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. However, prior works on TS diffusion models often borrow the framework of existing works proposed in other domains without considering the characteristics of TS data, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose Adaptive Noise schedule for Time series diffusion models (ANT), which automatically predetermines proper noise schedules for given TS datasets based on their statistics representing non-stationarity. Our intuition is that an optimal noise schedule should satisfy the following desiderata: 1) It linearly reduces the non-stationarity of TS data so that all diffusion steps are equally meaningful, 2) the data is corrupted to the random noise at the final step, and 3) the number of steps is sufficiently large. The proposed method is practical for use in that it eliminates the necessity of finding the optimal noise schedule with a small additional cost to compute the statistics for given datasets, which can be done offline before training. We validate the effectiveness of our method across various tasks, including TS forecasting, refinement, and generation, on datasets from diverse domains.

      <description>arXiv:2410.14507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting of armed conflicts is an important area of research that has the potential to save lives and prevent suffering. However, most existing forecasting models provide only point predictions without any individual-level uncertainty estimates. In this paper, we introduce a novel extension to conformal prediction algorithm which we call bin-conditional conformal prediction. This method allows users to obtain individual-level prediction intervals for any arbitrary prediction model while maintaining a specific level of coverage across user-defined ranges of values. We apply the bin-conditional conformal prediction algorithm to forecast fatalities from armed conflict. Our results demonstrate that the method provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for the predicted number of fatalities. Compared to standard conformal prediction, the bin-conditional method outperforms offers improved calibration of coverage rates across different values of the outcome, but at the cost of wider prediction intervals.</description>

      <title>MomentumSMoE: Integrating Momentum into Sparse Mixture of Experts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has become the key to unlocking unparalleled scalability in deep learning. SMoE has the potential to exponentially increase parameter count while maintaining the efficiency of the model by only activating a small subset of these parameters for a given sample. However, it has been observed that SMoE suffers from unstable training and has difficulty adapting to new distributions, leading to the model's lack of robustness to data contamination. To overcome these limitations, we first establish a connection between the dynamics of the expert representations in SMoEs and gradient descent on a multi-objective optimization problem. Leveraging our framework, we then integrate momentum into SMoE and propose a new family of SMoEs named MomentumSMoE. We theoretically prove and numerically demonstrate that MomentumSMoE is more stable and robust than SMoE. In particular, we verify the advantages of MomentumSMoE over SMoE on a variety of practical tasks including ImageNet-1K object recognition and WikiText-103 language modeling. We demonstrate the applicability of MomentumSMoE to many types of SMoE models, including those in the Sparse MoE model for vision (V-MoE) and the Generalist Language Model (GLaM). We also show that other advanced momentum-based optimization methods, such as Adam, can be easily incorporated into the MomentumSMoE framework for designing new SMoE models with even better performance, almost negligible additional computation cost, and simple implementations.</description>

      <title>A Lipschitz spaces view of infinitely wide shallow neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the mean field parametrization of shallow neural networks, using signed measures on unbounded parameter spaces and duality pairings that take into account the regularity and growth of activation functions. This setting directly leads to the use of unbalanced Kantorovich-Rubinstein norms defined by duality with Lipschitz functions, and of spaces of measures dual to those of continuous functions with controlled growth. These allow to make transparent the need for total variation and moment bounds or penalization to obtain existence of minimizers of variational formulations, under which we prove a compactness result in strong Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm, and in the absence of which we show several examples demonstrating undesirable behavior. Further, the Kantorovich-Rubinstein setting enables us to combine the advantages of a completely linear parametrization and ensuing reproducing kernel Banach space framework with optimal transport insights. We showcase this synergy with representer theorems and uniform large data limits for empirical risk minimization, and in proposed formulations for distillation and fusion applications.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Manifold Filter-Combine Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to better understand manifold neural networks (MNNs), we introduce Manifold Filter-Combine Networks (MFCNs). The filter-combine framework parallels the popular aggregate-combine paradigm for graph neural networks (GNNs) and naturally suggests many interesting families of MNNs which can be interpreted as the manifold analog of various popular GNNs. We then propose a method for implementing MFCNs on high-dimensional point clouds that relies on approximating the manifold by a sparse graph. We prove that our method is consistent in the sense that it converges to a continuum limit as the number of data points tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Causality in Reinforcement Learning With Bagged Decision Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of problems with bagged decision times. A bag contains a finite sequence of consecutive decision times. The transition dynamics are non-Markovian and non-stationary within a bag. Further, all actions within a bag jointly impact a single reward, observed at the end of the bag. Our goal is to construct an online RL algorithm to maximize the discounted sum of the bag-specific rewards. To handle non-Markovian transitions within a bag, we utilize an expert-provided causal directed acyclic graph (DAG). Based on the DAG, we construct the states as a dynamical Bayesian sufficient statistic of the observed history, which results in Markovian state transitions within and across bags. We then frame this problem as a periodic Markov decision process (MDP) that allows non-stationarity within a period. An online RL algorithm based on Bellman-equations for stationary MDPs is generalized to handle periodic MDPs. To justify the proposed RL algorithm, we show that our constructed state achieves the maximal optimal value function among all state constructions for a periodic MDP. Further we prove the Bellman optimality equations for periodic MDPs. We evaluate the proposed method on testbed variants, constructed with real data from a mobile health clinical trial.</description>

      <title>A Data-Adaptive Prior for Bayesian Learning of Kernels in Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernels are efficient in representing nonlocal dependence and they are widely used to design operators between function spaces. Thus, learning kernels in operators from data is an inverse problem of general interest. Due to the nonlocal dependence, the inverse problem can be severely ill-posed with a data-dependent singular inversion operator. The Bayesian approach overcomes the ill-posedness through a non-degenerate prior. However, a fixed non-degenerate prior leads to a divergent posterior mean when the observation noise becomes small, if the data induces a perturbation in the eigenspace of zero eigenvalues of the inversion operator. We introduce a data-adaptive prior to achieve a stable posterior whose mean always has a small noise limit. The data-adaptive prior's covariance is the inversion operator with a hyper-parameter selected adaptive to data by the L-curve method. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis on the computational practice of the data-adaptive prior, and demonstrate it on Toeplitz matrices and integral operators. Numerical tests show that a fixed prior can lead to a divergent posterior mean in the presence of any of the four types of errors: discretization error, model error, partial observation and wrong noise assumption. In contrast, the data-adaptive prior always attains posterior means with small noise limits.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play Posterior Sampling under Mismatched Measurement and Prior Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Posterior sampling has been shown to be a powerful Bayesian approach for solving imaging inverse problems. The recent plug-and-play unadjusted Langevin algorithm (PnP-ULA) has emerged as a promising method for Monte Carlo sampling and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation by combining physical measurement models with deep-learning priors specified using image denoisers. However, the intricate relationship between the sampling distribution of PnP-ULA and the mismatched data-fidelity and denoiser has not been theoretically analyzed. We address this gap by proposing a posterior-L2 pseudometric and using it to quantify an explicit error bound for PnP-ULA under mismatched posterior distribution. We numerically validate our theory on several inverse problems such as sampling from Gaussian mixture models and image deblurring. Our results suggest that the sensitivity of the sampling distribution of PnP-ULA to a mismatch in the measurement model and the denoiser can be precisely characterized.</description>

      <title>Inferring Change Points in High-Dimensional Regression via Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of localizing change points in a generalized linear model (GLM), a model that covers many widely studied problems in statistical learning including linear, logistic, and rectified linear regression. We propose a novel and computationally efficient Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm for estimating both the signals and the change point locations, and rigorously characterize its performance in the high-dimensional limit where the number of parameters $p$ is proportional to the number of samples $n$. This characterization is in terms of a state evolution recursion, which allows us to precisely compute performance measures such as the asymptotic Hausdorff error of our change point estimates, and allows us to tailor the algorithm to take advantage of any prior structural information on the signals and change points. Moreover, we show how our AMP iterates can be used to efficiently compute a Bayesian posterior distribution over the change point locations in the high-dimensional limit. We validate our theory via numerical experiments, and demonstrate the favorable performance of our estimators on both synthetic and real data in the settings of linear, logistic, and rectified linear regression.</description>

      <title>Learning to sample fibers for goodness-of-fit testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing exact goodness-of-fit tests for discrete exponential family models. This classical problem remains practically unsolved for many types of structured or sparse data, as it rests on a computationally difficult core task: to produce a reliable sample from lattice points in a high-dimensional polytope. We translate the problem into a Markov decision process and demonstrate a reinforcement learning approach for learning `good moves' for sampling. We illustrate the approach on data sets and models for which traditional MCMC samplers converge too slowly due to problem size, sparsity structure, and the requirement to use prohibitive non-linear algebra computations in the process. The differentiating factor is the use of scalable tools from \emph{linear} algebra in the context of theoretical guarantees provided by \emph{non-linear} algebra. Our algorithm is based on an actor-critic sampling scheme, with provable convergence.
  The discovered moves can be used to efficiently obtain an exchangeable sample, significantly cutting computational times with regards to statistical testing.</description>

      <title>Contextual Linear Optimization with Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contextual linear optimization (CLO) uses predictive contextual features to reduce uncertainty in random cost coefficients and thereby improve average-cost performance. An example is the stochastic shortest path problem with random edge costs (e.g., traffic) and contextual features (e.g., lagged traffic, weather). Existing work on CLO assumes the data has fully observed cost coefficient vectors, but in many applications, we can only see the realized cost of a historical decision, that is, just one projection of the random cost coefficient vector, to which we refer as bandit feedback. We study a class of offline learning algorithms for CLO with bandit feedback, which we term induced empirical risk minimization (IERM), where we fit a predictive model to directly optimize the downstream performance of the policy it induces. We show a fast-rate regret bound for IERM that allows for misspecified model classes and flexible choices of the optimization estimate, and we develop computationally tractable surrogate losses. A byproduct of our theory of independent interest is fast-rate regret bound for IERM with full feedback and misspecified policy class. We compare the performance of different modeling choices numerically using a stochastic shortest path example and provide practical insights from the empirical results.</description>

      <title>ScoreFusion: fusing score-based generative models via Kullback-Leibler barycenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce ScoreFusion, a theoretically grounded method for fusing multiple pre-trained diffusion models that are assumed to generate from auxiliary populations. ScoreFusion is particularly useful for enhancing the generative modeling of a target population with limited observed data. Our starting point considers the family of KL barycenters of the auxiliary populations, which is proven to be an optimal parametric class in the KL sense, but difficult to learn. Nevertheless, by recasting the learning problem as score matching in denoising diffusion, we obtain a tractable way of computing the optimal KL barycenter weights. We prove a dimension-free sample complexity bound in total variation distance, provided that the auxiliary models are well fitted for their own task and the auxiliary tasks combined capture the target well. We also explain a connection of the practice of checkpoint merging in AI art creation to an approximation of our KL-barycenter-based fusion approach. However, our fusion method differs in key aspects, allowing generation of new populations, as we illustrate in experiments.</description>

      <title>Granger Causality in Extremes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a rigorous mathematical framework for Granger causality in extremes, designed to identify causal links from extreme events in time series. Granger causality plays a pivotal role in uncovering directional relationships among time-varying variables. While this notion gains heightened importance during extreme and highly volatile periods, state-of-the-art methods primarily focus on causality within the body of the distribution, often overlooking causal mechanisms that manifest only during extreme events. Our framework is designed to infer causality mainly from extreme events by leveraging the causal tail coefficient. We establish equivalences between causality in extremes and other causal concepts, including (classical) Granger causality, Sims causality, and structural causality. We prove other key properties of Granger causality in extremes and show that the framework is especially helpful under the presence of hidden confounders. We also propose a novel inference method for detecting the presence of Granger causality in extremes from data. Our method is model-free, can handle non-linear and high-dimensional time series, outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in all considered setups, both in performance and speed, and was found to uncover coherent effects when applied to financial and extreme weather observations.</description>

      <title>Emergence in non-neural models: grokking modular arithmetic via average gradient outer product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks trained to solve modular arithmetic tasks exhibit grokking, a phenomenon where the test accuracy starts improving long after the model achieves 100% training accuracy in the training process. It is often taken as an example of "emergence", where model ability manifests sharply through a phase transition. In this work, we show that the phenomenon of grokking is not specific to neural networks nor to gradient descent-based optimization. Specifically, we show that this phenomenon occurs when learning modular arithmetic with Recursive Feature Machines (RFM), an iterative algorithm that uses the Average Gradient Outer Product (AGOP) to enable task-specific feature learning with general machine learning models. When used in conjunction with kernel machines, iterating RFM results in a fast transition from random, near zero, test accuracy to perfect test accuracy. This transition cannot be predicted from the training loss, which is identically zero, nor from the test loss, which remains constant in initial iterations. Instead, as we show, the transition is completely determined by feature learning: RFM gradually learns block-circulant features to solve modular arithmetic. Paralleling the results for RFM, we show that neural networks that solve modular arithmetic also learn block-circulant features. Furthermore, we present theoretical evidence that RFM uses such block-circulant features to implement the Fourier Multiplication Algorithm, which prior work posited as the generalizing solution neural networks learn on these tasks. Our results demonstrate that emergence can result purely from learning task-relevant features and is not specific to neural architectures nor gradient descent-based optimization methods. Furthermore, our work provides more evidence for AGOP as a key mechanism for feature learning in neural networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-marginal Schr\"odinger Bridges with Iterative Reference Refinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practitioners often aim to infer an unobserved population trajectory using sample snapshots at multiple time points. E.g., given single-cell sequencing data, scientists would like to learn how gene expression changes over a cell's life cycle. But sequencing any cell destroys that cell. So we can access data for any particular cell only at a single time point, but we have data across many cells. The deep learning community has recently explored using Schr\"odinger bridges (SBs) and their extensions in similar settings. However, existing methods either (1) interpolate between just two time points or (2) require a single fixed reference dynamic (often set to Brownian motion within SBs). But learning piecewise from adjacent time points can fail to capture long-term dependencies. And practitioners are typically able to specify a model family for the reference dynamic but not the exact values of the parameters within it. So we propose a new method that (1) learns the unobserved trajectories from sample snapshots across multiple time points and (2) requires specification only of a family of reference dynamics, not a single fixed one. We demonstrate the advantages of our method on simulated and real data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.09380v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exogenous heterogeneity, for example, in the form of instrumental variables can help us learn a system's underlying causal structure and predict the outcome of unseen intervention experiments. In this paper, we consider linear models in which the causal effect from covariates $X$ on a response $Y$ is sparse. We provide conditions under which the causal coefficient becomes identifiable from the observed distribution. These conditions can be satisfied even if the number of instruments is as small as the number of causal parents. We also develop graphical criteria under which identifiability holds with probability one if the edge coefficients are sampled randomly from a distribution that is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure and $Y$ is childless. As an estimator, we propose spaceIV and prove that it consistently estimates the causal effect if the model is identifiable and evaluate its performance on simulated data. If identifiability does not hold, we show that it may still be possible to recover a subset of the causal parents.</description>

      <title>Lower Complexity Adaptation for Empirical Entropic Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13580v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport (EOT) presents an effective and computationally viable alternative to unregularized optimal transport (OT), offering diverse applications for large-scale data analysis. In this work, we derive novel statistical bounds for empirical plug-in estimators of the EOT cost and show that their statistical performance in the entropy regularization parameter $\epsilon$ and the sample size $n$ only depends on the simpler of the two probability measures. For instance, under sufficiently smooth costs this yields the parametric rate $n^{-1/2}$ with factor $\epsilon^{-d/2}$, where $d$ is the minimum dimension of the two population measures. This confirms that empirical EOT also adheres to the lower complexity adaptation principle, a hallmark feature only recently identified for unregularized OT. As a consequence of our theory, we show that the empirical entropic Gromov-Wasserstein distance and its unregularized version for measures on Euclidean spaces also obey this principle. Additionally, we comment on computational aspects and complement our findings with Monte Carlo simulations. Our techniques employ empirical process theory and rely on a dual formulation of EOT over a single function class. Crucial to our analysis is the observation that the entropic cost-transformation of a function class does not increase its uniform metric entropy by much.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of dynamic implementations of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and No U-Turn Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is substantial empirical evidence about the success of dynamic implementations of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), such as the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), in many challenging inference problems but theoretical results about their behavior are scarce. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap. More precisely, we consider a general class of MCMC algorithms we call dynamic HMC. We show that this general framework encompasses NUTS as a particular case, implying the invariance of the target distribution as a by-product. Second, we establish conditions under which NUTS is irreducible and aperiodic and as a corrolary ergodic. Under conditions similar to the ones existing for HMC, we also show that NUTS is geometrically ergodic. Finally, we improve existing convergence results for HMC showing that this method is ergodic without any boundedness condition on the stepsize and the number of leapfrog steps, in the case where the target is a perturbation of a Gaussian distribution.</description>

      <title>Individualized Multi-Treatment Response Curves Estimation using RBF-net with Shared Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16571v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation is an important problem in precision medicine. Specific interests lie in identifying the differential effect of different treatments based on some external covariates. We propose a novel non-parametric treatment effect estimation method in a multi-treatment setting. Our non-parametric modeling of the response curves relies on radial basis function (RBF)-nets with shared hidden neurons. Our model thus facilitates modeling commonality among the treatment outcomes. The estimation and inference schemes are developed under a Bayesian framework using thresholded best linear projections and implemented via an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, appropriately accommodating uncertainty in all aspects of the analysis. The numerical performance of the method is demonstrated through simulation experiments. Applying our proposed method to MIMIC data, we obtain several interesting findings related to the impact of different treatment strategies on the length of ICU stay and 12-hour SOFA score for sepsis patients who are home-discharged.</description>

      <title>Timer: Generative Pre-trained Transformers Are Large Time Series Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has contributed remarkably to the advancement of time series analysis. Still, deep models can encounter performance bottlenecks in real-world data-scarce scenarios, which can be concealed due to the performance saturation with small models on current benchmarks. Meanwhile, large models have demonstrated great powers in these scenarios through large-scale pre-training. Continuous progress has been achieved with the emergence of large language models, exhibiting unprecedented abilities such as few-shot generalization, scalability, and task generality, which are however absent in small deep models. To change the status quo of training scenario-specific small models from scratch, this paper aims at the early development of large time series models (LTSM). During pre-training, we curate large-scale datasets with up to 1 billion time points, unify heterogeneous time series into single-series sequence (S3) format, and develop the GPT-style architecture toward LTSMs. To meet diverse application needs, we convert forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection of time series into a unified generative task. The outcome of this study is a Time Series Transformer (Timer), which is generative pre-trained by next token prediction and adapted to various downstream tasks with promising capabilities as an LTSM. Code and datasets are available at: https://github.com/thuml/Large-Time-Series-Model.</description>

      <title>Average gradient outer product as a mechanism for deep neural collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13728v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Collapse (DNC) refers to the surprisingly rigid structure of the data representations in the final layers of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Though the phenomenon has been measured in a variety of settings, its emergence is typically explained via data-agnostic approaches, such as the unconstrained features model. In this work, we introduce a data-dependent setting where DNC forms due to feature learning through the average gradient outer product (AGOP). The AGOP is defined with respect to a learned predictor and is equal to the uncentered covariance matrix of its input-output gradients averaged over the training dataset. The Deep Recursive Feature Machine (Deep RFM) is a method that constructs a neural network by iteratively mapping the data with the AGOP and applying an untrained random feature map. We demonstrate empirically that DNC occurs in Deep RFM across standard settings as a consequence of the projection with the AGOP matrix computed at each layer. Further, we theoretically explain DNC in Deep RFM in an asymptotic setting and as a result of kernel learning. We then provide evidence that this mechanism holds for neural networks more generally. In particular, we show that the right singular vectors and values of the weights can be responsible for the majority of within-class variability collapse for DNNs trained in the feature learning regime. As observed in recent work, this singular structure is highly correlated with that of the AGOP.</description>

      <title>On Subjective Uncertainty Quantification and Calibration in Natural Language Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applications of large language models often involve the generation of free-form responses, in which case uncertainty quantification becomes challenging. This is due to the need to identify task-specific uncertainties (e.g., about the semantics) which appears difficult to define in general cases. This work addresses these challenges from a perspective of Bayesian decision theory, starting from the assumption that our utility is characterized by a similarity measure that compares a generated response with a hypothetical true response. We discuss how this assumption enables principled quantification of the model's subjective uncertainty and its calibration. We further derive a measure for epistemic uncertainty, based on a missing data perspective and its characterization as an excess risk. The proposed methods can be applied to black-box language models. We illustrate the methods on question answering and machine translation tasks. Our experiments provide a principled evaluation of task-specific calibration, and demonstrate that epistemic uncertainty offers a promising deferral strategy for efficient data acquisition in in-context learning.</description>

      <title>Retraining with Predicted Hard Labels Provably Increases Model Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of a model trained with \textit{noisy labels} is often improved by simply \textit{retraining} the model with its own predicted \textit{hard} labels (i.e., $1$/$0$ labels). Yet, a detailed theoretical characterization of this phenomenon is lacking. In this paper, we theoretically analyze retraining in a linearly separable setting with randomly corrupted labels given to us and prove that retraining can improve the population accuracy obtained by initially training with the given (noisy) labels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such theoretical result. Retraining finds application in improving training with local label differential privacy (DP) which involves training with noisy labels. We empirically show that retraining selectively on the samples for which the predicted label matches the given label significantly improves label DP training at \textit{no extra privacy cost}; we call this \textit{consensus-based retraining}. As an example, when training ResNet-18 on CIFAR-100 with $\epsilon=3$ label DP, we obtain $6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy with consensus-based retraining.</description>

      <title>Proximal Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of algorithms, termed Proximal Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithms (PIPLA), for inference and learning in latent variable models whose joint probability density is non-differentiable. Leveraging proximal Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques and the recently introduced interacting particle Langevin algorithm (IPLA), we propose several variants within the novel proximal IPLA family, tailored to the problem of estimating parameters in a non-differentiable statistical model. We prove nonasymptotic bounds for the parameter estimates produced by multiple algorithms in the strongly log-concave setting and provide comprehensive numerical experiments on various models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. In particular, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed family of algorithms on a toy hierarchical example where our assumptions can be checked, as well as on the problems of sparse Bayesian logistic regression, sparse Bayesian neural network, and sparse matrix completion. Our theory and experiments together show that PIPLA family can be the de facto choice for parameter estimation problems in latent variable models for non-differentiable models.</description>

      <title>Experimenting on Markov Decision Processes with Local Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing randomized experiments to evaluate the effect of short-term treatments on the short-term outcomes has been well understood and become the golden standard in industrial practice. However, as service systems become increasingly dynamical and personalized, much focus is shifting toward maximizing long-term cumulative outcomes, such as customer lifetime value, through lifetime exposure to interventions. To bridge this gap, we investigate the randomized experiments within dynamical systems modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Our goal is to assess the impact of treatment and control policies on long-term cumulative rewards from relatively short-term observations. We first develop optimal inference techniques for assessing the effects of general treatment patterns. Furthermore, recognizing that many real-world treatments tend to be fine-grained and localized for practical efficiency and operational convenience, we then propose methods to harness this localized structure by sharing information on the non-targeted states. Our new estimator effectively overcomes the variance lower bound for general treatments while matching the more stringent lower bound incorporating the local treatment structure. Furthermore, our estimator can optimally achieve a linear reduction with the number of test arms for a major part of the variance. Finally, we explore scenarios with perfect knowledge of the control arm and design estimators that further improve inference efficiency.</description>

      <title>Kernel Density Estimators in Large Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies Kernel Density Estimation for a high-dimensional distribution $\rho(x)$. Traditional approaches have focused on the limit of large number of data points $n$ and fixed dimension $d$. We analyze instead the regime where both the number $n$ of data points $y_i$ and their dimensionality $d$ grow with a fixed ratio $\alpha=(\log n)/d$. Our study reveals three distinct statistical regimes for the kernel-based estimate of the density $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)=\frac{1}{n h^d}\sum_{i=1}^n K\left(\frac{x-y_i}{h}\right)$, depending on the bandwidth $h$: a classical regime for large bandwidth where the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) holds, which is akin to the one found in traditional approaches. Below a certain value of the bandwidth, $h_{CLT}(\alpha)$, we find that the CLT breaks down. The statistics of $\hat\rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)$ for a fixed $x$ drawn from $\rho(x)$ is given by a heavy-tailed distribution (an alpha-stable distribution). In particular below a value $h_G(\alpha)$, we find that $\hat\rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)$ is governed by extreme value statistics: only a few points in the database matter and give the dominant contribution to the density estimator. We provide a detailed analysis for high-dimensional multivariate Gaussian data. We show that the optimal bandwidth threshold based on Kullback-Leibler divergence lies in the new statistical regime identified in this paper. As known by practitioners, when decreasing the bandwidth a Kernel-estimated estimated changes from a smooth curve to a collections of peaks centred on the data points. Our findings reveal that this general phenomenon is related to sharp transitions between phases characterized by different statistical properties, and offer new insights for Kernel density estimation in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Corruption-Robust Linear Bandits: Minimax Optimality and Gap-Dependent Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In linear bandits, how can a learner effectively learn when facing corrupted rewards? While significant work has explored this question, a holistic understanding across different adversarial models and corruption measures is lacking, as is a full characterization of the minimax regret bounds. In this work, we compare two types of corruptions commonly considered: strong corruption, where the corruption level depends on the action chosen by the learner, and weak corruption, where the corruption level does not depend on the action chosen by the learner. We provide a unified framework to analyze these corruptions. For stochastic linear bandits, we fully characterize the gap between the minimax regret under strong and weak corruptions. We also initiate the study of corrupted adversarial linear bandits, obtaining upper and lower bounds with matching dependencies on the corruption level. Next, we reveal a connection between corruption-robust learning and learning with gap-dependent mis-specification, a setting first studied by Liu et al. (2023a), where the misspecification level of an action or policy is proportional to its suboptimality. We present a general reduction that enables any corruption-robust algorithm to handle gap-dependent misspecification. This allows us to recover the results of Liu et al. (2023a) in a black-box manner and significantly generalize them to settings like linear MDPs, yielding the first results for gap-dependent misspecification in reinforcement learning. However, this general reduction does not attain the optimal rate for gap-dependent misspecification. Motivated by this, we develop a specialized algorithm that achieves optimal bounds for gap-dependent misspecification in linear bandits, thus answering an open question posed by Liu et al. (2023a).</description>

      <title>Integrating Expert Judgment and Algorithmic Decision Making: An Indistinguishability Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for human-AI collaboration in prediction and decision tasks. Our approach leverages human judgment to distinguish inputs which are algorithmically indistinguishable, or "look the same" to any feasible predictive algorithm. We argue that this framing clarifies the problem of human-AI collaboration in prediction and decision tasks, as experts often form judgments by drawing on information which is not encoded in an algorithm's training data. Algorithmic indistinguishability yields a natural test for assessing whether experts incorporate this kind of "side information", and further provides a simple but principled method for selectively incorporating human feedback into algorithmic predictions. We show that this method provably improves the performance of any feasible algorithmic predictor and precisely quantify this improvement. We demonstrate the utility of our framework in a case study of emergency room triage decisions, where we find that although algorithmic risk scores are highly competitive with physicians, there is strong evidence that physician judgments provide signal which could not be replicated by any predictive algorithm. This insight yields a range of natural decision rules which leverage the complementary strengths of human experts and predictive algorithms.</description>

      <title>On Debiasing Text Embeddings Through Context Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have made it increasingly feasible to build applications leveraging textual data. Generally, the core of these applications rely on having a good semantic representation of text into vectors, via embedding models. However, it has been shown that these embeddings capture and perpetuate biases already present in text. While a few techniques have been proposed to debias embeddings, they do not take advantage of the recent advances in context understanding of modern embedding models. In this paper, we fill this gap by conducting a review of 19 embedding models by quantifying their biases and how well they respond to context injection as a mean of debiasing. We show that higher performing models are more prone to capturing biases, but are also better at incorporating context. Surprisingly, we find that while models can easily embed affirmative semantics, they fail at embedding neutral semantics. Finally, in a retrieval task, we show that biases in embeddings can lead to non-desirable outcomes. We use our new-found insights to design a simple algorithm for top $k$ retrieval, where $k$ is dynamically selected. We show that our algorithm is able to retrieve all relevant gendered and neutral chunks.</description>

      <title>Sample Compression Scheme Reductions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present novel reductions from sample compression schemes in multiclass classification, regression, and adversarially robust learning settings to binary sample compression schemes. Assuming we have a compression scheme for binary classes of size $f(d_\mathrm{VC})$, where $d_\mathrm{VC}$ is the VC dimension, then we have the following results: (1) If the binary compression scheme is a majority-vote or a stable compression scheme, then there exists a multiclass compression scheme of size $O(f(d_\mathrm{G}))$, where $d_\mathrm{G}$ is the graph dimension. Moreover, for general binary compression schemes, we obtain a compression of size $O(f(d_\mathrm{G})\log|Y|)$, where $Y$ is the label space. (2) If the binary compression scheme is a majority-vote or a stable compression scheme, then there exists an $\epsilon$-approximate compression scheme for regression over $[0,1]$-valued functions of size $O(f(d_\mathrm{P}))$, where $d_\mathrm{P}$ is the pseudo-dimension. For general binary compression schemes, we obtain a compression of size $O(f(d_\mathrm{P})\log(1/\epsilon))$. These results would have significant implications if the sample compression conjecture, which posits that any binary concept class with a finite VC dimension admits a binary compression scheme of size $O(d_\mathrm{VC})$, is resolved (Littlestone and Warmuth, 1986; Floyd and Warmuth, 1995; Warmuth, 2003). Our results would then extend the proof of the conjecture immediately to other settings. We establish similar results for adversarially robust learning and also provide an example of a concept class that is robustly learnable but has no bounded-size compression scheme, demonstrating that learnability is not equivalent to having a compression scheme independent of the sample size, unlike in binary classification, where compression of size $2^{O(d_\mathrm{VC})}$ is attainable (Moran and Yehudayoff, 2016).</description>
