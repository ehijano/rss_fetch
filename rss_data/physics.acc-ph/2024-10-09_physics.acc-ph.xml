      <title>A new approach to solving the radiation field problem of an extended helical undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method is applied to construct an exact solution for the radiation field of a particle moving along an infinite helical trajectory. The solution is obtained in the form of a series expansion in cylindrical multipoles. The obtained solution is compared with the existing approximate solution and, using the derived exact relationships for the Doppler effect, is used to construct integral and angular characteristics of the radiation field. The possibility of a continuous transition from expressions for a helical trajectory of a particle to expressions describing the motion of a particle along a closed circle is shown. Optimization criteria are introduced and the possibility of optimizing the radiation characteristics by several parameters is considered.</description>

      <title>A rotor-based multileaf collimator for beam shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new style of multileaf collimator which employs rotors with angularly dependent radius to control the masking aperture: a rotor-based multileaf collimator (RMLC). Using a padlock-inspired mechanism, a single motor can set dozens of rotors, i.e. leaves, independently. This is especially important for an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) compatible MLC, since this reduces the number of actuators and vacuum feedthroughs required by more than an order of magnitude. This new RMLC will complement previous work employing a UHV compatible MLC with an emittance exchange beamline to create arbitrarily shaped beams on demand. A feed-forward control system which abstracts away the complexity of the RMLC operation, and is adaptable to real beamline conditions, is discussed and demonstrated in simulation.</description>

      <title>Effect of Dielectric Wakefields in a Capillary Discharge for Plasma Wakefield Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric capillaries are widely used to generate plasmas for plasma wakefield acceleration. When a relativistic drive bunch travels through a capillary with misaligned trajectory with respect to the capillary axis, it is deflected by the effect of the dielectric transverse wakefields it drives. We experimentally show that the deflection effect increases along the bunch and with larger misalignment, and we investigate the decay of dielectric wakefields by measuring the effect on the front of a trailing bunch. We discuss the implications for the design of a plasma wakefield accelerator based on dielectric capillaries.</description>

      <title>Excellent performance of 650 MHz single-cell niobium cavity after electropolishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electropolishing process and cathodes have undergone modification and optimization for both low- and high-beta 650 MHz five-cell niobium cavities for PIP-II. Cavities treated with these modified electropolishing conditions exhibited smooth surfaces and good performance in baseline tests. Nonetheless, due to administrative constraints on project cavities, maximum gradient performance testing was not conducted. This paper presents a study conducted on a single-cell 650 MHz cavity utilizing the optimized electropolishing conditions, highlighting the maximum performance attained for this specific cavity. The cavity tested at 2 K in a vertical cryostat reached a superior accelerating field gradient of 53.3 MV/m at Q0 of 1.6x1010, which is the highest gradient attained for this type of large-sized cavities.</description>

      <title>Analytic model of stable shock-like structures in laser interaction with underdense plasma for identifying of phase and polarization dependent regime of laser wakefield accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical model describing a stable shock-like structure that is formed when an ultra-intense laser propagates through an underdense plasma. It is shown that such structures exist in a wide range of laser-plasma parameters, with a unique sub-luminal shock front velocity for each parameter. Numerical methods to accurately describe such shock-front is developed. The formalism is applied to describe the parameter space in which the Carrier-Envelope-Phase (CEP) effect under which phase and polarization dependent super-ponderomotive effects becomes significant. The developed formalism will enable quick identification of regimes in which CEP effects become significant, expediting designing of Laser Wakefield Accelerators operating in the superponderomotive regime.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Cnoidal Waves and Formation of Patterns and Coherent Structures in Intense Charged Particle Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The longitudinal dynamics of an intense high energy beam moving in a resonator cavity has been studied in some detail. Through the method of separation of variables and its obvious straightforward generalization, a solution of the Vlasov equation for the distribution function of an intense charged particle beam in the longitudinal direction has been obtained. The thus found Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) equilibrium has been utilized to construct stationary wave patterns in the special case when the velocity distribution (energy error distribution) is Maxwellian. These are cnoidal wave patterns, showing rather intriguing and in a sense unexpected analogy between the equilibrium wave patterns in an intense charged particle beam and similar wave clusters originally observed in shallow water.
  Based on the hydrodynamic model, fully equivalent to the coupled nonlinear system of the Vlasov equation for the distribution function of an intense beam in the longitudinal direction and the equation for the resonator cavity potential, an amplitude equation in the most general form has been derived. A very interesting and important property of the nonlinear amplitude equation is the fact that it is of hyperbolic type (nonlinear wave equation with complex coefficients) in the entire interval of admissible values for the wave number except for a single critical point, in which it is of parabolic type (non-linear Schrodinger equation with complex coefficients).</description>
