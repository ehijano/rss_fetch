      <title>Exact solution of the three-state generalized double-chain Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact analytical solution of generalized three-state double-chain Potts model with multi-spin interactions which are invariant under cyclic shift of all spin values is obtained. The partition function in a finite cyclically closed strip of length L, as well as the free energy, internal energy, entropy and heat capacity in thermodynamic limit are calculated using transfer-matrix method. Partial magnetization and susceptibility are suggested as the generalization of usual physical characteristics of a system. Proposed model can be interpreted as a generalized version of standard Potts model (which has Hamiltonian expressed through Kronecker symbols) and clock model (with Hamiltonian expressed through cosines). Considering a particular example of the model with plenty of forces, model's ground states are found, figures of its thermodynamic characteristics and discussed their behaviour at low temperature are shown.</description>

      <title>A Microcanonical Inflection Point Analysis via Parametric Curves and its Relation to the Zeros of the Partition Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In statistical physics, phase transitions are arguably among the most extensively studied phenomena. In the computational approach to this field, the development of algorithms capable of estimating entropy across the entire energy spectrum in a single execution has highlighted the efficacy of microcanonical inflection point analysis, while Fisher zeros technique has re-emerged as a powerful methodology for investigating these phenomena. This paper presents an alternative protocol for analyzing phase transitions based on parametric microcanonical curves. We also provide a clear demonstration of the relation of the linear pattern of the Fisher's zeros on the complex inverse temperature map (a circle in the complex $x=e^{-\beta \varepsilon}$ map) with the order of the transition, showing that the specific heat is inversely related to the distance between the zeros. We study various model systems, including the Lennard-Jones cluster, the Ising, the XY, and the Zeeman models, illustrating the characterization of first-order, second-order, and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions, respectively. By examining the behavior of thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and its derivatives in the microcanonical ensemble, we identify key features - such as loops and discontinuities in parametric curves - which signal phase transitions' presence and nature. We are confident that this approach can facilitate the classification of phase transitions across various physical systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of Fixing Spins in a Quantum Annealer with Energy Rescaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, various hardware restrictions significantly impede its efficient performance. Size-reduction methods provide an effective approach for addressing large-scale problems but often introduce additional challenges. A notable hardware restriction is the limited number of decision variables quantum annealing can handle compared to the size of the problem. Moreover, when employing size-reduction methods, the interactions and local magnetic fields in the Ising model--used to represent the combinatorial optimization problem--can become excessively large, making them difficult to implement on hardware. Although prior studies suggest that energy rescaling impacts the performance of quantum annealing, its interplay with size-reduction methods remains unexplored. This study examines the relationship between fixing spins, a promising size-reduction method, and the effects of energy rescaling. Numerical simulations and experiments conducted on a quantum annealer demonstrate that the fixing spins method enhances quantum annealing performance while preserving the spin-chain embedding for a homogeneous, fully connected ferromagnetic Ising model.</description>

      <title>University of percolation at dynamic pseudocritical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universality, encompassing critical exponents, scaling functions, and dimensionless quantities, is fundamental to phase transition theory. In finite systems, universal behaviors are also expected to emerge at the pseudocritical point. Focusing on two-dimensional percolation, we show that the size distribution of the largest cluster asymptotically approaches to a Gumbel form in the subcritical phase, a Gaussian form in the supercritical phase, and transitions within the critical finite-size scaling window. Numerical results indicate that, at consistently defined pseudocritical points, this distribution exhibits a universal form across various lattices and percolation models (bond or site), within error bars, yet differs from the distribution at the critical point. The critical polynomial, universally zero for two-dimensional percolation at the critical point, becomes nonzero at pseudocritical points. Nevertheless, numerical evidence suggests that the critical polynomial, along with other dimensionless quantities such as wrapping probabilities and Binder cumulants, assumes fixed values at the pseudocritical point that are independent of the percolation type (bond or site) but vary with lattice structures. These findings imply that while strict universality breaks down at the pseudocritical point, certain extreme-value statistics and dimensionless quantities exhibit quasi-universality, revealing a subtle connection between scaling behaviors at critical and pseudocritical points.</description>

      <title>Exact height distribution in one-dimensional Edwards-Wilkinson interface with diffusing diffusivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the height distribution of a one-dimensional Edwards-Wilkinson interface in the presence of a stochastic diffusivity $D(t)=B^2(t)$, where $B(t)$ represents a one-dimensional Brownian motion at time $t$. The height distribution at a fixed point is space is computed analytically. The typical height $h(x,t)$ at a given point in space is found to scale as $t^{3/4}$ and the distribution $G(H)$ of the scaled height $H=h/t^{3/4}$ is symmetric but with a nontrivial shape: while it approaches a nonzero constant quadratically as $H\to 0$, it has a non-Gaussian tail that decays exponentially for large $H$. We show that this exponential tail is rather robust and holds for a whole family of linear interface models parametrized by a dynamical exponent $z&gt;1$, with $z=2$ corresponding to the Edwards-Wilkinson model.</description>

      <title>Emergence of single-particle mobility edge (SPME) in a ladder network under a modified Aubrey-Andre-Harper (AAH) kind distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research examines the localization and delocalization phenomena in a two-strand ladder network incorporating a generalized Aubrey-Andre-Harper (AAH) model in different parametric regions. In our model, we have introduced a distortion that is neither periodic (Bloch-type) nor random (Anderson-type) but instead has a slowly varying pseudorandom pattern described by {\Gamma}n = {\lambda}cos(2{\pi}Qn^{\nu}), where 0 &lt; {\nu} &lt; 1. We have demonstrated that in the generalized ladder network in the 0 &lt; {\nu} &lt; 1 limit, it is not possible to see a pure metal-insulator transition due to the presence of a single particle mobility edge (SPME) state. We have shown that at {\nu} = 0.908 (and in its immediate neighborhood), the energy states maintain delocalization up to a considerable distortion strength and that a pure metal-to-insulator transition occurs at {\nu} = 1 as {\lambda} increases. We have also demonstrated the phase diagram for the ladder network in the parametric region {\nu}-{\lambda}. We extensively studied wave packet dynamics by examining different quantities to establish the claim satisfactorily. We also have studied the multifractality of the quantum network. These findings suggest that this ladder network could serve as a valuable platform for investigating the interplay between localized and extended states.</description>

      <title>Entropic costs of the quantum-to-classical transition in a microscopic clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally realize a quantum clock by using a charge sensor to count charges tunneling through a double quantum dot (DQD). Individual tunneling events are used as the clock's ticks. We quantify the clock's precision while measuring the power dissipated by the DQD and, separately, the charge sensor in both direct-current and radio-frequency readout modes. This allows us to probe the thermodynamic cost of creating ticks microscopically and recording them macroscopically, which we refer to as the quantum-to-classical transition. Our experiment is the first to explore the interplay between the entropy produced by a microscopic clockwork and its macroscopic measurement apparatus. We show that the latter contribution not only dwarfs the former but also unlocks greatly increased precision, because the measurement record can be exploited to optimally estimate time even when the DQD is at equilibrium. Our results suggest that the entropy produced by the amplification and measurement of a clock's ticks, which has often been ignored in the literature, is the most important and fundamental thermodynamic cost of timekeeping at the quantum scale.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Problem of Multiple Control Parameters in Optimized Borel-Type Summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most often used methods of summing divergent series in physics is the Borel-type summation with control parameters improving convergence, which are defined by some optimization conditions. The well known annoying problem in this procedure is the occurrence of multiple solutions for control parameters. We suggest a method for resolving this problem, based on the minimization of cost functional. Control parameters can be introduced by employing the Borel-Leroy or Mittag-Leffler transforms. Also, two novel transformations are proposed using fractional integrals and fractional derivatives. New cost functionals are advanced, based on lasso and ridge selection criteria, and their performance is studied for a number of models. The developed method is shown to provide good accuracy for the calculated quantities.</description>

      <title>A spatially varying differential equation for multi-patch pandemic propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovery (SIR) model to account for spatial variations in population as well as infection and recovery parameters. The equations are derived by taking the continuum limit of discrete interacting patches, and results in a diffusion equation with some nonlinear terms. The resulting population dynamics can be reinterpreted as a nonlinear heat flow equation where the temperature vector captures both infected and recovered populations across multiple patches.</description>

      <title>Doped resonating valence bond states: How robust are the spin ice phases in 3D Rydberg arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg blockade effect provides a convenient platform for simulating locally constrained many-body systems, such as quantum dimer models and quantum loop models, especially their novel phases like topological orders and gapless quantum spin ice (QSI) phases. To discuss the possible phase diagram containing different QSIs in 3D Rydberg arrays, here, we have constructed an extended Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonian with equal-weight-superposition ground state in different fillings at the RK point. Therefore, both the perfect QSIs with fixed local dimer filling and their monomer-doped states can be simulated directly by Monte Carlo sampling. Using single mode approximation, the excitations of dimers and monomers have also been explored in different fillings. We find that, in the thermodynamical limit, even doping a small amount of monomers can disrupt the topological structure and lead to the existence of off-diagonal long-range order. However, in a finite size (as in cold-atom experiment), the property of QSI will be kept in a certain region like a crossover after doping. The phase diagram containing different QSIs and off-diagonal order phases is proposed.</description>

      <title>The number of immune defense and counter-defense systems sustained in the arms race between procaryotes and viruses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prokaryotes have evolved various mechanisms to counter viruses, which in their turn developed numerous strategies to avoid defenses of the hosts. Dozens of such defense and counter-defense mechanisms have recently been discovered, yet the number of such systems held by a given virus or its host is limited. Here, we present numerical and theoretical arguments for the existence of the maximal number of ecologically and evolutionary sustainable defense and counter-defense systems maintained by both sides at any time of the never-ending evolutionary arms race. We find that the number of such systems is of the order of 10 for a broad range of assumptions about the costs and benefits of defense and counter-defense mechanisms and their specificity. This optimum in the number of defense and counter-defense systems appears as a result of a compromise between the metabolic and autoimmune costs of adding a new layer of defense and the benefits it conveys.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emergence of run-and-tumble-like dynamics in coupled self-propelled robots: experiment and theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the motility behaviour of microorganisms, we introduce a highly tunable, robotic system self-actuating into the run-and-tumble (RT)-like motion. It comprises two disk-shaped, centimeter-scale programmable robots individually programmed to perform overdamped active Brownian (AB) motion and connected by a rigid rod. The rod is attached to pivot points located on off-centered, mirror-symmetric points on each robot, allowing for its free rotation at both ends. We show that the collective dynamics of this system execute RT-like motion with characteristic sharp tumble events and exponentially distributed run times, similar to those observed in microorganisms. We further quantify emerging dynamics in terms of tumbling frequency and tune it over a wide range of experimental parameters. We also develop a theoretical model that reproduces our experimental results and elucidates the underlying physical mechanisms governing the rich phase behavior of RT motion. Together, these results highlight the importance of our robotic platform in offering valuable insights into the mechanism of motility characteristics in microorganisms.</description>

      <title>Universal fluctuations of localized two interacting particles in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the universal fluctuations of localized wavefunction in the Fock space of two interacting particles in one-dimensional disordered systems, focusing on the interplay between random potentials and random long-range interactions. By mapping the system onto a directed polymer problem, we show that random potentials alone produce correlated energies for the sites in the Fock space, giving rise to the fluctuation growth exponent 1/2. Introducing random long-range interactions alters these correlations and drives the system's fluctuations into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in (1+1)D with the exponent 1/3. To validate the universality of the observed fluctuation scaling, we study a complex directed polymer model with competing point and columnar disorder. Our results confirm that columnar disorder corresponds to on-site energies in the Fock space from the random potentials, while point disorder models the effects of random long-range interactions between the two particles. These findings provide new insights into the Fock-space perspective for examining disordered quantum many-body systems, and emphasize the critical role of disorder structure in determining the universality class of fluctuations in localized quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the clock, stochastic cutoff, and Tomita Monte Carlo methods in simulating the dipolar triangular lattice at criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic nanostructures find application in diverse technological domains and their behavior is significantly influenced by long-range dipolar interactions. However, simulating these systems using the traditional Metropolis Monte Carlo method poses high computational demand. Several methods, including the clock, stochastic cutoff, and Tomita approaches, can reduce the computational burden of simulating 2D systems with dipolar interactions. Although these three methods rely on distinct theoretical concepts, they all achieve complexity reduction by a common strategy. Instead of calculating the energy difference between a spin and all its neighbors, they evaluate the energy difference with only a limited number of randomly chosen neighbors. This is achieved through methods like the dynamic thinning and Fukui-Todo techniques. In this article, we compared the performance of the clock, SCO, Tomita, and Metropolis methods near the critical point of the dipolar triangular lattice to identify the most suitable algorithm for this type of simulation. Our findings show that while these methods are less suitable for simulating this system in their untuned implementation, incorporating the boxing nearby neighbors method and overrelaxation moves makes them significantly more efficient and better suited than the Metropolis method with overrelaxation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-stabilizerness or quantum magic of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($\rm SYK$) model, a prototype example of maximally chaotic quantum matter. We show that the Majorana spectrum of its ground state, encoding the spreading of the state in the Majorana basis, displays a Gaussian distribution as expected for chaotic quantum many-body systems. We compare our results with the case of the $\rm SYK_2$ model, describing non-chaotic random free fermions, and show that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively different in the two cases, featuring an exponential Laplace distribution for the $\rm SYK_2$ model rather than a Gaussian. From the spectrum we extract the stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) and show that for both models it displays a linear scaling with system size, with a prefactor that is larger for the SYK model, which has therefore higher magic. Finally, we discuss the spreading of quantun magic under unitary dynamics, as described by the evolution of the Majorana spectrum and the stabilizer Renyi Entropy starting from a stabilizer state. We show that the SRE for the $\rm SYK_2$ model equilibrates rapidly, but that in the steady-state the interacting chaotic SYK model has more magic than the simple $\rm SYK_2$. Our results therefore suggest that non-stabilizerness allows to sharply detect many-body quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Quantum work statistics across a critical point: full crossover from sudden quench to the adiabatic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When an external parameter drives a system across a quantum phase transition at a finite rate, work is performed on the system and entropy is dissipated, due to the creation of excitations via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Although both the adiabatic and sudden-quench limits have been studied in detail, the quantum work statistics along the crossover connecting these limits has largely been an open question. Here we obtain exact scaling functions for the work statistics along the full crossover from adiabatic to sudden-quench limits for critical quantum impurity problems, by combining linear response theory, conformal field theory, and the numerical renormalization group. These predictions can be tested in charge-multichannel Kondo quantum dot devices, where the dissipated work corresponds to the creation of nontrivial excitations such as Majorana fermions or Fibonacci anyons.</description>

Abstract: Recent research on the fundamentals of statistical mechanics has led to an interesting discovery: With locally nonchaotic barriers, as Boltzmann's H-theorem is inapplicable, there exist nontrivial non-thermodynamic systems that can produce useful work by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir without any other effect, thereby breaking the boundaries of the second law of thermodynamics. The previous analyses used classical mechanical models. In the current investigation, the study is extended to quantum mechanics. First, we reiterate that the Fermi-Dirac distribution and the Bose-Einstein distribution are compatible with the generalized Maxwell's relations, which demonstrates the overall robustness of the framework of quantum statistical mechanics. Next, we analyze a set of simple-step scattering problems. When the system is in contact with a thermal reservoir, a bound state inherently follows the second law of thermodynamics, while a scattering state may not. The root cause is associated with the nonlocal nature of the wave function. It implies that the non-thermodynamic phenomena favor unquantized energy, exhibiting a tendency to occur in classical mechanical or "semiclassical" setups.</description>

Abstract: Renormalization group theory is a powerful and intriguing technique with a wide range of applications. One of the main successes of renormalization group theory is the description of continuous phase transitions and the development of scaling theory. Most courses on phase transitions focus on scaling and critical exponents, while less attention is paid to universality, renormalization group flow, and the existence of a unique fixed point, which are the ultimate reasons why scaling theory is so effective in describing continuous phase transitions. We use a combination of Monte Carlo simulations and real space renormalization group theory to determine the renormalization group flow and to show the existence of a universal fixed point in the context of the ferromagnetic Ising model.</description>

Abstract: Hierarchical tree structures are common in many real-world systems, from tree roots and branches to neuronal dendrites and biologically inspired artificial neural networks, as well as in technological networks for organizing and searching complex datasets of high-dimensional patterns. Within the class of hierarchical self-organized systems, we investigate the interplay of structure and function, associated with the emergence of complex tree structures in disordered environments. Using an algorithm that creates and searches trees of real-world patterns, our work stands at the intersection of statistical physics, machine learning, and network theory. We resolve the network properties over multiple phase transitions and across a continuity of scales, using the von Neumann entropy, its generalized susceptibility, and the recent definition of thermodynamic-like quantities, such as work, heat, and efficiency. We show that scale-invariance, i.e. power-law Laplacian spectral density, is a key feature to construct trees capable of combining fast information flow and sufficiently rich internal representation of information, enabling the system to achieve its functional task efficiently. Moreover, the complexity of the environmental conditions the system has adapted to is encoded in the value of the exponent of the power-law spectral density, inherently related to the network spectral dimension, and directly influencing the traits of those functionally efficient networks. Thereby, we provide a novel metric to estimate the complexity of high-dimensional datasets.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Newtonian Deterministic Causality from Stochastic Motions in Continuous Space and Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since Newton's time, deterministic causality has been considered a crucial prerequisite in any fundamental theory in physics. In contrast, the present work investigates stochastic dynamical models for motion in one spatial dimension, in which Newtonian mechanics becomes an emergent property: We present a coherent theory in which a Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE) emerges in a description of the evolution of entropy $-\phi(x,t)=\epsilon \log$(Probability) of a system under observation and in the limit of large information extent $\epsilon^{-1}$ in homogeneous space and time. The variable $\phi$ represents a non-random high-order statistical concept that is distinct from probability itself as $\epsilon=0$; the HJE embodies an emergent law of deterministic causality in continuous space and time with an Imaginary Scale symmetry $(t,x,\phi)\leftrightarrow (it,ix,-i\phi)$. $\phi(x,t)$ exhibits a nonlinear wave phenomenon with a mathematical singularity in finite time, overcoming which we introduce viscosity $\epsilon(\partial^2\phi/\partial x^2)$ and wave $i\epsilon(\partial^2 \phi/\partial x^2)$ perturbations, articulating dissipation and conservation, which break the Imaginary Scale symmetry: They lead to the Brownian motion and Schr\"{o}dinger's equation of motion, respectively. Last but not least, Lagrange's action in classical mechanics acquires an entropic interpretation and Hamilton's principle is established.</description>

      <title>Unraveling-induced entanglement phase transition in diffusive trajectories of continuously monitored noninteracting fermionic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The competition between unitary quantum dynamics and dissipative stochastic effects, as emerging from continuous-monitoring processes, can culminate in measurement-induced phase transitions. Here, a many-body system abruptly passes, when exceeding a critical measurement rate, from a highly entangled phase to a low-entanglement one. We consider a different perspective on entanglement phase transitions and explore whether these can emerge when the measurement process itself is modified, while keeping the measurement rate fixed. To illustrate this idea, we consider a noninteracting fermionic system and focus on diffusive detection processes. Through extensive numerical simulations, we show that, upon varying a suitable \textit{unraveling parameter} -- interpolating between measurements of different quadrature operators -- the system displays a transition from a phase with area-law entanglement to one where entanglement scales logarithmically with the system size. Our findings may be relevant for tailoring quantum correlations in noisy quantum devices and for conceiving optimal classical simulation strategies.</description>

Abstract: The major difference between percolation and other phase transition models is the absence of an Hamiltonian and of a partition function. For this reason it is not straightforward to identify the corresponding field theory to be used as starting point of Renormalization Group computations. Indeed, it could be identified with the field theory of $n+1$ states Potts model in the limit of $n \to 0$ only by means of the mapping discovered by Kasteleyn and Fortuin for bond percolation. In this paper we show that it is possible to recover the epsilon expansion for critical exponents in finite dimension directly using the $M$-layer expansion, without the need to perform any analytical continuation. Moreover, we also show explicitly that the critical exponents for site and bond percolation are the same. This computation provides a reference for applications of the $M$-layer method to systems where the underlying field theory is unknown or disputed.</description>

Abstract: Enhanced experimental capabilities to control nonlocal and power-law decaying interactions are currently fuelling intense research in the domain of quantum many-body physics. Compared to their counterparts with short-ranged interactions, long-range interacting systems display novel physics, such as nonlinear light cones for the propagation of information or inequivalent thermodynamic ensembles. In this work, we consider generic long-range open quantum systems in arbitrary dimensions and focus on the so-called strong long-range regime. We prove that in the thermodynamic limit local properties, captured by reduced quantum states, are described by an emergent non-interacting theory. Here, the dynamics factorizes and the individual constituents of the system evolve independently such that no correlations are generated over time. In this sense, long-range interacting systems are locally non-interacting. This has significant implications for their relaxation behavior, for instance in relation to the emergence of long-lived quasi-stationary states or to the absence of thermalization.</description>

Abstract: Brownian motion in one or more dimensions is extensively used as a stochastic process to model natural and engineering signals, as well as financial data. Most works dealing with multidimensional Brownian motion consider the different dimensions as independent components. In this article, we investigate a model of correlated Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where the individual components are not necessarily independent. We explore various statistical properties of the process under consideration, going beyond the conventional analysis of the second moment. Our particular focus lies on investigating the distribution of turning angles. This distribution reveals particularly interesting characteristics for processes with dependent components that are relevant to applications in diverse physical systems. Theoretical considerations are supported by numerical simulations and analysis of two real-world datasets: the financial data of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard and Poor's 500, and trajectories of polystyrene beads in water. Finally, we show that the model can be readily extended to trajectories with correlations that change over time.</description>

Abstract: Progress in miniaturized technology allows us to control physical systems at nanoscale with remarkable precision. Experimental advancements have sparked interest in control problems in stochastic thermodynamics, typically concerning a time-dependent potential applied to a nanoparticle to reach a target stationary state in a given time with minimal energy cost. We study this problem for a particle subject to thermal fluctuations in a regime that takes into account the effects of inertia, and, building on the results of a previous work, provide a numerical method to find optimal controls even for non-Gaussian initial and final conditions, corresponding to non-harmonic confinements. The control protocol and the time-dependent position distribution are qualitatively different from the corresponding overdamped limit: in particular, a symmetry of the boundary conditions, which is preserved in the absence of inertia, turns out to be broken in the underdamped regime. We also show that the momentum mean tends to a constant value along the trajectory, except close to the boundary, while the evolution of the position mean and of the second moments is highly non-trivial. Our results also support that the lower bound on the optimal entropy production computed from the overdamped case is tight in the adiabatic limit.</description>

Abstract: Quantum circuits make it possible to simulate the continuous-time dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian by implementing discrete Trotter steps of duration $\tau$. However, when $\tau$ is sufficiently large, the discrete dynamics exhibit qualitative differences compared to the original evolution, potentially displaying novel features and many-body effects. We study an interesting example of this phenomenon, by considering the integrable Trotterization of a prototypical integrable model, the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. We focus on the well-known bipartition protocol, where two halves of a large system are prepared in different macrostates and suddenly joined together, yielding non-trivial nonequilibrium dynamics. Building upon recent results and adapting the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) of integrable models, we develop an exact large-scale description of an explicit one-dimensional quantum-circuit setting, where the input left and right qubits are initialized in two distinct product states. We explore the phenomenology predicted by the GHD equations, which depend on the Trotter step and the gate parameters. In some phases of the parameter space, we show that the quantum-circuit large-scale dynamics is qualitatively different compared to the continuous-time evolution. In particular, we find that a single microscopic defect at the junction, such as the addition of a single qubit, may change the nonequilibrium macrostate appearing at late time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an equilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show that such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which is necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate numerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point processes have broad applications in science and engineering. In physics, their use ranges from quantum chaos to statistical mechanics of many-particle systems. We introduce a spatial form factor (SFF) for the characterization of spatial patterns associated with point processes. Specifically, the SFF is defined in terms of the averaged even Fourier transform of the distance between any pair of points. We focus on homogeneous Poisson point processes and derive the explicit expression for the SFF in $d$-spatial dimensions. The SFF can then be found in terms of the even Fourier transform of the probability distribution for the distance between two independent and uniformly distributed random points on a $d$-dimensional ball, arising in the ball line picking problem. The relation between the SFF and the set of $n$-order spacing distributions is further established. The SFF is analyzed in detail for $d=1,2,3$ and in the infinite-dimensional case, as well as for the $d$-dimensional Coulomb gas, as an interacting point process. As a physical application, we describe the spontaneous vortex formation during Bose-Einstein condensation in finite time recently studied in ultracold atom experiments and use the SFF to reveal the stochastic geometry of the resulting vortex patterns. In closing, we also introduce a generalization of the SFF applicable to arbitrary sets in a metric space.</description>

      <title>Structure of Quantum Mean Force Gibbs States for Coupled Harmonic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An open quantum system interacting with a heat bath at given temperature is expected to reach the mean force Gibbs (MFG) state as a steady state. The MFG state is given by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom from the equilibrium Gibbs state of the total system plus bath. When the interaction between the system and the bath is not negligible, it is different from the usual system Gibbs state obtained from the system Hamiltonian only. Using the path integral method, we present the exact MFG state for a coupled system of quantum harmonic oscillators in contact with multiple thermal baths at the same temperature. We develop a nonperturbative method to calculate the covariances with respect to the MFG state. By comparing them with those obtained from the system Gibbs state, we find that the effect of coupling to the bath decays exponentially as a function of the distance from the system-bath boundary. This is similar to the skin effect found recently for a quantum spin chain interacting with an environment. Using the exact results, we also investigate the ultrastrong coupling limit where the coupling between the system and the bath gets arbitrarily large and make a connection with the recent result found for a general quantum system.</description>

      <title>A machine-learning study of phase transitions in Ising, Blume-Capel, and Ising-metamagnet models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine machine-learning (ML) techniques with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and finite-size scaling (FSS) to study continuous and first-order phase transitions in Ising, Blume-Capel, and Ising-metamagnet spin models. We go beyond earlier studies that had concentrated on obtaining the correlation-length exponent $\nu$. In particular, we show (a) how to combine neural networks (NNs), trained with data from MC simulations of Ising-type spin models on finite lattices, with FSS to obtain both thermal magnetic exponents $y_t = 1/\nu$ and $y_h$, respectively, at both critical and tricritical points, (b) how to obtain the NN counterpart of two-scale-factor universality at an Ising-type critical point, and (c) FSS at a first-order transition. We also obtain the FSS forms for the output of our trained NNs as functions of both the temperature and the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Fidelity Strange Correlators for Average Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phases in open quantum systems have become an exciting area of research, driven by the rising importance of noisy intermediate-scale quantum platforms. The concept of Average Symmetry-Protected Topological (ASPT) phases extends symmetry-protected topological phases to quantum systems affected by disorder or decoherence. To identify nontrivial ASPT states, we introduce a "fidelity strange correlator" (FSC), which operates directly on a single bulk density matrix without boundaries. For nontrivial ASPT phases in one and two dimensions, we show that the FSC reveals long-range or power-law behavior. In several two-dimensional examples, we establish a link between the FSC and certain non-local correlation functions in statistical loop models with quantum corrections, enabling us to derive exact scaling exponents for the FSC. In addition, we discuss methods to measure the FSC using classical shadow tomography. Our work lays the groundwork for identifying these intriguing topological phases of matter in open quantum systems, both numerically and experimentally.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity phase transitions in monitored random circuits</title>

Abstract: Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent Topology in Many-Body Dissipative Quantum Matter</title>

Abstract: The identification, description, and classification of topological features is an engine of discovery and innovation in several fields of physics. This research encompasses a broad variety of systems, from the integer and fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter, to protected states in complex photonic lattices in optics, and the structure of the QCD vacuum. Here, we introduce another playground for topology: the dissipative dynamics of pseudo-Hermitian many-body quantum systems. For that purpose, we study two different systems, the dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, and a quantum chaotic dephasing spin chain. For the two different many-body models, we find the same topological features for a wide range of parameters suggesting that they are universal. In the SYK model, we identify four universality classes, related to pseudo-Hermiticity, characterized by a rectangular block representation of the vectorized Liouvillian that is directly related to the existence of an anomalous trace of the unitary operator implementing fermionic exchange. As a consequence of this rectangularization, we identify a topological index $\nu$ that only depends on symmetry. Another distinct consequence of the rectangularization is the observation, for any coupling to the bath, of purely real topological modes in the Liouvillian. The level statistics of these real modes agree with that of the corresponding random matrix ensemble and therefore can be employed to characterize the four topological symmetry classes. In the limit of weak coupling to the bath, topological modes govern the approach to equilibrium, which may enable a direct path for experimental confirmation of topology in dissipative many-body quantum chaotic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically study gapless edge modes corresponding to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of two-dimensional three-state Potts paramagnets on a triangular lattice. First, we derive microscopic lattice models for the gapless edge and, using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) approach, investigate the finite-size scaling of the low-lying excitation spectrum and the entanglement entropy. Based on the obtained results, we identify the universality class of the critical edge, namely the corresponding conformal field theory and the central charge. Finally, we discuss the inherent symmetries of the edge models and the emergent winding number symmetry. As a result, one-dimensional chains with this symmetry form a model that supports gapless excitations due to its tricritical symmetry. Numerically, we show that low-energy states in the continuous limit of the edge model can be described by conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge $c=1$, given by the coset $SU_k(3)/SU_k(2)$ CFT at level k=1.</description>

      <title>Making Sense of Gravitational Thermodynamics</title>

Abstract: The use of statistical methods to model gravitational systems is crucial to physics practice, but the extent to which thermodynamics and statistical mechanics genuinely apply to these systems is a contentious issue. This paper provides new conceptual foundations for gravitational thermodynamics by reconsidering the nature of key concepts like equilibrium and advancing a novel way of understanding thermodynamics. The challenges arise from the peculiar characteristics of the gravitational potential, leading to non-extensive energy and entropy, negative heat capacity, and a lack of standard equilibrium. Hence it has been claimed that only non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is warranted in this domain, whereas thermodynamics is inapplicable. We argue instead that equilibrium statistical mechanics applies to self-gravitating systems at the relevant scale, as they display equilibrium in the form of metastable quasi-equilibrium states. We then develop a minimal framework for thermodynamics that can be applied to these systems and beyond. Thermodynamics applies in the sense that we can devise macroscopic descriptions and explanations of the behaviour of these systems in terms of coarse-grained quantities like energy and temperature within equilibrium statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Scalability of Graph Neural Network in Accurate Prediction of Frictional Contact Network in Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense suspensions often exhibit shear thickening, characterized by a dramatic increase in viscosity under large external forcing. This behavior has recently been linked to the formation of a system-spanning frictional contact network (FCN), which contributes to increased resistance during deformation. However, identifying these frictional contacts poses experimental challenges and is computationally expensive. This study introduces a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model designed to accurately predict FCNs in two dimensional simulations of dense shear thickening suspensions. The results demonstrate the robustness and scalability of the GNN model across various stress levels $(\sigma)$, packing fractions$(\phi)$, system sizes, particle size ratios$(\Delta)$, and amount of smaller particles. The model is further able to predict both the occurrence and structure of the FCN. The presented model is accurate and interpolates and extrapolates to conditions far from its control parameters. This machine learning approach provides an accurate, lower cost, and faster predictions of suspension properties compared to conventional methods, while it is trained using only small systems. Ultimately, the findings in this study pave the way for predicting frictional contact networks in real-life large-scale polydisperse suspensions, for which theoretical models are largely limited owing to computational challenges.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of 1-form symmetry and intrinsically mixed topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a R\'enyi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, &amp; Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite R\'enyi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.</description>

      <title>On the numerical integration of the Fokker-Planck equation driven by a mechanical force and the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal control theory aims to find an optimal protocol to steer a system between assigned boundary conditions while minimizing a given cost functional in finite time. Equations arising from these types of problems are often non-linear and difficult to solve numerically. In this note, we describe numerical methods of integration for two partial differential equations that commonly arise in optimal control theory: the Fokker-Planck equation driven by a mechanical potential for which we use Girsanov theorem; and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman, or dynamic programming, equation for which we find the gradient of its solution using the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula. The computation of the gradient is necessary to specify the optimal protocol. Finally, we give an example application of the numerical techniques to solving an optimal control problem without spacial discretization using machine learning.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in the Hayden-Preskill protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the time evolution of entanglement asymmetry of the black hole radiation in the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment. We assume the black hole is initially in a mixed state since it is entangled with the early radiation. Alice throws a diary maximally entangled with a reference system into the black hole. After the black hole has absorbed the diary, Bob tries to recover the information that Alice thought should be destroyed by the black hole. In this protocol, we found that a $U(1)$ symmetry of the radiation emerges before a certain transition time (the time when the vanishing entanglement asymmetry begins to grow). This emergent symmetry is exact in the thermodynamic limit and can be characterized by the vanishing entanglement asymmetry of the radiation. The transition time depends on the initial entropy and the size of the diary. What's more, when the initial state of the black hole is maximally mixed, this emergent symmetry survives during the whole procedure of the black hole radiation. We successfully explained this novel phenomenon using the decoupling inequality.</description>

      <title>Brickwall One-Loop Determinant: Spectral Statistics &amp; Krylov Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon -- a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon -- within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.</description>

      <title>Periodic Boundary Conditions for Bosonic Path Integral Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for bosonic path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) that scales quadratically with the number of particles. Path integral methods are a powerful tool to simulate bosonic condensed phases, which exhibit fundamental physical phenomena such as Bose--Einstein condensation and superfluidity. Recently, we developed a quadratic scaling algorithm for bosonic PIMD, but employed an ad hoc treatment of PBC. Here we rigorously enforce PBC in bosonic PIMD. It requires summing over the spring energies of all periodic images in the partition function, and a naive implementation scales exponentially with the system size. We present an algorithm for bosonic PIMD simulations of periodic systems that scales only quadratically. We benchmark our implementation on the free Bose gas and a model system of cold atoms in optical lattices. We also study an approximate treatment of PBC based on the minimum-image convention, and derive a numerical criterion to determine when it is valid.</description>
