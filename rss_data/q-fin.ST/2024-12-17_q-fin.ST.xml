      <title>PolyModel for Hedge Funds' Portfolio Construction Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The domain of hedge fund investments is undergoing significant transformation, influenced by the rapid expansion of data availability and the advancement of analytical technologies. This study explores the enhancement of hedge fund investment performance through the integration of machine learning techniques, the application of PolyModel feature selection, and the analysis of fund size. We address three critical questions: (1) the effect of machine learning on trading performance, (2) the role of PolyModel feature selection in fund selection and performance, and (3) the comparative reliability of larger versus smaller funds.
  Our findings offer compelling insights. We observe that while machine learning techniques enhance cumulative returns, they also increase annual volatility, indicating variability in performance. PolyModel feature selection proves to be a robust strategy, with approaches that utilize a comprehensive set of features for fund selection outperforming more selective methodologies. Notably, Long-Term Stability (LTS) effectively manages portfolio volatility while delivering favorable returns. Contrary to popular belief, our results suggest that larger funds do not consistently yield better investment outcomes, challenging the assumption of their inherent reliability.
  This research highlights the transformative impact of data-driven approaches in the hedge fund investment arena and provides valuable implications for investors and asset managers. By leveraging machine learning and PolyModel feature selection, investors can enhance portfolio optimization and reassess the dependability of larger funds, leading to more informed investment strategies.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach for Trading Factor Residuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The residuals in factor models prevalent in asset pricing presents opportunities to exploit the mis-pricing from unexplained cross-sectional variation for arbitrage. We performed a replication of the methodology of Guijarro-Ordonez et al. (2019) (G-P-Z) on Deep Learning Statistical Arbitrage (DLSA), originally applied to U.S. equity data from 1998 to 2016, using a more recent out-of-sample period from 2016 to 2024. Adhering strictly to point-in-time (PIT) principles and ensuring no information leakage, we follow the same data pre-processing, factor modeling, and deep learning architectures (CNNs and Transformers) as outlined by G-P-Z. Our replication yields unusually strong performance metrics in certain tests, with out-of-sample Sharpe ratios occasionally exceeding 10. While such results are intriguing, they may indicate model overfitting, highly specific market conditions, or insufficient accounting for transaction costs and market impact. Further examination and robustness checks are needed to align these findings with the more modest improvements reported in the original study. (This work was conducted as the final project for IEOR 4576: Data-Driven Methods in Finance at Columbia University.)</description>

      <title>Multivariate Distributions in Non-Stationary Complex Systems I: Random Matrix Model and Formulae for Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Risk assessment for rare events is essential for understanding systemic stability in complex systems. As rare events are typically highly correlated, it is important to study heavy-tailed multivariate distributions of the relevant variables, i.e. their joint probability density functions. Only for few systems, such investigation have been performed. Statistical models are desirable that describe heavy-tailed multivariate distributions, in particular when non-stationarity is present as is typically the case in complex systems. Recently, we put forward such a model based on a separation of time scales. By utilizing random matrices, we showed that the fluctuations of the correlations lift the tails. Here, we present formulae and methods to carry out a data comparisons for complex systems. There are only few fit parameters. Compared to our previous results, we manage to remove in the algebraic cases one out of the two, respectively three, fit parameters which considerably facilitates applications. Furthermore, we explicitly work out the moments of our model distributions. In a forthcoming paper we will apply our model to financial markets.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Distributions in Non-Stationary Complex Systems II: Empirical Results for Correlated Stock Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate Distributions are needed to capture the correlation structure of complex systems. In previous works, we developed a Random Matrix Model for such correlated multivariate joint probability density functions that accounts for the non-stationarity typically found in complex systems. Here, we apply these results to the returns measured in correlated stock markets. Only the knowledge of the multivariate return distributions allows for a full-fledged risk assessment. We analyze intraday data of 479 US stocks included in the S&amp;P500 index during the trading year of 2014. We focus particularly on the tails which are algebraic and heavy. The non-stationary fluctuations of the correlations make the tails heavier. With the few-parameter formulae of our Random Matrix Model we can describe and quantify how the empirical distributions change for varying time resolution and in the presence of non-stationarity.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Transformers: Enhancing Stock Movement Prediction On Multimodal Time-Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of predicting stock movements in financial markets by introducing Higher Order Transformers, a novel architecture designed for processing multivariate time-series data. We extend the self-attention mechanism and the transformer architecture to a higher order, effectively capturing complex market dynamics across time and variables. To manage computational complexity, we propose a low-rank approximation of the potentially large attention tensor using tensor decomposition and employ kernel attention, reducing complexity to linear with respect to the data size. Additionally, we present an encoder-decoder model that integrates technical and fundamental analysis, utilizing multimodal signals from historical prices and related tweets. Our experiments on the Stocknet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its potential for enhancing stock movement prediction in financial markets.</description>

      <title>Classification of Financial Data Using Quantum Support Vector Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Support Vector Machine is a kernel-based approach to classification problems. We study the applicability of quantum kernels to financial data, specifically our self-curated Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSEx) Broad Index dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first systematic research work on this dataset on the application of quantum kernel. We report empirical quantum advantage in our work, using several quantum kernels and proposing the best one for this dataset while verifying the Phase Space Terrain Ruggedness Index metric. We estimate the resources needed to carry out these investigations on a larger scale for future practitioners.</description>

      <title>Capital Asset Pricing Model with Size Factor and Normalizing by Volatility Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) relates a well-diversified stock portfolio to a benchmark portfolio. We insert size effect in CAPM, capturing the observation that small stocks have higher risk and return than large stocks, on average. Dividing stock index returns by the Volatility Index makes them independent and normal. In this article, we combine these ideas to create a new discrete-time model, which includes volatility, relative size, and CAPM. We fit this model using real-world data, prove the long-term stability, and connect this research to Stochastic Portfolio Theory. We fill important gaps in our previous article on CAPM with the size factor.</description>
