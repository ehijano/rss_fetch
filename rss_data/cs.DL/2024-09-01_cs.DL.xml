      <title>Exaptation: Academic mentees' career pathway to be independent and impactful</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In science, mentees often follow their mentors' career paths, but exceptional mentees frequently break from this routine, sometimes even outperforming their mentors. However, the pathways to independence for these excellent mentees and their interactions with mentors remain unclear. We analyzed the careers of over 500,000 mentees in Chemistry, Neuroscience, and Physics over the past 60 years to examine the strategies mentees employ in selecting research topics relative to their mentors, how these strategies evolve, and their resulting impact. Utilizing co-citation network analysis and a topic-specific impact allocation algorithm, we mapped the topic territory for each mentor-mentee pair and quantified their academic impact accrued within the topic. Our findings reveal mentees tend to engage with their mentors' less-dominated topics and explore new topics at the same time, and through this exaptive process, they begin to progressively establish their own research territories. This trend is particularly pronounced among those who outperform their mentors. Moreover, we identified an inverted U-shaped curve between the extent of topic divergence and the mentees' long-term impact, suggesting a moderate divergence from the mentors' research focus optimizes the mentees' academic impact. Finally, along the path to independence, increased coauthorship with mentors impedes the mentees' impact, whereas extending their collaboration networks with the mentors' former collaborators proves beneficial. These findings fill a crucial gap in understanding how mentees' research topic selection strategies affect academic success and offer valuable guidance for early-career researchers on pursuing independent research paths.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Accuracy of the Labeling System in Web of Science for the Sustainable Development Goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring and fostering research aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is crucial for formulating evidence-based policies, identifying best practices, and promoting global collaboration. The key step is developing a labeling system to map research publications to their related SDGs. The SDGs labeling system integrated in Web of Science (WoS), which assigns citation topics instead of individual publication to SDGs, has emerged as a promising tool.However we still lack of a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of WoS labeling system. By comparing with the Bergon approach, we systematically assessed the relatedness between citation topics and SDGs. Our analysis identified 15% of topics showing low relatedness to their assigned SDGs at a 1% threshold. Notably, SDGs such as '11 Cities', '07 Energy', and '13 Climate' exhibited higher percentages of low related topics. In addition, we revealed that certain topics are significantly underrepresented in their relevant SDGs, particularly for '02 Hunger', '12 Consumption', and '15 Land'. This study underscores the critical need for continual refinement and validation of SDGs labeling systems in WoS.</description>

      <title>CLOCR-C: Context Leveraging OCR Correction with Pre-trained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The digitisation of historical print media archives is crucial for increasing accessibility to contemporary records. However, the process of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) used to convert physical records to digital text is prone to errors, particularly in the case of newspapers and periodicals due to their complex layouts. This paper introduces Context Leveraging OCR Correction (CLOCR-C), which utilises the infilling and context-adaptive abilities of transformer-based language models (LMs) to improve OCR quality. The study aims to determine if LMs can perform post-OCR correction, improve downstream NLP tasks, and the value of providing the socio-cultural context as part of the correction process. Experiments were conducted using seven LMs on three datasets: the 19th Century Serials Edition (NCSE) and two datasets from the Overproof collection. The results demonstrate that some LMs can significantly reduce error rates, with the top-performing model achieving over a 60% reduction in character error rate on the NCSE dataset. The OCR improvements extend to downstream tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition, with increased Cosine Named Entity Similarity. Furthermore, the study shows that providing socio-cultural context in the prompts improves performance, while misleading prompts lower performance. In addition to the findings, this study releases a dataset of 91 transcribed articles from the NCSE, containing a total of 40 thousand words, to support further research in this area. The findings suggest that CLOCR-C is a promising approach for enhancing the quality of existing digital archives by leveraging the socio-cultural information embedded in the LMs and the text requiring correction.</description>
