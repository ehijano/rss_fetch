      <title>High-frequency Density Nowcasts of U.S. State-Level Carbon Dioxide Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate tracking of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is crucial for shaping climate policies and meeting global decarbonization targets. However, energy consumption and emissions data are released annually and with substantial publication lags, hindering timely decision-making. This paper introduces a panel nowcasting framework to produce higher-frequency predictions of the state-level growth rate of per-capita energy consumption and CO2 emissions in the United States (U.S.). Our approach employs a panel mixed-data sampling (MIDAS) model to predict per-capita energy consumption growth, considering quarterly personal income, monthly electricity consumption, and a weekly economic conditions index as predictors. A bridge equation linking per-capita CO2 emissions growth with the nowcasts of energy consumption is estimated using panel quantile regression methods. A pseudo out-of-sample study (2009-2018), simulating the real-time data release calendar, confirms the improved accuracy of our nowcasts with respect to a historical benchmark. Our results suggest that by leveraging the availability of higher-frequency indicators, we not only enhance predictive accuracy for per-capita energy consumption growth but also provide more reliable estimates of the distribution of CO2 emissions growth.</description>

      <title>Sequential Monte Carlo for Noncausal Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Sequential Monte Carlo approach for the Bayesian estimation of mixed causal and noncausal models. Unlike previous Bayesian estimation methods developed for these models, Sequential Monte Carlo offers extensive parallelization opportunities, significantly reducing estimation time and mitigating the risk of becoming trapped in local minima, a common issue in noncausal processes. Simulation studies demonstrate the strong ability of the algorithm to produce accurate estimates and correctly identify the process. In particular, we propose a novel identification methodology that leverages the Marginal Data Density and the Bayesian Information Criterion. Unlike previous studies, this methodology determines not only the causal and noncausal polynomial orders but also the error term distribution that best fits the data. Finally, Sequential Monte Carlo is applied to a bivariate process containing S$\&amp;$P Europe 350 ESG Index and Brent crude oil prices.</description>

      <title>Instrumented Difference-in-Differences with Heterogeneous Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12083v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many studies exploit variation in policy adoption timing across units as an instrument for treatment. This paper formalizes the underlying identification strategy as an instrumented difference-in-differences (DID-IV). In this design, a Wald-DID estimand, which scales the DID estimand of the outcome by the DID estimand of the treatment, captures the local average treatment effect on the treated (LATET). We extend the canonical DID-IV design to multiple period settings with the staggered adoption of the instrument across units. Moreover, we propose a credible estimation method in this design that is robust to treatment effect heterogeneity. We illustrate the empirical relevance of our findings, estimating returns to schooling in the United Kingdom. In this application, the two-way fixed effects instrumental variable regression, the conventional approach to implement DID-IV designs, yields a negative estimate. By contrast, our estimation method indicates a substantial gain from schooling.</description>
