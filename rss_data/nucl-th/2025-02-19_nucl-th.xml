      <title>Chiral Symmetry in Dense Matter with Meson Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kaon condensation in hyperon-mixed matter [($Y$+$K$) phase], which may be realized in neutron stars, is discussed on the basis of chiral symmetry. With the use of the effective chiral Lagrangian for kaon--baryon and kaon--kaon interactions; coupled with the relativistic mean field theory and universal three-baryon repulsive interaction, we clarify the effects of the $s$-wave kaon--baryon scalar interaction simulated by the kaon--baryon sigma terms and vector interaction (Tomozawa--Weinberg term) on kaon properties in hyperon-mixed matter, the onset density of kaon condensation, and the equation of state with the ($Y$+$K$) phase. In particular, the quark condensates in the ($Y$+$K$) phase are obtained, and their relevance to chiral symmetry restoration is discussed.</description>

      <title>Analytic continuation in coupling constant applied to two-proton emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For quantum meta-stable problems with three particles, the $^{6}$Be and $^{16}$Ne nuclei as two-proton ($2p$) emitters provide a testing field. Considering the complexity of many-body meta-stable systems, a tractable solver has been on demand. We apply the analytic continuation in coupling constant (ACCC) to these nuclei, and confirm that this method can solve such problems consistently to the time-dependent results as well as to the experimental data. The sensitivity of the $2p$ energies and widths to the proton-proton interaction is also investigated. The $^{6}$Be shows a smooth shift from short-life to long-life systems according to the proton-proton interaction. Same is concluded for the $2^+$ resonance of $^{16}$Ne. In contrast, for the first and second $0^+$ resonances of $^{16}$Ne, their energies and widths show the avoid-crossing behaviour, due to the coupling of two configurations in the core-proton subsystem, $^{15}$F. Since it requires only the bound-state solvers, the ACCC can be a low-cost option to solve three or more-body resonances.</description>

      <title>AC nuclear Stark effect in H-atom via super-intense laser-atom interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nuclear Stark effect induced in hydrogen-like atomic nuclei under super-intense laser fields. Since laser wavelengths are generally larger than nuclear dimensions, direct laser-nucleus interaction is unfeasible. Instead, this effect is induced indirectly through electron oscillations in the laser field, which produce a periodic electric field that shifts the nuclear energy levels. Using perturbation theory, we derive an expression for the energy shift and dynamic polarizability of the nucleus as a function of laser parameters. Our findings reveal that the Nuclear Stark effect can be controlled by adjusting the laser frequency and intensity, potentially enabling applications in nuclear and quantum optical systems.</description>

      <title>Initial-state-driven spin correlations in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of spin-polarization phenomena in heavy-ion collisions, it is typically assumed that final-state particles are polarized through thermal vorticity and shear. In this sense, polarization is a final-state effect. Here, we propose a different mechanism. We postulate that the collision of spin-carrying nucleons generates an initial transverse spin density, inducing a net polarization of the QCD fireball along a random direction. If the net spin is conserved throughout the evolution of the fireball, the final-state particles should exhibit measurable polarization. Within a wounded nucleon picture, we estimate that initial-state fluctuations induce a net polarization of $\Lambda$ baryons which is around $1\%$ in central collisions and over $10\%$ in noncentral collisions, significantly exceeding the contributions from thermal vorticity and shear. We introduce a two-particle angular correlation observable designed to reveal initial net-spin fluctuations, and emphasize the main signatures to look for in experiments. We argue that the discovery of these phenomena would have profound implications for nuclear structure and our understanding of spin in relativistic hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>A Precise Determination of $\alpha_s$ from the Heavy Jet Mass Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A global fit for $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ is performed on available $e^+e^-$ data for the heavy jet mass distribution. The state-of-the-art theory prediction includes $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ fixed-order results, N$^3$LL$^\prime$ dijet resummation, N$^2$LL Sudakov shoulder resummation, and a first-principles treatment of power corrections in the dijet region. Theoretical correlations are incorporated through a flat random-scan covariance matrix. The global fit results in $0.1145^{+0.0021}_{-0.0019}$, compatible with similar determinations from thrust and $C$-parameter. Dijet resummation is essential for a robust fit, as it engenders insensitivity to the fit-range lower cutoff; without resummation the fit-range sensitivity is overwhelming. In addition, we find evidence for a negative power correction in the trijet region if and only if Sudakov shoulder resummation is included.</description>

      <title>Extreme Shape Coexistence Observed in $^{70}$Co</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shape of the atomic nucleus is a property which underpins our understanding of nuclear systems, impacts the limits of nuclear existence, and enables probes of physics beyond the Standard Model. Nuclei can adopt a variety of shapes, including spheres, axially deformed spheroids, and pear shapes. In some regions of the nuclear chart where a spherical nucleus would naively be expected, deformed nuclear states can result from collective action of constituent protons and neutrons. In a small subset of nuclei both spherical and deformed nuclear states have been experimentally observed, a phenomenon termed shape coexistence. We present spectroscopic evidence for the coexistence of $J^{\pi}=1+$ spherical and deformed states in $^{70}$Co, separated by less than 275~keV. This close degeneracy of levels with the same $J^{\pi}$ and different shapes demonstrates an extreme example of shape coexistence resulting from the interplay of independent particle motion and collective behavior in highly unstable nuclear systems and identifies the Co isotopes as a transition point between deformed ground states observed in the Cr isotopes and spherical configurations observed in the closed-shell Ni isotopes.</description>

      <title>Spin current generation due to differential rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonequilibrium spin dynamics in differentially rotating systems, deriving an effective Hamiltonian for conduction electrons in the comoving frame. In contrast to conventional spin current generation mechanisms that require vorticity, our theory describes spins and spin currents arising from differentially rotating systems regardless of vorticity. We demonstrate the generation of spin currents in differentially rotating systems, such as liquid metals with Taylor-Couette flow. Our alternative mechanism will be important in the development of nanomechanical spin devices.</description>

      <title>$\phi^n$ trajectory bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05778v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform an extensive bootstrap study of Hermitian and non-Hermitian theories based on the novel analytic continuation of $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ in $n$. We first use the quantum harmonic oscillator to illustrate various aspects of the $\phi^n$ trajectory bootstrap method, such as the large $n$ expansion, matching conditions, exact quantization condition, and high energy asymptotic behavior. Then we derive highly accurate solutions for the anharmonic oscillators with the parity invariant potential $V(\phi)=\phi^2+\phi^{m}$ and the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant potential $V(\phi)=-(i\phi)^{m}$ for a large range of integral $m$, showing the high efficiency and general applicability of this new bootstrap approach. For the Hermitian quartic and non-Hermitian cubic oscillators, we further verify that the non-integer $n$ results for $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ are consistent with those from the wave function approach. In the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant case, the existence of $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ with non-integer $n$ allows us to bootstrap the non-Hermitian theories with non-integer powers, such as fractional and irrational $m$.</description>

      <title>Scaling of pre-equilibrium dilepton production in QCD Kinetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use QCD kinetic theory to compute dilepton production coming from the pre-equilibrium phase of the Quark-Gluon Plasma created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We demonstrate that the dilepton spectrum exhibits a simple scaling in terms of the specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$ and entropy density $dS/d\zeta \sim {\scriptstyle \left(T\tau^{1/3}\right)_\infty^{3/2}}$, which can be derived from dimensional analysis in the presence of a pre-equilibrium attractor. Based on this scaling we perform event-by-event calculations of in-medium dilepton production and determine the invariant mass range where the pre-equilibrium yield is the leading contribution.</description>

      <title>Dimuon and ditau production in photon-photon collisions at next-to-leading order in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-to-leading-order (NLO) quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections to the production of muon and tau pairs in photon-photon collisions, $\gamma\gamma\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-},\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$, are calculated in the equivalent photon approximation. We mostly consider $\gamma\gamma$ processes in ultraperipheral collisions of hadrons at the LHC, but the $\gamma\gamma\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ process in $\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^-$ collisions at LEP is also discussed. The NLO terms are found to modify the total fiducial cross sections by up to 5%, increasing the tails of the dilepton acoplanarity and transverse momentum distributions, and depleting by up to 15% the yields at high masses, with respect to the leading-order predictions including the very small virtuality of the colliding photons. At the LHC, the calculations obtained with the charge form factor for protons and lead ions including the NLO QED corrections improve the data--theory agreement for all measured differential distributions, and prove an indispensable ingredient for the extraction of precision quantities in photon-photon processes, such as the anomalous magnetic moment of the tau lepton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute baryon and electric charge deposition in high-energy heavy-ion collisions using the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) Effective Field Theory, where at leading order charge is deposited through multiple scatterings of valence quarks with a saturated gluon target. A simplified phenomenological formula is derived to describe charge deposition, from which the parametrical dependence with collisional energy and geometry can be extracted. We present an approximate analytical prediction of the so-called baryon stopping parameter $\alpha_B$, which shows excellent agreement with the state-of-the art extractions of $\alpha_B$ from experimental data. These results are further validated using the McDIPPER framework, by computing charge deposition at midrapidity across a range of collision energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 62.4 - 5020$ GeV).</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics with realistic hydrodynamic background for relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equations of perfect spin hydrodynamics are solved for the first time using a realistic (3+1)-dimensional hydrodynamic background, calibrated to reproduce a comprehensive set of hadronic observables, including rapidity distributions, transverse momentum spectra, and elliptic flow coefficients for Au+Au collisions at the beam energy of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 200$ GeV. The spin dynamics is governed by the conservation of the spin tensor, describing spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles, with particle mass in the spin tensor treated as an effective parameter. We investigate several scenarios, varying both the effective mass and the initial evolution time for the spin polarization tensor. The model predictions are then compared with experimental measurements of global and longitudinal spin polarization of Lambda hyperons. Our results indicate that a successful description of the data requires a delayed initial evolution time for the perfect spin hydrodynamics of about 4 fm/$c$ (in contrast to the standard initial time of 1 fm/$c$ used for the hydrodynamic background). This delay marks a transition from the phase where spin-orbit interaction is significant to the regime where spin-conserving processes dominate. Our findings suggest that the spin-orbit dissipative interaction plays a significant role only in the very early stages of the system's evolution.</description>

      <title>Constraining first-order phase transition inside neutron stars with application of Bayesian techniques on PSR J0437-4715 NICER data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the existence of exotic matter phases and phase transitions within the core of neutron stars is crucial to advancing our knowledge of cold-dense matter physics. Recent multi-messenger observations, including gravitational waves from neutron star mergers and precise X-ray data from NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) mission, have significantly constrained the neutron star equation of state (EOS). This study investigates the effects of phase transitions in neutron stars, focusing on NICER's latest observation of PSR J0437-4715. We employ Bayesian inference techniques to evaluate the presence of first-order phase transitions using a piecewise polytropic EOS model. Our analysis incorporates data from multiple NICER sources, to refine constraints on key phase transition parameters, including critical density and transition depth. We find that including data from PSR J0437-4715 improves the evidence of phase transitions and tightens the EOS constraints, especially at higher densities. However, Bayes factor analysis only indicates a slight preference for models without phase transitions and current observational precision is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In particular, this polytropic model identifies the critical phase transition mass of neutron stars as being close to 1.4 solar masses, which coincides with the approximate mass range of PSR J0437-4715. This work emphasizes the importance of precise measurements of PSR J0437-4715 for deepening our understanding of neutron star interiors and exploring potential new physics at extreme densities.</description>
