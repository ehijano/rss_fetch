      <title>Time-domain optical coherence tomography at 2 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ using GaSb-based broadband superluminescent diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a time-domain optical coherence tomography (TD-OCT) system operating in the 2 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ spectral region, enabled by a GaSb-based superluminescent diode (SLD). The spectrum emitted by the SLD exhibits a full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of $\sim$80 nm centred near 2.1 $\mu\mathrm{m}$. For OCT operation, stable amplified spontaneous emission with low spectral ripple ($&lt;20\%$) is maintained at drive currents below 150 mA. The SLD is fiber coupled and integrated into a fiber-based Michelson interferometer. In the OCT system, the measured coherence envelope yields an axial resolution of approximately 300 $\mu$m in air and enables depth-resolved imaging of scattering paint-based coating samples. In contrast to OCT implementations at 2 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ wavelength region that commonly rely on supercontinuum sources, the use of GaSb-based SLDs offers a compact practical alternative, leveraging the maturity and scalability of electrically driven semiconductor light sources packaged in a standard "butterfly" module. This report represents the first demonstration of TD-OCT imaging at 2 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ using a GaSb-based SLD source and establishes its suitability for compact and scalable mid-IR OCT instrumentation targeting non-biological, low-water-content materials.</description>

      <title>Online unsupervised Hebbian learning in deep photonic neuromorphic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While software implementations of neural networks have driven significant advances in computation, the von Neumann architecture imposes fundamental limitations on speed and energy efficiency. Neuromorphic networks, with structures inspired by the brain's architecture, offer a compelling solution with the potential to approach the extreme energy efficiency of neurobiological systems. Photonic neuromorphic networks (PNNs) are particularly attractive because they leverage the inherent advantages of light, namely high parallelism, low latency, and exceptional energy efficiency. Previous PNN demonstrations have largely focused on device-level functionalities or system-level implementations reliant on supervised learning and inefficient optical-electrical-optical (OEO) conversions. Here, we introduce a purely photonic deep PNN architecture that enables online, unsupervised learning. We propose a local feedback mechanism operating entirely in the optical domain that implements a Hebbian learning rule using non-volatile phase-change material synapses. We experimentally demonstrate this approach on a non-trivial letter recognition task using a commercially available fiber-optic platform and achieve a 100 percent recognition rate, showcasing an all-optical solution for efficient, real-time information processing. This work unlocks the potential of photonic computing for complex artificial intelligence applications by enabling direct, high-throughput processing of optical information without intermediate OEO signal conversions.</description>

      <title>Observation of Janus Chirality for Coherent Thermal Emission from Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces emerged as a powerful tool for controlling thermal radiation, yet achieving coherent emission with opposite circular handednesses remains a highly challenging problem. Here, we demonstrate experimentally the Janus chiral thermal emission from metasurfaces with opposite circular handednesses on either side of a single device. We employ anisotropic metasurfaces supporting high-Q resonances with photonic flatbands enabling near-unity circular dichroism through in-plane symmetry control. Our experiments confirm the Janus coherent emission, and they are validated by the results of the coupled-mode theory. The flatband resonant metasurfaces enabling a control of chiral thermal emission provide an efficient platform for spin-controlled light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Strong Coupling Between RF Photons and Plasmons of Electrons on Liquid Helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmons, arising from the collective motion of electrons, can interact strongly with electromagnetic fields or photons; this capability has been exploited across a broad range of applications, from chemical reactivity to biosensing. Recently, there has been growing interest in plasmons for applications in quantum information processing. Electrons floating on liquid helium provide an exceptionally clean, disorder-free system and have emerged as a promising platform for this purpose. In this work, we establish this system as a tunable plasmon-photon hybrid platform. We demonstrate strong coupling between floating-electron plasmons and radio-frequency (RF) photons confined in an LC resonator. Time-resolved measurements reveal coherent oscillatory energy exchange between the plasmonic and photonic modes, providing direct evidence of their coherent coupling. These results represent a step towards cavity quantum electrodynamics with a floating-electron plasmon coupled to a resonator. Furthermore, the LC resonator serves as a sensitive probe of electron-on-helium physics, enabling the observation of the Wigner crystal transition and a quantitative study of the temperature-dependent plasmon decay arising from ripplon-induced scattering.</description>

      <title>Fast Eikonal Phase Retrieval for High-Throughput Beamlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a fast Eikonal Phase Retrieval (EPR) formulation that accelerates eikonal phase retrieval by more than two orders of magnitude while retaining controlled accuracy. The method is derived from a second-order asymptotic expansion in the propagation distance $L$ and complemented by the leading Wentzel--Kramers--Brillouin (WKB)
  wave-optics correction, yielding an efficient iterative correction scheme preconditioned by FFT-diagonal, energy-dependent inverse operators (Paganin-type filters). To ensure robustness across practical experimental regimes, we combine two complementary solvers: (i) a local $O(L^2)$ closure that is accurate when eikonal shifts remain sub-pixel, and (ii) a non-local formulation for multi-pixel shifts, in which intensity is propagated through an explicit eikonal ray mapping using a mass-conserving bilinear redisribution on the detector grid, and detector residuals are transferred back to the object grid by the corresponding adjoint (transpose), implemented as bilinear interpolation, before applying an approximate FFT-diagonal preconditioner to accelerate convergence. The same framework supports polychromatic data through a compact spectral discretisation, allowing energy-dependent transport and inversion while keeping the iteration GPU/FFT efficient. Overall, this unified approach enables accurate and computationally efficient phase retrieval across propagation conditions relevant to high-throughput PPC-$\mu$CT experiments.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of the Topology Bandwidth Tradeoff in Valley Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated on-chip photonics increasingly relies on wave propagation that remains stable in the presence of fabrication imperfections, tight bends, and dense routing. Valley photonic crystals (VPCs) offer an attractive path: by opening a gap at the Dirac points of a hexagonal lattice, one can engineer guided modes confined to domain walls that thread around corners with reduced backreflection. We develop a design framework that co-optimizes the photonic bulk band gap and valley Chern number using a modified particle-swarm optimization (PSO), while evaluating the photonic band structure via plane-wave expansion and the topological characteristics using a gauge-invariant lattice discretization to compute the Berry-curvature. The optimized structures exhibit a clean valley-Hall gap with edge bands traversing the gap and high interface transmission in full-wave simulations. These results consolidate topology-aware geometry optimization for robust on-chip guiding.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Born theory for light scattering by time-modulated scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for electromagnetic scattering by particles with a permittivity that is periodically varying in time, based on a perturbative approach. Within this framework, we derive explicit expressions for the scattering matrix of the dynamic system in a first-order Born approximation, relating it directly to the corresponding static problem. We show that inelastic scattering amplitudes are governed by overlap integrals between static modes at the input and output frequencies. Using this insight, we analyze scattering from a time-modulated, isotropic, dielectric sphere and a high-permittivity dielectric cylinder, and demonstrate how modal orthogonality can suppress inelastic channels, while appropriate tuning of geometric parameters can significantly enhance them. In particular, we show that cylindrical resonators support strong inelastic scattering when resonance-to-resonance optical transitions, induced by the temporal variation, involve a high-Q supercavity mode. Comparison with full time-Floquet calculations confirms that the first-order Born approximation remains quantitatively accurate for modest modulation amplitudes and provides clear physical intuition for frequency conversion and resonance-mediated scattering processes in time-modulated photonic resonators.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Skyrmion Encoding by Structured Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured light fields, featuring unique topological properties and high tunability, have opened new frontiers in light-matter interactions with magnetic systems. However, the ultrafast and reconfigurable optical encoding of various types of topological magnetic textures remains a significant challenge. Here, we systematically investigate the encoding mechanism of structured light in magnets via the higher-order Poincar\'e sphere. By uncovering the precise relationship between the winding number of structured light and the topological charge of magnetic textures, we establish a fundamental topological connection between light and magnetism. This framework enables ultrafast, all-optical encoding of diverse topological spin textures in magnetic media, including skyrmions, antiskyrmions and skyrmion bags. Our work advances the fundamental understanding and all-optical control of topological magnetism, offering a promising route for designing skyrmion-based devices.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous four-wave mixing in a thin layer with second-order nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pairs of entangled photons are crucial for photonic quantum technologies. The demand for integrability and multi-functionality suggests 'flat' platforms - ultrathin layers and metasurfaces - as sources of photon pairs. With the success in demonstrating spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) from such sources, an alternative process to generate photon pairs, spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM), also starts to attract interest. In materials with nonzero second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$, SFWM can generate photon pairs both directly, through the third-order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(3)}$, and in a cascaded way, through second harmonic generation (SHG) followed by SPDC. Usually, the cascaded process is more efficient. Here, we show that in a thin layer, direct SFWM dominates, because the wavevector mismatch for SFWM is much smaller than for SHG or SPDC. To demonstrate it, we implement the photon pair generation via SFWM in a second-order nonlinear material - a thin layer of lithium niobate (LN). The existence of both second- and third-order nonlinear processes offers broader opportunities for quantum state engineering.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Hexagonal Nanowire MAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cell with Broadband Light Trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as strong contenders for the next generation of photovoltaic (PV) technologies due to their exceptional light absorption properties, tunability, and affordability in manufacturing. Here, we presented an ingenious hexagonal nanowire (HNW)-based PSC that achieves broadband absorption, minimizes reflectance, and offers robust polarization insensitivity by improving light-matter interaction and increasing charge-collection efficiency. The rotational symmetry of the HNW configuration yielded polarization-independent absorbance under both TE and TM illumination across the visible and near-infrared spectra. The optimization of the geometrical parameters of CH3NH3PbI3-based HNW structure, including diameter, period, and fill ratio, offered a wide rangeof variations that influenced both optical properties and device performance. To further intensify photon confinement, a dielectric SiO2 sphere is partially embedded in the ITO layer, improving long-wavelength absorbance and increasing electron-hole pair generation near the active region. We analyzed the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to examine the optical properties of our proposed structure. This study demonstrates that our proposed structure has achieved a higher generation rate, enhanced absorbance, and a higher optical short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 29.53 mA/cm2. Electrical performance is assessed by solving the coupled drift-diffusion and Poisson equations for the dynamics of carrier transport. The optimized HNW structure achieved a notable power conversion efficiency of 24.2%, highlighting a strong connection between optical confinement and effective carrier transport. These attributes render the proposed HNW PSC a viable option for high-performance PV systems and scalable thin-film solar technologies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study describes both experimentally and theoretically an important hitherto undiscovered feature of the scattering of micron_sized spherical objects when illuminated with highly focused circularly polarized light. This is a regime of high experimental relevance which has not been described in full detail. The experiments are complemented with the analytical formulas explaining the field scattered directed toward the backward hemispace. In particular, it is proven that this field shows a very regular oscillatory dependency with the optical size. This phenomenon is typically hidden in the total scattered field, as the field is scattered much less toward the backward hemisphere than toward the forward one. These regular oscillations are measured experimentally. It is proven that, by analyzing them, it is possible to determine the index of refraction of isolated micron_sized particles, opening new paths for applications in sensing and metrology.</description>

      <title>Detection of Hybrid Optical Anapoles in Dielectric Microspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonradiating optical anapoles are special configurations of charge_current distributions that do not radiate. It was theoretically predicted that, for microspheres, electric and magnetic dipolar coefficients can simultaneously vanish by engineering the incident light, leading to the excitation of nonradiating hybrid optical anapoles. In this work, the experimental detection of hybrid optical anapoles in dielectric microspheres (TiO2) is reported using dual detection optical spectroscopy, developed to enable sequential measurement of forward and backward scattering under tightly_focused Gaussian beam (TFGB) illumination. The results show that the excitation of TiO2 microspheres (diameter, d approx. 1 um) under TFGB illumination leads to the appearance of scattering minima in both the forward and backward directions within specific wavelength ranges. These scattering minima are found to be due to vanishing electric and magnetic dipolar coefficients associated with hybrid optical anapoles. The ability to confine electromagnetic fields associated with hybrid optical anapoles can give rise to several novel optical phenomena and applications.</description>

      <title>Optical forces, helicity, angular momentum and how they are all intertwined</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical description of optical forces and torques on micron_sized particles is a crucial area of research and has formed the foundation for advancements in optical trapping and manipulation technologies. In this study, we derive analytical expressions for optical forces and torques on micron_sized spherical particles illuminated by focused Laguerre_Gaussian (LG) beams, employing the well_defined helicity multipolar decomposition of electromagnetic fields and Mie theory. We developed a multifunctional program, Multipolar Optical Forces Toolbox, based on this theoretical framework. The program, available on GitHub, was used to generate optical trapping stability maps. These maps predict trap stability across a wide range of system parameters and serve as a practical tool for designing advanced optical trapping experiments. Our analysis reveals the important role of helicity p and orbital angular momentum l on the dynamics of particles trapped off_axis in LG beams and demonstrates the unique nature of the tangential torque. Our findings also highlight notable differences in longitudinal optical forces resulting from pure helicity modifications in Gaussian beams. Furthermore, we showcase the ability of LG beams to isolate Mie resonances, offering a novel approach to locate the spectral positions of the resonances of high multipolar modes. These insights deepen the understanding of helicity in LG optical traps and pave the way for the development of more advanced optical manipulation techniques.</description>

      <title>PPG-Based Heart Rate Accuracy in Diverse Populations: Investigating Inequities Across Body Composition and Skin Tones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wearable devices are widely used for heart rate (HR) monitoring, yet their accuracy across diverse body compositions and skin tones remains uncertain. This study evaluated four wrist worn devices (Apple, Fitbit, Samsung, Garmin) in 58 Hispanic adults with Fitzpatrick skin types III to V during a cycling protocol alternating moderate (0.64 to 0.76 HRmax) and vigorous (0.77 to 0.95 HRmax) intensities. Criterion HR was obtained using a Polar H10 ECG, and accuracy was assessed using mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), bias, and intraclass correlation coefficients. All devices showed significant deviation from criterion measures. Apple and Garmin demonstrated the lowest error, whereas Fitbit and Samsung exhibited greater inaccuracies.

      <title>Body Fat, Skin Tone, and the Accuracy of Smartwatch Caloric Expenditure Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smartwatches are widely used to estimate caloric expenditure for weight management, clinical decision making, and public health monitoring. These devices combine photoplethysmography, accelerometry, and proprietary algorithms. However, prior studies report substantial error, and the influence of moderators such as skin tone and body fat percentage (BF) remains underexamined. This study tested whether smartwatch brand, BF, and Fitzpatrick skin type (III to V) predict caloric expenditure error relative to indirect calorimetry. Fifty eight Hispanic adults completed a single laboratory visit including a ten minute recumbent cycling protocol with alternating two minute moderate and vigorous intensity intervals, bracketed by rest and recovery. Participants wore four consumer devices: Apple Watch Series 8, Fitbit Sense 2, Samsung Galaxy Watch 5, and Garmin Forerunner 955. Energy expenditure was measured using a COSMED K5 metabolic system. After device specific data quality filtering, valid participant device pairings ranged from 44 to 52 per brand. One sample tests showed significant mean bias for three devices: Apple, Garmin, and Samsung. Fitbit showed no significant overall bias, although this depended on device specific outlier removal. Mean bias varied by brand, with Garmin and Samsung showing the largest overestimations. Mixed effects models revealed significant effects of device and BF, as well as a device by BF interaction, with physical activity energy expenditure error increasing as adiposity increased. Overall, common smartwatches substantially misestimate caloric expenditure compared with indirect calorimetry. Error varies by brand and worsens with higher body fat, highlighting limitations of current consumer wearables and the need for improved accuracy across diverse body types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a quantum theory for the scattering of squeezed coherent light by a dissipative dielectric slab. Using the Green-function quantization approach, we derive the transformation of the field quadratures and show how dispersion, absorption, and multiple reflections distort the incident squeezing. We find that the slab can selectively attenuate or amplify quadrature noise depending on the slab parameters and provide expressions for the output power spectra.</description>

      <title>Role of quasi-Fermi levels in Si- and Mg-related optical absorption in nitride laser diodes (LDs): material context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical absorption and reabsorption of light emitted from active regions in nitride laser diodes (LDs) have been shown to reduce the light extraction efficiency of these devices. It was proven that the presence of Si and Mg may considerably increase the optical absorption. This effect is much stronger in the high-energy (short-wavelength) range of the spectrum. The absorption increase is directly related to the ionization of the Si donor and Mg acceptor levels, which are controlled by the electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels. It is shown that the absorption may be increased because of the higher ionization of Mg caused by the compensation in the p-type region and the high ionization of Si in the n-type region. It was explained theoretically why optical efficiency is increased by removal of doping in waveguides. It was also shown that good material quality leads to a low absorption level, especially in the Mg-doped p-type part of the device.</description>

      <title>High-resolution tunable frequency beamsplitter enabled by an integrated silicon pulse shaper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate high-fidelity, tunable, and ultrafine-resolution on-chip frequency beamsplitters using a quantum frequency processor based on an integrated pulse shaper with six spectral channels. Near-ideal Hadamard gate performance is achieved, with fidelity F &gt; 0.9995 and modified success probability P &gt; 0.9621 maintained across frequency spacings from 2-5 GHz and down to as few as four spectral pulse shaper channels. The system's support of frequency spacings as narrow as 2 GHz significantly surpasses prior bulk demonstrations and enables arbitrary splitting ratios via spectral phase or modulation index control. These results establish a scalable and resource-efficient platform for integrated frequency-bin quantum photonics, opening new directions in quantum information processing, including densely parallel single-qubit operations and multidimensional gate implementations.</description>

      <title>Scalable Memory Sharing in Photonic Quantum Memristors for Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although photons are robust, room-temperature carriers well suited to quantum machine learning, the absence of photon-photon interactions hinder the realization of memory functionalities that are critical for capturing long-range context. Recently, measurement-based implementations of photonic quantum memristors (PQMRs) have enabled tunable non-Markovian responses. However, their memory remains confined to local elements, in contrast to biological or artificial networks where memory is shared across the system. Here, we propose a scalable PQMR network that enables measurement-based memory sharing. Each memristive node updates its internal state using the history of its own and neighbouring quantum states, thereby realizing distributed memory. By modelling each node as a photonic quantum memtransistor, we demonstrate pronounced enhancements in both classical and quantum hysteresis at the device level, as well as enhanced network-level quantum hysteresis. Implemented as a quantum reservoir, the architecture achieves improved Fashion-MNIST classification accuracy and confidence via increased data separability. Our approach paves the way toward high-capacity quantum machine learning using memristive devices compatible with linear-optical quantum computing.</description>

      <title>High-gain effects in broadband continuous-wave parametric down conversion sources and measurements with undetected photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically how high-gain effects affect the measurement outcome of visible signal spectra in undetected photon measurement schemes. We consider two interferometric configurations: firstly, the SU(1,1) interferometer where the idler incurs loss and additional dispersion in between two identical, lossless, squeezers; secondly, the induced coherence interferometer where the idler incurs loss and additional dispersion in between two identical, lossless, squeezers and where the second squeezer is seeded by the idler and a vacuum ancilla mode. Furthermore, we consider a distributed loss configuration where the idler incurs loss as it propagates in the nonlinear medium. Motivated by experimental evidence and due to the fact that broadband sources are ideal for these measurement schemes, we use the dispersive data of a third-order dispersion engineered integrated waveguide parametric down conversion (PDC) source presented in New Journal of Physics 26, 123025 (2024) to model the PDC spectra in the three configurations. For each configuration we consider the case of idler-only (i) absorption, (ii) additional dispersion, and (iii) the combined effects. We obtain results which outline the strength and weaknesses of the different configurations at different operation points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Purcell effect can lead to a substantial enhancement in the maximum cooling power for solid-state laser cooling. We numerically demonstrate such enhancement in a patterned slot-waveguide structure using ytterbium-doped silica as the active material. The enhancement arises primarily from the increase of saturation power density and the escape efficiency, and can persist in spite of the presence of parasitic absorption in the structure surrounding the active material. Our results point to a new opportunity in photonic structure design for optical refrigeration.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of the Transverse Optical Flux in Random Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the kinetic energy (or gradient norm) of an incident linearly polarized monochromatic wave propagating in correlated random media. We explore the optical flux transverse to the mean Poynting flux at the paraxial-nonparaxial (vectorial) transition along with vortex counting. Here, by paraxial-nonparaxial transition we mean a gradual loss of validity of the paraxial approximation such that it is necessary to solve Maxwell-consistently employing the dyadic Green's function. The vortex number appears to increase approximately with a cubic root of the propagation distance for sufficiently small correlation length. Furthermore, a kink appears in nucleation rate at the position of maximum scintillation upon increasing correlation length. A driven steady state is reached due to the filtering of evanescent waves upon propagation. Finally, we present the spectrum of the incompressible kinetic energy and how it evolves from the paraxial case to that of a (nonparaxial) random field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for implementing an optical neural network using only linear optical resources, namely field displacement and interferometry applied to coherent states of light. The nonlinearity required for learning in a neural network is realized via an encoding of the input into phase shifts allowing for far more straightforward experimental implementation compared to previous proposals for, and demonstrations of, $\textit{in situ}$ inference. Beyond $\textit{in situ}$ inference, the method enables $\textit{in situ}$ training by utilizing established techniques like parameter shift rules or physical backpropagation to extract gradients directly from measurements of the linear optical circuit. We also investigate the effect of photon losses and find the model to be very resilient to these.</description>

      <title>On-chip control of the coherence matrix of four-mode partially coherent light: rank, entropy, and modal Stokes parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partially coherent light offers salutary capabilities in optical information processing that cannot be matched by coherent light. To date, this `coherence advantage' has been confirmed in proof-of-principle optical communications protocols using bulk optics. Taking full advantage of such opportunities necessitates processing multimode partially coherent light in integrated photonics platforms that alone provide the requisite stability for cascaded operations on a large scale. Here we demonstrate on-chip manipulation of four-mode partially coherent light described by a $4\times4$ Hermitian coherence matrix. Starting with generic maximally incoherent light, we utilize an on-chip hexagonal mesh of Mach-Zehnder interferometers to perform all the unitary and non-unitary tasks that are critical for realizing structured coherence: controlling the coherence rank (the number of non-zero eigenvalues of the coherence matrix); tuning the field entropy; molding the structure of the coherence matrix via $4\times4$ unitary transformations constructed out of sequences of $2\times2$ unitaries acting on pairs of modes; and tomographic reconstruction of the coherence matrix by measuring the modal Stokes parameters associated with Kronecker-Pauli matrices. These results confirm the scalability of utilizing $2\times2$ on-chip building blocks for the synthesis and reconstruction of high-dimensional coherence matrices, and provide a decisive step towards large-scale on-chip manipulation of massively moded partially coherent light for applications in optical information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the connection between photonic band-gap formation in two types of two-dimensional photonic crystals and the emergence of reverse electromagnetic energy flows generated by linearly polarized plane waves incident on a photonic-crystal slab. We show that these reverse energy flows, observed in both transmitted and reflected fields, originate from vortex structures in the Poynting vector. The resulting energy-flow patterns exhibit striking analogies to vortex formation in fluid motion past obstacles. The geometry and dynamics of the Poynting-vector vortices determine whether the incident electromagnetic energy is impeded, leading to the formation of photonic band gaps, or instead guided through the structure, enabling transmission.</description>

      <title>Scattering theory of frequency-entangled biphoton states facilitated by cavity polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of quantum light to probe exciton properties in semiconductor and molecular nanostructures typically occurs in the low-intensity regime. A substantial enhancement of exciton-photon coupling can be achieved with photonic cavities, where excitons hybridize with cavity modes to form polariton states. To provide a theoretical framework for interpreting emerging experimental efforts in this direction, we develop a scattering theory describing the interaction of frequency-entangled photon pairs with cavity polariton and bipolariton states under various coupling regimes. Employing the Tavis-Cummings model in combination with our scattering approach, we present a quantitative analysis of how the interaction of the entangled photon pair with the polariton/bipolariton modifies its joint spectral amplitude (JSA). Specifically, we examine the effects of the cavity-mode steady-state population, exciton-cavity coupling strength, and different forms of the input photon JSA. Our results show that the entanglement entropy of the scattered photons is highly sensitive to the interplay between the input JSA and the spectral line shapes of the polariton resonances, emphasizing the cavity filtering effects. We suggest that biphoton scattering quantum light spectroscopy best serves as a sensitive probe of polariton and bipolariton states in the photon-vacuum cavity state. Our approach is not only robust to various regimes of cavity-exciton coupling, but also amenable to extensions beyond the Tavis-Cummings model, enabling the representation of a broad class of molecular systems and solid state quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically compare the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for three configurations of absorption spectroscopy with undetected idler photons: an SU(1,1) interferometer with inter-source idler loss, an induced-coherence (IC) setup in which the idler partially seeds a second squeezer together with a vacuum ancilla, and a distributed-loss (DL) scheme with in-medium attenuation. We calculate the QFI as a function of parametric gain for both full and signal-only detection access. For losses below 99% and low to moderate gain, the SU(1,1) configuration provides the largest QFI. At high gain and intermediate loss, the IC scheme performs best, while under extreme attenuation (transmission $&lt;$ 1%) the DL model becomes optimal. These results delineate the measurement regimes in which each architecture is optimal in terms of information theory.</description>
