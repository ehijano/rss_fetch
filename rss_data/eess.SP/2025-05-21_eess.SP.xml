      <title>A Compact Narrowband Antenna Design for RF Fingerprinting Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting is widely used for supporting physical layer security in various wireless applications. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a small antenna with low-cost fabrication that can be directly integrated with nonlinear passive devices, forming a passive RF tag providing unique nonlinear signatures for RF fingerprinting. We first propose a miniaturized meander line dipole, achieved by two folded arms on two sides of the substrate. This leads to antenna with a simple feeding structure and compact size, making it ideal for planar integration. Two antennas on Rogers 4350B and ultra-thin flexible Panasonic Felios are fabricated, achieving small size at $0.21 \times 0.06 \times 0.004 \lambda_0^3$ and $0.14 \times 0.1 \times 0.0008 \lambda_0^3$ with realized gain of 1.87 dBi and 1.46 dBi. The passive tag consists of the proposed antenna structure and an integrated RF diode, and is further developed on both substrates, aiming to generate inter-modulation products (IMP) due to the nonlinearity of the diode, which can be used for device identification through classification algorithms. We investigate the nonlinearity of the designed tags for transmission at 15 dBm using two-tone signals. All tags produce a significant increased power at IMP frequencies at a range of 0.4 m. The tags on Rogers substrate provide around 23 dB IMP power increase and tags on flexible substrate embedded in lossy material provide around 16 dB power increase. These findings confirm that the proposed solution offers a simple passive tag design to support unique nonlinear signatures for RF fingerprinting applications in a simple, low-cost device.</description>

      <title>Study of Brain Connectivity by Multichannel EEG Quaternion Principal Component Analysis for Alzheimer Disease Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through widespread screening has emerged as a primary strategy to mitigate the significant global impact of AD. EEG measurements offer a promising solution for extensive AD detection. However, the intricate and nonlinear dynamics of multichannel EEG signals pose a considerable challenge for real-time AD diagnosis. This paper introduces a novel algorithm, which is based on Quaternion Principal Component Analysis (QPCA) of multichannel EEG signals, for AD classification. The algorithm extracts high dimensional correlations among different channels to generate features that are maximally representative with minimal information redundancy. This provides a multidimensional and precise measure of brain connectivity in disease assessment. Simulations have been conducted to evaluate the performance and to identify the most critical EEG channels or brain regions for AD classification. The results reveal a significant drop of connectivity measure in the alpha bands. The average AD classification accuracy for all 4-channel combinations reached 95%, while some particular permutations of channels achieved 100% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the temporal lobe emerges as one of the most important regions in AD classification given that the EEG signals are recorded during the presentation of an auditory stimulant. The selection of key parameters of the QPCA algorithm have been evaluated and some recommendations are proposed for further performance enhancement. This paper marks the first application of the QPCA algorithm for AD classification and brain connectivity analysis using multichannel EEG signals.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Graph Signals on Complex Manifolds with Kernel Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph signals are widely used to describe vertex attributes or features in graph-structured data, with applications spanning the internet, social media, transportation, sensor networks, and biomedicine. Graph signal processing (GSP) has emerged to facilitate the analysis, processing, and sampling of such signals. While kernel methods have been extensively studied for estimating graph signals from samples provided on a subset of vertices, their application to complex-valued graph signals remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel framework for reconstructing graph signals using kernel methods on complex manifolds. By embedding graph vertices into a higher-dimensional complex ambient space that approximates a lower-dimensional manifold, the framework extends the reproducing kernel Hilbert space to complex manifolds. It leverages Hermitian metrics and geometric measures to characterize kernels and graph signals. Additionally, several traditional kernels and graph topology-driven kernels are proposed for reconstructing complex graph signals. Finally, experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in accurately reconstructing complex graph signals, outperforming conventional kernel-based approaches. This work lays a foundational basis for integrating complex geometry and kernel methods in GSP.</description>

      <title>EEG-Based Inter-Patient Epileptic Seizure Detection Combining Domain Adversarial Training with CNN-BiLSTM Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated epileptic seizure detection from electroencephalogram (EEG) remains challenging due to significant individual differences in EEG patterns across patients. While existing studies achieve high accuracy with patient-specific approaches, they face difficulties in generalizing to new patients. To address this, we propose a detection framework combining domain adversarial training with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). First, the CNN extracts local patient-invariant features through domain adversarial training, which optimizes seizure detection accuracy while minimizing patient-specific characteristics. Then, the BiLSTM captures temporal dependencies in the extracted features to model seizure evolution patterns. Evaluation using EEG recordings from 20 patients with focal epilepsy demonstrated superior performance over non-adversarial methods, achieving high detection accuracy across different patients. The integration of adversarial training with temporal modeling enables robust cross-patient seizure detection.</description>

      <title>Recognition of Unseen Combined Motions via Convex Combination-based EMG Pattern Synthesis for Myoelectric Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromyogram (EMG) signals recorded from the skin surface enable intuitive control of assistive devices such as prosthetic limbs. However, in EMG-based motion recognition, collecting comprehensive training data for all target motions remains challenging, particularly for complex combined motions. This paper proposes a method to efficiently recognize combined motions using synthetic EMG data generated through convex combinations of basic motion patterns. Instead of measuring all possible combined motions, the proposed method utilizes measured basic motion data along with synthetically combined motion data for training. This approach expands the range of recognizable combined motions while minimizing the required training data collection. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method through an upper limb motion classification experiment with eight subjects. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method improved the classification accuracy for unseen combined motions by approximately 17%.</description>

      <title>Robust Secure Communications in Near-Field ISCAP Systems with Extremely Large-Scale Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates robust secure communications in a near-field integrated sensing, communication, and powering (ISCAP) system, in which the base station (BS) is equipped with an extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA). In this system, the BS transmits confidential messages to a single legitimate communication user (CU), simultaneously providing wireless power transfer to multiple energy receivers (ERs) and performing point target sensing. We consider a scenario in which both the ERs and the sensing target may act as potential eavesdroppers attempting to intercept the confidential messages. To safeguard secure communication, the BS employs a joint beamforming design by transmitting information beams combined with dedicated triple-purpose beams serving as energy and sensing signals, as well as artificial noise (AN) for effectively jamming potential eavesdroppers. It is assumed that only coarse location information of the ERs and sensing targets or eavesdroppers is available at the BS, leading to imperfect channel state information (CSI). Under this setup, we formulate a robust beamforming optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the secrecy rate for the CU, while ensuring worst-case performance requirements on both target sensing and wireless energy harvesting at the ERs. To address the non-convex robust joint beamforming problem and facilitate the deployment of a low-complexity algorithm, we employ the S-procedure alongside an eavesdropping CSI error-bound determination method to acquire a high-quality solution.</description>

      <title>Inter-Subject Variance Transfer Learning for EMG Pattern Classification Based on Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In electromyogram (EMG)-based motion recognition, a subject-specific classifier is typically trained with sufficient labeled data. However, this process demands extensive data collection over extended periods, burdening the subject. To address this, utilizing information from pre-training on multiple subjects for the training of the target subject could be beneficial. This paper proposes an inter-subject variance transfer learning method based on a Bayesian approach. This method is founded on the simple hypothesis that while the means of EMG features vary greatly across subjects, their variances may exhibit similar patterns. Our approach transfers variance information, acquired through pre-training on multiple source subjects, to a target subject within a Bayesian updating framework, thereby allowing accurate classification using limited target calibration data. A coefficient was also introduced to adjust the amount of information transferred for efficient transfer learning. Experimental evaluations using two EMG datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of our variance transfer strategy and its superiority compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>RIS Beam Calibration for ISAC Systems: Modeling and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-accuracy localization is a key enabler for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), playing an essential role in various applications such as autonomous driving. Antenna arrays and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) are incorporated into these systems to achieve high angular resolution, assisting in the localization process. However, array and RIS beam patterns in practice often deviate from the idealized models used for algorithm design, leading to significant degradation in positioning accuracy. This mismatch highlights the need for beam calibration to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world hardware behavior. In this paper, we present and analyze three beam models considering several key non-idealities such as mutual coupling, non-ideal codebook, and measurement uncertainties. Based on the models, we then develop calibration algorithms to estimate the model parameters that can be used for future localization tasks. This work evaluates the effectiveness of the beam models and the calibration algorithms using both theoretical bounds and real-world beam pattern data from an RIS prototype. The simulation results show that the model incorporating combined impacts can accurately reconstruct measured beam patterns. This highlights the necessity of realistic beam modeling and calibration to achieve high-accuracy localization.</description>

      <title>Wireless Sensing via Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wireless sensing architecture via pinching antenna systems is proposed. Compared to conventional wireless systems, PASS offers flexible antenna deployment and improved probing performance for wireless sensing by leveraging dielectric waveguides and pinching antennas (PAs). To enhance signal reception, leaky coaxial (LCX) cables are used to uniformly collect echo signals over a wide area. The Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for multi-target sensing is derived and then minimized through the joint optimization of the transmit waveform and the positions of PAs. To solve the resulting highly coupled, non-convex problem, a two-stage particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm is proposed. Numerical results demonstrate significant gains in sensing accuracy and robustness over conventional sensing systems, highlighting the benefits of integrating LCX-based reception with optimized PASS configurations.</description>

      <title>On Optimizing Time-, Space- and Power-Domain Energy-Saving Techniques for Sub-6 GHz Base Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What is the optimal base station (BS) resource allocation strategy given a measurement-based power consumption model and a fixed target user rate? Rush-to-sleep in time, rush-to-mute in space, awake-but-whisper in power, or a combination of them? We propose in this paper an efficient solution to the problem of finding the optimal number of active time slots, active antennas, and transmit power at active antennas in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system under per-user rate and per-antenna transmit power constraints. The use of a parametric power consumption model validated on operator measurements of 4G and 5G BSs enhances the interpretation of the results. We discuss the optimal energy-saving strategy at different network loads for three BS configurations. Using as few BS antennas as possible is close to optimal in BSs not implementing time-domain power savings such as micro-discontinuous transmission ({\mu}DTX). Energy-saving schemes that jointly operate in the three domains are instead optimal when the BS hardware can enter time-domain power-saving modes, with a tendency for rush-to-mute in massive MIMO and for rush-to-sleep in BS with fewer antennas. Median energy savings up to $30\%$ are achieved at low network loads.</description>

      <title>AI-empowered Real-Time Line-of-Sight Identification via Network Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of Line-of-Sight (LoS) conditions is critical for ensuring reliable high-frequency communication links, which are particularly vulnerable to blockages and rapid channel variations. Network Digital Twins (NDTs) and Ray-Tracing (RT) techniques can significantly automate the large-scale collection and labeling of channel data, tailored to specific wireless environments. This paper examines the quality of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models trained on data generated by Network Digital Twins. We propose and evaluate training strategies for a general-purpose Deep Learning model, demonstrating superior performance compared to the current state-of-the-art. In terms of classification accuracy, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art Deep Learning model by 5% in very low SNR conditions and by approximately 10% in medium-to-high SNR scenarios. Additionally, the proposed strategies effectively reduce the input size to the Deep Learning model while preserving its performance. The computational cost, measured in floating-point operations per second (FLOPs) during inference, is reduced by 98.55% relative to state-of-the-art solutions, making it ideal for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>SINR Maximizing Distributionally Robust Adaptive Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the robust adaptive beamforming (RAB) problem via the worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) maximization over distributional uncertainty sets for the random interference-plus-noise covariance (INC) matrix and desired signal steering vector. Our study explores two distinct uncertainty sets for the INC matrix and three for the steering vector. The uncertainty sets of the INC matrix account for the support and the positive semidefinite (PSD) mean of the distribution, as well as a similarity constraint on the mean. The uncertainty sets for the steering vector consist of the constraints on the first- and second-order moments of its associated probability distribution. The RAB problem is formulated as the minimization of the worst-case expected value of the SINR denominator over any distribution within the uncertainty set of the INC matrix, subject to the condition that the expected value of the numerator is greater than or equal to one for every distribution within the uncertainty set of the steering vector. By leveraging the strong duality of linear conic programming, this RAB problem is reformulated as a quadratic matrix inequality problem. Subsequently, it is addressed by iteratively solving a sequence of linear matrix inequality relaxation problems, incorporating a penalty term for the rank-one PSD matrix constraint. We further analyze the convergence of the iterative algorithm. The proposed robust beamforming approach is validated through simulation examples, which illustrate improved performance in terms of the array output SINR.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Age of Information in Network Digital Twins for AI-driven Real-Time Link Blockage Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Line-of-Sight (LoS) identification is crucial to ensure reliable high-frequency communication links, especially those vulnerable to blockages. Network Digital Twins and Artificial Intelligence are key technologies enabling blockage detection (LoS identification) for high-frequency wireless systems, e.g., 6&gt;GHz. In this work, we enhance Network Digital Twins by incorporating Age of Information (AoI) metrics, a quantification of status update freshness, enabling reliable real-time blockage detection (LoS identification) in dynamic wireless environments. By integrating raytracing techniques, we automate large-scale collection and labeling of channel data, specifically tailored to the evolving conditions of the environment. The introduced AoI is integrated with the loss function to prioritize more recent information to fine-tune deep learning models in case of performance degradation (model drift). The effectiveness of the proposed solution is demonstrated in realistic urban simulations, highlighting the trade-off between input resolution, computational cost, and model performance. A resolution reduction of 4x8 from an original channel sample size of (32, 1024) along the angle and subcarrier dimension results in a computational speedup of 32 times. The proposed fine-tuning successfully mitigates performance degradation while requiring only 1% of the available data samples, enabling automated and fast mitigation of model drifts.</description>

      <title>Robust Activity Detection for Massive Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive machine-type communications (mMTC) are fundamental to the Internet of Things (IoT) framework in future wireless networks, involving the connection of a vast number of devices with sporadic transmission patterns. Traditional device activity detection (AD) methods are typically developed for Gaussian noise, but their performance may deteriorate when these conditions are not met, particularly in the presence of heavy-tailed impulsive noise. In this paper, we propose robust statistical techniques for AD that do not rely on the Gaussian assumption and replace the Gaussian loss function with robust loss functions that can effectively mitigate the impact of heavy-tailed noise and outliers. First, we prove that the coordinate-wise (conditional) objective function is geodesically convex and derive a fixed-point (FP) algorithm for minimizing it, along with convergence guarantees. Building on the FP algorithm, we propose two robust algorithms for solving the full (unconditional) objective function: a coordinate-wise optimization algorithm (RCWO) and a greedy covariance learning-based matching pursuit algorithm (RCL-MP). Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly outperform existing algorithms in scenarios with non-Gaussian noise, achieving higher detection accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>Temporal Spectrum Cartography in Low-Altitude Economy Networks: A Generative AI Framework with Multi-Agent Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a two-stage generative AI (GenAI) framework tailored for temporal spectrum cartography in low-altitude economy networks (LAENets). LAENets, characterized by diverse aerial devices such as UAVs, rely heavily on wireless communication technologies while facing challenges, including spectrum congestion and dynamic environmental interference. Traditional spectrum cartography methods have limitations in handling the temporal and spatial complexities inherent to these networks. Addressing these challenges, the proposed framework first employs a Reconstructive Masked Autoencoder (RecMAE) capable of accurately reconstructing spectrum maps from sparse and temporally varying sensor data using a novel dual-mask mechanism. This approach significantly enhances the precision of reconstructed radio frequency (RF) power maps. In the second stage, the Multi-agent Diffusion Policy (MADP) method integrates diffusion-based reinforcement learning to optimize the trajectories of dynamic UAV sensors. By leveraging temporal-attention encoding, this method effectively manages spatial exploration and exploitation to minimize cumulative reconstruction errors. Extensive numerical experiments validate that this integrated GenAI framework outperforms traditional interpolation methods and deep learning baselines by achieving 57.35% and 88.68% reconstruction error reduction, respectively. The proposed trajectory planner substantially improves spectrum map accuracy, reconstruction stability, and sensor deployment efficiency in dynamically evolving low-altitude environments.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Aided Full-Duplex ISAC System with Self-Interference Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has shown significant potential for improving the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. In this paper, we model an MA-aided ISAC system operating in a communication full-duplex mono-static sensing framework. The self-interference channel is modeled as a function of the antenna position vectors under the near-field channel condition. We develop an optimization problem to maximize the weighted sum of downlink and uplink communication rates alongside the mutual information relevant to the sensing task. To address this highly non-convex problem, we employ the fractional programming (FP) method and propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm that jointly optimizes the beamforming, user power allocation, and antenna positions at the transceivers. Given the sensitivity of the AO-based algorithm to the initial antenna positions, a PSO-based algorithm is proposed to explore superior sub-optimal antenna positions within the feasible region. Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithms enable the MA system to effectively leverage the antenna position flexibility for accurate beamforming in a complex ISAC scenario. This enhances the system's self-interference cancellation (SIC) capabilities and markedly improves its overall performance and reliability compared to conventional fixed-position antenna designs.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Design for Downlink Pinching-Antenna Systems with QoS Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pinching antennas have recently garnered significant attention due to their ability to dynamically reconfigure wireless propagation environments. Despite notable advancements in this area, the exploration of energy efficiency (EE) maximization in pinching-antenna systems remains relatively underdeveloped. In this paper, we address the EE maximization problem in a downlink time-division multiple access (TDMA)-based multi-user system employing one waveguide and multiple pinching antennas, where each user is subject to a minimum rate constraint to ensure quality-of-service. The formulated optimization problem jointly considers transmit power and time allocations as well as the positioning of pinching antennas, resulting in a non-convex problem. To tackle this challenge, we first obtain the optimal positions of the pinching antennas. Based on this, we establish a feasibility condition for the system. Subsequently, the joint power and time allocation problem is decomposed into two subproblems, which are solved iteratively until convergence. Specifically, the power allocation subproblem is addressed through an iterative approach, where a semi-analytical solution is obtained in each iteration. Likewise, a semi-analytical solution is derived for the time allocation subproblem. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed pinching-antenna-based strategy significantly outperforms both conventional fixed-antenna systems and other benchmark pinching-antenna schemes in terms of EE.</description>

      <title>Rate-Distortion Optimization with Non-Reference Metrics for UGC Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Service providers must encode a large volume of noisy videos to meet the demand for user-generated content (UGC) in online video-sharing platforms. However, low-quality UGC challenges conventional codecs based on rate-distortion optimization (RDO) with full-reference metrics (FRMs). While effective for pristine videos, FRMs drive codecs to preserve artifacts when the input is degraded, resulting in suboptimal compression. A more suitable approach used to assess UGC quality is based on non-reference metrics (NRMs). However, RDO with NRMs as a measure of distortion requires an iterative workflow of encoding, decoding, and metric evaluation, which is computationally impractical. This paper overcomes this limitation by linearizing the NRM around the uncompressed video. The resulting cost function enables block-wise bit allocation in the transform domain by estimating the alignment of the quantization error with the gradient of the NRM. To avoid large deviations from the input, we add sum of squared errors (SSE) regularization. We derive expressions for both the SSE regularization parameter and the Lagrangian, akin to the relationship used for SSE-RDO. Experiments with images and videos show bitrate savings of more than 30\% over SSE-RDO using the target NRM, with no decoder complexity overhead and minimal encoder complexity increase.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Fluid Antenna System under Spatially-Correlated Rician Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) are among the most promising technologies for the sixth generation (6G) mobile communication networks. Unlike traditional fixed-position multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, a FAS possesses position reconfigurability to switch on-demand among $N$ predefined ports over a prescribed space. This paper explores the performance of a single-input single-output (SISO) model with a fixed-position antenna transmitter and a single-antenna FAS receiver, referred to as the Rx-SISO-FAS model, under spatially-correlated Rician fading channels. Our contributions include exact expressions and closed-form bounds for the outage probability of the Rx-SISO-FAS model, as well as exact and closed-form lower bounds for the ergodic rate. Importantly, we also analyze the performance considering both uniform linear array (ULA) and uniform planar array (UPA) configurations for the ports of the FAS. To gain insights, we evaluate the diversity order of the proposed model and our analytical results indicate that with a fixed overall system size, increasing the number of ports, $N$, significantly decreases the outage performance of FAS under different Rician fading factors. Our numerical results further demonstrate that: $i)$ the Rx-SISO-FAS model can enhance performance under spatially-correlated Rician fading channels over the fixed-position antenna counterpart; $ii)$ the Rician factor negatively impacts performance in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime; $iii$) FAS can outperform an $L$ branches maximum ratio combining (MRC) system under Rician fading channels; and $iv)$ when the number of ports is identical, UPA outperforms ULA.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evaluation of Multiple Active RISs for 5G MIMO Commercial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While numerous experimental studies have demonstrated the feasibility of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology, most have primarily focused on extending coverage. In contrast, this paper presents an experimental evaluation of multiple active RISs deployed in a 5G multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) commercial network, emphasizing enhancements in channel rank and throughput. We propose a low-complexity, codebook-based beamforming algorithm specifically tailored for multi-RIS configurations, which diversifies directional channels and reduces reliance on explicit channel state information. Field tests using a commercial base station and user equipment reveal that the multi-RIS system can improve channel rank and throughput by up to 14% compared to single-RIS deployments, while maintaining low computational complexity. These findings underscore the practical benefits of active multi-RIS systems for next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>Fiber Nonlinearity Mitigation in Coherent Optical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fiber nonlinearity represents a critical challenge to the capacity enhancement of modern optical communication systems. In recent years, significant research efforts have focused on mitigating its impact through two complementary approaches. On the one hand, researchers have investigated practical digital signal processing (DSP) techniques to mitigate or compensate for nonlinear impairments, such as reversing fiber propagation effects through digital backpropagation (DBP). However, the high computational complexity of these techniques often discourages their practical implementation. On the other hand, information-theoretic studies have sought to establish the capacity limits of the nonlinear optical fiber channel, providing a framework for evaluating the ultimate performance of existing optical networks and guiding the design of next-generation systems. This work reviews recent advances and proposes future directions for nonlinearity compensation and mitigation, including constellation shaping techniques and low-complexity DBP. Furthermore, it highlights the potential of these innovations both in advancing the theoretical understanding of fiber capacity limits and in enabling practical DSP implementations.</description>

      <title>Impact of Data Sparsity on Machine Learning for Fault Detection in Power System Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Germany's transition to a renewable energy-based power system is reshaping grid operations, requiring advanced monitoring and control to manage decentralized generation. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for power system protection, particularly for fault detection (FD) and fault line identification (FLI) in transmission grids. However, ML model reliability depends on data quality and availability. Data sparsity resulting from sensor failures, communication disruptions, or reduced sampling rates poses a challenge to ML-based FD and FLI. Yet, its impact has not been systematically validated prior to this work. In response, we propose a framework to assess the impact of data sparsity on ML-based FD and FLI performance. We simulate realistic data sparsity scenarios, evaluate their impact, derive quantitative insights, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this evaluation strategy by applying it to an existing ML-based framework. Results show the ML model remains robust for FD, maintaining an F1-score of 0.999 $\pm$ 0.000 even after a 50x data reduction. In contrast, FLI is more sensitive, with performance decreasing by 55.61% for missing voltage measurements and 9.73% due to communication failures at critical network points. These findings offer actionable insights for optimizing ML models for real-world grid protection. This enables more efficient FD and supports targeted improvements in FLI.</description>

Abstract: Accurately estimating the refractive environment over multiple frequencies within the marine atmospheric boundary layer is crucial for the effective deployment of radar technologies. Traditional parabolic equation simulations, while effective, can be computationally expensive and time-intensive, limiting their practical application. This communication explores a novel approach using deep neural networks to estimate the pattern propagation factor, a critical parameter for characterizing environmental impacts on signal propagation. Image-to-image translation generators designed to ingest modified refractivity data and generate predictions of pattern propagation factors over the same domain were developed. Findings demonstrate that deep neural networks can be trained to analyze multiple frequencies and reasonably predict the pattern propagation factor, offering an alternative to traditional methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) present significant challenges for reliable communication due to the dynamic nature of their channels. Studying channel coherence time is crucial, since it directly impacts the design of robust transmission schemes (e.g., channel estimation and precoding strategies). This paper evaluates the coherence time of non-terrestrial channels theoretically, revealing that the rapid mobility of non-terrestrial base stations (BSs) substantially reduces channel coherence time. Our results demonstrate that the presence and enhancement of the line-of-sight (LoS) channel play a crucial role in extending coherence time, thereby improving the stability of NTN links. Furthermore, unlike terrestrial networks, where beamwidth adjustments can effectively influence coherence time, our findings indicate that in NTNs, receiver beamwidth has a negligible effect under high-speed BS motion. These insights provide valuable guidelines for designing robust transmission schemes and adaptive signal processing techniques in future NTN deployments.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Precision Quantization: Make the Best Use of Bits Where They Matter Most</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization offers superior performance to fixed-precision quantization. It has been widely used in signal processing, communication systems, and machine learning. In mixed-precision quantization, bit allocation is essential. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new bit allocation framework for mixed-precision quantization from a search perspective. First, we formulate a general bit allocation problem for mixed-precision quantization. Then we introduce the penalized particle swarm optimization (PPSO) algorithm to address the integer consumption constraint. To improve efficiency and avoid iterations on infeasible solutions within the PPSO algorithm, a greedy criterion particle swarm optimization (GC-PSO) algorithm is proposed. The corresponding convergence analysis is derived based on dynamical system theory. Furthermore, we apply the above framework to some specific classic fields, i.e., finite impulse response (FIR) filters, receivers, and gradient descent. Numerical examples in each application underscore the superiority of the proposed framework to the existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Weakly Supervised Convolutional Dictionary Learning for Multi-Label Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) has emerged as a powerful approach for signal representation by learning translation-invariant features through convolution operations. While existing CDL methods are predominantly designed and used for fully supervised settings, many real-world classification tasks often rely on weakly labeled data, where only bag-level annotations are available. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised convolutional dictionary learning framework that jointly learns shared and class-specific components, for multi-instance multi-label (MIML) classification where each example consists of multiple instances and may be associated with multiple labels. Our approach decomposes signals into background patterns captured by a shared dictionary and discriminative features encoded in class-specific dictionaries, with nuclear norm constraints preventing feature dilution. A Block Proximal Gradient method with Majorization (BPG-M) is developed to alternately update dictionary atoms and sparse coefficients, ensuring convergence to local minima. Furthermore, we incorporate a projection mechanism that aggregates instance-level predictions to bag-level labels through learnable pooling operators.Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing MIML methods in terms of classification performance, particularly in low-label regimes. The learned dictionaries provide interpretable representations while effectively handling background noise and variable-length instances, making the method suitable for applications such as environmental sound classification and RF signal analysis.</description>

      <title>The PHD/CPHD filter for Multiple Extended Target Tracking with Trajectory Set Theory and Explicit Shape Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two methods for tracking multiple extended targets or unresolved group targets with elliptical extent shape. These two methods are deduced from the famous Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter and the Cardinality-PHD (CPHD) filter, respectively. In these two methods, Trajectory Set Theory (TST) is combined to establish the target trajectory estimates. Moreover, by employing a decoupled shape estimation model, the proposed methods can explicitly provide the shape estimation of the target, such as the orientation of the ellipse extension and the length of its two axes. We derived the closed Bayesian recursive of these two methods with stable trajectory generation and accurate extent estimation, resulting in the TPHD-E filter and the TCPHD-E filter. In addition, Gaussian mixture implementations of our methods are provided, which are further referred to as the GM-TPHD-E filter and the GM-TCPHD-E filters. We illustrate the ability of these methods through simulations and experiments with real data. These experiments demonstrate that the two proposed algorithms have advantages over existing algorithms in target shape estimation, as well as in the completeness and accuracy of target trajectory generation.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking CFAR and CNN-based Peak Detection Algorithms in ISAC under Hardware Impairments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peak detection is a fundamental task in radar and has therefore been studied extensively in radar literature. However, Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems for sixth generation (6G) cellular networks need to perform peak detection under hardware impairments and constraints imposed by the underlying system designed for communications. This paper presents a comparative study of classical Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR)-based algorithms and a recently proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based method for peak detection in ISAC radar images. To impose practical constraints of ISAC systems, we model the impact of hardware impairments, such as power amplifier nonlinearities and quantization noise. We perform extensive simulation campaigns focusing on multi-target detection under varying noise as well as on target separation in resolution-limited scenarios. The results show that CFAR detectors require approximate knowledge of the operating scenario and the use of window functions for reliable performance. The CNN, on the other hand, achieves high performance in all scenarios, but requires a preprocessing step for the input data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper treats the inverse problem of retrieving the electrical conductivity starting from boundary measurements in the framework of Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT). In particular, the focus is on non-iterative reconstruction methods that are compatible with real-time applications. In this work, the Kernel Method, a new non-iterative reconstruction method for Electrical Resistance Tomography, is presented. The imaging algorithm deals with the problem of retrieving one or more anomalies of arbitrary shape, topology, and size, embedded in a known background (inverse obstacles problem). The foundation of the Kernel Method is that if there exists a proper current density applied at the boundary (Neumann data) of the domain that is able to produce the same measurements with and without the anomaly, then this boundary source produces a power density that vanishes in the region occupied by the anomaly, when applied to the problem involving the background material only. Therefore, the Kernel Method consists of (i) evaluating a proper current density g at the boundary of the domain of interest, by solving a proper linear eigenvalue problem, (ii) solving one direct problem for the configuration without anomaly and driven by g, and (iii) reconstructing the anomaly as the region in which the power density is negligible. This new tomographic method has a very simple numerical implementation that requires a very low computational cost. In addition to theoretical results, an extensive numerical campaign proves the effectiveness of this new imaging method.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Characterization of the Resonator in the Chinese Transverse Flute (dizi)</title>

Abstract: The dizi is a traditional Chinese transverse flute and is most distinguished from the western flute by the presence of a hole covered by a wrinkled membrane. In this study, we analyze the linear acoustical behavior of the dizi resonator through a detailed acoustical model that incorporates drilled toneholes, back end-holes, membrane hole, and upstream embouchure hole. The input admittance of the dizi is measured and modeled using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) and Transfer Matrix Method with external Interactions (TMMI). In comparison to measurements, the TMMI is shown to more accurately model the dizi than the TMM when compared to measurements. Our analysis reveals that attaching the membrane shifts admittance peaks to lower frequencies, reduces their magnitude, and influences tuning and harmonicity for different peaks and fingerings. The study further shows that the upstream branch, which includes the embouchure hole, complicates the evaluation of the tonehole lattice cutoff frequency, suggesting that it may not need to be considered for flute instruments. Cutoff frequencies exhibit distinct groupings across fingerings, influenced by the different tonehole lattices in the dizi: finger-hole lattice and end-hole lattice.</description>

      <title>Solid State Bus-Comp: A Large-Scale and Diverse Dataset for Dynamic Range Compressor Virtual Analog Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtual Analog (VA) modeling aims to simulate the behavior of hardware circuits via algorithms to replicate their tone digitally. Dynamic Range Compressor (DRC) is an audio processing module that controls the dynamics of a track by reducing and amplifying the volumes of loud and quiet sounds, which is essential in music production. In recent years, neural-network-based VA modeling has shown great potential in producing high-fidelity models. However, due to the lack of data quantity and diversity, their generalization ability in different parameter settings and input sounds is still limited. To tackle this problem, we present Solid State Bus-Comp, the first large-scale and diverse dataset for modeling the classical VCA compressor -- SSL 500 G-Bus. Specifically, we manually collected 175 unmastered songs from the Cambridge Multitrack Library. We recorded the compressed audio in 220 parameter combinations, resulting in an extensive 2528-hour dataset with diverse genres, instruments, tempos, and keys. Moreover, to facilitate the use of our proposed dataset, we conducted benchmark experiments in various open-sourced black-box and grey-box models, as well as white-box plugins. We also conducted ablation studies in different data subsets to illustrate the effectiveness of the improved data diversity and quantity. The dataset and demos are on our project page: https://www.yichenggu.com/SolidStateBusComp/.</description>
