      <title>On the attenuation of waves through broken ice of randomly-varying thickness on water of finite depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent work of Dafydd and Porter [2024] on the attenuation of waves propagating through floating broken ice of random thickness is extended to consider water of non-shallow depth. A theoretical model of broken floating ice is analysed using a multiple scales analysis to provide an explicit expression for the attenuation of waves as they propagate from a region of constant thickness ice into a semi-infinite region of ice whose thickness is a slowly-varying random function of distance. Theoretical predictions are shown to compare well to numerical simulations of scattering over long finite regions of ice of randomly-varying thickness computed from an approximate depth-averaged model derived under a mild-slope assumption. The theory predicts a low-frequency attenuation proportional to the eighth power of frequency and a roll-over effect at higher frequencies. The relationship between the results and field measurements are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Non-Orographic Gravity Waves on Transport and Mixing: Effects of Oblique Propagation and Coupling to Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravity waves (GWs) are a fundamental driver of circulation, tracer transport, and mixing in the middle and upper atmosphere, but their treatment in global circulation models remains incomplete. In particular, standard parameterizations typically restrict propagation to the vertical and treat GW-turbulence interactions in only a rudimentary manner, potentially leading to systematic biases in simulated dynamics and transport. Here, we use the Multi-Scale Gravity-Wave Model (MS-GWaM) implemented in the Community Climate Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic Model UA-ICON, together with a novel theoretical framework, to quantify the impact of (i) oblique GW propagation and (ii) explicit bidirectional coupling between GWs and turbulence. Ensemble simulations reveal that allowing for oblique propagation lowers and cools the summer mesopause by shifting the deposition of momentum and heat to lower altitudes, reduces GW-induced vertical shear in the the middle and lower atmosphere, and enhances turbulent kinetic energy in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere. In contrast, coupling GWs to turbulence produces a nearly opposite mesopause response, lifting and warming the mesopause, while maintaining a reduction in wave-induced shear and further enhancing turbulence. Tracer experiments additionally show that turbulent coupling significantly increases mixing, particularly in regions of enhanced TKE, with implications for chemical redistribution. These results demonstrate that both oblique GW propagation and GW-turbulence interactions exert leading-order controls on mesosphere-lower thermosphere circulation, temperature structure, and tracer transport. Neglecting these processes in global models likely contributes to biases in the Brewer-Dobson circulation, energy balance, and constituent distributions, underscoring the need for next-generation GW parameterizations that capture these effects.</description>

      <title>Smoothing and spatial verification of global fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00936v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecast verification plays a crucial role in the development cycle of operational numerical weather prediction models. At the same time, verification remains a challenge as the traditionally used non-spatial forecast quality metrics exhibit certain drawbacks, with new spatial metrics being developed to address these problems. Some of these new metrics are based on smoothing, with one example being the widely used Fraction Skill Score (FSS) and its many derivatives. However, while the FSS has been used by many researchers in limited area domains, there are no examples of it being used in a global domain yet. The issue is due to the increased computational complexity of smoothing in a global domain, with its inherent spherical geometry and non-equidistant and/or irregular grids. At the same time, there clearly exists a need for spatial metrics that could be used in the global domain as the operational global models continue to be developed and improved, along with the new machine-learning-based models. Here, we present two new methodologies for smoothing in a global domain that are potentially fast enough to make the smoothing of high-resolution global fields feasible. Both approaches also consider the variability of grid point area sizes and can handle missing data appropriately. This, in turn, makes the calculation of smoothing-based metrics, such as FSS and its derivatives, in a global domain possible, which we demonstrate by evaluating the performance of operational high-resolution global precipitation forecasts provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.</description>

      <title>Using Diffusion Models to do Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent surge in machine learning (ML) methods for geophysical modeling has raised the question of how these methods might be applied to data assimilation (DA). We focus on diffusion modeling (a form of generative artificial intelligence) for systems that can perform the entire DA process, rather than on ML-based tools used within a conventional DA system. We identify at least three distinct types of diffusion-based DA systems and show that they differ in the posterior distribution they target for sampling. These posterior distributions correspond to different priors and/or likelihoods, which in turn result in unique training datasets, computational requirements, and state estimate qualities. Our analysis further shows that a diffusion DA system designed to target the same posterior distribution as current ensemble DA algorithms requires re-training at each DA cycle, which is computationally costly. We discuss the implications of these findings for the use of diffusion modeling in DA.</description>
