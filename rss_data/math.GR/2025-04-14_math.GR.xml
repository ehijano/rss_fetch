      <title>Generalized torsion in amalgams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a condition sufficient to ensure that an amalgam of groups is generalized torsion-free. As applications, we construct a closed 3-manifold whose fundamental group is generalized torsion-free and non bi-orderable; a one-relator group which is generalized torsion-free and non bi-orderable; and a group which is generalized torsion-free and non left-orderable.</description>

      <title>Orders of Products of Slanted Class Transpositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we continue the research initiated in the preprint: V. G. Bardakov, A. L. Iskra, Orders of products of horizontal class transpositions, arXiv:2409.13341, and related to S. Kohl's question on the orders of products of pairs of class transpositions. In the preprint, an answer was given to S. Kohl's question for horizontal class transpositions. In the present work, the products of pairs of slanted class transpositions are considered, and under certain conditions, their orders are determined, with it being established that the number of different orders is finite.</description>

      <title>Almost unimodular groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a locally compact group has open unimodular part if and only if the Plancherel weight on its group von Neumann algebra is almost periodic. We call such groups almost unimodular. The almost periodicity of the Plancherel weight allows one to define a Murray-von Neumann dimension for certain Hilbert space modules over the group von Neumann algebra, and we show that for finite covolume subgroups this dimension scales according to the covolume. Using this we obtain a generalization of the Atiyah-Schmid formula in the setting of second countable almost unimodular groups with finite covolume subgroups. Additionally, for the class of almost unimodular groups we present many examples, establish a number of permanence properties, and show that the formal degrees of irreducible and factorial square integrable representations are well behaved.</description>

      <title>Amenability of group actions on compact spaces and the associated Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amenability of group actions on topological spaces generalizes amenability of groups and has applications in group theory, such as characterizing $C^{*}$--exact groups. We characterized it in terms of Banach algebras. For a topological group $G$ , group amenability can be characterized through the amenability of the convolution Banach algebra $L^1(G)$. Here a Banach algebra $A$ is called amenable if all derivations from $A$ to any dual--type $A$--$A$--Banach bimodules are inner. We extended this result to discrete group actions on compact Hausdorff spaces, using a certain Banach algebra arising from the action and a weakened amenability condition of Banach algebras. We also proved a fixed point characterization of amenable actions, which improves the result by Dong and Wang (2015).</description>

Abstract: We study definably primitive pseudo-finite permutation groups of finite $SU$-rank. We show that if $(G,X)$ is such a permutation group, then the rank of $G$ can be bounded in terms of the rank of $X$, providing an analogue of a theorem of Borovik and Cherlin in the setting of definably primitive permutation groups of finite Morley rank.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08571v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to show that the fundamental group of any smooth complex algebraic variety cannot be realized as a lattice of any simply connected nilpotent Lie group whose Lie algebra is $p$-filiform Lie algebra such that neither abelian nor $2$-step nilpotent. Moreover, we provide a sufficient condition for a lattice in a simply connected nilpotent Lie group of dimension up to $6$ not to be isomorphic to the fundamental group of any smooth complex algebraic variety.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic independence for random permutations from surface groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an orientable hyperbolic surface of genus $g\geq 2$ with a marked point $o$, and let $\Gamma$ be an orientable hyperbolic surface group isomorphic to $\pi_{1}(X,o)$. Consider the space $\text{Hom}(\Gamma,S_{n})$ which corresponds to $n$-sheeted covers of $X$ with labeled fiber. Given $\gamma\in\Gamma$ and a uniformly random $\phi\in\text{Hom}(\Gamma,S_{n})$, what is the expected number of fixed points of $\phi(\gamma)$?
  Formally, let $F_{n}(\gamma)$ denote the number of fixed points of $\phi(\gamma)$ for a uniformly random $\phi\in\text{Hom}(\Gamma,S_{n})$. We think of $F_{n}(\gamma)$ as a random variable on the space $\text{Hom}(\Gamma,S_{n})$. We show that an arbitrary fixed number of products of the variables $F_{n}(\gamma)$ are asymptotically independent as $n\to\infty$ when there are no obvious obstructions. We also determine the limiting distribution of such products. Additionally, we examine short cycle statistics in random permutations of the form $\phi(\gamma)$ for a uniformly random $\phi\in\text{Hom}(\Gamma,S_{n})$. We show a similar asymptotic independence result and determine the limiting distribution.</description>

      <title>Abelian p-groups with a fixed elementary subgroup or with a fixed elementary quotient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his 1934 paper, G.\ Birkhoff poses the problem of classifying pairs $(G,U)$ where $G$ is an abelian group and $U\subset G$ a subgroup, up to automorphisms of $G$. In general, Birkhoff's Problem is not considered feasible. In this note, we fix a prime number $p$ and assume that $G$ is a direct sum of cyclic $p$-groups and $U\subset G$ is a subgroup. Under the assumption that the factor group $G/U$ is an elementary abelian $p$-group, we show that the pair $(G,U)$ always has a direct sum decomposition into pairs of type $(\mathbb Z/(p^n),\mathbb Z/(p^n))$ or $(\mathbb Z/(p^n), (p))$. Surprisingly, in the dual situation we need an additional condition. If we assume that $U$ itself is an elementary subgroup of $G$, then we show that the pair $(G,U)$ has a direct sum decomposition into pairs of type $(\mathbb Z/(p^n),0)$ or $(\mathbb Z/(p^n), (p^{n-1}))$ if and only if $G/U$ is a~direct sum of cyclic $p$-groups. We generalize the above results to modules over commutative discrete valuation rings.</description>

      <title>Around subgroups of Artin groups: derived subgroups and acylindrical hyperbolicity in the even FC-case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize to (certain) Artin groups some results previously known for right-angled Artin groups (RAAGs). First, we generalize a result by Droms, B. Servatius, and H. Servatius, and prove that the derived subgroup of an Artin group is free if and only if the group is coherent. Second, coherent Artin groups over non complete graphs split as free amalgamated products along free abelian subgroups, and we extend to arbitrary Artin groups admitting such a splitting a recent result by Casals-Ruiz and the first author on finitely generated normal subgroups of RAAGs. Finally, we use splittings of even Artin groups of FC-type to generalize results of Minasyan and Osin on acylindrical hyperbolicity of their subgroups.</description>

      <title>Graphical models for topological groups: A case study on countable Stone spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By analogy with the Cayley graph of a group with respect to a finite generating set or the Cayley-Abels graph of a totally disconnected, locally compact group, we introduce countable connected graphs associated to Polish groups that we term Cayley-Abels-Rosendal graphs. A group admitting a Cayley-Abels-Rosendal graph acts on it continuously, coarsely metrically properly and cocompactly by isometries of the path metric. By an expansion of the Milnor-Schwarz lemma, it follows that the group is generated by a coarsely bounded set and the group equipped with a word metric with respect to a coarsely bounded generating set and the graph are quasi-isometric. In other words, groups admitting Cayley-Abels-Rosendal graphs are topological analogues of the finitely generated groups. Our goal is to introduce this topological perspective to a geometric group theorist.
  We apply these concepts to homeomorphism groups of countable Stone spaces. We completely characterize when these homeomorphism groups are coarsely bounded, when they are locally bounded (all of them are), and when they admit a Cayley-Abels-Rosendal graph, and if so produce a coarsely bounded generating set.</description>

      <title>Dimensions of finitely generated simple groups and their subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct finitely generated simple torsion-free groups with strong homological control. Our main result is that every subset of $\mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$, with some obvious exceptions, can be realized as the set of dimensions of subgroups of a finitely generated simple torsion-free group. This is new even for basic cases such as $\{ 0, 1, 3 \}$ and $\{ 0, 1, \infty \}$, even without simplicity or finite generation, and answers a question of Talelli and disproves a conjecture of Petrosyan. Moreover, we prove that every countable group of dimension at least $2$ embeds into a finitely generated simple group of the same dimension. These are the first examples of finitely generated simple groups with dimension other than $2$ or $\infty$. As another application, we exhibit the first examples of torsion-free groups with the fixed point property for actions on finite-dimensional contractible CW-complexes, and construct torsion-free groups in all countable levels of Kropholler's hierarchy, answering a question of Januszkiewicz, Kropholler and Leary. Our method combines small cancellation theory with group theoretic Dehn filling, and allows to do several other exotic constructions with control on the dimension. Along the way we construct the first uncountable family of pairwise non-measure equivalent finitely generated torsion-free groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the finite solvable groups $G$ in which every real element has prime power order. We divide our examination into two parts: the case $\textbf{O}_2(G)&gt;1$ and the case $\textbf{O}_2(G)=1$. Specifically we proved that if $\textbf{O}_2(G)&gt;1$ then $G$ is a $\{2,p\}$-group. Finally, by taking into consideration the examples presented in the analysis of the $\textbf{O}_2(G)=1$ case, we deduce some interesting and unexpected results about the connectedness of the real prime graph $\Gamma_{\mathbb{R}}(G)$. In particular, we found that there are groups such that $\Gamma_{\mathbb{R}}(G)$ has respectively 3 and 4 connected components.</description>

Abstract: For any integers $p\geq 2$ and $q\geq 1$, let $\mathbb{H}^{p,q}$ be the pseudo-Riemannian hyperbolic space of signature $(p,q)$. We prove that if $\Gamma$ is the fundamental group of a closed aspherical $p$-manifold, then the set of representations of $\Gamma$ to $\mathrm{PO}(p,q+1)$ which are convex cocompact in $\mathbb{H}^{p,q}$ is a union of connected components of $\mathrm{Hom}(\Gamma,\mathrm{PO}(p,q+1))$. This gives new examples of higher-dimensional higher-rank Teichm\"uller spaces.</description>

      <title>Equivariant injectivity of crossed products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a $\mathbb{G}$-operator space $(X, \alpha)$, which consists of an action $\alpha: X \curvearrowleft \mathbb{G}$ of a locally compact quantum group $\mathbb{G}$ on an operator space $X$, and we make a study of the notion of $\mathbb{G}$-equivariant injectivity for such an operator space. Given a $\mathbb{G}$-operator space $(X, \alpha)$, we define a natural associated crossed product operator space $X\rtimes_\alpha \mathbb{G}$, which has canonical actions $X\rtimes_\alpha \mathbb{G} \curvearrowleft \mathbb{G}$ (the adjoint action) and $X\rtimes_\alpha \mathbb{G}\curvearrowleft \check{\mathbb{G}}$ (the dual action) where $\check{\mathbb{G}}$ is the dual quantum group. We then show that if $X$ is a $\mathbb{G}$-operator system, then $X\rtimes_\alpha \mathbb{G}$ is $\mathbb{G}$-injective if and only if $X\rtimes_\alpha \mathbb{G}$ is injective and $\mathbb{G}$ is amenable, and that (under a mild assumption) $X\rtimes_\alpha \mathbb{G}$ is $\check{\mathbb{G}}$-injective if and only if $X$ is $\mathbb{G}$-injective. We discuss how these results generalise and unify several recent results from the literature, and give new applications of these results.</description>
