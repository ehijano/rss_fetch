      <title>On a generalized principle of fractal stiffness self-similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The principle of fractal stiffness self-similarity is expanded to encompass structures with several differently-scaled contributors to the total stiffness matrix. The generalized principle is applied to solve the problem of a fractal triangular gasket that incorporates drilling modes, with a view to further applications to the modelling of fractal shells.</description>

      <title>Mathematical physics of dilute Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss recent progress in the mathematical analysis of dilute Bose gases. We review results in one to three dimensions, but the focus will be on three dimensions. In all dimensions we have a two term asymptotic expansion of the ground state energy density by an expression that depends only on the scattering length of the potential. In dimension three this is the celebrated Lee-Huang-Yang formula. In dimensions two and three the dilute limit is a weakly interacting regime whereas in dimension one it is rather strongly interacting. We sketch briefly the mathematical difficulties and review some remaining open problems in the field.</description>

      <title>Modeling and computing many-body electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene with mechanical relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and compute solutions of a many-body model of the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene which systematically accounts for the effects of structural relaxation. We model mechanical relaxation by coupling linear elasticity to a stacking energy that penalizes disregistry. Minimizers of the resulting functional are then input into a tight-binding model of twisted bilayer graphene, from which a single-particle continuum moir\'e-scale (Bistritzer-MacDonald-like) model is systematically derived. We then project this model together with a Coulomb electron-electron interaction term into the single-particle model's flat moir\'e bands. We numerically compute Hartree-Fock ground states of this model, comparing the relative energies of competing many-body ground states.</description>

      <title>Hilbert-Schmidt norm estimates for fermionic reduced density matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of $k$-particle reduced density matrices of $N$-body fermionic states is bounded by $C_kN^{k/2}$, which is of the same order as that of Slater determinant states. This generalises a recent result of Christiansen (2024) on 2-particle reduced density matrices to higher-order density matrices. Moreover, our estimate directly yields a lower bound on the von Neumann entropy and the 2-R\'enyi entropy of reduced density matrices, thereby providing further insight into conjectures of Carlen-Lieb-Reuvers (2016,2018).</description>

      <title>An efficient numerical method for surface acoustic wave equations over unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices are widely used in modern communication equipment and SAW equations describe the critical physical processes of acoustic-electric conversion in SAW devices. It is very challenging to numerically solve such equations, since they are typically three dimensional problems defined on unbounded domains. In this paper, we first use the perfectly matched layer method to truncate the unbounded domain and then propose a finite element tearing and interconnecting algorithm for the truncated equations based on the periodic structure of the truncated domain. We also design an effective solver for the ill-conditioned linear system of the Lagrange multipliers arising from discretization. Several numerical results are performed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Controllable diatomic molecular quantum thermodynamic machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present quantum heat machines using a diatomic molecule modelled by a $q$-deformed potential as a working medium. We analyze the effect of the deformation parameter and other potential parameters on the work output and efficiency of the quantum Otto and quantum Carnot heat cycles. Furthermore, we derive the analytical expressions of work and efficiency as a function of these parameters. Interestingly, our system reveals different operational phases for the range of parameter regimes considered, such as a quantum heat engine. In addition, the efficiency of the quantum Otto heat engine is seen to be tunable by the deformation parameter. Our findings provide useful insight for understanding the impact of anharmonicity on the design of quantum thermal machines.</description>

      <title>On Spinning Particles, their Partition Functions and Picture Changing Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the partition function for the $N=1$ spinning particle, including pictures and the large Hilbert space, and show that it counts the dimension of the BRST cohomology in two- and four-dimensional target space. We also construct a quadratic action in the target space. Furthermore, we find a consistent interaction as a derived bracket based on the associative product of world line fields, leading to an interacting theory of multiforms in space-time. Finally, we comment on the equivalence of the multiform theory with a Dirac fermion. We also identify the chiral anomaly of the latter with a Hodge anomaly for the multiform theory, which manifests itself as a deformation of the gauge fixing.</description>

      <title>Decay estimates for discrete bi-Schr\"{o}dinger operators on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the discrete Laplace operator $\Delta$ on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}$ satisfies the following sharp time decay estimate: $$\left\|e^{it\Delta}\right\|_{\ell^1\rightarrow\ell^{\infty}}\lesssim|t|^{-\frac{1}{3}},\quad t\neq0,$$ which is slower than the usual $|t|^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ decay in the continuous case on $\mathbb{R}$. However in this paper, we have showed that the discrete bi-Laplacian $\Delta^2$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ actually exhibits the same sharp decay estimate $|t|^{-\frac{1}{4}}$ as its continuous counterpart.
  In view of these free decay estimates, this paper further investigates the discrete bi-Schr\"{o}dinger operators of the form $H=\Delta^2+V$ on the lattice space $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})$, where $V(n)$ is a real valued potential of $\mathbb{Z}$. Under suitable decay conditions on $V$ and assuming that both 0 and 16 are regular spectral points of $H$, we establish the following sharp $\ell^1-\ell^{\infty}$ dispersive estimates: $$\left\|e^{-itH}P_{ac}(H)\right\|_{\ell^1\rightarrow\ell^{\infty}}\lesssim|t|^{-\frac{1}{4}},\quad t\neq0,$$ where $P_{ac}(H)$ denotes the spectral projection onto the absolutely continuous spectrum space of $H$. Additionally, the following decay estimates for beam equation are also derived: $$\|{\rm cos}(t\sqrt H)P_{ac}(H)\|_{\ell^1\rightarrow\ell^{\infty}}+\left\|\frac{{\rm sin}(t\sqrt H)}{t\sqrt H}P_{ac}(H)\right\|_{\ell^1\rightarrow\ell^{\infty}}\lesssim|t|^{-\frac{1}{3}},\quad t\neq0.$$</description>

      <title>Stochastic ordering, attractiveness and couplings in non-conservative particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the stochastic comparison of interacting particle systems allowing for multiple arrivals, departures and non-conservative jumps of individuals between sites. That is, if $k$ individuals leave site $x$ for site $y$, a possibly different number $l$ arrive at destination. This setting includes new models, when compared to the conservative case, such as metapopulation models with deaths during migrations. It implies a sharp increase of technical complexity, given the numerous changes to consider. Known results are significantly generalised, even in the conservative case, as no particular form of the transition rates is assumed.
  We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on the rates for the stochastic comparison of the processes and prove their equivalence with the existence of an order-preserving Markovian coupling. As a corollary, we get necessary and sufficient conditions for the attractiveness of the processes. A salient feature of our approach lies in the presentation of the coupling in terms of solutions to network flow problems.
  We illustrate the applicability of our results to a flexible family of population models described as interacting particle systems, with a range of parameters controlling births, deaths, catastrophes or migrations. We provide explicit conditions on the parameters for the stochastic comparison and attractiveness of the models, showing their usefulness in studying their limit behaviour. Additionally, we give three examples of constructing the coupling.</description>

      <title>The Levi-Civita connection and Chern connections for cocycle deformations of K\"{a}hler manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider unitary cocycle deformations of covariant $\ast$-differential calculi. We prove that complex structures, holomorphic bimodules and Chern connections can be deformed to their noncommutative counterparts under such deformations. If we start with a K\"ahler manifold, then the Levi-Civita connection on the space of one forms of the deformed calculus can be expressed as a direct sum of the Chern connections on the twisted holomorphic and the anti-holomorphic bimodules. Our class of examples include toric deformations considered by Mesland and Rennie as well as cocycle deformations of the Heckenberger-Kolb calculi.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic deformed kinematics leads to a loss of the absolute locality of interactions. In previous studies, some models of noncommutative spacetimes in a two-particle system that implements locality were considered. In this work, we present a characterization of the Poisson-Lie algebras formed by the noncommutative space-time coordinates of a multi-particle system and Lorentz generators as a possible restriction on these models. The relativistic deformed kinematics derived from these algebras are also discussed. Finally, we show its connection with cotangent bundle geometries.</description>

      <title>On the emergence of an almost-commutative spectral triple from a geometric construction on a configuration space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the structure of an almost-commutative spectral triple emerges in a semi-classical limit from a geometric construction on a configuration space of gauge connections. The geometric construction resembles that of a spectral triple with a Dirac operator on the configuration space that interacts with the so-called $\mathbf{HD}$-algebra, which is an algebra of operator-valued functions on the configuration space, and which is generated by parallel-transports along flows of vector-fields on the underlying manifold. In a semi-classical limit the $\mathbf{HD}$-algebra produces an almost-commutative algebra where the finite factor depends on the representation of the $\mathbf{HD}$-algebra and on the point in the configuration space over which the semi-classical state is localized. Interestingly, we find that the Hilbert space, in which the almost-commutative algebra acts, comes with a double fermionic structure that resembles the fermionic doubling found in the noncommutative formulation of the standard model. Finally, the emerging almost-commutative algebra interacts with a spatial Dirac operator that emerges in the semi-classical limit. This interaction involves both factors of the almost-commutative algebra.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable models for universal operator growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum observables of generic many-body systems exhibit a universal pattern of growth in the Krylov space of operators. This pattern becomes particularly manifest in the Lanczos basis, where the evolution superoperator assumes the tridiagonal form. According to the universal operator growth hypothesis, the nonzero elements of the superoperator, known as Lanczos coefficients, grow asymptotically linearly. We introduce and explore broad families of Lanczos coefficients that are consistent with the universal operator growth and lead to the exactly solvable dynamics. Within these families, the subleading terms of asymptotic expansion of the Lanczos sequence can be controlled and fine-tuned to produce diverse dynamical patterns. For one of the families, the Krylov complexity is computed exactly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The It from Qubit paradigm proposes that gravitational spacetimes emerge from quantum entanglement. So far, the main evidence for this involves holographic dualities, where the entangled qubits live in a dual nongravitational theory. In this essay, we argue that string theory provides the mechanism to define these entangled qubits in the bulk gravitating theory. This involves a local form of geometric transition, which is the stringy mechanism that underlies \emph{local} holography. We illustrate how this works in the A model topological string,</description>

Abstract: We study standing waves for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a discrete graph. We characterize for a self-adjoint realizations of Schr\"odinger operators conditions related with the geometry of the graph that guarantee discreteness of the spectrum and study ground states on the generalized Nehari manifold in order to prove the existence of standing wave solutions in the self-focusing and defocusing case. In this context, we show properties of the solutions, such as integrability. Finally, we discuss decay properties of solutions and the bifurcation of solutions from the trivial solution.</description>

      <title>From decay of correlations to locality and stability of the Gibbs state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that whenever the Gibbs state of a quantum spin system satisfies decay of correlations, then it is stable, in the sense that local perturbations affect the Gibbs state only locally, and it satisfies local indistinguishability, i.e. it exhibits local insensitivity to system size. These implications hold in any dimension, require only locality of the Hamiltonian, and are based on Lieb-Robinson bounds and on a detailed analysis of the locality properties of the quantum belief propagation for Gibbs states.
  To demonstrate the versatility of our approach, we explicitly apply our results to several physically relevant models in which the decay of correlations is either known to hold or is proved by us. These include Gibbs states of one-dimensional spin chains with polynomially decaying interactions at any temperature, and high-temperature Gibbs states of quantum spin systems with finite-range interactions in any dimension. We also prove exponential decay of correlations above a threshold temperature for Gibbs states of one-dimensional finite spin chains with translation-invariant and exponentially decaying interactions, and then apply our general results.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Hamiltonian structures of the kinetic equation for soliton gas under polychromatic reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deepen the existence of a nonlocal Hamiltonian formalism for the El's kinetic equation for soliton gas under the polychromatic reduction for a class of interaction kernels. The nonlocality presented is related to semi-Riemannian metrics of constant curvature, conformally flat metrics and hypersurfaces in a pseudo-Euclidean space. These results generalise a previous one that Vergallo and Ferapontov obtained with local Hamiltonian operators. Some examples as the Korteweg-de Vries, the Lieb-Liniger and the separable cases are analysed.</description>

      <title>Convergent Power Series for Anharmonic Chain with Periodic Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the case of a pinned anharmonic chain of oscillators, with coordinates $({\bf q},{\bf p})=\{(q_x, p_x):\,x\in\mathbb Z_N=\{-N, ......, N\}\}$, subjected to an external driving force $
  F(\cdot)$ of period $\theta=2\pi/\omega$ acting on the oscillator at $x=0$. The system evolves according to a Hamiltonian dynamics with frictional damping, $\gamma&gt;0$, present at both endpoints $x=-N,N$. The Hamiltonian is given by $$ H_N({\bf q},{\bf p})=\sum_{x\in\mathbb Z_N}\Big[\frac{p_x^2}2 + \frac12 (q_{x}-q_{x-1})^2 +\frac{\omega_0^2 q_x^2}{2}+\nu\big( V(q_x)+ U(q_x-q_{x-1})\big)\Big],$$ where $V(\cdot)$ and $U(\cdot)$ are $C^2$ smooth anharmonic pinning and interaction potentials with bounded second derivatives, $\omega_0&gt;0$ and $\nu \in \mathbb R$. We prove that if $\omega$ does not fall in the spectrum of the infinite harmonic system $I:=[\omega_0 ,\sqrt{\omega_0^2+4} ]$, then there exists a $\nu_0&gt;0$ such that for $\vert \nu\vert &lt;\nu_0$ the system approaches asymptotically in time a unique $\theta$-periodic solution, whose coordinates are given by a convergent power type series in $\nu$. The series coefficients are bounded and smooth functions of $\nu$. The value of $\nu_0$ is a lower bound on the radius of convergence, independent of $N$, the friction coefficient $\gamma&gt;0$ and ${\mathcal F}$. It depends only {on the supremum norm of $V''(\cdot)$ and $U''(\cdot)$} and the distance of the set of integer multiplicities of $\omega$ from $I$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of point-vortex type systems near thermal equilibrium: relaxation or not?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the long-time dynamics of point-vortex type systems near thermal equilibrium and to the possible emergence of collisional relaxation. More precisely, we consider a tagged particle coupled to a large number of background particles that are initially at equilibrium, and we analyze its resulting slow dynamics. On the one hand, in the spirit of the Lenard-Balescu relaxation for plasmas, we establish in a generic setting the outset of the slow thermalization of the tagged particle. On the other hand, we show that a completely different phenomenology is also possible in some degenerate regime: the slow dynamics of the tagged particle then remains conservative and the thermalization no longer holds in a strict sense. We provide the first detailed description of this degenerate regime and of its mixing properties. Note that it is particularly delicate to handle due to statistical closure problems, which manifest themselves as a lack of self-adjointness of the effective Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Resurgent Wilson loops in refined topological string</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the resurgent structures of Wilson loops in refined topological string theory. We argue that the Borel singularities should be integral periods, and that the associated Stokes constants are refined Donaldson-Thomas invariants, just like the free energies, except that the Borel singularities cannot be local flat coordinates. We also solve the non-perturbative series in closed form from the holomorphic anomaly equations for the refined Wilson loops. We illustrate these results with the examples of local P^2 and local P^1 x P^1.</description>

      <title>Non Hilbertian (Lorentzian) Length Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, the idea of finite dimensional $L^p$ spaces is transferred to Lorentzian length spaces to provide an example that is locally nowhere Minkowskian. Looking at the sectional curvature bounds of this example leads to the more general statement that normed spaces in which the norm does not come from an inner product, have no sectional curvature bounds. This statement holds in the Riemannian and Lorentzian cases. In addition, the Lorentzian $L^p$ space can be used as an example in the context of Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, to show that unbounded sectional curvature or geodesic regularity is in general not preserved in the GH limit, and as an example of a sequence of uniform bounded length spaces which are not GH pre-compact.</description>

      <title>Practical Introduction to Action-Dependent Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Action-dependent field theories are systems where the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian depends on new variables that encode the action. They model a larger class of field theories, including non-conservative behavior, while maintaining a well-defined notion of symmetries and a Noether theorem. This makes them especially suited for open systems. After a conceptual introduction, we make a quick presentation of a new mathematical framework for action-dependent field theory: multicontact geometry. The formalism is illustrated with a variety of action-dependent Lagrangians, some of which are regular and others singular, derived from well-known theories whose Lagrangians have been modified to incorporate action-dependent terms. Detailed computations are provided, including the constraint algorithm for the singular cases, in both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms. These are the one-dimensional wave equation, the Klein-Gordon equation and the telegrapher equation, Maxwell's electromagnetism, Metric-affine gravity, the heat equation and Burguers' equation, the Bosonic string theory, and (2+1)-dimensional gravity and Chern-Simons equation.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable conformal field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review 2d CFT in the bootstrap approach, and sketch the known exactly solvable CFTs with no extended chiral symmetry: Liouville theory, (generalized) minimal models, limits thereof, and loop CFTs, including the $O(n)$, Potts and $PSU(n)$ CFTs.
  Exact solvability relies on local conformal symmetry, and on the existence of degenerate fields. We show how these assumptions constrain the spectrum and correlation functions. We discuss how crossing symmetry equations can be solved analytically and/or numerically, leading to analytic expressions for structure constants in terms of the double Gamma function.
  In the case of loop CFTs, we sketch the corresponding statistical models, and derive the relation between statistical and CFT variables. We review the resulting combinatorial description of correlation functions, and discuss what remains to be done for solving the CFTs.</description>

      <title>Categories of orthosets and adjointable maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An orthoset is a non-empty set together with a symmetric and irreflexive binary relation $\perp$, called the orthogonality relation. An orthoset with 0 is an orthoset augmented with an additional element 0, called falsity, which is orthogonal to every element. The collection of subspaces of a Hilbert space that are spanned by a single vector provides a motivating example.
  We say that a map $f \colon X \to Y$ between orthosets with 0 possesses the adjoint $g \colon Y \to X$ if, for any $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$, $f(x) \perp y$ if and only if $x \perp g(y)$. We call $f$ in this case adjointable. For instance, any bounded linear map between Hilbert spaces induces a map with this property. We discuss in this paper adjointability from several perspectives and we put a particular focus on maps preserving the orthogonality relation.
  We moreover investigate the category OS of all orthosets with 0 and adjointable maps between them. We especially focus on the full subcategory iOS of irredundant orthosets with 0. iOS can be made into a dagger category, the dagger of a morphism being its unique adjoint. iOS contains dagger subcategories of various sorts and provides in particular a framework for the investigation of projective Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Resurgence of Tritronqu\'{e}es Solutions of the Deformed Painlev\'{e} I Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the formal $\hbar$-power series solution of the deformed Painlev\'{e} I equation is resurgent, which means it is generically Borel summable and its Borel transform admits endless analytic continuation. In particular, we find that the Borel transform defines a global multivalued holomorphic function on a singular algebraic surface isomorphic to the Fermat quintic surface $x^5 + y^5 + z^5 = 0$ modulo an involution. This surface is an algebraic fibration over the complex plane of the differential equation with generic fibre a smooth quintic curve. Each fibre is equipped with a fivefold covering map over another complex plane (the Borel plane) with ten ramification points (the Borel singularities) spread equally over two branch points giving two opposite Stokes rays.</description>
