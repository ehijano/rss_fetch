      <title>q3-MuPa: Quick, Quiet, Quantitative Multi-Parametric MRI using Physics-Informed Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3D fast silent multi-parametric mapping sequence with zero echo time (MuPa-ZTE) is a novel quantitative MRI (qMRI) acquisition that enables nearly silent scanning by using a 3D phyllotaxis sampling scheme. MuPa-ZTE improves patient comfort and motion robustness, and generates quantitative maps of T1, T2, and proton density using the acquired weighted image series. In this work, we propose a diffusion model-based qMRI mapping method that leverages both a deep generative model and physics-based data consistency to further improve the mapping performance. Furthermore, our method enables additional acquisition acceleration, allowing high-quality qMRI mapping from a fourfold-accelerated MuPa-ZTE scan (approximately 1 minute). Specifically, we trained a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to map MuPa-ZTE image series to qMRI maps, and we incorporated the MuPa-ZTE forward signal model as an explicit data consistency (DC) constraint during inference. We compared our mapping method against a baseline dictionary matching approach and a purely data-driven diffusion model. The diffusion models were trained entirely on synthetic data generated from digital brain phantoms, eliminating the need for large real-scan datasets. We evaluated on synthetic data, a NISM/ISMRM phantom, healthy volunteers, and a patient with brain metastases. The results demonstrated that our method produces 3D qMRI maps with high accuracy, reduced noise and better preservation of structural details. Notably, it generalised well to real scans despite training on synthetic data alone. The combination of the MuPa-ZTE acquisition and our physics-informed diffusion model is termed q3-MuPa, a quick, quiet, and quantitative multi-parametric mapping framework, and our findings highlight its strong clinical potential.</description>

      <title>First Positronium Lifetime Imaging using $^{52}$Mn and $^{55}$Co with a plastic-based PET scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positronium Lifetime Imaging (PLI) extends positron emission tomography by using the lifetime of positronium atoms as a probe of tissue molecular architecture. In this work, we report the first PLI measurements performed with $^{52}$Mn and $^{55}$Co using the modular J-PET. Four samples were studied in each experiment: two Certified Reference Materials (polycarbonate and fused silica) and two human tissues (cardiac myxoma and adipose). The selection of PLI events was based on the registration of two 511~keV annihilation photons and one prompt gamma in triple coincidence. From the resulting lifetime spectra we extracted the mean ortho-positronium lifetime $\tau_{\text{oPs}}$ and the mean positron lifetime $\Delta T_{\text{mean}}$ for each sample. The measured values of $\tau_{\text{oPs}}$ in polycarbonate using both isotopes matches well with the certified reference values. Furthermore, $^{55}$Co reproduced identical results for fused-silica measurements at their respective uncertainty levels. In contrast, measurements with $^{52}$Mn in fused silica show a minor deviation, which could be caused by the Parafilm spacer. In myxoma and adipose tissue, the reduced $\tau_{\text{oPs}}$ values are mainly linked to the long storage history of the samples rather than to the choice of isotope. Comparing peak-to-background ratios and spectral purity, $^{55}$Co provides cleaner PLI data under the same experimental conditions. Although $^{52}$Mn offers a longer half-life and a multi gamma cascade enhancing $\beta^{+}$ + $\gamma$ coincidences, but at the expense of higher background. In this study, we demonstrate that the applied selection criteria on the data measured with the modular J-PET can be used for PLI studies even with radionuclides with complex decay patterns.</description>

      <title>Iterative projected gradient descent for dynamic PET kernel reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction often presents high noise due to the use of short duration frames to describe the kinetics of the radiotracer. Here we introduce a new method to calculate a kernel matrix to be used in the kernel reconstruction for noise reduction in dynamic PET. We first show that the kernel matrix originally calculated using a U-net neural network (DeepKernel) can be calculated more efficiently using projected gradient descent (PGDK), with several orders of magnitude faster calculation time for 3D images. Then, using the PGDK formulation, we developed an iterative method (itePGDK) to calculate the kernel matrix without the need of high quality composite priors, instead using the noisy dynamic PET image for calculation of the kernel matrix. In itePGDK, both the kernel matrix and the high quality reference image are iteratively calculated using PGDK. We performed 2D simulations and real 3D mouse whole body scans to compare itePGDK with DeepKernel and PGDK. Brain parametric maps of cerebral blood flow and non-displaceable binding potential were also calculated in 3D images. Performance in terms of bias-variance tradeoff, mean squared error, and parametric maps standard error, was similar between PGDK and DeepKernel, while itePGDK outperformed these methods in these metrics. Particularly in short duration frames, itePGDK presents less bias and less artifacts in fast kinetics organs uptake compared with DeepKernel. itePGDK eliminates the need to define composite frames in the kernel method, producing images and parametric maps with improved quality compared with deep learning methods.</description>

      <title>Analytical phase kurtosis of the constant gradient spin echo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaussian phase approximation (GPA) underlies many standard diffusion magnetic resonance (MR) signal models, yet its validity is rarely scrutinized. Here, we assess the validity of the GPA by analytically deriving the excess phase kurtosis $\kappa_4/\kappa_2^2$, where $\kappa_n$ is the $n^{\text{th}}$ cumulant of the accumulated phase distribution due to motion. We consider the signal behavior of the spin echo with constant gradient amplitude $g$ and echo time $T$ in several one-dimensional model systems: (1) a stationary Poisson pore-hopping model with uniform pore spacing $\Delta x$ and mean inter-hop time $\tau_{\text{hop}}$; (2) a trapped-release model in which spin isochromats are initially immobilized and then released with diffusivity $D$ following an exponentially-distributed release time, $\tau_{\text{rel}}$; and (3) restricted diffusion in a domain of length $L$. To our knowledge, this is among the first systematic analytical treatments of spin echo phase kurtosis without assuming Gaussian compartments or infinitesimally short gradient pulses. In the pore-hopping system, $\kappa_4/\kappa^2_2 = (9/5)\tau_{\text{hop}}/T$, inversely proportional to the mean hop number, $T/\tau_{\text{hop}}$. In the trapped-release system, $\kappa_4/\kappa_2^2$ is positive and decreases roughly log-linearly with $T/\langle\tau_{\text{rel}}\rangle$, where $\langle\tau_{\text{rel}}\rangle$ is the average release time. For restriction, $\kappa_4/\kappa_2^2$ vanishes at small and large $L/\sqrt{DT}$, but has complicated intermediate behavior. There is a negative peak at $L/\sqrt{DT}\approx 1.2$ and a positive peak at $L/\sqrt{DT}\approx 4.4$. Monte Carlo simulations are included to validate the analytical findings. Overall, we find that the GPA does not generally hold for these systems under moderate experimental conditions, i.e., $T=10\;\mathrm{ms}$, $g\approx 0.2-0.6\;\mathrm{T/m}$.</description>

      <title>Finite element analysis of very large bone models based on micro-CT scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution voxel-based micro-finite element ($\mu$FE) models derived from $\mu$CT imaging enable detailed investigation of bone mechanics but remain computationally challenging at anatomically relevant scales. This study presents a comprehensive $\mu$FE framework for large-scale biomechanical analysis of an intact New Zealand White (NZW) rabbit femur, integrating advanced segmentation, scalable finite element solvers, and experimental validation using predominantly open-source libraries. Bone geometries were segmented from $\mu$CT data using the MIA clustering algorithm and converted into voxel-based $\mu$FE meshes, which were solved using the open-source MFEM library with algorithms designed for large-scale linear elasticity systems.
  The numerical solutions were verified by comparing with a commercial finite element solver, and by evaluating the performance of full assembly and element-by-element formulations within MFEM. Models containing over $8\times10^{8}$ DOFs were solved using moderate HPC resources, demonstrating the feasibility of anatomically realistic $\mu$FE simulations at this scale. Resolution effects were investigated by comparing models with voxel sizes of 20, 40, and 80 $\mu$m, revealing that 40 $\mu$m preserves boundary displacement and principal strain distributions with minimal bias while significantly reducing computational cost. Sensitivity analyses further showed that segmentation parameters influence the global mechanical response.
  Finally, $\mu$FE predictions were coupled with Digital Image Correlation measurements on an NZW rabbit femur under compression to calibrate effective bone material properties at the micron scale. The results demonstrate that large-scale, experimentally informed $\mu$FE modeling can be achieved using open-source tools, providing a robust foundation for preclinical assessment of bone mechanics and treatment-related risks.</description>

      <title>High Space-bandwidth Product Label-free Examination of iPSC-derived Brain Organoids via Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) is a promising quantitative phase imaging technique that enables high-resolution, label-free imaging over a large field-of-view. Here, we present the first application of FPM for the quantitative analysis of human brain organoid slices, providing a powerful, cost-effective, and label-free enhancement to the current gold-standard fluorescence microscopy. Brain organoids, prepared as thin (5 micrometer) slices, were imaged with a custom-built FPM system consisting of a standard light microscope (4x, 0.2 NA objective) and a 7x7 LED array. This configuration achieved a synthetic numerical aperture of 0.54 and a spatial resolution of approximately 488 nm across an area of 2.077 x 3.65 mm. Fluorescence microscopy was used in parallel for neurons, astrocytes, and nuclei labeling, providing rich fluorescence imaging. Moreover, we designed an automated method to merge classical resolution fluorescence images to visualize the whole brain organoid and align it with the numerically increased space-bandwidth product FPM image. The provided alignment method enables rich phase-fluorescence correlative imaging. Based on the segmentation performed on the stitched fluorescence images, we devised a quantitative phase analysis revealing a higher mean optical thickness of the nuclei versus astrocytes and neurons. Notably, nuclei located in neurogenic regions consistently exhibited significantly higher phase values (optical path difference) compared to nuclei elsewhere, suggesting cell-type-specific biophysical signatures. The label-free, quantitative, and high-throughput capabilities of the FPM approach demonstrated here make it a powerful and accessible tool for future structural and functional studies of whole-section brain organoid development and disease modeling studies.</description>

      <title>A novel Boltzmann equation solver for calculation of dose and fluence spectra distributions for proton beam therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approach.
  We solve the Boltzmann transport equation using an iterative procedure. Our algorithm accounts for Coulomb scattering and nuclear reactions. It uses the same physical models, as do the most rigorous Monte Carlo systems. Thereby it achieves the same low level of systematic errors.
  Our solver does not involve random sampling. The solution is not contaminated by statistical noise. This means that the overall uncertainties of our solver are lower than those realistically achievable with Monte Carlo. Furthermore, our solver is orders of magnitude faster. Its another advantage is that it calculates fluence spectra. They are needed for calculation of relative biological effectiveness, especially when advanced radiobiological models are used that may present a challenge for other algorithms.
  Main results.
  We have developed a novel Boltzmann equation solver, have written prototype software, and completed its testing for calculations in water. For 40-220 MeV protons we calculated fluence spectra, depth doses, three-dimensional dose distributions for narrow Gaussian beams. The CPU time was 5-11 ms for depth doses and fluence spectra at multiple depths. Gaussian beam calculations took 31-78 ms. All the calculations were run on a single Intel i7 2.9 GHz CPU. Comparison of our solver with Geant4 showed good agreement for all energies and depths. For the 1\%/1 mm $\gamma$-test the pass rate was 0.95-0.99. In this test, 1\% was the difference between our and Geant4 doses at the same point. The test included low dose regions down to 1\% of the maximum dose.</description>

      <title>Towards Interpretable AI in Personalized Medicine: A Radiological-Biological Radiomics Dictionary Connecting Semantic Lung-RADS and imaging Radiomics Features; Dictionary LC 1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with survival strongly dependent on early detection. Standard-dose computed tomography (CT) screening using the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) standardizes pulmonary nodule assessment but is limited by inter-reader variability and reliance on qualitative descriptors, while radiomics offers quantitative biomarkers that often lack clinical interpretability. To bridge this gap, we propose a radiological-biological dictionary that aligns radiomic features (RFs) with Lung-RADS semantic categories. A clinically informed dictionary translating ten Lung-RADS descriptors into radiomic proxies was developed through literature curation and validated by eight expert reviewers. As a proof of concept, imaging and clinical data from 977 patients across 12 collections in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) were analyzed; following preprocessing and manual segmentation, 110 RFs per nodule were extracted using PyRadiomics in compliance with the Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI). A semi-supervised learning framework incorporating 499 labeled and 478 unlabeled cases was applied to improve generalizability, evaluating seven feature selection methods and ten interpretable classifiers. The optimal pipeline (ANOVA feature selection with a support vector machine) achieved a mean validation accuracy of 0.79. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis identified key RFs corresponding to Lung-RADS semantics such as attenuation, margin irregularity, and spiculation, supporting the validity of the proposed mapping. Overall, this dictionary provides an interpretable framework linking radiomics and Lung-RADS semantics, advancing explainable artificial intelligence for CT-based lung cancer screening.</description>

      <title>A Dual-Tuned Concentric Multimodal RF Coil for 7T 1H/31P MRSI: Concurrently Enhancing B1 Efficiency Over Single-Tuned References</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the design, simulation, and experimental validation of a dual-tuned concentric multimodal surface coil for 7T 1H/31P magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), developed to significantly enhance 31P B1 efficiency while improving 1H performance. The coil architecture utilizes two interleaved sets of three concentric loop resonators. Intra-nucleus electromagnetic coupling within each three-loop set generates a spectrum of eigenmodes; the operational modes for 1H and 31P were specifically selected because their co-directed current distributions reinforce the magnetic field at the center, yielding B1 patterns that resemble those of conventional single-loop surface coils but with superior efficiency. Full-wave electromagnetic simulations and bench measurements on a fabricated prototype were conducted to characterize the multimodal resonance behavior, scattering parameters, B1 distribution, and 10-g local SAR, using size-matched conventional single-tuned loops as references. The results confirmed that the design reproducibly generated the predicted eigenmode ordering with sufficient spectral separation to prevent interference from parasitic or undesired modes. Notably, the multimodal design achieved an 83% boost in 31P B1 efficiency and a 21% boost in 1H B1 efficiency at the coil center compared to same-sized single-tuned references. Sufficient inter-nuclear decoupling was achieved to prevent signal leakage between channels, and simulations with a human head model confirmed that the peak 10-g local SAR remained comparable to conventional designs. These findings demonstrate that this multimodal concentric design offers a robust and highly efficient solution for multinuclear MRSI at ultrahigh fields, effectively mitigating the sensitivity limitations of X-nuclei without compromising proton-based imaging capabilities.</description>

      <title>Computational Analysis of Disease Progression in Pediatric Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive cardiopulmonary disease that leads to increased pulmonary pressures, vascular remodeling, and eventual right ventricular (RV) failure. Pediatric PAH remains understudied due to limited data and the lack of targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In this study, we developed and calibrated multi-scale, patient-specific cardiovascular models for four pediatric PAH patients using longitudinal MRI and catheterization data collected approximately two years apart. Using the CRIMSON simulation framework, we coupled three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models of the pulmonary arteries with zero-dimensional (0D) lumped-parameter heart and Windkessel models to simulate patient hemodynamics. An automated Python-based optimizer was developed to calibrate boundary conditions by minimizing discrepancies between simulated and clinical metrics, reducing calibration time from weeks to days. Model-derived metrics such as arterial stiffness, pulse wave velocity, resistance, and compliance were found to align with clinical indicators of disease severity and progression. Our findings demonstrate that computational modeling can non-invasively capture patient-specific hemodynamic adaptation over time, offering a promising tool for monitoring pediatric PAH and informing future treatment strategies.</description>

      <title>Circuit-free cardiovascular monitoring via skin-interfaced nanophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous cardiovascular monitoring is essential for managing circulatory health and disease, yet most wearable sensors are constrained by reliance on electrical transduction and built-in electronics. We present a circuit-free, wholly optical approach using diffraction from a skin-interfaced nanostructured surface to detect minute skin strains from the arterial pulse. A smartphone camera records the shifting diffraction pattern in real time, removing the need for spectrometers or other optical hardware. In phantom and human studies, we recovered high-fidelity arterial pulse waves and detected benign arrhythmic events in close agreement with a clinical reference. Derived waveforms captured features linked to arterial stiffness, a key cardiovascular risk marker. Our approach uses battery-free, cost-effective, and disposable platforms enabling scalable monitoring for healthcare and broad consumer applications.</description>

Abstract: Prenatal maternal stress alters maternal-fetal heart rate coupling, as demonstrated by the Fetal Stress Index derived from bivariate phase-rectified signal averaging. Here, we extend this framework using information-theoretical measures to elucidate underlying mechanisms. In 120 third-trimester pregnancies (58 stressed, 62 control), we computed transfer entropy (TE), entropy rate (ER), and sample entropy (SE) under multiple conditioning paradigms, employing mixed linear models for repeated measures. We identify dual coupling mechanisms at the short-term (0.5 - 2.5 s), but not long-term (2.5 - 5 s) time scales: (1) stress-invariant state-dependent synchronization, with maternal decelerations exerting approximately 60% coupling strength on fetal heart rate complexity - a fundamental coordination conserved across demographics; and (2) stress-sensitive temporal information transfer (TE), showing exploratory associations with maternal cortisol that require replication. A robust sex-by-stress interaction emerged in TE from mixed models, with exploratory female-specific coupling patterns absent in males. Universal acceleration predominance was observed in both maternal and fetal heart rates, stronger in fetuses and independent of sex or stress. We provide insight into the dependence of these findings on the sampling rate of the underlying data, identifying 4 Hz, commonly used for ultrasound-derived fetal heart rate recordings, as the necessary and sufficient sampling rate regime to capture the information flow. Information-theoretical analysis reveals that maternal-fetal coupling operates through complementary pathways with differential stress sensitivity, extending the Fetal Stress Index by elucidating causal foundations. Future studies should explore additional information-theoretical conditional approaches to resolve stress-specific and time-scale-specific differences in information flow.</description>
