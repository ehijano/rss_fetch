      <title>Physics-Informed Regression Modelling for Vertical Facade Surface Temperature: A Tropical Case Study on Solar-reflective Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban heat islands (UHIs) pose a critical challenge in densely populated cities and tropical climates where large amounts of energy are used to meet the cooling demand. To address this, Building and Construction Authority (BCA) of Singapore provides incentives for passive cooling such as using of solar-reflective material in its Green Mark guidelines. Thus, understanding about its real-world effectiveness in tropical urban environments is required. This study evaluated the effectiveness of solar-reflective cool paint using a hybrid modelling framework combining a transient physical model and data driven model through field measurements. Several machine learning algorithms were compared including multiple-linear regression (MLR), random forest regressor (RF), AdaBoost regressor (AB), extreme gradient boosting regressor (XGB), and TabPFN regressor (TPR). The results indicated that the transient physical model overestimated facade temperatures in the lower temperature ranges. The physics-informed MLR achieved best performance with improved accuracy for pre-cool paint (R2=0.96, RMSE=0.83C) and post-cool paint (R2=0.95, RMSE=0.65C) scenarios, reducing RMSE by 26% and 44%, respectively. The hybrid model also effectively predicted hourly heat fluxes revealing substantial reductions in surface temperature and heat storage with increasing albedo. The maximum net heat flux q_net was reduced by about 30-65 W/m2 in the post-cool paint stage (albedo = 0.73) compared to the pre-cool paint stage (albedo = 0.31). As albedo increases from 0.1 to 0.9, the sensitivity analysis predicts that the maximum daytime surface temperature will decrease by about 11C and the peak heat release of the net heat flux will decrease significantly from about 161 W/m2 to 27 W/m2.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Key Design Factors for Thermal Comfort in Underground Space Through Global Sensitivity Analysis and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study identified the key design factors related to thermal comfort in naturally ventilated underground spaces under high temperature condition (outdoor Tmax = 42.9$^\circ\mathrm{C}$) in Fuzhou, China. Fuzhou has a humid subtropical climate and is one of the three hottest cities in China in 2024. The reference roof measurement point showed the highest heat exposure (36.3% &gt;35$^\circ\mathrm{C}$) followed by pedestrian-level areas (20.4% &gt;35$^\circ\mathrm{C}$), while the underground remained consistently cooler (0% &gt;35$^\circ\mathrm{C}$). Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests confirmed significant differences (p &lt; 0.001) in environmental conditions (e.g., AT, GT, MRT, V, RH). Underground spaces showed the most stable and lowest PET (mean PET = 35.4$^\circ\mathrm{C}$) due to high thermal mass and shading, although moderate to intense thermal stresses still existed. Pedestrian-level spaces displayed greater PET variation (mean = 37.4$^\circ\mathrm{C}$) influenced by direct and diffuse solar radiation, while roofs suffered from extreme heat stress (mean PET = 40.6$^\circ\mathrm{C}$) peaking at 100% frequency from 9:00 to 14:00. Four distinct periods including early morning transition, evening transition, cooling, and heat stressing were identified for optimal underground space utilization as heat shelter. The global sensitivity analysis showed that variations in MET explained 60% of the variance in PET within the underground environment, followed by AT (20%), V (10%), MRT (5%), and RH (5%). The partial dependence analysis indicated that PET in underground space rose by approximately 7$^\circ\mathrm{C}$ when MET increased from 1 to 5 met, while a 1 m/s rise in V led to a 2$^\circ\mathrm{C}$ reduction in PET, suggesting shaded areas with good ventilation can significantly improve thermal comfort even if AT remains moderately high.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency atmospheric water harvesting enabled by ultrasonic extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric water harvesting technology, which extracts moisture from ambient air to generate water, is a promising strategy to realize decentralized water production. However, the prohibitively high energy consumption of heat-induced evaporation process of water extraction hinders the technology deployment. Here we demonstrate that vibrational mechanical actuation can be used instead of heat to extract water from moisture harvesting materials, offering about forty-five-fold increase in the extraction energy efficiency. We report the energy consumption for water extraction below the enthalpy of water evaporation, thus breaking the thermal limit of the energy efficiency inherent to the state-of-the-art thermal evaporation and making atmospheric water harvesting technology economically feasible for adoption on scale.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Exceptional Points by Interpolating Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are special points in non-Hermitian systems where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. In open quantum systems, these points are typically analyzed using effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or Liouvillian superoperators. While quantum channels offer the most general framework for describing state evolution in such systems, the existence and properties of EPs within this setting remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present a general strategy for generating quantum EPs for a single-qubit setting. We show that quantum channels can be separated into two distinct phases, with the transition between them marked by the presence of an EP. Based on this, we propose a systematic method to realize EPs by interpolating between quantum channels representing different phases. Experimentally, we implement these interpolated channels on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum computer and confirm the emergence of second-order EPs with high fidelity. Extending the interpolation to three channels further reveals third-order EPs. Our results establish quantum channel interpolation as a versatile framework for generating EPs and provide a general description of EPs in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Fast Recovery of Niobium-based Superconducting Resonators after Laser Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacing superconducting microwave resonators with optical systems enables sensitive photon detectors, quantum transducers, and related quantum technologies. Achieving high optical pulse repetition is crucial for maximizing the device throughput. However, light-induced deterioration, such as quasiparticle poisoning, pair-breaking-phonon generation, and elevated temperature, hinders the rapid recovery of superconducting circuits, limiting their ability to sustain high optical pulse repetition rates. Understanding these loss mechanisms and enabling fast circuit recovery are therefore critical. In this work, we investigate the impact of optical illumination on niobium nitride and niobium microwave resonators by immersing them in superfluid helium-4 and demonstrate a three-order-of-magnitude faster resonance recovery compared to vacuum. By analyzing transient resonance responses, we provide insights into light-induced dynamics in these superconductors, highlighting the advantages of niobium-based superconductors and superfluid helium for rapid circuit recovery in superconducting quantum systems integrated with optical fields.</description>

      <title>Optically Reconfigurable Electrodes for Dielectric Elastomer Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An optically addressable and configurable electrode architecture for dielectric elastomer actuators and arrays is described. It is based on embedding photoconductive, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires in the DEA to create electrodes. Normally, a network of ZnO nanowires is electrically insulating but it becomes conductive in the presence of UV light with a photon energy above the optical bandgap. Taking advantage of this characteristic optical induced switching behavior, we create an optically addressable electrode design, and create new, localized capacitor structures. As the ZnO nanowires are only conductive where, and when, illuminated the effective electrode structure is not fixed, as is the case with CNT and carbon-black electrodes currently used in DEAs. This provides greater, previously unattainable, freedom in the design of dielectric elastomer actuators for soft robotics and devices.</description>

      <title>1T'-MoTe$_2$ as an integrated saturable absorber for photonic machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the saturable absorption behavior of a 1T'-MoTe$_2$ monolayer integrated with a silicon nitride waveguide for applications in photonic neural networks. Using experimental transmission measurements and theoretical modeling, we characterize the nonlinear response of the material. Our model, incorporating quasi-Fermi level separation and carrier dynamics, successfully explains these behaviors and predicts the material's absorption dependence on the carrier density. Furthermore, we demonstrate a coupling efficiency of up to 20% between the 1T'-MoTe$_2$ monolayer and the silicon nitride waveguide, with saturation achievable at input powers as low as a few uW. These results suggest that 1T'-MoTe$_2$ is a promising candidate for implementing nonlinear functions in integrated photonic neural networks.</description>

      <title>Engineering Non-Hermitian Quantum Evolution Using a Hermitian Bath Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering quantum bath networks through non-Hermitian subsystem Hamiltonians has recently emerged as a promising strategy for qubit cooling, state stabilization, and fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, scaling these systems while maintaining precise control over their complex interconnections, especially in the optical domain, poses significant challenges in both theoretical modeling and physical implementation. In this work, drawing on principles from quantum and mathematical physics, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing non-Hermitian subsystems within entirely Hermitian photonic platforms. In particular, controlled exponential decay without actual absorption loss is realized in finite 1-D waveguide chains through discrete-to-continuum coupling and Lanczos transformations. Using this new methodology, we implement parity-time symmetric quantum systems and experimentally demonstrate that these artificial bath environments accurately replicate the dynamics of non-Hermitian arrangements in both single- and multi-photon excitation regimes. Since the non-Hermitian subsystem response deterministically arises from an artificially built Hermitian bath, the quantum evolution can be monitored via post-selection in this fully conservative configuration. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical models and experimental realizations, thus paving the way for exploiting quantum bath engineering in advanced information processing and emerging quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Modulation of sub-optical cycle photocurrents in an ultrafast near-infrared scanning tunnelling microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lightwave-driven scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) at near-IR frequencies promises an unprecedented combination of atomic spatial resolution and temporal resolution approaching the attosecond range. To achieve this goal, high-sensitivity optical control and detection of sub-cycle tunnelling currents must be achieved at the STM junction. Here, we demonstrate the generation and detection of coherent ultrafast currents across the junction of an STM illuminated by near-infrared single-cycle pulses. We introduce a novel modulation scheme that avoids time-dependent thermal loading while selectively isolating carrier-envelope phase (CEP)-dependent photocurrents. All artifacts arising from periodic modulation of laser power and thermal coupling are efficiently suppressed, enabling a clean readout of the coherent portion of the ultrafast tunneling current.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits remarkable electronic properties under external magnetic fields, notably the emergence of flat Landau levels. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of MATBG's operational phase diagram under three distinct quantum thermodynamic cycles, i.e., Quantum Otto Cycle (QOC), Quantum Carnot Cycle (QCC), and Quantum Stirling Cycle (QSC). Employing the continuum eight-band model, we evaluate the thermodynamic performance of MATBG across multiple operational modes: heat engine, refrigerator, cold pump, and Joule pump, and benchmark it against other graphene systems such as monolayer graphene, AB-Bernal stacked bilayer graphene, and non-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Our findings reveal that MATBG demonstrates superior heat engine performance in QSC, while achieving high efficiency albeit with reduced work output in QOC. Even though the performance of MATBG as a cold pump or refrigerator is modest in QOC and QSC, it shows notable improvement as a refrigerator in QCC. Additionally, we identify a highly reversible Joule pump mode in both QSC and QOC under strict adiabaticity, underscoring the unique thermodynamic behavior of MATBG.</description>

      <title>Chemical Control for the Morphogenesis of Conducting Polymer Dendrites in Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conducting polymer dendrite (CPD) morphogenesis is an electrochemical process that unlocks the potential to implement in materio evolving intelligence in electrical systems: As an electronic device experiences transient voltages in an open-space wet environment, electrically conductive structures physically change over time, programming the filtering properties of an interconnect as a non-linear analog device. Mimicking the self-preservation strategies of some sessile organisms, CPDs adapt their morphology to the environment they grow in. Either studied as an electrochemical experiment or as neuromorphic devices, the dependence of CPDs' electrical properties on the chemical nature of their environment is still unreported, despite the inter-dependence between the electrical properties of the electrogenerated material and the chemical composition of their growth medium. In this study, we report on the existing intrication between the nature and concentration of the electrolytes, electroactive compounds and co-solvents and the electrical and the electrochemical properties of CPDs in water. CPDs exhibit various chemical sensitivities in water: their morphology is highly dependent on the nature of the chemical resources available in their environment. The selection of these resources therefore critically influence morphogenesis. Also, concentrations have different impacts on growth dynamics, conditioning the balance between thermodynamic and kinetic control on polymer electrosynthesis. By correlating the dependencies of these evolving objects with the availability of the chemical resources in an aqueous environment, this study proposes guidelines to tune the degree of evolution of electronic materials in water. Such hardware is envisioned to exploit the chemical complexity of real world environments as part of information processing technologies.</description>

Abstract: Micro-transfer printing is an assembly technology that enables large-scale integration of diverse materials and components from micro- to nano-scale. However, traditional micro-transfer printing technologies lack dynamic selectivity, limiting capabilities in sorting and repairing materials and components for effective yield management during large-scale manufacturing and integration processes. In this work, we introduce a dynamically programmable micro-transfer printing system utilizing a sharp phase-changing polymer and an independently addressable microheater array to modulate adhesion through localized heating. The system demonstrates dynamically programmable capabilities for selective transfer of various materials including semiconductors, polymers and metals, handling geometries from micro-scale chiplets to nanometer-thick films and micro-spheres. It also exhibits exceptional capabilities in 3D stacking and heterogeneous materials integration, significantly advancing the manufacturability of complex microsystems. As a demonstration, we successfully perform dynamically programmable transfer of microLED chips to create arbitrarily specified patterns, offering a promising solution to the challenges of mass transfer and pixel repair in microLED display manufacturing.</description>

      <title>An ultrasonic transducer for vibration mode conversion of wedge-shaped structure of acoustic black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustic black hole (ABH) structure has been extensively employed in applications such as vibration mitigation, noise reduction, and energy harvesting, owing to its unique sound wave trapping and energy concentration effects. Furthermore, ABH structure shows significant promise in improving the performance of ultrasonic device and constructing multifunctional acoustic field. Therefore, this paper proposes an ultrasonic mode-conversion transducer consisting of a Langevin transducer and an ABH wedge radiant plate to investigate the potential applications of ABH in ultrasonic levitation and multifunctional particle manipulation. The theoretical model of flexural vibration of the radiant plate was established by utilizing Timoshenko beam theory and transfer matrix method, and the calculated vibration frequencies demonstrated good agreement with those obtained from finite element simulations (FES). The electrical impedance frequency response characteristics, vibration modes and the near-field sound pressure distribution of the transducer in air were also simulated. The results revealed that the amplitude of the ABH wedge radiant plate increases stepwise, and the sound pressure exhibits a gradient distribution. A prototype of the transducer was fabricated and experimentally tested, confirming the accuracy of FES and the feasibility of the design approach. Finally, the ultrasonic levitation experiment demonstrated that the ABH design enables the formation of gradient distribution of sound pressure in the standing wave sound field, thereby facilitating precise particle sorting.</description>

      <title>Subharmonic entrainment and limit cycle modulation by high frequency excitation: A Renormalization group approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the possibility of a sub-harmonic $(1{:}2)$ entrainment and supercritical Hopf bifurcation in a van der Pol-Duffing oscillator that has been excited by two frequencies, comprising a slow parametric drive and a fast external forcing, through the variation of the amplitude of the external fast signal. We also deduce the condition for the threshold parametric strength required to generate sub-harmonic oscillation. The Blekhman perturbation (direct partition of motion) and the Renormalization group technique have been employed to study how the signal amplitude plays a pivotal role in modulating the limit cycle dynamics as well as the subharmonic generation. Studies of nonlinear responses and bifurcations of such driven nonlinear systems are usually done by treating the strength of the fast drive as the control parameter. Here we show that, beyond its role in allowing one to study the dynamics with the slow and fast components nicely separated, the amplitude of the high-frequency signal can also be treated as an independent control parameter for controlling both the limit cycle behavior and the onset of subharmonic oscillation in the oscillator. Our analytical estimations are well supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Remote Entangling Gates for Spin Qubits in Quantum Dots using a Charge-Sensitive Superconducting Coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to realize microwave-activated CZ gates between two remote spin qubits in quantum dots using a charge-sensitive superconducting coupler. The qubits are longitudinally coupled to the coupler, so that the transition frequency of the coupler depends on the logical qubit states; a capacitive network model using first-quantized charge operators is developed to illustrate this. Driving the coupler transition then implements a conditional phase shift on the qubits. Two pulsing schemes are investigated: a rapid, off-resonant pulse with constant amplitude, and a pulse with envelope engineering that incorporates dynamical decoupling to mitigate charge noise. We develop non-Markovian time-domain simulations to accurately model gate performance in the presence of $1/f^\beta$ charge noise. Simulation results indicate that a CZ gate fidelity exceeding 90% is possible with realistic parameters and noise models.</description>

      <title>Wettability and sp2/sp3 ratio effects on supercapacitor performance of N-doped hydrogenated amorphous Carbon Nanofoam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13264v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsed laser-deposited amorphous carbon nanofoams are potential candidate for electrochemical energy storage applications due to ultra-light weight, large volumetric void fractions, and co-existence of sp, sp2 and sp3 carbon hybridization. It is known that charge storage in carbon nanostructures containing disordered sp2-domains is determined by their wettability, surface area, and porosity. However, their charge-storage performance is limited to the areal capacitance of the order of a few mF/cm2. We enhanced the supercapacitor performance of nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon nanofoam by engineering its wettability and sp2-C/sp3-C ratio by vacuum annealing. The specific capacitance was enhanced by about fifty times and the device voltage increased from 0.8 to 1.1 V compared to as-grown carbon nanofoam. In addition, we examined for the first time the initial increase in specific capacitance of the aqueous symmetric supercapacitor with respect to the scan rate, employing in-situ measurements coupling Raman spectroscopy and electrochemistry. We attribute this effect, observed but generally not explained in previous works in the literature, to the electrochemical activation induced by structural changes during the charge storage performance. This optimization of pulsed laser deposited carbon nanofoam may open an avenue for fabricating lightweight and porous nanostructures for advanced macro-to-micro-supercapacitor devices.</description>

      <title>Role of defects in atom probe analysis of sol-gel silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon dioxide is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature so that they can be analysed at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La-APT). To achieve this goal, in this study we show that UV and deep UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</description>
