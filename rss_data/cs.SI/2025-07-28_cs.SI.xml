      <title>Fixed points of Personalized PageRank centrality: From irreducible to reducible networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the PageRank of a complex network as a function of its personalization vector. By using this approach, a complete characterization of the existence and uniqueness of fixed points of PageRank of a graph is given in terms of the number and nature of its strongly connected components. The method presented includes the use of a feedback-PageRank in order to compute exactly the fixed points following the classic Power's Method in terms of the (left-hand) Perron vector of each strongly connected components.</description>

      <title>Negative news posts are less prevalent and generate lower user engagement than non-negative news posts across six countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although news negativity is often studied, missing is comparative evidence on the prevalence of and engagement with negative political and non-political news posts on social media. We use 6,081,134 Facebook posts published between January 1, 2020, and April 1, 2024, by 97 media organizations in six countries (U.S., UK, Ireland, Poland, France, Spain) and develop two multilingual classifiers for labeling posts as (non-)political and (non-)negative. We show that: (1) negative news posts constitute a relatively small fraction (12.6%); (2) political news posts are neither more nor less negative than non-political news posts; (3) U.S. political news posts are less negative relative to the other countries on average (40% lower odds); (4) Negative news posts get 15% fewer likes and 13% fewer comments than non-negative news posts. Lastly, (5) we provide estimates of the proportion of the total volume of user engagement with negative news posts and show that only between 10.2% to 13.1% of engagement is linked to negative posts by the analyzed news organizations.</description>

      <title>Changes to the Facebook Algorithm Decreased News Visibility Between 2021-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platforms, especially Facebook, are primary news sources in the US. In its widely criticized "War on News," Meta algorithmically deprioritized news and political content. We use data from 40 news organizations (5,243,302 Facebook posts, 7,875,372,958 user reactions) and 21 non-news pages (396,468 posts; 1,909,088,308 reactions) between January 1, 2016 and February 13, 2025 to examine how these changes influenced news visibility on the platform. Reactions to news declined by 78% between 2021 and 2024 while reactions to non-news pages increased, indicating targeted suppression of news visibility. Low-quality sources were especially suppressed, yet the 2025 end to "War on News" increased user reactions to news, especially low-quality ones. These changes do not reflect decreased news supply, Facebook user base, or interest in news over this period.</description>

      <title>CityHood: An Explainable Travel Recommender System for Cities and Neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present CityHood, an interactive and explainable recommendation system that suggests cities and neighborhoods based on users' areas of interest. The system models user interests leveraging large-scale Google Places reviews enriched with geographic, socio-demographic, political, and cultural indicators. It provides personalized recommendations at city (Core-Based Statistical Areas - CBSAs) and neighborhood (ZIP code) levels, supported by an explainable technique (LIME) and natural-language explanations. Users can explore recommendations based on their stated preferences and inspect the reasoning behind each suggestion through a visual interface. The demo illustrates how spatial similarity, cultural alignment, and interest understanding can be used to make travel recommendations transparent and engaging. This work bridges gaps in location-based recommendation by combining a kind of interest modeling, multi-scale analysis, and explainability in a user-facing system.</description>

      <title>A Distributed Approach for Agile Supply Chain Decision-Making Based on Network Attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the frequent occurrence of disruptions has had a negative impact on global supply chains. To stay competitive, enterprises strive to remain agile through the implementation of efficient and effective decision-making strategies in reaction to disruptions. A significant effort has been made to develop these agile disruption mitigation approaches, leveraging both centralized and distributed decision-making strategies. Though trade-offs of centralized and distributed approaches have been analyzed in existing studies, no related work has been found on understanding supply chain performance based on the network attributes of the disrupted supply chain entities. In this paper, we characterize supply chains from a capability and network topological perspective and investigate the use of a distributed decision-making approach based on classical multi-agent frameworks. The performance of the distributed framework is evaluated through a comprehensive case study that investigates the performance of the supply chain as a function of the network structure and agent attributes within the network in the presence of a disruption. Comparison to a centralized decision-making approach highlights trade-offs between performance, computation time, and network communication based on the decision-making strategy and network architecture. Practitioners can use the outcomes of our studies to design response strategies based on agent capabilities, network attributes, and desired supply chain performance.</description>

      <title>Epidemiology-informed Network for Robust Rumor Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12949v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid spread of rumors on social media has posed significant challenges to maintaining public trust and information integrity. Since an information cascade process is essentially a propagation tree, recent rumor detection models leverage graph neural networks to additionally capture information propagation patterns, thus outperforming text-only solutions. Given the variations in topics and social impact of the root node, different source information naturally has distinct outreach capabilities, resulting in different heights of propagation trees. This variation, however, impedes the data-driven design of existing graph-based rumor detectors. Given a shallow propagation tree with limited interactions, it is unlikely for graph-based approaches to capture sufficient cascading patterns, questioning their ability to handle less popular news or early detection needs. In contrast, a deep propagation tree is prone to noisy user responses, and this can in turn obfuscate the predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel Epidemiology-informed Network (EIN) that integrates epidemiological knowledge to enhance performance by overcoming data-driven methods sensitivity to data quality. Meanwhile, to adapt epidemiology theory to rumor detection, it is expected that each users stance toward the source information will be annotated. To bypass the costly and time-consuming human labeling process, we take advantage of large language models to generate stance labels, facilitating optimization objectives for learning epidemiology-informed representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EIN not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets but also exhibits enhanced robustness across varying tree depths.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Climate Change Debate in Italy through Information Supply and Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate change is one of the most critical challenges of the twenty-first century. Public understanding of climate issues and of the goals regarding the climate transition is essential to translate awareness into concrete actions. In this context, social media platforms play a crucial role in disseminating information about climate change and climate policy. To better understand the dynamics of information circulation and the emergence of information voids we propose a model that takes into account the supply and demand of information related to the Italian climate-transition discourse. We conceptualise information supply as the production of content on Facebook, Instagram and GDELT (an online news database) while leveraging Google searches to capture information demand. Our findings highlight responsiveness and temporal coupling between supply and demand, particularly during moments of heightened public attention triggered by significant external events. These responsive interactions reveal an overall adaptive information ecosystem. However, we also observe persistent information voids which may limit public understanding and delay meaningful engagement.</description>
