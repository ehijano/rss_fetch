      <title>Exploring Smartphone-based Spectrophotometry for Nutrient Identification and Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11027v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imbalanced nutrition is a global health issue with significant downstream effects. Current methods of assessing nutrient levels face several limitations, with accessibility being a major concern. In this paper, we take a step towards accessibly measuring nutrient status within the body. We explore the potential of smartphone-based spectrophotometry for identifying and quantifying nutrients in a solution by building and testing two prototype devices. We compared the prototypes and found that the limitations posed by the initial, simpler prototype were well addressed in the more portable and reliable second-generation device. With the second-generation prototype, we created and implemented a semi-automatic signal processing and analysis pipeline for analyzing absorption spectra. We thoroughly evaluated the prototypes by analyzing the effect of four different light sources and three reference spectra strategies. Results demonstrate that an LED bulb light source performed best, and all reference spectra strategies performed similarly. We then compared the second-generation prototype to a benchtop laboratory spectrophotometer to further validate the device. We applied the Beer-Lambert Law to demonstrate that our prototype is able to quantify the amount of vitamin B12 in a solution with an accuracy of up to 91.3%. Our in-depth analyses, discussions, and results demonstrate the potential use of smartphone-based spectrophotometry as an accessible method to identify and quantify nutrients and pave the way for future developments that can apply this approach to the human body.</description>

      <title>FLASH-enabled Proton SBRT for a challenging case of spine metastasis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FLASH effect, characterized by potential sparing of organs at risk (OAR) through ultra-high dose rate irradiation, has garnered significant attention for its capability to address indications previously untreatable at conventional dose rates (DR) with hypofractionated schemes. While considerable biological research is needed to understand the FLASH effect and determine the FLASH modifying factors (FMF) for individual OARs, exploratory treatment planning studies have also emerged. This study aims to show that spinal metastases are candidate treatment sites likely to benefit from this phenomenon and establish the requisite FMFs to achieve the protective FLASH effect. A conformal FLASH Proton SBRT plan was generated for a patient with spine metastasis in a research version of RayStation11B (RaySearch laboratories AB, Stockhom) on an IBA Proteus Plus system. Two oblique posterior beams were used in the plan. The prescribed dose to the CTV was set according to 3 different fractionation regimens: 5 fractions (fx) of 7 Gy, 8 fx of 5 Gy, and 10 fx of 4.2 Gy. Spot filtering and sorting techniques were applied to maximize the 5% pencil beam scanning DR in the spinal cord (SC). The FLASH effect was assumed to be observed within irradiated regions above 40 Gy/s and 4 Gy per fraction. The generated plans successfully ensure robust target coverage in each fraction. The volume of SC that does not comply with the clinical goal adheres to the FLASH effect conditions in each fraction. Depending on the aforementioned fractionation schemes used, a FMF of approximately 0.6 to 0.8 is necessary to enable such treatment in FLASH conditions. Our study demonstrates the potential of hypofractionated FLASH PT in treating spine metastasis while preserving SC integrity. This approach could enable more effective treatment of spinal metastases, potentially preventing SC compression and paralysis in these patients.</description>

      <title>Physically motivated projection of the electrocardiogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a physically motivated projection of the 12 lead electrocardiogram, based on a deep learning model trained on 21,799 recordings from the PTB-XL database, that allows the separation between left and right ventricular activity. We show that the observed dyssynchrony is in accordance with other experimental methods. The PhysECG method may be considered a reduced solution to inverse problem of ECG imaging, which reconstructs the epicardial potentials and enables a good qualitative assessment of pathological changes. The foundations of the model are based on a molecular approach to biopotential propagation. We present the quality metrics for the reconstruction based on the model on testing set selected from the PTB database. The heart's activity in view of the method is decomposed into two disjoint processes: the passage of the electric activation wavefront and the response of cardiomyocytes. We introduce the idea of the electrode-resolved activity function, which represents the mass of the ventricle in Phase 0 of action potential within the lead field of each electrode. We also show the effects of the population distribution of the anatomical position of the septum with regard to the direction of the V3 electrode. We present and discuss four healthy controls: male and female, right bundle branch block, and anterior myocardial infarction. We demonstrate that the results obtained using PhysECG are in accordance with the functional changes evoked by pathology. The algorithm may be used to reconstruct the activity on any 12 lead or Holter recordings. The method offers limited power of ECG imaging based entirely on sole ECG, which presents an affordable solution accessible for low and middle-income countries where access to resource-demanding imaging modalities is limited.</description>

      <title>Defining myocardial fiber bundle architecture in atrial digital twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key component in developing atrial digital twins (ADT) - virtual representations of patients' atria - is the accurate prescription of myocardial fibers which are essential for the tissue characterization. Due to the difficulty of reconstructing atrial fibers from medical imaging, a widely used strategy for fiber generation in ADT relies on mathematical models. Existing methodologies utilze semi-automatic approaches, are tailored to specific morphologies, and lack rigorous validation against imaging fiber data. In this study, we introduce a novel atrial Laplace-Dirichlet-Rule-Based Method (LDRBM) for prescribing highly detailed myofiber orientations and providing robust regional annotation in bi-atrial morphologies of any complexity. The robustness of our approach is verified in eight extremely detailed bi-atrial geometries, derived from a sub-millimiter Diffusion-Tensor-Magnetic-Resonance Imaging (DTMRI) human atrial fiber dataset. We validate the LDRBM by quantitatively recreating each of the DTMRI fiber architectures: a comprehensive comparison with DTMRI ground truth data is conducted, investigating differences between electrophysiology (EP) simulations provided by either LDRBM and DTMRI fibers. Finally, we demonstrate that the novel LDRBM outperforms current state-of-the-art fiber models, confirming the exceptional accuracy of our methodology and the critical importance of incorporating detailed fiber orientations in EP simulations. Ultimately, this work represents a fundamental step toward the development of physics-based digital twins of the human atria, establishing a new standard for prescribing fibers in ADT.</description>

      <title>3D printing by two-photon polymerization of hollow microneedles for interstitial fluid extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) is a rich source of biomarkers (e.g., glucose) that can be used for continuous health monitoring with wearable sensors. Hollow microneedle devices are a promising solution to extract ISF on demand by penetrating the skin with minimal pain. However, they rely on inserting bio-incompatible materials (e.g., silicon) into individuals, limiting the application time. Here, the direct 3D printing of polymer hollow microneedles on silicon-based microfluidic devices and the successful in-vivo extraction of ISF are demonstrated. Our additive manufacturing approach enables the versatile combination of materials and rapid prototyping of microneedle geometry. After improving the design through finite element modeling, a hollow microneedle geometry was printed by two-photon polymerization and experimentally characterized with mechanical and fluidic tests. Microneedles were fabricated with high accuracy (i.e., 997 +/- 2 um) and reliably interfaced with the microfluidic chip (i.e., centerline alignment within 5% of diameter). The needles demonstrated sufficient mechanical strength (i.e., 411 +/- 3 mN per needle) to endure at least 10 consecutive insertions into simulated skin. Biocompatibility and ISF extraction were demonstrated in an in-vivo 72-hour test, showing the safety and reliability of our approach. Such a platform is promising for minimally invasive, continuous monitoring of biomarkers in ISF, aiding in medical diagnoses and personalized health treatments.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity 3D Lung CT Synthesis in ARDS Swine Models Using Score-Based 3D Residual Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe condition characterized by lung inflammation and respiratory failure, with a high mortality rate of approximately 40%. Traditional imaging methods, such as chest X-rays, provide only two-dimensional views, limiting their effectiveness in fully assessing lung pathology. Three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) offers a more comprehensive visualization, enabling detailed analysis of lung aeration, atelectasis, and the effects of therapeutic interventions. However, the routine use of CT in ARDS management is constrained by practical challenges and risks associated with transporting critically ill patients to remote scanners. In this study, we synthesize high-fidelity 3D lung CT from 2D generated X-ray images with associated physiological parameters using a score-based 3D residual diffusion model. Our preliminary results demonstrate that this approach can produce high-quality 3D CT images that are validated with ground truth, offering a promising solution for enhancing ARDS management.</description>

      <title>Optical matrix imaging applied to embryology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution label-free imaging of oocytes and embryos is essential for in vitro fertilization procedures. Yet conventional microscopy fails in this task because of aberrations and multiple scattering induced by refractive index heterogeneities inside the sample. These detrimental phenomena drastically degrade the images of early embryos particularly in depth. To overcome these fundamental problems without sacrificing the frame rate, optical matrix imaging (OMI) is a suitable tool. Relying on an ultra-fast measurement of the reflection matrix associated with the sample, it can compensate for aberration and forward multiple scattering in post-processing, thereby providing three-dimensional and highly contrasted images of embryos at a confocal resolution. As a first proof-of-concept, bovine oocytes and embryos are imaged at a 300 nm resolution almost in real time. Our system enables visualization of intracellular structures such as lipids and mitochondria in the cytoplasm or the zona pellucida surrounding it. Altogether, we demonstrate that OMI is a promising tool for research in developmental biology and for time-lapse monitoring of oocytes and embryos in assisted reproduction.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic coupling of a cilia--mucus system in Herschel--Bulkley flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The yield stress and shear thinning properties of mucus are identified as critical for ciliary coordination and mucus transport in human airways. We use here numerical simulations to explore the hydrodynamic coupling of cilia and mucus with these two properties using the Herschel--Bulkley model, in a lattice Boltzmann solver for the fluid flow. Three mucus flow regimes, i.e. a poorly organized regime, a swirly regime, and a fully unidirectional regime, are observed and analysed by parametric studies. We systematically investigate the effects of ciliary density, interaction length, Bingham number and flow index on the mucus flow regime formation. The underlying mechanism of the regime formation is analysed in detail by examining the variation of two physical quantities (polarization and integral length) and the evolution of the flow velocity, viscosity and shear-rate fields. Mucus viscosity is found to be the dominant parameter influencing the regime formation when enhancing the yield stress and shear thinning properties. The present model is able to reproduce the solid body rotation observed in experiments (Loiseau et al. , Nat. Phys. , vol. 16, 2020, pp. 1158--1164). A more precise prediction can be achieved by incorporating non-Newtonian properties into the modelling of mucus as proposed by Gsell et al. ( Sci. Rep. , vol. 10, 2020, 8405).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image monitoring and guidance during medical examinations can aid both diagnosis and treatment. However, the sampling frequency is often too low, which creates a need to estimate the missing images. We present a probabilistic motion model for sequential medical images, with the ability to both estimate motion between acquired images and forecast the motion ahead of time. The core is a low-dimensional temporal process based on a linear Gaussian state-space model with analytically tractable solutions for forecasting, simulation, and imputation of missing samples. The results, from two experiments on publicly available cardiac datasets, show reliable motion estimates and an improved forecasting performance using patient-specific adaptation by online learning.</description>

      <title>The concentrated toroidal wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical solution to the Helmholtz wave equation in spherical coordinates is well known and has found many important applications in wave propagation, scattering, and imaging in optics and acoustics. The separable solution is comprised of spherical Bessel functions in the radial direction and spherical harmonics in the angular directions. The nature of the spherical Bessel functions includes a long asymptotic oscillatory tail at large radii, not conducive to applications where a tight concentration of wave amplitude around a ring is desired, for example in toroidal configurations. However, we have found that certain practical bandpass spectral shapes, centered around a peak frequency, can create a superposition of spherical Bessel functions that effectively concentrate the wave amplitude around a defined ring at the time instant of coherent addition, avoiding the long tail asymptotic oscillations of the single frequency solution. Theoretical solutions are shown for different bandpass spectra applied to the spherical Bessel functions, along with numerical solutions of transient wave propagation using practical hemispherical source shapes. These findings introduce a framework by which ring or toroidal concentrated waves can be produced with a simple bandpass superposition applied to hemispherical source shapes and with reference to the classical solutions in spherical coordinates.</description>
