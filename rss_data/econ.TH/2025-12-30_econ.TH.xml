      <title>Team Disagreement and Productive Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how open disagreement influences team performance in a dynamic production game. Team members can hold different priors about the productivity of the available production technologies. Initial beliefs are common knowledge and updated based on observed production outcomes. We show that when only one technology is available, a player works harder early on when her coworkers are initially more pessimistic about the technology's productivity. Holding average team optimism constant, this force implies that a team's expected output increases in the degree of disagreement of its members. A manager with the task of forming two-member teams from a large workforce maximizes total expected output by matching coworkers' beliefs in a negative assortative way. When alternative, equally good, production technologies are available, a disagreeing team outperforms any like-minded team in terms of average output and team members' welfare.</description>

      <title>Reputation and Disclosure in Dynamic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a continuous-time model of reputational disclosure in directed networks of biased intermediaries with career concerns. A payoff-relevant fundamental follows a diffusion and a decision maker chooses actions to track it. Experts obtain verifiable signals that reach the decision maker only if relayed by intermediaries. Intermediaries choose whether to forward evidence and an observable disclosure clock that controls the arrival rate of disclosure opportunities. Because clocks are public, silence is state dependent: when the clock is on, delay is informative and reputationally costly; when it is off, silence is mechanically uninformative. Disclosure becomes a real option on reputational capital.
  Along any expert-decision maker path, Markov perfect Bayesian equilibria are ladder policies with finitely many posterior cutoffs, and clock-off windows eliminate knife-edge mixing. With sufficiently high reputational stakes and low discounting, dynamic incentives rule out persistent suppression and guarantee eventual transmission of all verifiable evidence along the path, even when bias reversals block static unraveling.
  We then study network design and formation. Absent the high-reputation regime, among trees exactly the bias-monotone ones sustain disclosure. Under homogeneous reputational intensities the bias-ordered line is dynamically optimal; with heterogeneous intensities, optimal design screens by topology, placing high-reputation intermediaries on direct parallel routes rather than in series. In an endogenous link-formation game, pairwise stable networks can be inefficiently sparse or redundantly dense because agents ignore the option-value externalities their links create or destroy for others' reputational assets.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Effects of Macroeconomic Variables on Child Mortality in D-8 Countries Using Panel Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research analyses the axiomatic link among health expenditures, inflation rate, and gross national income (GNI) per capita concerning the child mortality (CMU5) rate in D-8 nations, employing panel data analysis from 1995 to 2014. Utilising conventional panel unit root tests and linear regression models, we establish that education expenditures, in conjunction with health expenditures, inflation rate, and GNI per capita, display stationarity at level. Additionally, we examine fixed effects and random effects estimators for the pertinent variables, utilising metrics such as the Hausman Test (HT) and comparisons with CCMR correlations. Our data demonstrate that the CMU5 rate in D-8 nations has steadily decreased, according to a somewhat negative linear regression model, therefore slightly undermining the fourth Millennium Development Goal (MDG4) of the World Health Organisation (WHO).</description>

      <title>Public Goods Provision in Directed Networks: A Kernel Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the decentralized provision of public goods in directed networks. We establish a correspondence between kernels in graph theory and specialized equilibria in which players either contribute a fixed threshold amount or free-ride entirely. Leveraging this relationship, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of specialized equilibria in deterministic networks and prove that specialized equilibria exist almost surely in large random networks. We further demonstrate that enhancing network reciprocity weakly expands the set of specialized equilibria without destroying existing ones. Moreover, we propose an iterative elimination algorithm that simplifies the network while preserving equilibrium properties. Finally, we show that a Nash equilibrium is stable only if it is specialized, thereby providing dynamic justification for our focus on this equilibrium class.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Decoupling in Multidimensional Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study multidimensional sequential screening. A monopolist contracts with an agent endowed with private information about the distribution of their eventual valuations of different goods; a contract is written and the agent reports their initial private information before drawing and reporting their valuations. In these settings, the monopolist frontloads surplus extraction: Any information rents given to the agent to elicit their post-contractual valuations can be extracted in expectation before valuations are drawn. This significantly simplifies the multidimensional screening problem. If the agent's valuations satisfy invariant dependencies (valuations can be dependent across dimensions, but how valuations are coupled cannot vary in their initial private information), the optimal mechanism coincides with independently offering the optimal sequential screening mechanism for each good, regardless of the dependency structure.</description>

      <title>The Revealed Preference Theory of Aggregate Object Allocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I develop a revealed preference framework to test whether an aggregate allocation of indivisible objects satisfies Pareto efficiency and individual rationality (PI) without observing individual preferences. Exploiting the type-based preferences of Echenique et. al. (2013), I derive necessary and sufficient conditions for PI-rationalizability. I show that an allocation is PI-rationalizable if and only if its allocation graph is acyclic. Next, I analyse non-PI-rationalizable allocations. First, I study the three respective problems: removal of a minimum size of subset of individuals/types/objects to restore PI-rationalizability. I prove that these three problems are NP-complete. Then, I provide an alternative goodness-of-fit measure, namely Critical Exchange Index (CEI). The CEI assess the highest portion of individuals who can involve exchanging their final objects to reach PI. This measure shows the extent of inefficiencies. The results yield the first complete revealed preference analysis for Pareto efficiency and individual rationality in matching markets and provide an implementable tool for empirical applications.</description>

      <title>Axiomatic Foundations of Bayesian Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study axiomatic foundations of Bayesian persuasion, where a principal (i.e., sender) delegates the task of choice making after informing a biased agent (i.e., receiver) about the payoff relevant uncertain state (see, e.g., Kamenica and Gentzkow (2011)). Our characterizations involve novel models of Bayesian persuasion, where the principal can steer the agent's bias after acquiring costly information. Importantly, we provide an elicitation method using only observable menu-choice data of the principal, which shows how to construct the principal's subjective costs of acquiring information even when he anticipates managing the agent's bias.</description>

      <title>Broken Symmetry of Stock Returns -- a Modified Jones-Faddy Skew t-Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that negative skew and positive mean of the distribution of stock returns are largely due to the broken symmetry of stochastic volatility governing gains and losses. Starting with stochastic differential equations for stock returns and for stochastic volatility we argue that the distribution of stock returns can be effectively split in two -- for gains and losses -- assuming difference in parameters of their respective stochastic volatilities. A modified Jones-Faddy skew t-distribution utilized here allows to reflect this in a single organic distribution which tends to meaningfully capture this asymmetry. We illustrate its application on distribution of daily S&amp;P500 returns, including analysis of its tails.</description>

      <title>Coarse Q-learning in Decision-Making: Indifference vs. Indeterminacy vs. Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Coarse Q-learning (CQL), a reinforcement learning model of decision-making under payoff uncertainty where alternatives are exogenously partitioned into coarse similarity classes (based on limited salience) and the agent maintains estimates (valuations) of expected payoffs only at the class level. Choices are modeled as softmax (multinomial logit) over class valuations and uniform within class; and valuations update toward realized payoffs as in classical Q-learning with stochastic bandit feedback (Watkins and Dayan, 1992). Using stochastic approximation, we derive a continuous-time ODE limit of CQL dynamics and show that its steady states coincide with smooth (logit) perturbations of Valuation Equilibria (Jehiel and Samet, 2007). We demonstrate the possibility of multiple equilibria in decision trees with generic payoffs and establish local asymptotic stability of strict pure equilibria whenever they exist. By contrast, we provide sufficient conditions on the primitives under which every decision tree admits a unique, globally asymptotically stable mixed equilibrium that renders the agent indifferent across classes as sensitivity to payoff differences diverges. Nevertheless, convergence to equilibrium is not universal: we construct an open set of decision trees where the unique mixed equilibrium is linearly unstable and the valuations converge to a stable limit cycle - with choice probabilities perpetually oscillating.</description>

      <title>Broad Validity of the First-Order Approach in Moral Hazard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the standard moral hazard problem with limited liability. The first-order approach (FOA) is the main tool for its solution, but existing sufficient conditions for its validity are restrictive. Our main result shows that the FOA is broadly valid, as long as the agent's reservation utility is sufficiently high. In basic examples, the FOA is valid for almost any positive reservation wage.
  We establish existence and uniqueness of the optimal contract. We derive closed-form solutions with various functional forms. We show that optimal contracts are either linear or piecewise linear option contracts with log utility and output distributions in an exponential family with linear sufficient statistic (including Gaussian, exponential, binomial, geometric, and Gamma). We provide an algorithm for finding the optimal contracts both in the case where the FOA is valid and in the case where it is not at trivial computational cost.</description>

      <title>What Slips the Mind Stalls the Deal: Delay in Bargaining with Absentmindedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In finite-horizon bargaining, deals are often made "on the courthouse steps", just before the deadline. We propose a novel source of both bargaining delay and this deadline effect: absentmindedness. In a model where parties negotiate over a course of action from a binary set and utility is non-transferable, a bargainer who does not know the calendar time may rationally reject an "ultimatum offer" as the trade deadline looms. Rational confusion is a source of bargaining power for the absentminded player, as it induces the other party to make a concession near the trade deadline to prevent negotiations from breaking down. The absentminded party may reject unfavorable offers in hopes of receiving a favorable offer closer to the deadline. If utility is transferable, there are equilibria which feature delay if and only if players are patient. Such equilibria always involve history-dependent strategies.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Saving under Risk Preference Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that wealthy households have substantially higher saving rates and markedly lower marginal propensity to consume (MPC) than other groups. Existing theory cannot account for this pattern unless under restrictive assumptions on returns, discounting, and preferences. This paper develops a general theory of optimal savings with preference shocks, allowing risk aversion to vary across states and over time. We show that incorporating such heterogeneity in risk attitudes fundamentally alters the asymptotic dynamics of consumption and saving. In particular, we provide an analytical characterization of the asymptotic MPCs and show that zero asymptotic MPCs, corresponding to a 100% asymptotic saving rate, arise under markedly weaker conditions than in existing theory. Strikingly, such outcomes occur whenever there is a positive probability that agents become less risk averse in the future. As a result, the vanishing MPC emerges as a generic feature rather than a knife-edge result of the optimal savings model, offering a more theoretically robust and empirically consistent account of the saving behavior of wealthy households.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When are dynamics valuable? In Bayesian environments with public signals and no intertemporal commitment, we study a seller who allocates an economically single-shot resource over time. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which the optimal dynamic mechanism collapses to a simple terminal design: a single public experiment at date 0 followed by a posterior-dependent static mechanism executed at a deterministic date, with no further disclosure. The key condition is the existence of a global affine shadow value that supports the posterior-based revenue frontier and uniformly bounds all history-dependent revenues. When this condition fails, a collapse statistic pinpoints the dates and public state variables that generate genuine dynamic value. The characterization combines martingale concavification on the belief space with an affine-support duality for concave envelopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transaction Fee Mechanisms (TFMs) study auction design in the Blockchain context, and emphasize robustness against miner and user collusion, moreso than traditional auction theory. \cite{chung2023foundations} introduce the notion of a mechanism being $c$-Side-Contract-Proof ($c$-SCP), i.e., robust to a collusion of the miner and $c$ users. Later work \cite{chung2024collusion,welfareIncreasingCollusion} shows a gap between the $1$-SCP and $2$-SCP classes. We show that the class of $2$-SCP mechanisms equals that of any $c$-SCP with $c\geq 2$, under a relatively minor assumption of consistent tie-breaking. In essence, this implies that any mechanism vulnerable to collusion, is also vulnerable to a small collusion.</description>

      <title>Stable Voting and the Splitting of Cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithms for resolving majority cycles in preference aggregation have been studied extensively in computational social choice. Several sophisticated cycle-resolving methods, including Tideman's Ranked Pairs, Schulze's Beat Path, and Heitzig's River, are refinements of the Split Cycle (SC) method that resolves majority cycles by discarding the weakest majority victories in each cycle. Recently, Holliday and Pacuit proposed a new refinement of Split Cycle, dubbed Stable Voting, and a simplification thereof, called Simple Stable Voting (SSV). They conjectured that SSV is a refinement of SC whenever no two majority victories are of the same size. In this paper, we prove the conjecture up to 6 alternatives and refute it for more than 6 alternatives. While our proof of the conjecture for up to 5 alternatives uses traditional mathematical reasoning, our 6-alternative proof and 7-alternative counterexample were obtained with the use of SAT solving. The SAT encoding underlying this proof and counterexample is applicable far beyond SC and SSV: it can be used to test properties of any voting method whose choice of winners depends only on the ordering of margins of victory by size.</description>
