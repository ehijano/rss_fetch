      <title>Spatio-temporal pattern formation under varying functional response parametrizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancement of the predictive power and robustness of nonlinear population dynamics models allows ecologists to make more reliable forecasts about species' long term survival. However, the limited availability of detailed ecological data, especially for complex ecological interactions creates uncertainty in model predictions, often requiring adjustments to the mathematical formulation of these interactions. Modifying the mathematical representation of components responsible for complex behaviors, such as predation, can further contribute to this uncertainty, a phenomenon known as structural sensitivity. Structural sensitivity has been explored primarily in non-spatial systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and in a limited number of simple, spatially extended systems modeled by nonhomogeneous parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), where self-diffusion alone cannot produce spatial patterns. In this study, we broaden the scope of structural sensitivity analysis to include spatio-temporal ecological systems in which spatial patterns can emerge due to diffusive instability. Through a combination of analytical techniques and supporting numerical simulations, we show that pattern formation can be highly sensitive to how the system and its associated ecological interactions are mathematically parameterized. In fact, some patterns observed in one version of the model may completely disappear in another with a different parameterization, even though the underlying properties remain unchanged.</description>

      <title>Motion of ferrodark solitons in harmonically trapped superfluids: spin corrections and emergent quartic potentials exhibiting symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for topological soliton dynamics in trapped spinor superfluids, decomposing the force acting on the soliton by the surrounding fluid into the buoyancy force and spin-corrections arising from the density depletion at soliton core and the coupling between the orbital motion and the spin mixing, respectively. For ferrodark solitons (FDSs) in spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs), the spin correction enables mapping the FDS motion in a harmonic trap to the atomic-mass particle dynamics in an emergent quartic potential. Initially placing a type-I FDS near the trap center, a single-sided oscillation happens, which maps to the particle moving around a local minimum of the emergent double-well potential. As the initial distance of a type-II FDS from the trap center increases, the motion exhibits three regimes: trap-centered harmonic and anharmonic, followed by single-sided oscillations. Correspondingly the emergent quartic potential undergoes symmetry breaking, transitioning from a single minimum to a double-well shape, where particle motion shifts from oscillating around the single minimum to crossing between two minima via the local maximum, then the motion around one of the two minima. In a hard-wall trap with linear potential, the FDS motion maps to a harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of localized states in the stochastic discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reconsider the dynamics of localized states in the deterministic and stochastic discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Localized initial conditions disperse if the strength of the nonlinear part drops below a threshold. Localized states are unstable in a noisy environment. As expected, an infinite temperature state emerges when multiplicative noise is applied, while additive noise yields unbounded dynamics since conservation of normalization is violated.</description>
