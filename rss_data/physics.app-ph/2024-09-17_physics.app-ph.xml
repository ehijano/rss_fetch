      <title>A new critical growth parameter and mechanistic model for SiC nanowire synthesis via Si substrate carbonization: the role of H$_2$/CH$_4$ gas flow ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SiC structures, including nanowires and films, can be effectively grown on Si substrates through carbonization. However, growth parameters other than temperature, which influence the preferential formation of SiC nanowires or films, have not yet been identified. In this work, we investigate SiC synthesis via Si carbonization using methane (CH$_4$) by varying the growth temperature and the hydrogen to methane gas flow ratio (H$_2$/CH$_4$). We demonstrate that adjusting these parameters allows for the preferential growth of SiC nanowires or films. Specifically, SiC nanowires are preferentially grown when the H$_2$/CH$_4$ ratio exceeds a specific threshold, which varies with the growth temperature, ranging between 1200$^\circ$C and 1310$^\circ$C. Establishing this precise growth window for SiC nanowires in terms of the H$_2$/CH$_4$ ratio and growth temperature provides new insights into the parameter-driven morphology of SiC. Furthermore, we propose a mechanistic model to explain the preferential growth of either SiC nanowires or films, based on the kinetics of gas-phase reactions and surface processes. These findings not only advance our understanding of SiC growth mechanisms but also pave the way for optimized fabrication strategies for SiC-based nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Spintronic Neuron Using a Magnetic Tunnel Junction for Low-Power Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel spiking artificial neuron design based on a combined spin valve/magnetic tunnel junction (SV/MTJ). Traditional hardware used in artificial intelligence and machine learning faces significant challenges related to high power consumption and scalability. To address these challenges, spintronic neurons, which can mimic biologically inspired neural behaviors, offer a promising solution. We present a model of an SV/MTJ-based neuron which uses technologies that have been successfully integrated with CMOS in commercially available applications. The operational dynamics of the neuron are derived analytically through the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation, demonstrating its ability to replicate key spiking characteristics of biological neurons, such as response latency and refractive behavior. Simulation results indicate that the proposed neuron design can operate on a timescale of about 1 ns, without any bias current, and with power consumption as low as 50 uW.</description>

      <title>A biology-inspired model for the electrical response of solid state memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristors stand out as promising components in the landscape of memory and computing. Memristors are generally defined by a conductance equation containing a state variable that imparts a memory effect. The current-voltage cycling causes transitions of the conductance, determined by different physical mechanisms such as the formation of conducting filaments in an insulating surrounding. Here we provide a unified description of the set and reset processes, by means of a single voltage activated relaxation time of the memory variable. This approach is based on the Hodgkin-Huxley model that is widely used to describe action potentials dynamics in neurons. We focus on halide perovskite memristors and their intersection with neuroscience-inspired computing. We show that the modelling approach adeptly replicates the experimental traits of both volatile and nonvolatile memristors. Its versatility extends across various device materials and configurations, capturing nuanced behaviors such as scan rate- and upper vertex-dependence. The model also describes well the response to sequences of voltage pulses that cause synaptic potentiation effects. This model serves as a potent tool for comprehending and probing the underlying mechanisms of memristors, by indicating the relaxation properties that control observable response, which opens the way for a detailed physical interpretation.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Time of Multipore Nanofluidic Memristors for Neuromorphic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristors have been positioned at the forefront of the purposes for carrying out neuromorphic computation. Their tuneable conductivity properties enable the imitation of synaptic behaviour. Multipore nanofluidic memristors have shown their memristic properties and are candidate devices for liquid neuromorphic systems. Such properties are visible through an inductive hysteresis in the current-voltage sweeps, which is then confirmed by the inductive characteristics in impedance spectroscopy measurements. The dynamic behaviour of memristors is largely determined by a voltage-dependent relaxation time. Here, we obtain the kinetic relaxation time of a multipore nanofluidic memristor via its impedance spectra. We show that the behaviour of this characteristic of memristors is comparable to that of natural neural systems. Hence, we open a way to study the mimic of neuron characteristics by searching for memristors with the same kinetic times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dependence on the square resistance of the linear attenuation caused by an absorbing vane in a circular waveguide is investigated. The maximal attenuation is determined to be attained at the square resistance values in the range 130-150 $\Omega$. Special constructions of impedance-matched low-reflectivity absorbing vanes are proposed and production-ready structural calculation are carried out.</description>

      <title>A semi-analytical method using auxiliary sine series for vibration and sound radiation of a rectangular plate with elastic edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient semi-analytical method using auxiliary sine series for transverse vibration and sound radiation of a thin rectangular plate with edges elastically restrained against translation and rotation. The formulation, constructed by two-dimensional sine and/or cosine series, can approximately express the bending displacement, and calculate vibration and sound radiation under excitation of point force, arbitrary-angle plane wave, or diffuse acoustic field with acceptable accuracy. It is also applied for baffled or unbaffled conditions. A post-process program is developed to predict vibrating frequencies and modes, mean square velocity spectrum, and sound transmission loss via reduced-order integrals of radiation impedances. The method is validated by experiment and simulation results, demonstrating accurate and efficient computation using a single program for transverse vibration and sound radiation of a plate under different elastic boundary conditions and different excitations. Formulas given in this paper provide a basis for the code development on transverse vibration and sound radiation analysis of thin plates.</description>

      <title>Automated design of nonreciprocal thermal emitters via Bayesian optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal thermal emitters that break Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation promise exciting applications for thermal and energy applications. The design of the bandwidth and angular range of the nonreciprocal effect, which directly affects the performance of nonreciprocal emitters, typically relies on physical intuition. In this study, we present a general numerical approach to maximize the nonreciprocal effect. We choose doped magneto-optic materials and magnetic Weyl semimetal materials as model materials and focus on pattern-free multilayer structures. The optimization randomly starts from a less effective structure and incrementally improves the broadband nonreciprocity through the combination of Bayesian optimization and reparameterization. Optimization results show that the proposed approach can discover structures that can achieve broadband nonreciprocal emission at wavelengths from 5 to 40 micrometers using only a fewer layers, significantly outperforming current state-of-the-art designs based on intuition in terms of both performance and simplicity.</description>

      <title>FB-HyDON: Parameter-Efficient Physics-Informed Operator Learning of Complex PDEs via Hypernetwork and Finite Basis Domain Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep operator networks (DeepONet) and neural operators have gained significant attention for their ability to map infinite-dimensional function spaces and perform zero-shot super-resolution. However, these models often require large datasets for effective training. While physics-informed operators offer a data-agnostic learning approach, they introduce additional training complexities and convergence issues, especially in highly nonlinear systems. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Finite Basis Physics-Informed HyperDeepONet (FB-HyDON), an advanced operator architecture featuring intrinsic domain decomposition. By leveraging hypernetworks and finite basis functions, FB-HyDON effectively mitigates the training limitations associated with existing physics-informed operator learning methods. We validated our approach on the high-frequency harmonic oscillator, Burgers' equation at different viscosity levels, and Allen-Cahn equation demonstrating substantial improvements over other operator learning models.</description>

      <title>Electrical detection in two-terminal perpendicularly magnetized devices via geometric anomalous Nernst effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-uniform current distribution arisen from either current crowding effect or hot spot effect provides a method to tailor the interaction between thermal gradient and electron transport in magnetically ordered systems. Here we apply the device structural engineering to realize an in-plane inhomogeneous temperature distribution within the conduction channel, and the resulting geometric anomalous Nernst effect (GANE) gives rise to a non-zero 2nd -harmonic resistance whose polarity corresponds to the out-of-plane magnetization of Co/Pt multi-layer thin film, and its amplitude is linearly proportional to the applied current. By optimizing the aspect ratio of convex-shaped device, the effective temperature gradient can reach up to 0.3 K/$\mu$m along the y-direction, leading to a GANE signal of 28.3 $\mu$V. Moreover, we demonstrate electrical write and read operations in the perpendicularly-magnetized Co/Pt-based spin-orbit torque device with a simple two-terminal structure. Our results unveil a new pathway to utilize thermoelectric effects for constructing high-density magnetic memories</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An experimental study of optical phonon modes, both normal and interface (IF) phonons, in bilayer strain-coupled InAs/GaAs_(1-x)Sb_x quantum dot heterostructures has been presented by means of low-temperature polarized Raman scattering. The effect of Sb-content on the frequency positions of these phonon modes has been very well correlated with the simulated strain. The Raman peaks show different frequency shifts in the heterostructure with varying Sb-content in the capping layer. This shift is attributed to the strain relaxation, bigger size of quantum dots and type-II band alignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The applications and impact of high fidelity simulation of fluid flows are far-reaching. They include settling some long-standing and fundamental questions in turbulence. However, the computational resources required for such efforts are extensive. Here, we explore the possibility of employing the recent computing paradigm of quantum computing to simulate fluid flows. The lure of this new paradigm is the potentially exponential advantage in memory and speed, in comparison with classical computing. This field has recently witnessed a considerable uptick in excitement and contributions. In this work, we give a succinct discussion of the progress made so far, with focus on fluid flows, accompanied by an enumeration of challenges that require sustained efforts for progress. Quantum computing of fluid flows has a promising future, but the inherently nonlinear nature of flows requires serious efforts on resolving various bottlenecks, and on synthesising progress on theoretical, numerical and experimental fronts. We present certain critical details that have not yet attracted adequate attention.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work emphasizes the relevance of low-field NMR relaxometry to investigate colloid-polymer hydrogels by probing water dynamics across a wide range of formulations between $\rm 10^{\circ}C$ and $\rm 80^{\circ}C$. By examining the temperature dependence of the transverse relaxation time $T_2$, we demonstrate a clear link between the NMR response and the rheological behavior of the hydrogels. In particular, we show that NMR relaxometry targeting the solvent provides reliable insights into the hydrogel microstructure and allows the detection of phase transitions and aging processes. Our findings suggest that this solvent-focused technique could greatly benefit the soft matter community, complementing other experimental methods in the study of gels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits require a cladding material on top to prevent any outside interaction with the photonic circuit elements and electromagnetic modes that could cause damage. Mohit et al. proposed selective tuning of the resonance of a cavity by using the mode-index engineering method. However, their work did not consider adding a cladding (upper cladding) material on top of the tuned cavity. In this study, I aim to build upon their work by investigating the impact of depositing cladding material on the frequency distribution of tuned cavities through analytical studies and numerical experiments. I identify crucial calculation parameters and discuss the optimum conditions for high-resolution tuning and large tuning range.</description>

      <title>Space-time adaptive ADER-DG finite element method with LST-DG predictor and a posteriori sub-cell ADER-WENO finite-volume limiting for multidimensional detonation waves simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-time adaptive ADER-DG finite element method with LST-DG predictor and a posteriori sub-cell ADER-WENO finite-volume limiting was used for simulation of multidimensional reacting flows with detonation waves. The presented numerical method does not use any ideas of splitting or fractional time steps methods. The modification of the LST-DG predictor has been developed, based on a local partition of the time step in cells in which strong reactivity of the medium is observed. This approach made it possible to obtain solutions to classical problems of flows with detonation waves and strong stiffness, without significantly decreasing the time step. The results obtained show the very high applicability and efficiency of using the ADER-DG-PN method with a posteriori sub-cell limiting for simulating reactive flows with detonation waves. The numerical solution shows the correct formation and propagation of ZND detonation waves. The structure of detonation waves is resolved by this numerical method with subcell resolution even on coarse spatial meshes. The smooth components of the numerical solution are correctly and very accurately reproduced by the numerical method. Non-physical artifacts of the numerical solution, typical for problems with detonation waves, such as the propagation of non-physical shock waves and weak detonation fronts ahead of the main detonation front, did not arise in the results obtained. The results of simulating rather complex problems associated with the propagation of detonation waves in significantly inhomogeneous domains are presented, which show that all the main features of detonation flows are correctly reproduced by this numerical method. It can be concluded that the space-time adaptive ADER-DG-PN method with a posteriori sub-cell ADER-WENO finite-volume limiting is perfectly applicable to simulating complex reacting flows with detonation waves.</description>

      <title>Space-time adaptive ADER-DG finite element method with LST-DG predictor and a posteriori sub-cell WENO finite-volume limiting for simulation of non-stationary compressible multicomponent reactive flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-time adaptive ADER finite element DG method with a posteriori correction technique of solutions on subcells by the finite-volume ADER-WENO limiter was used to simulate non-stationary compressible multicomponent reactive flows. The multicomponent composition of the reacting medium and the reactions occurring in it were described by expanding the original system of Euler equations by a system of non-stationary convection-reaction equations. The use of this method to simulate high stiff problems associated with reactions occurring in a multicomponent medium requires the use of the adaptive change in the time step. The solution of the classical problem related to the formation and propagation of a ZND detonation wave is carried out. It was shown that the space-time adaptive ADER finite element DG method with a posteriori correction technique of solutions on subcells by the finite-volume ADER-WENO limiter can be used to simulate flows without using of splitting in directions and fractional step methods.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary high order ADER-DG method with local DG predictor for solutions of initial value problems for systems of first-order ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An adaptation of the arbitrary high order ADER-DG numerical method with local DG predictor for solving the IVP for a first-order non-linear ODE system is proposed. The proposed numerical method is a completely one-step ODE solver with uniform steps, and is simple in algorithmic and software implementations. It was shown that the proposed version of the ADER-DG numerical method is A-stable and L-stable. The ADER-DG numerical method demonstrates superconvergence with convergence order 2N+1 for the solution at grid nodes, while the local solution obtained using the local DG predictor has convergence order N+1. It was demonstrated that an important applied feature of this implementation of the numerical method is the possibility of using the local solution as a solution with a subgrid resolution, which makes it possible to obtain a detailed solution even on very coarse coordinate grids. The scale of the error of the local solution, when calculating using standard representations of single or double precision floating point numbers, using large values of the degree N, practically does not differ from the error of the solution at the grid nodes. The capabilities of the ADER-DG method for solving stiff ODE systems characterized by extreme stiffness are demonstrated. Estimates of the computational costs of the ADER-DG numerical method are obtained.</description>

      <title>Characterizing generalized Floquet topological states in hybrid space-time dimensions</title>

Abstract: In spatiotemporally modulated systems, topological states exist not only in energy gaps but also in momentum gaps. Such unconventional topological states impose challenges on topological physics. The underlying models also make the conventional Hamiltonian descriptions complicated. Here, we propose to describe such systems with space- and time-direction transfer matrices which substantially simplify the underlying theory and give direct information on the topological properties of the quasienergy and quasimomentum gaps. In particular, we find that the space- and time-direction reflection phases can serve as signatures for distinguishing various topological phases of the quasienergy and quasimomentum gaps. This approach directly reveals the topological properties of the band gap, avoiding the complexity in calculating bulk band topology in hybrid energy-moment space. By investigating two concrete models, we show that the method works well for both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems. Furthermore, we uncover an unconventional topological state, called the anomalous Floquet quasimomentum gap, whose topological properties are invariant for different choices of the unit-cell center. This work advances the study of topological phenomena in hybrid space-time (energy-momentum) dimension that are attracting much interest due to the development of spatiotemporally modulated materials.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study on Boiling of Nanofluids in Copper Foam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanofluids are suspensions of nanoscale particles (such as metals and their oxides) in base fluids (such as water, oil, or alcohol), which can significantly enhance the heat transfer performance of the base fluid. However, when nanofluids are applied to heat pipes, it is common for nanoparticles to accumulate within the heat pipe's capillary wick, clogging it and increasing thermal resistance. This paper investigates the phenomenon of boiling of water and nanofluids enhanced by copper foam through experimental methods. When the liquid is injected into copper foam placed on a heating plate, some of the liquid is squeezed out along the boundary of the heated surface of the copper foam during boiling. This phenomenon is independent of gravity but related to the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the heating surface. Based on these properties, we design a device to guide the squeezed-out liquid to other locations, offering a promising solution to the problem of nanoparticle accumulation in the heat pipe's capillary wick.</description>

      <title>Programmable multifunctional integrated microwave photonic circuit on thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave photonics, with its advanced high-frequency signal processing capabilities, is expected to play a crucial role in next-generation wireless communications and radar systems. The realization of highly integrated, high-performance, and multifunctional microwave photonic links will pave the way for its widespread deployment in practical applications, which is a significant challenge. Here, leveraging thin-film lithium niobate intensity modulator and programmable cascaded microring resonators, we demonstrate for the first time a tunable microwave photonic notch filter that simultaneously achieves high level of integration along with high dynamic range, high link gain, low noise figure, and ultra-high rejection ratio. Additionally, this programmable on-chip system is multifunctional, allowing for the dual-band notch filter and the suppression of the high-power interference signal. This work demonstrates the potential applications of the thin-film lithium niobate platform in the field of high-performance integrated microwave photonic filtering and signal processing, facilitating the advancement of microwave photonic system towards practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for the additive fabrication of planar magnetic nanoarrays with minimal surface roughness. Synthesis is accomplished by combining electron-beam lithography, used to generate nanometric patterned masks, with ion implantation in thin films. By implanting $^{56}$Fe$^{+}$ ions, we are able to introduce magnetic functionality in a controlled manner into continuous Pd thin films, achieving 3D spatial resolution down to a few tens of nanometers. Our results demonstrate the successful application of this technique in fabricating square artificial spin ice lattices, which exhibit well-defined magnetization textures and interactions among the patterned magnetic elements.</description>

      <title>A practical approach to calculating magnetic Johnson noise for precision measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic Johnson noise is an important consideration for many applications involving precision magnetometry, and its significance will only increase in the future with improvements in measurement sensitivity. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be utilized to derive analytic expressions for magnetic Johnson noise in certain situations. But when used in conjunction with finite element analysis tools, the combined approach is particularly powerful as it provides a practical means to calculate the magnetic Johnson noise arising from conductors of arbitrary geometry and permeability. In this paper, we demonstrate this method to be one of the most comprehensive approaches presently available to calculate thermal magnetic noise. In particular, its applicability is shown to not be limited to cases where the noise is evaluated at a point in space but also can be expanded to include cases where the magnetic field detector has a more general shape, such as a finite size loop, a gradiometer, or a detector that consists of a polarized atomic species trapped in a volume. Furthermore, some physics insights gained through studies made using this method are discussed</description>

      <title>Realization of cold atom gyroscope in space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-precision gyroscopes in space are essential for fundamental physics research and navigation. Due to its potential high precision, the cold atom gyroscope is expected to be the next generation of gyroscopes in space. Here, we report the first realization of a cold atom gyroscope, which was demonstrated by the atom interferometer installed in the China Space Station (CSS) as a payload. By compensating for CSS's high dynamic rotation rate using a built-in piezoelectric mirror, spatial interference fringes in the interferometer are successfully obtained. Then, the optimized ratio of the Raman laser's angles is derived, the coefficients of the piezoelectric mirror are self-calibrated in orbit, and various systemic effects are corrected. We achieve a rotation measurement resolution of 50*10^-6 rad/s for a single shot and 17*10^-6 rad/s for an average number of 32. The measured rotation is (-1142+/-29)*10^-6 rad/s and is compatible with that recorded by the classical gyroscope of the CSS. This study paves the way for developing high-precision cold atom gyroscopes in space.</description>

      <title>Preventing overfitting in infrared ellipsometry using temperature dependence: fused silica as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dispersive linear optical properties of materials are frequently described using oscillator models, where the oscillators represent interactions between light and various material resonances (vibrational, free-carrier, interband, etc.). The state-of-the-art measurement of the complex refractive index is variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), where additional measurement angles and the measured depolarization of light provides much more information compared to simpler measurements such as single-angle reflectance and transmittance. Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art VASE data can be hard to uniquely fit using oscillator models, and the resulting models may be hard to interpret physically. Here, we demonstrate the use of an additional degree of freedom, temperature, to improve the accuracy, uniqueness, and physicality of oscillator models of materials. Our approach relies on the well-understood temperature dependence of material resonances, and in particular vibrational resonances in amorphous SiO2, which are expected to change monotonically from room temperature to hundreds of degrees C. We performed VASE measurements at different temperatures, independently fitted the data at each temperature, and then confirmed that our models are unique and physical by monitoring the temperature dependence of the resulting fitting parameters. Using this technique, we generated highly accurate and precise data sets and material models describing the mid-infrared complex refractive index of three different grades of fused SiO2, which can then be used for modeling of mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.</description>
