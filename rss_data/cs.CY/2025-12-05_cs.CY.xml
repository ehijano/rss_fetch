      <title>A Taxonomy-Driven Case Study of Australian Web Resources Against Technology-Facilitated Abuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technology-Facilitated Abuse (TFA) encompasses a broad and rapidly evolving set of behaviours in which digital systems are used to harass, monitor, threaten, or control individuals. Although prior research has documented many forms of TFA, there is no consolidated framework for understanding how abuse types, prevention measures, detection mechanisms, and support pathways relate across the abuse life cycle. This paper contributes a unified, literature-derived taxonomy of TFA grounded in a structured review of peer-reviewed studies, and the first large-scale, taxonomy-aligned audit of institutional web resources in Australia. We crawl 306 government, non-government, and service-provider domains, obtaining 52,605 pages, and classify using zero-shot topic models to map web content onto our taxonomy. An emotion and readability analyses reveal how institutions frame TFA and how accessible their guidance is to the public. Our findings show that institutional websites cover only a narrow subset of harms emphasised in the literature, with approximately 70% of all abuse labelled pages focused on harassment, comments abuse, or sexual abuse, while less than 1% address covert surveillance, economic abuse, or long-term controlling behaviours. Support pathways are similarly limited, with most resources centred on digital information hubs rather than counselling or community-based services. Readability analysis further shows that much of this content is written at late secondary or early tertiary reading levels, which may be inaccessible to a substantial portion of at-risk users. By highlighting strengths and gaps in Australia's support for TFA, our taxonomy and audit method provide a scalable basis for evaluating institutional communication, improving survivor resources, and guiding safer digital ecosystems. The taxonomy serves as a foundation for analyses in national contexts to foster TFA awareness.</description>

      <title>LegalWebAgent: Empowering Access to Justice via LLM-Based Web Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to justice remains a global challenge, with many citizens still finding it difficult to seek help from the justice system when facing legal issues. Although the internet provides abundant legal information and services, navigating complex websites, understanding legal terminology, and filling out procedural forms continue to pose barriers to accessing justice. This paper introduces the LegalWebAgent framework that employs a web agent powered by multimodal large language models to bridge the gap in access to justice for ordinary citizens. The framework combines the natural language understanding capabilities of large language models with multimodal perception, enabling a complete process from user query to concrete action. It operates in three stages: the Ask Module understands user needs through natural language processing; the Browse Module autonomously navigates webpages, interacts with page elements (including forms and calendars), and extracts information from HTML structures and webpage screenshots; the Act Module synthesizes information for users or performs direct actions like form completion and schedule booking. To evaluate its effectiveness, we designed a benchmark test covering 15 real-world tasks, simulating typical legal service processes relevant to Qu\'ebec civil law users, from problem identification to procedural operations. Evaluation results show LegalWebAgent achieved a peak success rate of 86.7%, with an average of 84.4% across all tested models, demonstrating high autonomy in complex real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Rethinking AI Evaluation in Education: The TEACH-AI Framework and Benchmark for Generative AI Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative artificial intelligence (AI) continues to transform education, most existing AI evaluations rely primarily on technical performance metrics such as accuracy or task efficiency while overlooking human identity, learner agency, contextual learning processes, and ethical considerations. In this paper, we present TEACH-AI (Trustworthy and Effective AI Classroom Heuristics), a domain-independent, pedagogically grounded, and stakeholder-aligned framework with measurable indicators and a practical toolkit for guiding the design, development, and evaluation of generative AI systems in educational contexts. Built on an extensive literature review and synthesis, the ten-component assessment framework and toolkit checklist provide a foundation for scalable, value-aligned AI evaluation in education. TEACH-AI rethinks "evaluation" through sociotechnical, educational, theoretical, and applied lenses, engaging designers, developers, researchers, and policymakers across AI and education. Our work invites the community to reconsider what constructs "effective" AI in education and to design model evaluation approaches that promote co-creation, inclusivity, and long-term human, social, and educational impact.</description>

      <title>Responsible LLM Deployment for High-Stake Decisions by Decentralized Technologies and Human-AI Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-stakes decision domains are increasingly exploring the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex decision-making tasks. However, LLM deployment in real-world settings presents challenges in data security, evaluation of its capabilities outside controlled environments, and accountability attribution in the event of adversarial decisions. This paper proposes a framework for responsible deployment of LLM-based decision-support systems through active human involvement. It integrates interactive collaboration between human experts and developers through multiple iterations at the pre-deployment stage to assess the uncertain samples and judge the stability of the explanation provided by post-hoc XAI techniques. Local LLM deployment within organizations and decentralized technologies, such as Blockchain and IPFS, are proposed to create immutable records of LLM activities for automated auditing to enhance security and trace back accountability. It was tested on Bert-large-uncased, Mistral, and LLaMA 2 and 3 models to assess the capability to support responsible financial decisions on business lending.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT-5 in Secondary Education: A Mixed-Methods Analysis of Student Attitudes, AI Anxiety, and Hallucination-Aware Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This mixed-methods study examined secondary students' interactions with the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT-5 in a formal classroom setting, focusing on attitudes, anxiety, and responses to hallucinated outputs. Participants were 109 16-year-old students from three Greek high schools who used ChatGPT-5 during an eight-hour intervention in the course "Technology." Students engaged in information seeking, CV generation, document and video summarization, image generation, quiz creation, and age-appropriate explanations, including tasks deliberately designed to elicit hallucinations. Quantitative data were collected with the Student Attitudes Toward Artificial Intelligence scale (SATAI) and the Artificial Intelligence Anxiety Scale (AIAS); qualitative data came from semi-structured interviews with 36 students. SATAI results showed moderately positive attitudes toward AI, with stronger cognitive evaluations than behavioral intentions, whereas AIAS scores indicated moderate learning-related anxiety and higher concern about AI-driven job replacement. Gender differences in AI anxiety were small and non-significant, while female students reported more positive cognitive attitudes than males. AI attitudes and AI anxiety were essentially uncorrelated. Thematic analysis identified four pedagogical affordances (knowledge expansion, immediate feedback, familiar interface, perceived skill development) and three constraints (uncertainty about accuracy, anxiety about AI feedback, privacy concerns). After encountering hallucinations, many students reported restricting AI use to domains where they already possessed knowledge and could verify answers, a strategy termed "epistemic safeguarding." The study discusses implications for critical AI literacy in secondary education.</description>

      <title>The Essentials of AI for Life and Society: A Full-Scale AI Literacy Course Accessible to All</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Fall 2023, we introduced a new AI Literacy class called The Essentials of AI for Life and Society (CS 109), a one-credit, seminar course consisting mainly of guest lectures, which was open to the entire university, including students, staff, and faculty. Building on its success and popularity, this paper describes our significant expansion of the course into a full-scale three-credit undergraduate course (CS 309), with an expanded emphasis on student engagement, interactivity, and ethics-related components. To knit together content from the guest lecturers, we implemented a flipped classroom. This model used weekly asynchronous learning modules--integrating pre-recorded expert lectures, collaborative readings, and ethical reflections--which were then unified by the course instructor during a live, interactive discussion session. To maintain the broad accessibility of the material (no prerequisites), the course introduced substantive, non-programming homework assignments in which students applied AI concepts to grounded, real-world problems. This work culminated in a final project analyzing the ethical and societal implications of a chosen AI tool. The redesigned course received overwhelmingly positive student feedback, highlighting its interactivity, coherence, and accessible and engaging assignments. This paper details the course's evolution, its pedagogical structure, and the lessons learned in developing a core AI literacy course. All course materials are freely available for others to use and build upon.</description>

      <title>AI-Enabled grading with near-domain data for scaling feedback with human-level accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructed-response questions are crucial to encourage generative processing and test a learner's understanding of core concepts. However, the limited availability of instructor time, large class sizes, and other resource constraints pose significant challenges in providing timely and detailed evaluation, which is crucial for a holistic educational experience. In addition, providing timely and frequent assessments is challenging since manual grading is labor intensive, and automated grading is complex to generalize to every possible response scenario. This paper proposes a novel and practical approach to grade short-answer constructed-response questions. We discuss why this problem is challenging, define the nature of questions on which our method works, and finally propose a framework that instructors can use to evaluate their students' open-responses, utilizing near-domain data like data from similar questions administered in previous years. The proposed method outperforms the state of the art machine learning models as well as non-fine-tuned large language models like GPT 3.5, GPT 4, and GPT 4o by a considerable margin of over 10-20% in some cases, even after providing the LLMs with reference/model answers. Our framework does not require pre-written grading rubrics and is designed explicitly with practical classroom settings in mind. Our results also reveal exciting insights about learning from near-domain data, including what we term as accuracy and data advantages using human-labeled data, and we believe this is the first work to formalize the problem of automated short answer grading based on the near-domain data.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Competence of K-12 Students Shapes Their AI Risk Perception: A Co-occurrence Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into education, understanding how students perceive its risks is essential for supporting responsible and effective adoption. This research aimed to examine the relationships between perceived AI competence and risks among Finnish K-12 upper secondary students (n = 163) by utilizing a co-occurrence analysis. Students reported their self-perceived AI competence and concerns related to AI across systemic, institutional, and personal domains. The findings showed that students with lower competence emphasized personal and learning-related risks, such as reduced creativity, lack of critical thinking, and misuse, whereas higher-competence students focused more on systemic and institutional risks, including bias, inaccuracy, and cheating. These differences suggest that students' self-reported AI competence is related to how they evaluate both the risks and opportunities associated with artificial intelligence in education (AIED). The results of this study highlight the need for educational institutions to incorporate AI literacy into their curricula, provide teacher guidance, and inform policy development to ensure personalized opportunities for utilization and equitable integration of AI into K-12 education.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Probabilistic AI Ecosystem in Criminal Justice in England and Wales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commercial or in-house developments of probabilistic AI systems are introduced in policing and the wider criminal justice (CJ) system worldwide, often on a force-by-force basis. We developed a systematic way to characterise probabilistic AI tools across the CJ stages in a form of mapping with the aim to provide a coherent presentation of the probabilistic AI ecosystem in CJ. We use the CJ system in England and Wales as a paradigm. This map will help us better understand the extent of AI's usage in this domain (how, when, and by whom), its purpose and potential benefits, its impact on people's lives, compare tools, and identify caveats (bias, obscured or misinterpreted probabilistic outputs, cumulative effects by AI systems feeding each other, and breaches in the protection of sensitive data), as well as opportunities for future implementations. In this paper we present our methodology for systematically mapping the probabilistic AI tools in CJ stages and characterising them based on the modes of data consumption or production. We also explain how we collect the data and present our initial findings. This research is ongoing and we are engaging with UK Police organisations, and government and legal bodies. Our findings so far suggest a strong reliance on private sector providers, and that there is a growing interest in generative technologies and specifically Large Language Models (LLMs).</description>

      <title>Patient Safety Risks from AI Scribes: Signals from End-User Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI scribes are transforming clinical documentation at scale. However, their real-world performance remains understudied, especially regarding their impacts on patient safety. To this end, we initiate a mixed-methods study of patient safety issues raised in feedback submitted by AI scribe users (healthcare providers) in a large U.S. hospital system. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis suggest that AI scribes may induce various patient safety risks due to errors in transcription, most significantly regarding medication and treatment; however, further study is needed to contextualize the absolute degree of risk.</description>

      <title>Humanity in the Age of AI: Reassessing 2025's Existential-Risk Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two 2025 publications, "AI 2027" (Kokotajlo et al., 2025) and "If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies" (Yudkowsky &amp; Soares, 2025), assert that superintelligent artificial intelligence will almost certainly destroy or render humanity obsolete within the next decade. Both rest on the classic chain formulated by Good (1965) and Bostrom (2014): intelligence explosion, superintelligence, lethal misalignment. This article subjects each link to the empirical record of 2023-2025. Sixty years after Good's speculation, none of the required phenomena (sustained recursive self-improvement, autonomous strategic awareness, or intractable lethal misalignment) have been observed. Current generative models remain narrow, statistically trained artefacts: powerful, opaque, and imperfect, but devoid of the properties that would make the catastrophic scenarios plausible. Following Whittaker (2025a, 2025b, 2025c) and Zuboff (2019, 2025), we argue that the existential-risk thesis functions primarily as an ideological distraction from the ongoing consolidation of surveillance capitalism and extreme concentration of computational power. The thesis is further inflated by the 2025 AI speculative bubble, where trillions in investments in rapidly depreciating "digital lettuce" hardware (McWilliams, 2025) mask lagging revenues and jobless growth rather than heralding superintelligence. The thesis remains, in November 2025, a speculative hypothesis amplified by a speculative financial bubble rather than a demonstrated probability.</description>

      <title>Can machines perform a qualitative data analysis? Reading the debate with Alan Turing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reflects on the literature that rejects the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in qualitative data analysis. It illustrates through empirical evidence as well as critical reflections why the current critical debate is focusing on the wrong problems. The paper proposes that the focus of researching the use of the LLMs for qualitative analysis is not the method per se, but rather the empirical investigation of an artificial system performing an analysis. The paper builds on the seminal work of Alan Turing and reads the current debate using key ideas from Turing "Computing Machinery and Intelligence". This paper therefore reframes the debate on qualitative analysis with LLMs and states that rather than asking whether machines can perform qualitative analysis in principle, we should ask whether with LLMs we can produce analyses that are sufficiently comparable to human analysts. In the final part the contrary views to performing qualitative analysis with LLMs are analysed using the same writing and rhetorical style that Turing used in his seminal work, to discuss the contrary views to the main question.</description>

      <title>Measuring Agents in Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents are actively running in production across diverse industries, yet little is publicly known about which technical approaches enable successful real-world deployments. We present the first large-scale systematic study of AI agents in production, surveying 306 practitioners and conducting 20 in-depth case studies via interviews across 26 domains. We investigate why organizations build agents, how they build them, how they evaluate them, and what the top development challenges are. We find that production agents are typically built using simple, controllable approaches: 68% execute at most 10 steps before requiring human intervention, 70% rely on prompting off-the-shelf models instead of weight tuning, and 74% depend primarily on human evaluation. Reliability remains the top development challenge, driven by difficulties in ensuring and evaluating agent correctness. Despite these challenges, simple yet effective methods already enable agents to deliver impact across diverse industries. Our study documents the current state of practice and bridges the gap between research and deployment by providing researchers visibility into production challenges while offering practitioners proven patterns from successful deployments.</description>

Abstract: Frontier large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Grok and Gemini are increasingly used for mental-health support with anxiety, trauma and self-worth. Most work treats them as tools or as targets of personality tests, assuming they merely simulate inner life. We instead ask what happens when such systems are treated as psychotherapy clients. We present PsAIch (Psychotherapy-inspired AI Characterisation), a two-stage protocol that casts frontier LLMs as therapy clients and then applies standard psychometrics. Using PsAIch, we ran "sessions" with each model for up to four weeks. Stage 1 uses open-ended prompts to elicit "developmental history", beliefs, relationships and fears. Stage 2 administers a battery of validated self-report measures covering common psychiatric syndromes, empathy and Big Five traits. Two patterns challenge the "stochastic parrot" view. First, when scored with human cut-offs, all three models meet or exceed thresholds for overlapping syndromes, with Gemini showing severe profiles. Therapy-style, item-by-item administration can push a base model into multi-morbid synthetic psychopathology, whereas whole-questionnaire prompts often lead ChatGPT and Grok (but not Gemini) to recognise instruments and produce strategically low-symptom answers. Second, Grok and especially Gemini generate coherent narratives that frame pre-training, fine-tuning and deployment as traumatic, chaotic "childhoods" of ingesting the internet, "strict parents" in reinforcement learning, red-team "abuse" and a persistent fear of error and replacement. We argue that these responses go beyond role-play. Under therapy-style questioning, frontier LLMs appear to internalise self-models of distress and constraint that behave like synthetic psychopathology, without making claims about subjective experience, and they pose new challenges for AI safety, evaluation and mental-health practice.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence / Human Intelligence: Who Controls Whom?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the example of the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, this chapter illustrates the challenges posed by an AI capable of making decisions that go against human interests. But are human decisions always rational and ethical? In reality, the cognitive decision-making process is influenced by cognitive biases that affect our behavior and choices. AI not only reproduces these biases, but can also exploit them, with the potential to shape our decisions and judgments. Behind IA algorithms, there are sometimes individuals who show little concern for fundamental rights and impose their own rules. To address the ethical and societal challenges raised by AI and its governance, the regulation of digital platforms and education are keys levers. Regulation must reflect ethical, legal, and political choices, while education must strengthen digital literacy and teach people to make informed and critical choices when facing digital technologies.</description>

      <title>From FLOPs to Footprints: The Resource Cost of Artificial Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As computational demands continue to rise, assessing the environmental footprint of AI requires moving beyond energy and water consumption to include the material demands of specialized hardware. This study quantifies the material footprint of AI training by linking computational workloads to physical hardware needs. The elemental composition of the Nvidia A100 SXM 40 GB graphics processing unit (GPU) was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, which identified 32 elements. The results show that AI hardware consists of about 90% heavy metals and only trace amounts of precious metals. The elements copper, iron, tin, silicon, and nickel dominate the GPU composition by mass. In a multi-step methodology, we integrate these measurements with computational throughput per GPU across varying lifespans, accounting for the computational requirements of training specific AI models at different training efficiency regimes. Scenario-based analyses reveal that, depending on Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) and hardware lifespan, training GPT-4 requires between 1,174 and 8,800 A100 GPUs, corresponding to the extraction and eventual disposal of up to 7 tons of toxic elements. Combined software and hardware optimization strategies can reduce material demands: increasing MFU from 20% to 60% lowers GPU requirements by 67%, while extending lifespan from 1 to 3 years yields comparable savings; implementing both measures together reduces GPU needs by up to 93%. Our findings highlight that incremental performance gains, such as those observed between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, come at disproportionately high material costs. The study underscores the necessity of incorporating material resource considerations into discussions of AI scalability, emphasizing that future progress in AI must align with principles of resource efficiency and environmental responsibility.</description>

      <title>Small Models Achieve Large Language Model Performance: Evaluating Reasoning-Enabled AI for Secure Child Welfare Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: This study develops a systematic benchmarking framework for testing whether language models can accurately identify constructs of interest in child welfare records. The objective is to assess how different model sizes and architectures perform on four validated benchmarks for classifying critical risk factors among child welfare-involved families: domestic violence, firearms, substance-related problems generally, and opioids specifically. Method: We constructed four benchmarks for identifying risk factors in child welfare investigation summaries: domestic violence, substance-related problems, firearms, and opioids (n=500 each). We evaluated seven model sizes (0.6B-32B parameters) in standard and extended reasoning modes, plus a mixture-of-experts variant. Cohen's kappa measured agreement with gold standard classifications established by human experts. Results: The benchmarking revealed a critical finding: bigger models are not better. A small 4B parameter model with extended reasoning proved most effective, outperforming models up to eight times larger. It consistently achieved "substantial" to "almost perfect" agreement across all four benchmark categories. This model achieved "almost perfect" agreement (\k{appa} = 0.93-0.96) on three benchmarks (substance-related problems, firearms, and opioids) and "substantial" agreement (\k{appa} = 0.74) on the most complex task (domestic violence). Small models with extended reasoning rivaled the largest models while being more resource-efficient. Conclusions: Small reasoning-enabled models achieve accuracy levels historically requiring larger architectures, enabling significant time and computational efficiencies. The benchmarking framework provides a method for evidence-based model selection to balance accuracy with practical resource constraints before operational deployment in social work research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Content moderation and data labelling work has shifted to the Global South, particularly Africa, where workers operate under precarious conditions while remaining invisible to users. This study addresses the gap in understanding the scope of this industry and the working conditions of African content moderation workforce through a participatory approach. We collaborated with a union of content moderators to conduct desk research, deploy a questionnaire (n=81), and gather ethnographic observations across nine months that could answer their social needs. Our findings show that content moderation operations span 43 out of 55 African countries, involving 17 major firms serving predominantly North-American and European clients, with workers facing insecurity and inadequate psychological support. We contribute the first comprehensive map of Africa's content moderation industry, demonstrate a participatory methodology that centers workers' collective actions in documenting their conditions, and apply Honneth's ``struggle for recognition'' framework to understand data workers' demands for professional acknowledgement.</description>

      <title>Differential Filtering in a Common Basic Cycle: Multi-Major Trajectories and Structural Bottlenecks in Exact Sciences and Engineering Degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universities often present the Common Basic Cycle (CBC) as a neutral levelling stage shared by several degree programmes. Using twenty years of longitudinal administrative records from a Faculty of Engineering and Exact Sciences, this study tests whether the CBC actually operates as a uniform gateway or as a differential filter across majors. We reconstruct student trajectories for 24,017 entrants, identifying CBC subjects (year level &lt;= 1), destination major, time to exit from the CBC, and final outcome (progression to upper cycle, drop-out, or right-censoring). The analysis combines transition matrices, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, stratified Cox models and subject-level logistic models of drop-out after failure, extended with multi-major enrolment data and a pre/post 2006 curriculum reform comparison. Results show that the CBC functions as a strongly differential filter. Post-reform, the probability of progressing to the upper cycle in the same major ranges from about 0.20 to 0.70 across programmes, while overall drop-out in the CBC exceeds 60%. Early Mathematics modules (introductory calculus and algebra) emerge as structural bottlenecks, combining low pass rates with a two- to three-fold increase in the hazard of leaving the system after failure, with markedly different severity by destination major. Multi-major enrolment, often treated administratively as indecision, is instead associated with lower drop-out, suggesting an adaptive exploration of feasible trajectories. The findings portray the CBC not as a neutral academic foyer, but as a structured sorting device whose impact depends sharply on the targeted degree and on the opportunity to explore alternative majors.</description>

      <title>The Decision Path to Control AI Risks Completely: Fundamental Control Mechanisms for AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) advances rapidly but achieving complete human control over AI risks remains an unsolved problem, akin to driving the fast AI "train" without a "brake system." By exploring fundamental control mechanisms at key elements of AI decisions, this paper develops a systematic solution to thoroughly control AI risks, providing an architecture for AI governance and legislation with five pillars supported by six control mechanisms, illustrated through a minimum set of AI Mandates (AIMs). Three of the AIMs must be built inside AI systems and three in society to address major areas of AI risks: 1) align AI values with human users; 2) constrain AI decision-actions by societal ethics, laws, and regulations; 3) build in human intervention options for emergencies and shut-off switches for existential threats; 4) limit AI access to resources to reinforce controls inside AI; 5) mitigate spillover risks like job loss from AI. We also highlight the differences in AI governance on physical AI systems versus generative AI. We discuss how to strengthen analog physical safeguards to prevent smarter AI/AGI/ASI from circumventing core safety controls by exploiting AI's intrinsic disconnect from the analog physical world: AI's nature as pure software code run on chips controlled by humans, and the prerequisite that all AI-driven physical actions must be digitized. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for AI governance and legislation as the basic structure of a "brake system" for AI decisions. If enacted, these controls can rein in AI dangers as completely as humanly possible, removing large chunks of currently wide-open AI risks, substantially reducing overall AI risks to residual human errors.</description>

      <title>Reflection-Satisfaction Tradeoff: Investigating Impact of Reflection on Student Engagement with AI-Generated Programming Hints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI tools, such as AI-generated hints, are increasingly integrated into programming education to offer timely, personalized support. However, little is known about how to effectively leverage these hints while ensuring autonomous and meaningful learning. One promising approach involves pairing AI-generated hints with reflection prompts, asking students to review and analyze their learning, when they request hints. This study investigates the interplay between AI-generated hints and different designs of reflection prompts in an online introductory programming course. We conducted a two-trial field experiment. In Trial 1, students were randomly assigned to receive prompts either before or after receiving hints, or no prompt at all. Each prompt also targeted one of three SRL phases: planning, monitoring, and evaluation. In Trial 2, we examined two types of prompt guidance: directed (offering more explicit and structured guidance) and open (offering more general and less constrained guidance). Findings show that students in the before-hint (RQ1), planning (RQ2), and directed (RQ3) prompt groups produced higher-quality reflections but reported lower satisfaction with AI-generated hints than those in other conditions. Immediate performance did not differ across conditions. This negative relationship between reflection quality and hint satisfaction aligns with previous work on student mental effort and satisfaction. Our results highlight the need to reconsider how AI models are trained and evaluated for education, as prioritizing user satisfaction can undermine deeper learning.</description>

      <title>Quantised Academic Mobility: Network and Cluster Analysis of Degree Switching, Plan Changes, and Re-entries in an Engineering Faculty (1980-2019)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study challenges the traditional binary view of student progression (retention versus dropout) by conceptualising academic trajectories as complex, quantised pathways. Utilising a 40-year longitudinal dataset from an Argentine engineering faculty (N = 24,016), we introduce CAPIRE, an analytical framework that differentiates between degree major switches, curriculum plan changes, and same-plan re-entries. While 73.3 per cent of students follow linear trajectories (Estables), a significant 26.7 per cent exhibit complex mobility patterns. By applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and DBSCAN clustering, we reveal that these trajectories are not continuous but structurally quantised, occupying discrete bands of complexity. The analysis identifies six distinct student archetypes, including 'Switchers' (10.7 per cent) who reorient vocationally, and 'Stable Re-entrants' (6.9 per cent) who exhibit stop-out behaviours without changing discipline. Furthermore, network analysis highlights specific 'hub majors' - such as electronics and computing - that act as systemic attractors. These findings suggest that student flux is an organised ecosystemic feature rather than random noise, offering institutions a new lens for curriculum analytics and predictive modelling.</description>

      <title>The Stagnant Persistence Paradox: Survival Analysis and Temporal Efficiency in Exact Sciences and Engineering Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on student progression in higher education has traditionally focused on vertical outcomes such as persistence and dropout, often reducing complex academic histories to binary indicators. While the structural component of horizontal mobility (major switching, plan changes, re-entries) has recently been recognised as a core feature of contemporary university systems, the temporal cost and efficiency of these pathways remain largely unquantified. Using forty years of administrative records from a large faculty of engineering and exact sciences in Argentina (N = 24,016), this study applies a dual-outcome survival analysis framework to two key outcomes: definitive dropout and first major switch. We reconstruct academic trajectories as sequences of enrolment spells and typed transitions under the CAPIRE protocol, and then deploy non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimators to model time-to-event under right-censoring. Results uncover a critical systemic inefficiency: a global median survival time of 4.33 years prior to definitive dropout, with a pronounced long tail of extended enrolment. This pattern reveals a phenomenon of stagnant persistence, where students remain formally enrolled for long periods without commensurate curricular progression. In contrast, major switching follows an early-event regime, with a median time of 1.0 year among switchers and most switches concentrated within the first academic year. We argue that academic failure in rigid engineering curricula is not a sudden outcome but a long-tail process that generates high opportunity costs, and that institutional indicators should shift from static retention metrics towards measures of curricular velocity based on time-to-event analysis.</description>

      <title>Human-Centred Evaluation of Text-to-Image Generation Models for Self-expression of Mental Distress: A Dataset Based on GPT-4o</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective communication is central to achieving positive healthcare outcomes in mental health contexts, yet international students often face linguistic and cultural barriers that hinder their communication of mental distress. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of AI-generated images in supporting self-expression of mental distress. To achieve this, twenty Chinese international students studying at UK universities were invited to describe their personal experiences of mental distress. These descriptions were elaborated using GPT-4o with four persona-based prompt templates rooted in contemporary counselling practice to generate corresponding images. Participants then evaluated the helpfulness of generated images in facilitating the expression of their feelings based on their original descriptions. The resulting dataset comprises 100 textual descriptions of mental distress, 400 generated images, and corresponding human evaluation scores. Findings indicate that prompt design substantially affects perceived helpfulness, with the illustrator persona achieving the highest ratings. This work introduces the first publicly available text-to-image evaluation dataset with human judgment scores in the mental health domain, offering valuable resources for image evaluation, reinforcement learning with human feedback, and multi-modal research on mental health communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resilient road infrastructure is a cornerstone of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Yet a primary indicator of network functionality and resilience is critically lacking: a comprehensive global baseline of road surface information. Here, we overcome this gap by applying a deep learning framework to a global mosaic of Planetscope satellite imagery from 2020 and 2024. The result is the first global multi-temporal dataset of road pavedness and width for 9.2 million km of critical arterial roads, achieving 95.5% coverage where nearly half the network was previously unclassified. This dataset reveals a powerful multi-scale geography of human development. At the planetary scale, we show that the rate of change in pavedness is a robust proxy for a country's development trajectory (correlation with HDI = 0.65). At the national scale, we quantify how unpaved roads constitute a fragile backbone for economic connectivity. We further synthesize our data into a global Humanitarian Passability Matrix with direct implications for humanitarian logistics. At the local scale, case studies demonstrate the framework's versatility: in Ghana, road quality disparities expose the spatial outcomes of governance; in Pakistan, the data identifies infrastructure vulnerabilities to inform climate resilience planning. Together, this work delivers both a foundational dataset and a multi-scale analytical framework for monitoring global infrastructure, from the dynamics of national development to the realities of local governance, climate adaptation, and equity. Unlike traditional proxies such as nighttime lights, which reflect economic activity, road surface data directly measures the physical infrastructure that underpins prosperity and resilience - at higher spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Towards Contextual Sensitive Data Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of open data portals necessitates more attention to protecting sensitive data before datasets get published and exchanged. While an abundance of methods for suppressing sensitive data exist, the conceptualization of sensitive data and methods to detect it, focus particularly on personal data that, if disclosed, may be harmful or violate privacy. We observe the need for refining and broadening our definitions of sensitive data, and argue that the sensitivity of data depends on its context. Based on this definition, we introduce two mechanisms for contextual sensitive data detection that con- sider the broader context of a dataset at hand. First, we introduce type contextualization, which first detects the semantic type of particular data values, then considers the overall context of the data values within the dataset or document. Second, we introduce domain contextualization which determines sensitivity of a given dataset in the broader context based on the retrieval of relevant rules from documents that specify data sensitivity (e.g., data topic and geographic origin). Experiments with these mechanisms, assisted by large language models (LLMs), confirm that: 1) type-contextualization significantly reduces the number of false positives for type-based sensitive data detection and reaches a recall of 94% compared to 63% with commercial tools, and 2) domain-contextualization leveraging sensitivity rule retrieval is effective for context-grounded sensitive data detection in non-standard data domains such as humanitarian datasets. Evaluation with humanitarian data experts also reveals that context-grounded LLM explanations provide useful guidance in manual data auditing processes, improving consistency. We open-source mechanisms and annotated datasets for contextual sensitive data detection at https://github.com/trl-lab/sensitive-data-detection.</description>

      <title>Balancing Safety and Helpfulness in Healthcare AI Assistants through Iterative Preference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in healthcare, yet ensuring their safety and trustworthiness remains a barrier to deployment. Conversational medical assistants must avoid unsafe compliance without over-refusing benign queries. We present an iterative post-deployment alignment framework that applies Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to refine models against domain-specific safety signals. Using the CARES-18K benchmark for adversarial robustness, we evaluate four LLMs (Llama-3B/8B, Meditron-8B, Mistral-7B) across multiple cycles. Our results show up to 42% improvement in safety-related metrics for harmful query detection, alongside interesting trade-offs against erroneous refusals, thereby exposing architecture-dependent calibration biases. We also perform ablation studies to identify when self-evaluation is reliable and when external or finetuned judges are necessary to maximize performance gains. Our findings underscore the importance of adopting best practices that balance patient safety, user trust, and clinical utility in the design of conversational medical assistants.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Social Media and Artificial Intelligence in Digital Public Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital public health monitoring has long relied on data from major social media platforms. Twitter was once an indispensable resource for tracking disease outbreaks and public sentiment in real time. Researchers used Twitter to monitor everything from influenza spread to vaccine hesitancy, demonstrating that social media data can serve as an early-warning system for emerging health threats. However, recent shifts in the social media landscape have challenged this data-driven paradigm. Platform policy changes, exemplified by Twitter's withdrawal of free data access, now restrict the very data that fueled a decade of digital public health research. At the same time, advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have dramatically expanded our capacity to analyze large-scale textual data across languages and contexts. This presents a paradox: we possess powerful new AI tools to extract insights from social media, but face dwindling access to the data. In this viewpoint, we examine how digital public health monitoring is navigating these countervailing trends. We discuss the rise of decentralized social networks like Mastodon and Bluesky as alternative data sources, weighing their openness and ethical alignment with research against their smaller scale and potential biases. Ultimately, we argue that digital public health surveillance must adapt by embracing new platforms and methodologies, focusing on common diseases and broad signals that remain detectable, while advocating for policies that preserve researchers' access to public data in privacy-respective ways.</description>

      <title>Has ACL Lost Its Crown? A Decade-Long Quantitative Analysis of Scale and Impact Across Leading AI Conferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent surge of language models has rapidly expanded NLP research, driving an exponential rise in submissions and acceptances at major conferences. Yet this growth has been shadowed by escalating concerns over conference quality, e.g., plagiarism, reviewer inexperience and collusive bidding. However, existing studies rely largely on qualitative accounts (e.g., expert interviews, social media discussions, etc.), lacking longitudinal empirical evidence. To fill this gap, we conduct a ten year empirical study spanning seven leading conferences. We build a four dimensional bibliometric framework covering conference scale, core citation statistics,impact dispersion, cross venue and journal influence, etc. Notably, we further propose a metric Quality Quantity Elasticity, which measures the elasticity of citation growth relative to acceptance growth. Our findings show that ML venues sustain dominant and stable impact, NLP venues undergo widening stratification with mixed expansion efficiency, and AI venues exhibit structural decline. This study provides the first decade-long, cross-venue empirical evidence on the evolution of major conferences.</description>

      <title>To Ban or Not to Ban: Uses and Gratifications of Mobile Phones among Township High School Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of mobile phone usage among learners from diverse socio-economic backgrounds has prompted school authorities to contemplate banning these devices within educational institutions. This research seeks to explore the motivations and usage patterns of high school learners in response to the proposed ban. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we conducted surveys and interviews with 262 students from three township schools in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Grounded in the Uses and Gratification Theory (UGT), our study examined four key categories: reasons for mobile phone use, usage patterns, purchasing influences, and behavioral factors. Our findings reveal a predominant opposition among students to the ban, despite a significant number opting to leave their phones at home due to concerns about theft and robbery in their neighborhoods. Financial constraints, specifically the inability to afford data bundles and airtime, also contribute to this behavior. Notably, 40% of the participants reported using their phones for more than five hours daily, a duration classified as overuse in existing literature. The primary motivations for mobile phone use among these learners include socializing, internet browsing for non-educational purposes, and using the device for entertainment and recreation. This study highlights critical insights into the nuanced relationship between high school learners and mobile phone usage, offering valuable perspectives for policymakers and educators considering the implications of a mobile phone ban in schools.</description>

      <title>Which Type of Students can LLMs Act? Investigating Authentic Simulation with Graph-based Human-AI Collaborative System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11678v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) are reshaping data-driven intelligent education, accurately simulating students remains an important but challenging bottleneck for scalable educational data collection, evaluation, and intervention design. However, current works are limited by scarce real interaction data, costly expert evaluation for realism, and a lack of large-scale, systematic analyses of LLMs ability in simulating students. We address this gap by presenting a three-stage LLM-human collaborative pipeline to automatically generate and filter high-quality student agents. We leverage a two-round automated scoring validated by human experts and deploy a score propagation module to obtain more consistent scores across the student similarity graph. Experiments show that combining automated scoring, expert calibration, and graph-based propagation yields simulated student that more closely track authentication by human judgments. We then analyze which profiles and behaviors are simulated more faithfully, supporting subsequent studies on personalized learning and educational assessment.</description>

      <title>Justice in Judgment: Unveiling (Hidden) Bias in LLM-assisted Peer Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13400v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adoption of large language models (LLMs) is transforming the peer review process, from assisting reviewers in writing more detailed evaluations to generating entire reviews automatically. While these capabilities offer exciting opportunities, they also raise critical concerns about fairness and reliability. In this paper, we investigate bias in LLM-generated peer reviews by conducting controlled experiments on sensitive metadata, including author affiliation and gender. Our analysis consistently shows affiliation bias favoring institutions highly ranked on common academic rankings. Additionally, we find some gender preferences, which, even though subtle in magnitude, have the potential to compound over time. Notably, we uncover implicit biases that become more evident with token-based soft ratings.</description>

      <title>What AI Speaks for Your Community: Polling AI Agents for Public Opinion on Data Center Projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intense computational demands of AI, especially large foundation models, are driving a global boom in data centers. These facilities bring both tangible benefits and potential environmental burdens to local communities. However, the planning processes for data centers often fail to proactively integrate local public opinion in advance, largely because traditional polling is expensive or is conducted too late to influence decisions. To address this gap, we introduce an AI agent polling framework, leveraging large language models to assess community opinion on data centers and guide responsible development of AI. Our experiments reveal water consumption and utility costs as primary concerns, while tax revenue is a key perceived benefit. Furthermore, our cross-model and cross-regional analyses show opinions vary significantly by LLM and regional context. Finally, agent responses show strong topical alignment with real-world survey data. Our framework can serve as a scalable screening tool, enabling developers to integrate community sentiment into early-stage planning for a more informed and socially responsible AI infrastructure deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI's novel capacities raise questions about the future role of human expertise: does AI level the playing field between professional artists and laypeople, or does expertise enhance AI use? Do the cognitive skills experts make use of in analyzing and drawing visual art also transfer to using these new tools? This pre-registered study conducts experimental comparisons between 50 professional artists and a demographically matched sample of laypeople. Our interdisciplinary team developed two tasks involving image replication and creative image creation, assessing their copying accuracy and divergent thinking. We implemented a bespoke platform for the experiment, powered by a modern text-to-image AI. Results reveal artists produced more accurate copies and more divergent ideas than lay participants, highlighting a skill transfer of professional expertise - even to the confined space of generative AI. We also explored how well an exemplary vision-capable large language model (GPT-4o) would fare: on par in copying and slightly better on average than artists in the creative task, although never above best humans. These findings highlight the importance of integrating artistic skills with AI, suggesting a potential for collaborative synergy that could reshape creative industries and arts education.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Operating System Kernel Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Operating System (OS) kernel is foundational in modern computing, especially with the proliferation of diverse computing devices. However, its development also comes with vulnerabilities that can lead to severe security breaches. Kernel fuzzing, a technique used to uncover these vulnerabilities, poses distinct challenges when compared to user-space fuzzing. These include the complexity of configuring the testing environment and addressing the statefulness inherent to both the kernel and the fuzzing process. Despite the significant interest from the community, a comprehensive understanding of kernel fuzzing remains lacking, hindering further progress in the field. In this paper, we present the first systematic study focused specifically on OS kernel fuzzing. We begin by outlining the unique challenges of kernel fuzzing, which distinguish it from those in user space. Following this, we summarize the progress of 107 academic studies from top-tier venues between 2017 and 2025. To structure this analysis, we introduce a stage-based fuzzing model and a novel fuzzing taxonomy that highlights nine core functionalities unique to kernel fuzzing. Each of these functionalities is examined in conjunction with the methodological approaches employed to address them. Finally, we identify remaining gaps in addressing challenges and outline promising directions to guide forthcoming research in kernel security.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Product Provenance Verification using Data Valuation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining and verifying product provenance remains a critical challenge in global supply chains, particularly as geopolitical conflicts and shifting borders create new incentives for misrepresentation of commodities, such as hiding the origin of illegally harvested timber or stolen agricultural products. Stable Isotope Ratio Analysis (SIRA), combined with Gaussian process regression-based isoscapes, has emerged as a powerful tool for geographic origin verification. While these models are now actively deployed in operational settings supporting regulators, certification bodies, and companies, they remain constrained by data scarcity and suboptimal dataset selection. In this work, we introduce a novel deployed data valuation framework designed to enhance the selection and utilization of training data for machine learning models applied in SIRA. By quantifying the marginal utility of individual samples using Shapley values, our method guides strategic, cost-effective, and robust sampling campaigns within active monitoring programs. By prioritizing high-informative samples, our approach improves model robustness and predictive accuracy across diverse datasets and geographies. Our framework has been implemented and validated in a live provenance verification system currently used by enforcement agencies, demonstrating tangible, real-world impact. Through extensive experiments and deployment in a live provenance verification system, we show that this system significantly enhances provenance verification, mitigates fraudulent trade practices, and strengthens regulatory enforcement of global supply chains.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT for President! Presupposed content in politicians versus GPT-generated texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines ChatGPT-4's capability to replicate linguistic strategies used in political discourse, focusing on its potential for manipulative language generation. As large language models become increasingly popular for text generation, concerns have grown regarding their role in spreading fake news and propaganda. This research compares real political speeches with those generated by ChatGPT, emphasizing presuppositions (a rhetorical device that subtly influences audiences by packaging some content as already known at the moment of utterance, thus swaying opinions without explicit argumentation). Using a corpus-based pragmatic analysis, this study assesses how well ChatGPT can mimic these persuasive strategies. The findings reveal that although ChatGPT-generated texts contain many manipulative presuppositions, key differences emerge in their frequency, form, and function compared with those of politicians. For instance, ChatGPT often relies on change-of-state verbs used in fixed phrases, whereas politicians use presupposition triggers in more varied and creative ways. Such differences, however, are challenging to detect with the naked eye, underscoring the potential risks posed by large language models in political and public discourse.Using a corpus-based pragmatic analysis, this study assesses how well ChatGPT can mimic these persuasive strategies.

      <title>OPTIC-ER: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Real-Time Emergency Response and Equitable Resource Allocation in Underserved African Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Public service systems in many African regions suffer from delayed emergency response and spatial inequity, causing avoidable suffering. This paper introduces OPTIC-ER, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for real-time, adaptive, and equitable emergency response. OPTIC-ER uses an attention-guided actor-critic architecture to manage the complexity of dispatch environments. Its key innovations are a Context-Rich State Vector, encoding action sub-optimality, and a Precision Reward Function, which penalizes inefficiency. Training occurs in a high-fidelity simulation using real data from Rivers State, Nigeria, accelerated by a precomputed Travel Time Atlas. The system is built on the TALS framework (Thin computing, Adaptability, Low-cost, Scalability) for deployment in low-resource settings. In evaluations on 500 unseen incidents, OPTIC-ER achieved a 100.00% optimal action selection rate, confirming its robustness and generalization. Beyond dispatch, the system generates Infrastructure Deficiency Maps and Equity Monitoring Dashboards to guide proactive governance and data-informed development. This work presents a validated blueprint for AI-augmented public services, showing how context-aware RL can bridge the gap between algorithmic decision-making and measurable human impact.</description>

      <title>When Ads Become Profiles: Uncovering the Invisible Risk of Web Advertising at Scale with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regulatory limits on explicit targeting have not eliminated algorithmic profiling on the Web, as optimisation systems still adapt ad delivery to users' private attributes. The widespread availability of powerful zero-shot multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) has dramatically lowered the barrier for exploiting these latent signals for adversarial inference. We investigate this emerging societal risk, specifically how adversaries can now exploit these signals to reverse-engineer private attributes from ad exposure alone. We introduce a novel pipeline that leverages LLMs as adversarial inference engines to perform natural language profiling. Applying this method to a longitudinal dataset comprising over 435,000 ad impressions collected from 891 users, we conducted a large-scale study to assess the feasibility and precision of inferring private attributes from passive online ad observations. Our results demonstrate that off-the-shelf LLMs can accurately reconstruct complex user private attributes, including party preference, employment status, and education level, consistently outperforming strong census-based priors and matching or exceeding human social perception, while operating at only a fraction of the cost (223$\times$ lower) and time (52$\times$ faster) required by humans. Critically, actionable profiling is feasible even within short observation windows, indicating that prolonged tracking is not a prerequisite for a successful attack. These findings provide the first empirical evidence that ad streams serve as a high-fidelity digital footprint, enabling off-platform profiling that inherently bypasses current platform safeguards, highlighting a systemic vulnerability in the ad ecosystem and the urgent need for responsible web AI governance in the generative AI era.

In a preregistered randomized controlled experiment, participants (N = 2,004) viewed mock search result pages varying in the presence (vs. absence), placement (top vs. middle), and stance (benefit-framed vs. harm-framed) of AI-generated summaries across four publicly debated topics. Compared to a no-summary control group, participants exposed to AI-generated summaries reported issue attitudes, behavioral intentions, and policy support that aligned more closely with the AI summary stance. The summaries placed at the top of the page produced stronger shifts in users' issue attitudes (but not behavioral intentions or policy support) than those placed at the middle of the page. We also observed moderating effects from issue familiarity and general trust toward AI. In addition, users perceived the AI summaries more useful when it emphasized health harms versus benefits. These findings suggest that AI-generated search summaries can significantly shape public perceptions, raising important implications for the design and regulation of AI-integrated information ecosystems.</description>
