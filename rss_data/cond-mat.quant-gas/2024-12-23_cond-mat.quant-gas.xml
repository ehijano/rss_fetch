      <title>Adiabatic preparation of a number-conserving atomic Majorana phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a protocol to adiabatically prepare the ground state of a widely discussed number-conserving model Hamiltonian for ultracold atoms in optical lattices that supports Majorana edge states. In particular, we introduce a symmetry breaking mass term that amounts to threading a commensurate (artificial) magnetic flux through the plaquettes of the considered two-leg ladder which opens a constant bulk gap. This enables the preparation of the topological Majorana phase from a trivial Mott insulator state with optimal asymptotic scaling of the ramp time in system size, which is linear owing to the critical nature of the target state. Using constructive bosonization techniques that account for both finite size effects and global fermion number conservation, we are able to fully explain with theory the somewhat counterintuitive necessity of the aforementioned commensurate flux for a controlled bulk gap. Our analytical predictions are corroborated and quantified by unbiased numerical matrix product states (MPS) simulations. Directly building up on previous experimental work, the crucial flux-term of the proposed protocol is feasible with state-of-the-art experimental techniques in atomic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Supersolid spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a linear response theory to provide a unified description of two recent spectroscopy protocols for probing one-dimensional supersolid states realized in cold-atom systems. Both protocols involve applying a periodic optical potential to excite the supersolid and determine its excitation frequencies and density response characteristics. This information can be used to estimate the superfluid fraction. We validate our linear response theory against nonlinear meanfield simulations of the dynamics for both translationally invariant and trapped cases. A key focus is the behavior at the band edge - the regime occurring when the optical potential used to excite the system has a wavelength that is twice the value of the supersolid lattice constant. Here symmetry can be used to selectively excite a mode from one of the two low-energy gapless excitation bands. Finally, we consider the application of the spectroscopy protocols to determine the superfluid fraction, showing the relationship to hydrodynamic theory and a Josephson-Junction array model.</description>

      <title>Many-body interferometry of one-dimensional integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose using many-body Ramsey interferometry to measure non-equilibrium correlation functions of one-dimensional (1D) integrable systems. The 1D transverse-field Ising model, which is conjectured to equilibrate into non-thermal Gibbs ensemble (GGE) steady states, is studied. It is shown that retarded Green's functions, as opposed to ordinary spin-spin correlators considered previously, can convincingly distinguish between the GGE and thermal post-quench steady states, justifying the assumption of convergence towards the GGE as the system equilibrates. We also propose the experimental protocol for measuring the response functions with Ramsey interferometry, which can be used to distinguish between different post-quench phases of the model. Our proposal can be realized with current ultracold atom techniques, and opens up the possibility to study dynamics in non-thermal ensembles.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulating continuum field theories with large-spin lattice models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories (QFTs) is one of the most promising applications of quantum simulators. Regularizing a bosonic QFT for quantum simulation purposes typically involves a truncation in Hilbert space in addition to a discretization of space. Here, we discuss how to perform such a regularization of scalar QFTs using multi-level or qudit systems, and show that this enables quantitative predictions in the continuum limit by extrapolating results obtained for large-spin lattice models. With extensive matrix-product state simulations, we numerically demonstrate the sequence of extrapolations that leads to quantitative agreement of observables for the integrable sine-Gordon (sG) QFT. We further show how to prepare static and moving soliton excitations, and analyze their scattering dynamics, in agreement with a semi-classical model and analytical predictions. Finally, we illustrate how a non-integrable perturbation of the sG model gives rise to dynamics reminiscent of string breaking and plasma oscillations in gauge theories. Our methods are directly applicable in state-of-the-art analog quantum simulators, opening the door to implementing a wide variety of scalar field theories and tackling long-standing questions in non-equilibrium QFT like the fate of the false vacuum.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy scaling laws from fluctuations of non-conserved quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement patterns reveal essential information on many-body states and provide a way to classify quantum phases of matter. However, experimental studies of many-body entanglement remain scarce due to their unscalable nature. The present work aims to mitigate this theoretical and experimental divide by introducing reduced fluctuations of observables, consisting of a sum of on-site operators, as a scalable experimental probe of the entanglement entropy. Specifically, we illustrate by Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations in spin chains that the reduced fluctuations exhibit the same size scaling properties as the entanglement entropy. Generalizing previous observations restricted to special systems with conserved quantities, our work introduces experimentally feasible protocol to extract entanglement scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Chemical potential of the warm dense electron gas from ab initio path integral Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present extensive new \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulation results for the chemical potential of the warm dense uniform electron gas (UEG), spanning a broad range of densities and temperatures. This is achieved by following two independent routes, i) based on the direct estimation of the free energy [Dornheim \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2407.01044] and ii) using a histogram estimator in PIMC simulations with a varying number of particles. We empirically confirm the expected inverse linear dependence of the exchange--correlation (XC) part of the chemical potential on the simulated number of electrons, which allows for a reliable extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit without the necessity for an additional finite-size correction. We find very good agreement (within $\Delta\mu_\textnormal{xc}\lesssim0.5\%$) with the previous parametrization of the XC-free energy by Groth \emph{et al.}~[\emph{Phys.~Rev.~Lett.}~\textbf{119}, 135001 (2017)], which constitutes an important cross validation of current state-of-the-art UEG equations of state. In addition to being interesting in its own right, our study constitutes the basis for the future PIMC based investigation of the chemical potential of real warm dense matter systems starting with hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Error-corrected fermionic quantum processors with neutral atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body fermionic systems can be simulated in a hardware-efficient manner using a fermionic quantum processor. Neutral atoms trapped in optical potentials can realize such processors, where non-local fermionic statistics are guaranteed at the hardware level. Implementing quantum error correction in this setup is however challenging, due to the atom-number superselection present in atomic systems, that is, the impossibility of creating coherent superpositions of different particle numbers. In this work, we overcome this constraint and present a blueprint for an error-corrected fermionic quantum computer that can be implemented using current experimental capabilities. To achieve this, we first consider an ancillary set of fermionic modes and design a fermionic reference, which we then use to construct superpositions of different numbers of referenced fermions. This allows us to build logical fermionic modes that can be error corrected using standard atomic operations. Here, we focus on phase errors, which we expect to be a dominant source of errors in neutral-atom quantum processors. We then construct logical fermionic gates, and show their implementation for the logical particle-number conserving processes relevant for quantum simulation. Finally, our protocol is illustrated using a minimal fermionic circuit, where it leads to a quadratic suppression of the logical error rate.</description>

      <title>Extracting work from coherence in a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how work can be extracted from number-state coherence in a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate. With careful tuning of parameters, a sequence of thermodynamically reversible steps transforms a Glauber coherent state into a thermal state with the same energy probability distribution. The work extracted during this process arises entirely from the removal of quantum coherence. More generally, we characterise quantum (from coherence) and classical (remaining) contributions to work output, and find that in this system the quantum contribution can be dominant over a broad range of parameters. The proportion of quantum work output can be further enhanced by squeezing the initial state. Due to the many-body nature of the system, the work from coherence can equivalently be understood as work from entanglement.</description>

      <title>Many-body enhancement in a spin-chain quantum heat engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that ferromagnetic interactions can enhance the adiabatic performance of a quantum spin chain engine at low temperatures. The enhancement in work output is particular pronounced, increasing exponentially with interaction strength. The performance enhancement occurs in the paramagnetic phase and is qualitatively explained by considering just the ground and first excited state, in which case the system exhibits bipartite entanglement. As the temperature is increased, thermal occupation of higher energy states diminishes performance. We find that these thermal fluctuations are smallest for long-range interactions, resulting in the highest efficiency. Diabatic work extraction degrades performance due to quantum friction. We identify an approximate, experimentally realisable counterdiabatic drive that can mitigate friction for weak interactions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics and eigenstate correlations in strongly disordered quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The many-body localised phase of quantum systems is an unusual dynamical phase wherein the system fails to thermalise and yet, entanglement grows unboundedly albeit very slowly in time. We present a microscopic theory of this ultraslow growth of entanglement in terms of dynamical eigenstate correlations of strongly disordered, interacting quantum systems in the many-body localised regime. These correlations involve sets of four or more eigenstates and hence, go beyond correlations involving pairs of eigenstates which are usually studied in the context of eigenstate thermalisation or lack thereof. We consider the minimal case, namely the second R\'enyi entropy of entanglement, of an initial product state as well as that of the time-evolution operator, wherein the correlations involve quartets of four eigenstates. We identify that the dynamics of the entanglement entropy is dominated by the spectral correlations within certain special quartets of eigenstates. We uncover the spatial structure of these special quartets and the ensuing statistics of the spectral correlations amongst the eigenstates therein, which reveals a hierarchy of timescales or equivalently, energyscales. We show that the hierarchy of these timescales along with their non-trivial distributions conspire to produce the logarithmic in time growth of entanglement, characteristic of the many-body localised regime. The underlying spatial structures in the set of special quartets also provides a microscopic understanding of the spacetime picture of the entanglement growth. The theory therefore provides a much richer perspective on entanglement growth in strongly disordered systems compared to the commonly employed phenomenological approach based on the $\ell$-bit picture.</description>

      <title>Effective (Floquet) Lindblad generators from spectral unwinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mathematical description of the reduced dynamics of an open quantum system can often be given in terms of a completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) map, also known as quantum channel. In a seminal work by Wolf et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 150402 (2008)], it was shown that deciding whether a given quantum channel was generated from an underlying effective Markovian dynamics, with time-independent generator of Lindblad form, is generally an NP-hard problem. The difficulty is related to the fact that one has to search through all possible branches of the operator logarithm of the map, in order to identify, if any of the resulting effective generators is of Lindblad form. In this work we show that in cases where one has access to the full reduced dynamics at all previous times (the dynamical map) one can significantly facilitate the search for an effective generator by making use of Floquet theory. By performing a spectral unwinding such that the effective micromotion is minimized, the effective Floquet generator is often an excellent candidate for an effective generator of Lindblad form. This significantly reduces the complexity of the search for an effective generator of Lindblad form in many (though not all) cases. Our results are relevant for engineering Floquet Lindbladians in complex many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: We define a measurable spin for the edge of a lowest Landau level and incompressible fractional quantum Hall state in the presence of an Abelian or non-Abelian bulk quasiparticle. We show that this quantity takes a fractional value inherited from the fractional spin of the bulk quasiparticle. We present a geometric picture that does not rely on global symmetries of the wavefunction but is able to treat quasiparticles and edges with different shapes. We study finite-size many-body wavefunctions on the cylinder with circular quasiparticles and straight edges. Our results are supported by matrix-product-state calculations for the Laughlin and the k=3 Read-Rezayi states.</description>

      <title>A bosonic matrix product state description of Read-Rezayi states and its application to quasi-hole spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state by means of a purely bosonic matrix product state formulation, which is described in detail. We calculate the density profiles in the presence of bulk quasi-holes of six different types: one for each $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion sector. From the density profiles, we calculate the (local) spins of these quasi-holes. By employing a spin-statistics relation, we obtain the exchange statistics parameters. Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the quasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding quasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the monodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry phase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our bosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.</description>
