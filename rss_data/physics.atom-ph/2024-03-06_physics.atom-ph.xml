      <title>Targeted optimization in small-scale atomic structure calculations: application to Au I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of reliable atomic data can be a severe limitation in astrophysical modelling, in particular of events such as kilonovae that require information on all neutron-capture elements across a wide range of ionization stages. Notably, the presence of non-orthonormalities between electron orbitals representing configurations that are close in energy can introduce significant inaccuracies in computed energies and transition probabilities. Here, we propose an explicit targeted optimization method that can effectively circumvent this concern while retaining an orthonormal orbital basis set. We illustrate this method within the framework of small-scale atomic structure models of Au I, using the GRASP2018 multiconfigurational Dirac-Hartree-Fock atomic structure code. By comparing to conventional optimization schemes we show how a targeted optimization approach improves the energy level positioning and ordering. Targeted optimization also leads to better agreement with experimental data for the strongest E1 transitions. This illustrates how small-scale models can be significantly improved with minor computational costs if orbital non-orthonormalities are considered carefully. These results should prove useful to multi-element atomic structure calculations in, for example, astrophysical opacity applications involving neutron-capture elements.</description>

      <title>Observing the relative sign of excited-state dipole transitions by combining attosecond streaking and transient absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic structure of atomic quantum systems and their dynamical interaction with light is reflected in transition dipole matrix elements coupling the system's energy eigenstates. In this work, we measure phase shifts of the time-dependent ultrafast absorption to determine the relative signs of. the transition-dipole matrix elements. The measurement relies on precise absolute calibration of the relative timing between the used light pulses, which is achieved by combining attosecond transient absorption and attosecond streaking spectroscopy to simultaneously measure the resonant photoabsorption spectra of laser-coupled doubly excited states in helium, together with the attosecond streaked photoelectron spectra. The streaking measurement reveals the absolute timing and the full temporal profile of the interacting electric fields which is then used to quantify the state-specific dynamics of the measured photoabsorption spectra. By comparing the 1-fs time-scale modulation across the absorption lines corresponding to the 2s2p (1P) and sp2,3+ (1P) doubly excited states between simulation and measurement, we quantify the signs of the transition dipole matrix elements for the laser-coupled autoionizing states 2s2p-2p2 and 2p2-sp2,3+ to be opposite of each other.</description>

      <title>Deterministic preparation of a dual-species two-ion crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for efficient preparation methods for dual-species ion crystals is rapidly expanding across quantum technology and fundamental physics applications with trapped ions. We present a deterministic and efficient technique to produce such crystals, utilizing the segmented structure of a linear Paul trap. By precisely tailoring the trapping potentials, we can split, move, and discard parts of an ion chain. This process is automated in a sequence that converts a larger ion sample into the desired configuration. A critical component of our approach is the accurate identification of crystal constituents. This is achieved by matching the measured positions of fluorescing ions against theoretical expectations for larger crystals, thus facilitating the detection of non-fluorescing ions and enabling accurate ion counting. We demonstrate that our method reliably produces two-ion crystals within minutes. These results represent a significant advance in the production of two-species ion crystals with applications ranging from quantum logic spectroscopy and optical clocks to quantum computing and simulation with trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Successive quasienergy collapse and the driven Dicke phase transition in the few-emitter limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergent behavior that arises in many-body systems of increasing size follows universal laws that become apparent in order-to-disorder transitions. While this behavior has been traditionally explored for large numbers of emitters, recent progress allows for the exploration of the few-emitter limit, where correlations can be measured and connected to microscopic models to gain further insight into order-to-disorder transitions. We explore this few-body limit in the driven and damped Tavis--Cummings model, which describes a collection of atoms interacting with a driven and damped cavity mode. Our exploration revolves around the dressed states of the atomic ensemble and field, whose energies are shown to collapse as the driving field is increased to mark the onset of a dissipative quantum phase transition. The collapse occurs in stages and is an effect of light-matter correlations that are overlooked for single atoms and neglected in mean-field models. The implications of these correlations over the macroscopic observables of the system are presented. We encounter a shift in the expected transition point and an increased number of parity-broken states to choose from once the ordered phase is reached.</description>

      <title>Limits on scalar dark matter interactions from radiative corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is limited information about interaction strength of scalar dark matter candidate with hadrons and leptons for scalar particle mass exceeding $10^{-3}$ eV while its interaction with photon is well-studied. The scalar-photon coupling constant receives quantum corrections from one-loop Feynman diagrams which involve the scalar-lepton, scalar-quark and scalar-W boson vertices. We calculate these one-loop quantum corrections and find new limits on the scalar particle interactions with electron, muon, tau, quarks, nucleons, gluons and W boson for $m_{\phi}&lt;15$ MeV by re-purposing the results of experiments measuring the scalar-photon interaction. Limits on interactions with heavy leptons and quarks have been obtained for the first time, limits on other interactions in certain mass intervals are 2 to 15 orders of magnitude stronger than those presented in previous publications.</description>

      <title>Pushing single atoms near an optical cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical scattering force is used to reduce the loading time of single atoms to a cavity mode. Releasing a cold atomic ensemble above the resonator, we apply a push beam along the direction of gravity, offering fast atomic transport with narrow velocity distribution. We also observe in real time that, when the push beam is illuminated against gravity, single atoms slow down and even turn around in the mode, through the cavity-transmission measurement. Our method can be employed to make atom-cavity experiments more efficient.</description>

      <title>Enhancing single-atom loading in tightly confined dipole traps with ancillary dipole beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single atoms trapped in tightly focused optical dipole traps provide an excellent experimental platform for quantum computing, precision measurement, and fundamental physics research. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a novel approach to enhancing the loading of single atoms by introducing a weak ancillary dipole beam. The loading rate of single atoms in a dipole trap can be significantly improved by only a few tens of microwatts of counter-propagating beam. It was also demonstrated that multiple atoms could be loaded with the assistance of a counter-propagating beam. By reducing the power requirements for trapping single atoms and enabling the trapping of multiple atoms, our method facilitates the extension of single-atom arrays and the investigation of collective light-atom interactions.</description>

      <title>High-Order Harmonic Generation in Helium: A Comparison Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a detailed study of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in helium. When comparing predictions from a single-active-electron model with those from all-electron simulations, such as ATTOMESA and R-matrix with time-dependence, which can include different numbers of states in the close-coupling expansion, it seems imperative to generate absolute numbers for the HHG spectrum in a well-defined framework. While qualitative agreement in the overall frequency dependence of the spectrum, including the cut-off frequency predicted by a semi-classical model, can be achieved by many models in arbitrary units, only absolute numbers can be used for benchmark comparisons between different approaches.</description>

      <title>Proposal for simulating quantum spin models with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction using Rydberg atoms, and construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to realize tunable quantum spin models with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in Rydberg atom quantum simulators. Our scheme uses a two-photon Raman transition and transformation to the spin-rotating frame. We investigate the properties of the model including only the DMI and Zeeman energy, which can be experimentally realized in our scheme. We show that the model accommodates exact and asymptotic quantum many-body scars exhibiting nonergodic dynamics.</description>
