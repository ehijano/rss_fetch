      <title>Effective Versions of Strong Measure Zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective versions of strong measure zero sets are developed for various levels of complexity and computability. It is shown that the sets can be equivalently defined using a generalization of supermartingales called odds supermartingales, success rates on supermartingales, predictors, and coverings. We show Borel's conjecture of a set having strong measure zero if and only if it is countable holds in the time and space bounded setting. At the level of computability this does not hold. We show the computable level contains sequences at arbitrary levels of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy by proving a correspondence principle yielding a condition for the sets of computable strong measure zero to agree with the classical sets of strong measure zero. An algorithmic version of strong measure zero using lower semicomputability is defined. We show that this notion is equivalent to the set of NCR reals studied by Reimann and Slaman, thereby giving new characterizations of this set. Effective strong packing dimension zero is investigated requiring success with respect to the limit inferior instead of the limit superior. It is proven that every sequence in the corresponding algorithmic class is decidable. At the level of computability, the sets coincide with a notion of weak countability that we define.</description>

      <title>Convergence and efficiency proof of quantum imaginary time evolution for bounded order systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many current and near-future applications of quantum computing utilise parametric families of quantum circuits and variational methods to find optimal values for these parameters. Solving a quantum computational problem with such variational methods relies on minimising some cost function, e.g., the energy of a physical system. As such, this is similar to the training process in machine learning and variational quantum simulations can therefore suffer from similar problems encountered in machine learning training. This includes non-convergence to the global minimum due to local minima as well as critical slowing down. In this article, we analyse the imaginary time evolution as a means of compiling parametric quantum circuits and finding optimal parameters, and show that it guarantees convergence to the global minimum without critical slowing down. We also show that the compilation process, including the task of finding optimal parameters, can be performed efficiently up to an arbitrary error threshold if the underlying physical system is of bounded order. This includes many relevant computational problems, e.g., local physical theories and combinatorial optimisation problems such as the flight-to-gate assignment problem. In particular, we show a priori estimates on the success probability for these combinatorial optimisation problems. There seem to be no known classical methods with similar efficiency and convergence guarantees. Meanwhile the imaginary time evolution method can be implemented on current quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for the Diverse-k-SAT problem: the geometry of satisfying assignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a $k$-CNF formula and an integer $s$, we study algorithms that obtain $s$ solutions to the formula that are maximally dispersed. For $s=2$, the problem of computing the diameter of a $k$-CNF formula was initiated by Creszenzi and Rossi, who showed strong hardness results even for $k=2$. Assuming SETH, the current best upper bound [Angelsmark and Thapper '04] goes to $4^n$ as $k \rightarrow \infty$. As our first result, we give exact algorithms for using the Fast Fourier Transform and clique-finding that run in $O^*(2^{(s-1)n})$ and $O^*(s^2 |\Omega_{F}|^{\omega \lceil s/3 \rceil})$ respectively, where $|\Omega_{F}|$ is the size of the solution space of the formula $F$ and $\omega$ is the matrix multiplication exponent.
  As our main result, we re-analyze the popular PPZ (Paturi, Pudlak, Zane '97) and Sch\"{o}ning's ('02) algorithms (which find one solution in time $O^*(2^{\varepsilon_{k}n})$ for $\varepsilon_{k} \approx 1-\Theta(1/k)$), and show that in the same time, they can be used to approximate the diameter as well as the dispersion ($s&gt;2$) problems. While we need to modify Sch\"{o}ning's original algorithm, we show that the PPZ algorithm, without any modification, samples solutions in a geometric sense. We believe that this property may be of independent interest.
  Finally, we present algorithms to output approximately diverse, approximately optimal solutions to NP-complete optimization problems running in time $\text{poly}(s)O^*(2^{\varepsilon n})$ with $\varepsilon&lt;1$ for several problems such as Minimum Hitting Set and Feedback Vertex Set. For these problems, all existing exact methods for finding optimal diverse solutions have a runtime with at least an exponential dependence on the number of solutions $s$. Our methods find bi-approximations with polynomial dependence on $s$.</description>

      <title>On closure properties of TotP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20262v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The class TotP consists of functions that count the number of all paths of a nondeterministic polynomial-time Turing machine. In this paper, we give a second definition of the class TotP in terms of certificates and verifiers, and present a few natural closure properties of this class. From the second definition of TotP it follows that TotP = #P if and only if P = NP. We also prove that the closure of TotP under left composition with the class FP+ is equivalent to TotP = FP+ and P = PP, and give examples of FP+-functions such that if TotP is closed under composition with them, then it is closed under composition with FP+.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Firefighting on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a pursuit-evasion game that describes the process of extinguishing a fire burning on the nodes of an undirected graph. We denote the minimum number of firefighters required by $\text{ffn}(G)$ and provide a characterization for the graphs with $\text{ffn}(G)=1$ and $\text{ffn}(G)=2$ as well as almost sharp bounds for complete binary trees. We show that deciding whether $\text{ffn}(G) \leq m$ for given $G$ and $m$ is NP-hard. Furthermore, we show that shortest strategies can have superpolynomial length, leaving open whether the problem is in NP. Based on some plausible conjectures, we also prove that this decision problem is neither NP-hard for graphs with bounded treewidth nor for constant $m$.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Geometric programming in the Turing model and application to nonnegative tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a version of geometric programming problem consisting in minimizing a function given by the maximum of finitely many log-Laplace transforms of discrete nonnegative measures on a Euclidean space. Under a coerciveness assumption, we show that an $\varepsilon$-minimizer can be computed in a time that is polynomial in the input size and in $|\log\varepsilon|$. This is obtained by establishing bit-size estimates on approximate minimizers and by applying the ellipsoid method. We also derive polynomial iteration complexity bounds for the interior-point method applied to the same class of problems. We deduce that the spectral radius of a partially symmetric, weakly irreducible nonnegative tensor can be approximated within an $\varepsilon$-error in polynomial time. For strongly irreducible tensors, we show in addition that the logarithm of the positive eigenvector is polynomial time approximable. Our results also yield that the the maximum of a nonnegative homogeneous $d$-form in the $\ell_d$ unit ball can be approximated in polynomial time. In particular, the spectral radius of uniform weighted hypergraphs and some known upper bounds for the clique number of uniform hypergraphs are polynomial time computable. In contrast, we provide an example showing that the Phase I approach needs exponentially many bits to solve the feasibility problem in geometric programming.</description>

      <title>Quartic quantum speedups for planted inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a quantum algorithm for the Planted Noisy $k$XOR problem (also known as sparse Learning Parity with Noise) that achieves a nearly quartic ($4$th power) speedup over the best known classical algorithm while also only using logarithmically many qubits. Our work generalizes and simplifies prior work of Hastings, by building on his quantum algorithm for the Tensor Principal Component Analysis (PCA) problem. We achieve our quantum speedup using a general framework based on the Kikuchi Method (recovering the quartic speedup for Tensor PCA), and we anticipate it will yield similar speedups for further planted inference problems. These speedups rely on the fact that planted inference problems naturally instantiate the Guided Sparse Hamiltonian problem. Since the Planted Noisy $k$XOR problem has been used as a component of certain cryptographic constructions, our work suggests that some of these are susceptible to super-quadratic quantum attacks.</description>

      <title>Unique Hard Attention: A Tale of Two Sides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the expressive power of transformers has recently attracted attention, as it offers insights into their abilities and limitations. Many studies analyze unique hard attention transformers, where attention selects a single position that maximizes the attention scores. When multiple positions achieve the maximum score, either the rightmost or the leftmost of those is chosen. In this paper, we highlight the importance of this seeming triviality. Recently, finite-precision transformers with both leftmost- and rightmost-hard attention were shown to be equivalent to Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). We show that this no longer holds with only leftmost-hard attention -- in that case, they correspond to a \emph{strictly weaker} fragment of LTL. Furthermore, we show that models with leftmost-hard attention are equivalent to \emph{soft} attention, suggesting they may better approximate real-world transformers than right-attention models. These findings refine the landscape of transformer expressivity and underscore the role of attention directionality.</description>
