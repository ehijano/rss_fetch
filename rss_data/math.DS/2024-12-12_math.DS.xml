      <title>Renormalization for Bruin-Troubetzkoy ITMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of interval translation mappings introduced by Bruin and Troubetzkoy, describing a new renormalization scheme, inspired by the classical Rauzy induction for this class. We construct a measure, invariant under the renormalization, supported on the parameters yielding infinite type interval translation mappings in this class. With respect to this measure, a.e. transformation is uniquely ergodic. We show that this set has Hausdorff dimension between 1.5 and 2, and that the Hausdorff dimension coincides with the affinity dimension. Finally, seeing our renormalization as a multidimensional continued fraction algorithm, we show that it has almost always the Pisot property. We discover an interesting phenomenon: the dynamics of this class of transformations is often (conjecturally: almost always) weak mixing, while the renormalizing algorithm typically has the Pisot property.</description>

      <title>Projection Method for Steady states of Cahn-Hilliard Equation with the Dynamic Boundary Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard equation is a fundamental model that describes phase separation processes of two-phase flows or binary mixtures. In recent years, the dynamic boundary conditions for the Cahn-Hilliard equation have been proposed and analyzed. Our first goal in this article is to present a projection method to locate the steady state of the CH equation with dynamic boundary conditions. The main feature of this method is that it only uses the variational derivative in the metric $L^2$ and not that in the metric $H^{-1}$, thus significantly reducing the computational cost. In addition, the projected dynamics fulfill the important physical properties: mass conservation and energy dissipation. In the temporal construction of the numerical schemes, the convex splitting method is used to ensure a large time step size. Numerical experiments for the two-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau free energy, where the surface potential is the double well potential or the moving contact line potential, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of this projection method.</description>

      <title>Koopman Theory-Inspired Method for Learning Time Advancement Operators in Unstable Flame Front Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the evolution of complex systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) remains challenging, especially for nonlinear, chaotic behaviors. This study introduces Koopman-inspired Fourier Neural Operators (kFNO) and Convolutional Neural Networks (kCNN) to learn solution advancement operators for flame front instabilities. By transforming data into a high-dimensional latent space, these models achieve more accurate multi-step predictions compared to traditional methods. Benchmarking across one- and two-dimensional flame front scenarios demonstrates the proposed approaches' superior performance in short-term accuracy and long-term statistical reproduction, offering a promising framework for modeling complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new generalization of Wythoff Nim using three piles of stones. We show that its P-positions have finite difference properties and produce a partition of positive integers. Further, we give a conjecture that the P-positions approximate a semi-line whose slope is described by algebraic numbers of degree 5.</description>

      <title>On uniformly quasiconformal Anosov diffeomorphisms with two dimensional distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a transitive uniformly $u$-quasiconformal Anosov diffeomorphism with a two-dimensional unstable distribution has a globally defined stable holonomy. As a corollary, we are able to remove an additional assumption in a theorem of Kalinin-Sadovskaya, and deduce that all transitive uniformly quasiconformal Anosov diffeomorphisms are $C^{\infty}$-conjugate to affine Anosov diffeomorphisms on infra-torus.</description>

      <title>Singular perturbation in heavy ball dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a $C^{1,1}_\mathrm{loc}$ lower bounded function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ definable in an o-minimal structure on the real field, we show that the singular perturbation $\epsilon \searrow 0$ in the heavy ball system \begin{equation} \label{eq:P_eps} \tag{$P_\epsilon$}
  \epsilon\ddot{x}_\epsilon(t) + \gamma\dot{x}_\epsilon(t) + \nabla f(x_\epsilon(t)) = 0, ~~~ \forall t \geqslant 0, ~~~ x_\epsilon(0) = x_0, ~~~ \dot{x}_\epsilon(0) = \dot{x}_0, \end{equation} preserves boundedness of solutions, where $\gamma&gt;0$ is the friction and $(x_0,\dot{x}_0) \in \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n$ is the initial condition. This complements the work of Attouch, Goudou, and Redont which deals with finite time horizons. In other words, this work studies the asymptotic behavior of a ball rolling on a surface subject to gravitation and friction, without assuming convexity nor coercivity.</description>

      <title>Algebraic dependence number and cardinality of generating iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a dust-like self-similar set (generated by IFSs with the strong separation condition), Elekes, Keleti and M\'{a}th\'{e} found an invariant, called `algebraic dependence number', by considering its generating IFSs and isometry invariant self-similar measures. We find an intrinsic quantitative characterisation of this number: it is the dimension over $\mathbb{Q}$ of the vector space generated by the logarithms of all the common ratios of infinite geometric sequences in the gap length set, minus 1. With this concept, we present a lower bound on the cardinality of generating IFS (with or without separation conditions) in terms of the gap lengths of a dust-like set. We also establish analogous result for dust-like graph-directed attractors on complete metric spaces. This is a new application of the ratio analysis method and the gap sequence.</description>

      <title>Furstenberg systems of pretentious and MRT multiplicative functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03121v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove structural results for measure preserving systems, called Furstenberg systems, naturally associated with bounded multiplicative functions. We show that for all pretentious multiplicative functions these systems always have rational discrete spectrum and, as a consequence, zero entropy. We obtain several other refined structural and spectral results, one consequence of which is that the Archimedean characters are the only pretentious multiplicative functions that have Furstenberg systems with trivial rational spectrum, another is that a pretentious multiplicative function has ergodic Furstenberg systems if and only if it pretends to be a Dirichlet character, and a last one is that for any fixed pretentious multiplicative function all its Furstenberg systems are isomorphic. We also study structural properties of Furstenberg systems of a class of multiplicative functions, introduced by Matom\"aki, Radziwill, and Tao, which lie in the intermediate zone between pretentiousness and strong aperiodicity. In a work of the last two authors and Gomilko, several examples of this class with exotic ergodic behavior were identified, and here we complement this study and discover some new unexpected phenomena. Lastly, we prove that Furstenberg systems of general bounded multiplicative functions have divisible spectrum. When these systems are obtained using logarithmic averages, we show that trivial rational spectrum implies a strong dilation invariance property, called strong stationarity, but, quite surprisingly, this property fails when the systems are obtained using Ces\`aro averages.</description>

      <title>Epidemiological dynamics in populations structured by neighbourhoods and households</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epidemiological dynamics are affected by the spatial and demographic structure of the host population. Households and neighbourhoods are known to be important groupings but little is known about the epidemiological interplay between them. In order to explore the implications for infectious disease epidemiology of households with similar demographic structures clustered in space we develop a multi-scale epidemic model consisting of neighbourhoods of households. In our analysis we focus on key parameters which control household size, the importance of transmission within households relative to outside of them, and the degree to which the non-household transmission is localised within neighbourhoods. We construct the household reproduction number $R_*$ over all neighbourhoods and derive the analytic probability of an outbreak occurring from a single infected individual in a specific neighbourhood. We find that reduced localisation of transmission within neighbourhoods reduces $R_*$ when household size differs between neighbourhoods. This effect is amplified by larger differences between household sizes and larger divergence between transmission rates within households and outside of them. However, the impact of neighbourhoods with larger household sizes on an individual's risk of infection is mainly limited to the individuals that reside in those neighbourhoods. We consider various surveillance scenarios and show that household size information from the initial infectious cases is often more important than neighbourhood information while household size and neighbourhood localisation influences the sequence of neighbourhoods in which an outbreak is observed.</description>

      <title>Approaches to critical point theory via sequential and parametrized topological complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a space was introduced to obtain a lower bound on the number of critical points of a $C^1$-function on a given manifold. Related to Lusternik-Schnirelmann category and motivated by topological robotics, the topological complexity (TC) of a space is a numerical homotopy invariant whose topological properties are an active field of research. The notions of sequential and parametrized topological complexity extend the ideas of topological complexity. While the definition of TC is closely related to Lusternik-Schnirelmann category, the connections of sequential and parametrized TC to critical point theory have not been fully explored yet. In this article we apply methods from Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory to establish various lower bounds on numbers of critical points of functions in terms of sequential and parametrized TCs. We carry out several consequences and applications of these bounds, among them a computation of the parametrized TC of the unit tangent bundles of $(4m-1)$-spheres.</description>
