      <title>Southern binaries with the Zorro Speckle Camera @ Gemini-South</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements in the context of a survey of southern hemisphere binary and multiple stellar systems observed with the Zorro Speckle dual diffraction-limited optical imaging camera on the 8.1m Gemini-South telescope carried out between 2019 and 2023. The overall motivation of our survey, as well as some initial results of these observations, are outlined to demonstrate the capabilities - and limitations - of Zorro. We report on the astrometric characterization of the instrument in terms of the precision and accuracy of our measurements and provide details of our custom-made data reduction pipeline. For targets with separations smaller than 0.4 arcsec, an overall precision of 1 mas in the radial and tangential directions is obtained, while the uncertainty in position angle is 0.2 deg. Relative astrometry and contrast brightness in the two Zorro filters at 562 and 832 nm are reported for 70 pairs on 64 distinct systems (six are triples). Eleven new binaries are found, mostly of small separations (down to 15 mas), and large brightness contrast (up to Delta m=6 in the red channel). Our results indicate that the Zorro instrument, when properly calibrated, delivers excellent quality data for visual binary studies of tight and/or faint companions.</description>

      <title>ASASSN-13dn: A Luminous and Double-Peaked Type II Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of ASASSN-13dn, one of the first supernovae discovered by ASAS-SN, and a new member of the rare group of Luminous Type II Supernovae (LSNe II). It was discovered near maximum light, reaching an absolute magnitude of M$_{v}$ $\sim$ -19 mag, placing this object between normal luminosity type II SNe and superluminous SNe A detailed analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic data of ASASSN-13dn is performed. The spectra are characterized by broad lines, in particular the H$\alpha$ lines where we measure expansion velocities ranging between 14000 - 6000 km s$^{-1}$ over the first 100 days. H$\alpha$ dominates the nebular spectra, and we detect a narrow P-Cygni absorption within the broader emission line with an expansion velocity of 1100 km s$^{-1}$. Photometrically, its light curve shows a re-brightening of $\sim$ 0.6 mag in the $gri$ bands starting at 25$\pm$2 days after discovery, with a secondary peak at $\sim 73$d, followed by an abrupt and nearly linear decay of 0.09 mag d$^{-1}$ for the next 35 days. At later times, after a drop of 4 magnitudes from the second maximum, the light curves of ASASSN-13dn shows softer undulations from 125 to 175 days. We compare ASASSN-13dn with other LSNe II in the literature, finding no match to both light curve and spectroscopic properties. We discuss the main powering mechanism and suggest that interaction between the ejecta and a dense CSM produced by eruptions from an LBV-like progenitor could potentially explain the observations.</description>

      <title>On the million-degree signature of spicules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spicules have often been proposed as substantial contributors toward the mass and energy balance of the solar corona. While their transition region (TR) counterpart has unequivocally been established over the past decade, the observations concerning the coronal contribution of spicules have often been contested. This is mainly attributed to the lack of adequate coordinated observations, their small spatial scales, highly dynamic nature, and complex multi-thermal evolution, which are often observed at the limit of our current observational facilities. Therefore, it remains unclear how much heating occurs in association with spicules to coronal temperatures. In this study, we use coordinated high-resolution observations of the solar chromosphere, TR, and corona of a quiet Sun region and a coronal hole with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) to investigate the (lower) coronal ($\sim$1MK) emission associated with spicules. We perform differential emission measure (DEM) analysis on the AIA passbands using basis pursuit and a newly developed technique based on Tikhonov regularization to probe the thermal structure of the spicular environment at coronal temperatures. We find that the EM maps at 1 MK reveal the presence of ubiquitous, small-scale jets with a clear spatio-temporal coherence with the spicules observed in the IRIS/TR passband. Detailed space-time analysis of the chromospheric, TR, and EM maps show unambiguous evidence of rapidly outward propagating spicules with strong emission (2--3 times higher than the background) at 1 MK. Our findings are consistent with previously reported MHD simulations that show heating to coronal temperatures associated with spicules.</description>

      <title>The role of Trees of Fragmenting Granules (TFG) in the formation of the solar supergranular pattern from Hinode observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present in this paper an exceptional scientific dataset allowing to investigate the structure and evolution of the interior of solar supergranulation cells. Trees of Fragmenting Granules (TFG) and associated flows were evidenced using Local Correlation Tracking techniques (LCT) from a 24 H duration sequence of Hinode (JAXA/NASA) observations. The treatment of the dataset exhibits the evolution of the TFG and shows that their mutual interactions are able to build horizontal flows with longer lifetime than granules (1 to 2 hours) over a scale of 10 arcsec (the mesogranulation). These flows act on the diffusion of the intranetwork magnetic elements and also on the location and shape of the network. Hence, the TFG appear as one of the major elements involved in supergranular formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Exploring coronal abundances of M dwarfs at moderate activity levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Main sequence stars of spectral types F, G, and K with low to moderate activity levels exhibit a recognizable pattern known as the first ionization potential effect (FIP effect), where elements with lower first ionization potentials are more abundant in the stellar corona than in the photosphere. In contrast, high activity main sequence stars such as AB Dor (K0), active binaries, and M dwarfs exhibit an inverse pattern known as iFIP. We aim to determine whether or not the iFIP pattern persists in moderate-activity M dwarfs. We used XMM-Newton to observe the moderately active M dwarf HD 223889 that has an X-ray surface flux of log FX,surf = 5.26, the lowest for an M dwarf studied so far for coronal abundance patterns. We used low-resolution CCD spectra of the star to calculate the strength of the FIP effect quantified by the FIP bias (Fbias) to assess the persistence of the iFIP effect in M dwarfs. Our findings reveal an iFIP effect similar to that of another moderately active binary star, GJ 338 AB, with a comparable error margin. The results hint at a possible plateau in the Teff-Fbias diagram for moderately active M dwarfs. Targeting stars with low coronal activity that have a coronal temperature between 2 MK and 4 MK is essential for refining our understanding of (i)FIP patterns and their causes.</description>

      <title>Reduced atomic models for large-scale computations: Fe XIII near-infrared lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate atomic models for astrophysical plasma can be very complex, requiring thousands of states. However, for a variety of applications such as large-scale forward models of the Stokes parameters of a spectral line in the solar corona, it is necessary to build much reduced atomic models. We present two examples of such models, focused on the two near-infrared Fe XIII lines observed on the ground at 10750, 10801 Angstroms. These lines are primary diagnostics for a range of missions (especially the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope, DKIST) to measure electron densities and magnetic fields in the solar corona. We calculate the Stokes parameters for a range of coronal conditions using CHIANTI (for intensities) and P-CORONA (for intensities and polarization), and use P-CORONA and a realistic global MHD simulation to show that the reduced models provide accurate results, typically to within 5% those obtained with larger models. Reduced models provide a significant decrease (over three orders of magnitude) in the computational time in spectropolarimetric calculations. The methods we describe are general and can be applied to a range of conditions and other ions.</description>

      <title>Precursor Activity Preceding Interacting Supernovae I: Bridging the Gap with SN 2022mop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, an increasing number of transients have shown luminous activity at their explosion sites weeks to years before an interacting supernova (SN) is observed. For some objects, this pre-SN activity is typically linked to large-scale mass-loss events preceding core collapse, yet its triggering mechanism and the underlying explosion process remain uncertain. We present SN 2022mop, which was initially observed in August 2022, exhibiting nebular emission, including [O I], Mg I], and [Ca II], resembling the late-time (~200 days post-explosion) spectrum of a stripped-envelope SN (SESN) from a progenitor with M[ZAMS] &lt; 18 Msun. SN 2022mop shows strong (~ 1 mag) repeating undulations in its light curve, suggesting late-time interaction. In mid-2024, the transient re-brightened for several months before a Type IIn SN (r[peak] = -18.2 mag) was observed in December 2024, closely resembling the evolution of SN 2009ip. By triangulating both transients using Pan-STARRS images, we determine that both transients are coincident within approximately 3 parsecs. Given the environment, the chance alignment of two isolated SNe is unlikely. We propose a merger-burst scenario: a compact object formed in 2022, is kicked into an eccentric orbit, interacts with its hydrogen-rich companion over subsequent months, and ultimately merges, triggering a Type IIn SN-like transient.</description>

      <title>Multi-Phase Shock Cooling Emission in Ultra-Stripped Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-stripped and Type Ibn supernovae (USSNe and SNe Ibn, respectively) are fast-evolving, hydrogen-poor transients that often show signs of interaction with dense circumstellar material (CSM). Wu &amp; Fuller (2022) identify a mass range for helium-core stars in which they expand significantly during core oxygen/neon burning, resulting in extreme late-stage mass loss in tight binaries ($P\sim1-100\,{\rm days}$). Here we explore the resulting light curves from a subset of models from Wu &amp; Fuller (2022) and find that in some cases they can exhibit two phases of shock cooling emission (SCE). The first SCE is attributed to the circumbinary material, and the second SCE is from the extended helium-burning envelope of the exploding star. Since SCE luminosity is roughly proportional to the initial radius of the emitting material, events that exhibit both phases of SCE provide the exciting opportunity of measuring both the extent of the CSM and the radius of the exploding star. These light curves are explored with both analytic arguments and numerical modeling, and from this we identify the parameter space of CSM mass, helium envelope mass, and nickel mass, for which the helium envelope SCE will be visible. We provide a qualitative comparison of these models to two fast-evolving, helium-rich transients, SN2019kbj and SN2019dge. The similarity between these events and our models demonstrates that this extreme binary mass loss mechanism may explain some SNe Ibn and USSNe.</description>

      <title>Taylor-Couette flow with split endcaps: preparatory hydrodynamic study for upcoming DRESDYN-MRI experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetorotational instability (MRI) is of great importance in astrophysical disks, driving angular momentum transport and accretion of matter onto a central object. A Taylor-Couette (TC) flow between two coaxial cylinders subject to an axial magnetic field is a preferred setup for MRI-experiments. A main challenge in those experiments has been to minimize the effects of axial boundaries, or endcaps, which substantially alter the flow structure compared to the axially unbounded idealized case. Understanding the influence of endcaps on the flow stability is crucial for the unambiguous experimental identification of MRI. In this paper, we examine the hydrodynamic evolution of a TC flow in the presence of split endcap rims up to Reynolds number $Re =$ $2\times 10^5$. At this $Re$, the flow deviates from the ideal TC flow profile, resulting in about $15\%$ deviation in angular velocity at the mid-height of the cylinders. Aside from turbulent fluctuations caused by shearing instability at the endcaps, the bulk flow remains axially independent and exhibits Rayleigh stability. We characterize the scaling of the Ekman and Stewartson boundary layer thickness with respect to $Re$. We also study the effect of changing the rotation ratio of the cylinders $\mu$ on the flow at large $Re$ and show that TC experiments can be conducted for larger $\mu \sim 0.5$ to safely ensure the hydrodynamic stability of the flow in the upcoming DRESDYN-MRI experiment. In all configurations considered, the modification of the flow profile by the endcaps further decreases the required critical threshold for the onset of MRI that can facilitate its detection in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Stellar Parameters for over Fifty Million stars from SMSS DR4 and Gaia DR3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an updated catalog of stellar parameters, including effective temperature, luminosity classification, and metallicity, for over fifty million stars from the SkyMapper Southern Survey (SMSS) DR4 and Gaia DR3. The accuracy of the derived parameters remains consistent with those achieved in SMSS DR2 using the same methods. Thanks to the advancements in SMSS DR4, photometric-metallicity estimates are now available for an unprecedented number of metal-poor stars. The catalog includes over 13 million metal-poor (MP; [Fe/H]&lt;-1) stars, nearly three million very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H]&lt;-2.0) stars, and approximately 120,000 extremely metal-poor (EMP; [Fe/H]&lt;-3.0) stars -- representing an increase by a factor of 4-6 compared to SMSS DR2. This catalog, combined with other stellar parameters obtained through our efforts, will be made available at https://nadc.china-vo.org/data/sports/.</description>

      <title>Exploratory study on the masses of odd-$Z$ nuclei and $r$-process simulation based on the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \textbf{Background:} Nuclear masses of exotic nuclei are important for both nuclear physics and astrophysics. The deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) is capable of providing proper descriptions for exotic nuclei by simultaneously including deformation and continuum effects. The mass table of even-$Z$ nuclei with $8\le Z\le 120$ has been established based on the DRHBc theory [ADNDT 158, 101661 (2024)]. \textbf{Purpose:} This work aims to systematically estimate the masses of odd-$Z$ nuclei based on the available DRHBc results of even-$Z$ nuclei, thereby providing a pseudo DRHBc mass table for all nuclei with $8\le Z\le 120$. This mass table can then be employed in the $r$-process studies to investigate the influence of deformation on $r$-process. \textbf{Method:} The mass of an odd nucleus is expressed as a function of the masses and odd-even mass differences of its neighboring even nuclei, with the odd-even mass difference approximated by the average pairing gap. The $r$-process simulations are carried out using the site-independent classical $r$-process model based on the waiting-point approximation. \textbf{Results and Conclusions:} The approximation of the odd-even mass difference with the average pairing gap is validated to be effective, by reproducing the masses of even-$Z$ odd-$N$ nuclei calculated by DRHBc. Combining the DRHBc masses of even-$Z$ nuclei and the estimated masses of odd-$Z$, a pseudo DRHBc mass table is established, with the root-mean-square (rms) deviation from available mass data $\sigma=1.50$ MeV. This pseudo DRHBc mass table is applied to the $r$-process simulation, and the impact of nuclear deformation effects is analyzed. The deformation effects can influence the $r$-process path and thus affect the $r$-process abundance. In particular, the nuclear shape transitions can even lead to the discontinuity of the $r$-process path.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared evidence for iron-rich dust in the multi-ringed inner disk of HD 144432</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Rocky planets form by the concentration of solid particles in the inner few au regions of planet-forming disks. Their chemical composition reflects the materials in the disk available in the solid phase at the time the planets were forming. Aims. We aim to constrain the structure and dust composition of the inner disk of the young star HD 144432, using an extensive set of infrared interferometric data taken by the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), combining PIONIER, GRAVITY, and MATISSE observations. Methods. We introduced a new physical disk model, TGMdust, to image the interferometric data, and to fit the disk structure and dust composition. We also performed equilibrium condensation calculations with GGchem. Results. Our best-fit model has three disk zones with ring-like structures at 0.15, 1.3, and 4.1 au. Assuming that the dark regions in the disk at ~0.9 au and at ~3 au are gaps opened by planets, we estimate the masses of the putative gap-opening planets to be around a Jupiter mass. We find evidence for an optically thin emission ($\tau&lt;0.4$) from the inner two disk zones ($r&lt;4$ au) at $\lambda&gt;3\ \mu$m. Our silicate compositional fits confirm radial mineralogy gradients. To identify the dust component responsible for the infrared continuum emission, we explore two cases for the dust composition, one with a silicate+iron mixture and the other with a silicate+carbon one. We find that the iron-rich model provides a better fit to the spectral energy distribution. Conclusions. We propose that in the warm inner regions ($r&lt;5$ au) of typical planet-forming disks, most if not all carbon is in the gas phase, while iron and iron sulfide grains are major constituents of the solid mixture along with forsterite and enstatite. Our analysis demonstrates the need for detailed studies of the dust in inner disks with new mid-infrared instruments such as MATISSE and JWST/MIRI.</description>

      <title>The GALAH Survey: Stellar parameters and abundances for 800,000 Gaia RVS spectra using GALAH DR4 and The Cannon</title>

Abstract: Analysing stellar parameters and abundances from nearly one million Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) spectra poses challenges due to the limited spectral coverage (restricted to the infrared Ca II triplet) and variable signal-to-noise ratios of the data. To address this, we use The Cannon, a data-driven method, to transfer stellar parameters and abundances from the GALAH (GALactic Archaeology with HERMES) DR4 (R ~ 28,000) catalogue to the lower resolution Gaia DR3 RVS spectra (R ~ 11,500). Our model, trained on 14,484 common targets, predicts parameters such as $T_{\text{eff}}$, $\log g$, and $[\text{Fe/H}]$, along with several other elements across approximately 800,000 Gaia RVS spectra. We utilise stars from open and globular clusters present in the Gaia RVS catalogue to validate our predicted mean $[\text{Fe/H}]$ with high precision (~0.02-0.10 dex). Additionally, we recover the bimodal distribution of $[\text{Ti/Fe}]$ versus $[\text{Fe/H}]$, reflecting the high and low $\alpha$-components of Milky Way disc stars, demonstrating The Cannon's capability for accurate stellar abundance determination from medium-resolution Gaia RVS spectra. The methodologies and resultant catalogue presented in this work highlight the remarkable potential of the RVS dataset, which by the end of the Gaia mission will comprise spectra of over 200 million stars.</description>

      <title>Vortex Avalanches and Collective Motion in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16878v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate the dynamics of about 600 quantum vortices in a spinning-down cylindrical container using a Gross--Pitaevskii model. For the first time, we find convincing spatial-temporal evidence of avalanching behaviour resulting from vortex depinning and collective motion. During a typical avalanche, about 10 to 20 vortices exit the container in a short period, producing a glitch in the superfluid angular momentum and a localised void in the vorticity. After the glitch, vortices continue to depin and circulate around the vorticity void in a similar manner to that seen in previous point-vortex simulations. We present evidence of collective vortex motion throughout this avalanche process. We also show that the effective Magnus force can be used to predict when and where avalanches will occur. Lastly, we comment on the challenge of extrapolating these results to conditions in real neutron stars, which contain many orders of magnitude more vortices.</description>

      <title>A 3D Simulation of a Type II-P Supernova: from Core Bounce to Beyond Shock Breakout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to better connect core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) theory with its observational signatures, we have developed a simulation pipeline from the onset of core collapse to beyond shock breakout. Using this framework, we present a three-dimensional simulation study following the evolution from five seconds to over five days of a 17-M$_{\odot}$ progenitor that explodes with $\sim$10$^{51}$ erg of energy and $\sim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni ejecta. The early explosion is highly asymmetric, expanding most prominently along the southern hemisphere. This early asymmetry is preserved to shock breakout, $\sim$1 day later. Breakout itself evinces strong angle-dependence, with as much a day delay in shock breakout by direction. The nickel ejecta closely tails the forward shock, with velocities at breakout as high as $\sim$7000 km s$^{-1}$. A delayed reverse shock forming at the H/He interface on hour timescales leads to the formation of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, fast-moving nickel bullets, and almost complete mixing of the metal core into the hydrogen envelope. For the first time, we illustrate the angle-dependent emergent broadband and bolometric light curves from simulations evolved in three-dimensions in entirety, continuing through hydrodynamic shock breakout a CCSN model of a massive stellar progenitor evolved with detailed, late-time neutrino microphysics and transport. Our case study of a single progenitor suggests that 3D simulations initiated with detailed neutrino heating can begin to generically produce the cornucopia of suggested asymmetries and features in CCSNe observations, while establishing the methodology to study this problem in breadth.</description>
