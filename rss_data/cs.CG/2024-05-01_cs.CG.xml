      <title>Optimal Bridge, Twin Bridges and Beyond: Inserting Edges into a Road Network to Minimize the Constrained Diameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a road network modelled as a planar straight-line graph $G=(V,E)$ with $|V|=n$, let $(u,v)\in V\times V$, the shortest path (distance) between $u,v$ is denoted as $\delta_G(u,v)$. Let $\delta(G)=\max_{(u,v)}\delta_G(u,v)$, for $(u,v)\in V\times V$, which is called the diameter of $G$. Given a disconnected road network modelled as two disjoint trees $T_1$ and $T_2$, this paper first aims at inserting one and two edges (bridges) between them to minimize the (constrained) diameter $\delta(T_1\cup T_2\cup I_j)$ going through the inserted edges, where $I_j, j=1,2$, is the set of inserted edges with $|I_1|=1$ and $|I_2|=2$. The corresponding problems are called the {\em optimal bridge} and {\em twin bridges} problems. Since when more than one edge are inserted between two trees the resulting graph is becoming more complex, for the general network $G$ we consider the problem of inserting a minimum of $k$ edges such that the shortest distances between a set of $m$ pairs $P=\{(u_i,v_i)\mid u_i,v_i\in V, i\in [m]\}$, $\delta_G(u_i,v_i)$'s, are all decreased.
  The main results of this paper are summarized as follows:
  (1) We show that the optimal bridge problem can be solved in $O(n^2)$ time and that a variation of it has a near-quadratic lower bound unless SETH fails. The proof also implies that the famous 3-SUM problem does have a near-quadratic lower bound for large integers, e.g., each of the $n$ input integers has $\Omega(\log n)$ decimal digits. We then give a simple factor-2 $O(n\log n)$ time approximation algorithm for the optimal bridge problem.
  (2) We present an $O(n^4)$ time algorithm to solve the twin bridges problem, exploiting some new property not in the optimal bridge problem.
  (3) For the general problem of inserting $k$ edges to reduce the (graph) distances between $m$ given pairs, we show that the problem is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology generalizations for Social Media Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study details an approach for the analysis of social media collected political data through the lens of Topological Data Analysis, with a specific focus on Persistent Homology and the political processes they represent by proposing a set of mathematical generalizations using Gaussian functions to define and analyze these Persistent Homology categories. Three distinct types of Persistent Homologies were recurrent across datasets that had been plotted through retweeting patterns and analyzed through the k-Nearest-Neighbor filtrations. As these Persistent Homologies continued to appear, they were then categorized and dubbed Nuclear, Bipolar, and Multipolar Constellations. Upon investigating the content of these plotted tweets, specific patterns of interaction and political information dissemination were identified, namely Political Personalism and Political Polarization. Through clustering and application of Gaussian density functions, I have mathematically characterized each category, encapsulating their distinctive topological features. The mathematical generalizations of Bipolar, Nuclear, and Multipolar Constellations developed in this study are designed to inspire other political science digital media researchers to utilize these categories as to identify Persistent Homology in datasets derived from various social media platforms, suggesting the broader hypothesis that such structures are bound to be present on political scraped data regardless of the social media it's derived from. This method aims to offer a new perspective in Network Analysis as it allows for an exploration of the underlying shape of the networks formed by retweeting patterns, enhancing the understanding of digital interactions within the sphere of Computational Social Sciences.</description>

      <title>Optimal Algorithm for the Planar Two-Center Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.08784v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a fundamental problem in Computational Geometry, the planar two-center problem. In this problem, the input is a set $S$ of $n$ points in the plane and the goal is to find two smallest congruent disks whose union contains all points of $S$. A longstanding open problem has been to obtain an $O(n\log n)$-time algorithm for planar two-center, matching the $\Omega(n\log n)$ lower bound given by Eppstein [SODA'97]. Towards this, researchers have made a lot of efforts over decades. The previous best algorithm, given by Wang [SoCG'20], solves the problem in $O(n\log^2 n)$ time. In this paper, we present an $O(n\log n)$-time (deterministic) algorithm for planar two-center, which completely resolves this open problem.</description>
