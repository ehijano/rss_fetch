      <title>On Balancing Sparsity with Reliable Connectivity in Distributed Network Design with Random K-out Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In several applications in distributed systems, an important design criterion is ensuring that the network is sparse, i.e., does not contain too many edges, while achieving reliable connectivity. Sparsity ensures communication overhead remains low, while reliable connectivity is tied to reliable communication and inference on decentralized data reservoirs and computational resources. A class of network models called random K-out graphs appear widely as a heuristic to balance connectivity and sparsity, especially in settings with limited trust, e.g., privacy-preserving aggregation of networked data in which networks are deployed. However, several questions remain regarding how to choose network parameters in response to different operational requirements, including the need to go beyond asymptotic results and the ability to model the stochastic and adversarial environments. To address this gap, we present theorems to inform the choice of network parameters that guarantee reliable connectivity in regimes where nodes can be finite or unreliable. We first derive upper and lower bounds for probability of connectivity in random K-out graphs when the number of nodes is finite. Next, we analyze the property of r-robustness, a stronger notion than connectivity that enables resilient consensus in the presence of malicious nodes. Finally, motivated by aggregation mechanisms based on pairwise masking, we model and analyze the impact of a subset of adversarial nodes, modeled as deletions, on connectivity and giant component size - metrics that are closely tied to privacy guarantees. Together, our results pave the way for end-to-end performance guarantees for a suite of algorithms for reliable inference on networks.</description>

      <title>Trust@Health: A Trust-Based Multilayered Network for Scalable Healthcare Service Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the intricate relationships within healthcare systems, focusing on interactions among doctors, departments, and hospitals. Leveraging an evolutionary graph framework, the proposed model emphasizes both intra-layer and inter-layer trust relationships to better understand and optimize healthcare services. The trust-based network facilitates the identification of key healthcare entities by integrating their social and professional interactions, culminating in a trust-based algorithm that quantifies the importance of these entities. Validation with a real-world dataset reveals a strong correlation (0.91) between the proposed trust measures and the ratings of hospitals and departments, though doctor ratings demonstrate skewed distributions due to potential biases. By modeling these relationships and trust dynamics, the framework supports scalable healthcare infrastructure, enabling effective patient referrals, personalized recommendations, and enhanced decision-making pathways.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Network-aware Direct Search Method for Influence Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influence Maximization (IM) is a pivotal concept in social network analysis, involving the identification of influential nodes within a network to maximize the number of influenced nodes, and has a wide variety of applications that range from viral marketing and information dissemination to public health campaigns. IM can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem with a black-box objective function, where the goal is to select $B$ seed nodes that maximize the expected influence spread. Direct search methods, which do not require gradient information, are well-suited for such problems. Unlike gradient-based approaches, direct search algorithms, in fact, only evaluate the objective function at a suitably chosen set of trial points around the current solution to guide the search process. However, these methods often suffer from scalability issues due to the high cost of function evaluations, especially when applied to combinatorial problems like IM. This work, therefore, proposes the Network-aware Direct Search (NaDS) method, an innovative direct search approach that integrates the network structure into its neighborhood formulation and is used to tackle a mixed-integer programming formulation of the IM problem, the so-called General Information Propagation model. We tested our method on large-scale networks, comparing it to existing state-of-the-art approaches for the IM problem, including direct search methods and various greedy techniques and heuristics. The results of the experiments empirically confirm the assumptions underlying NaDS, demonstrating that exploiting the graph structure of the IM problem in the algorithmic framework can significantly improve its computational efficiency in the considered context.</description>

      <title>MAD: A Benchmark for Multi-Turn Audio Dialogue Fact-Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the growing popularity of audio platforms, fact-checking spoken content remains significantly underdeveloped. Misinformation in speech often unfolds across multi-turn dialogues, shaped by speaker interactions, disfluencies, overlapping speech, and emotional tone-factors that complicate both claim detection and verification. Existing datasets fall short by focusing on isolated sentences or text transcripts, without modeling the conversational and acoustic complexity of spoken misinformation. We introduce MAD (Multi-turn Audio Dialogues), the first fact-checking dataset aligned with multi-turn spoken dialogues and corresponding audio. MAD captures how misinformation is introduced, contested, and reinforced through natural conversation. Each dialogue includes annotations for speaker turns, dialogue scenarios, information spread styles, sentence-level check-worthiness, and both sentence- and dialogue-level veracity. The dataset supports two core tasks: check-worthy claim detection and claim verification. Benchmarking shows that even strong pretrained models reach only 72-74% accuracy at the sentence level and 71-72% at the dialogue level in claim verification, underscoring MAD's difficulty. MAD offers a high-quality benchmark for advancing multimodal and conversational fact-checking, while also surfacing open challenges related to reasoning over speech and dialogue dynamics.</description>

      <title>Beyond Physicians: Social and Familial Norms Driving Cesarean Section Decisions in Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Women's health in Bangladesh faces risks due to an alarming rise in cesarean section (CS) rates, exceeding 72% in hospital-based deliveries, far surpassing the WHO's recommended limit of 15%. This study, guided by the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), explored socio-cultural factors influencing childbirth mode decisions. Among 503 survey participants, 91% of CS cases occurred against initial preferences, revealing a disconnect between health beliefs and behavior. Subjective norms, particularly family influence and social expectations, emerged as more critical in shaping CS decisions than physician recommendations.</description>

      <title>Insight Rumors: A Novel Textual Rumor Locating and Marking Model Leveraging Att_BiMamba2 Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of social media networks, rumor detection models have attracted more and more attention. Whereas, these models primarily focus on classifying contexts as rumors or not, lacking the capability to locate and mark specific rumor content. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel rumor detection model named Insight Rumors to locate and mark rumor content within textual data. Specifically, we propose the Bidirectional Mamba2 Network with Dot-Product Attention (Att_BiMamba2), a network that constructs a bidirectional Mamba2 model and applies dot-product attention to weight and combine the outputs from both directions, thereby enhancing the representation of high-dimensional rumor features. Simultaneously, a Rumor Locating and Marking module is designed to locate and mark rumors. The module constructs a skip-connection network to project high-dimensional rumor features onto low-dimensional label features. Moreover, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) is employed to impose strong constraints on the output label features, ensuring accurate rumor content location. Additionally, a labeled dataset for rumor locating and marking is constructed, with the effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated through comprehensive experiments. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed scheme not only detects rumors accurately but also locates and marks them in context precisely, outperforming state-of-the-art schemes that can only discriminate rumors roughly.</description>

      <title>Influence Prediction in Collaboration Networks: An Empirical Study on arXiv</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an empirical study of the Social Sphere Model for influence prediction, previously introduced by the authors, combining link prediction with top-k centrality-based selection. We apply the model to the temporal arXiv General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology collaboration network, evaluating its performance under varying edge sampling rates and prediction horizons to reflect different levels of initial data completeness and network evolution. Accuracy is assessed using mean squared error in both link prediction and influence maximization tasks. The results show that the model effectively identifies latent influencers, i.e., nodes that are not initially central but later influential, and performs best with denser initial graphs. Among the similarity measures tested, the newly introduced RA-2 metric consistently yields the lowest prediction errors. These findings support the practical applicability of the model to predict real-world influence in evolving networks.</description>

      <title>Unfolded Laplacian Spectral Embedding: A Theoretically Grounded Approach to Dynamic Network Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic relational structures play a central role in many AI tasks, but their evolving nature presents challenges for consistent and interpretable representation. A common approach is to learn time-varying node embeddings, whose effectiveness depends on satisfying key stability properties. In this paper, we propose Unfolded Laplacian Spectral Embedding, a new method that extends the Unfolded Adjacency Spectral Embedding framework to normalized Laplacians while preserving both cross-sectional and longitudinal stability. We provide formal proof that our method satisfies these stability conditions. In addition, as a bonus of using the Laplacian matrix, we establish a new Cheeger-style inequality that connects the embeddings to the conductance of the underlying dynamic graphs. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the strong performance of our method. These results establish a principled and stable framework for dynamic network representation grounded in spectral graph theory.</description>

      <title>Fast Geometric Embedding for Node Influence Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing classical centrality measures such as betweenness and closeness is computationally expensive on large-scale graphs. In this work, we introduce an efficient force layout algorithm that embeds a graph into a low-dimensional space, where the radial distance from the origin serves as a proxy for various centrality measures. We evaluate our method on multiple graph families and demonstrate strong correlations with degree, PageRank, and paths-based centralities. As an application, it turns out that the proposed embedding allows to find high-influence nodes in a network, and provides a fast and scalable alternative to the standard greedy algorithm.</description>

      <title>Exploring Content and Social Connections of Fake News with Explainable Text and Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global spread of misinformation and concerns about content trustworthiness have driven the development of automated fact-checking systems. Since false information often exploits social media dynamics such as "likes" and user networks to amplify its reach, effective solutions must go beyond content analysis to incorporate these factors. Moreover, simply labelling content as false can be ineffective or even reinforce biases such as automation and confirmation bias. This paper proposes an explainable framework that combines content, social media, and graph-based features to enhance fact-checking. It integrates a misinformation classifier with explainability techniques to deliver complete and interpretable insights supporting classification decisions. Experiments demonstrate that multimodal information improves performance over single modalities, with evaluations conducted on datasets in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Additionally, the framework's explanations were assessed for interpretability, trustworthiness, and robustness with a novel protocol, showing that it effectively generates human-understandable justifications for its predictions.</description>
