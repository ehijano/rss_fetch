      <title>Superconducting phase diagram of multi-layer square-planar nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in square-planar nickelates has offered a rich materials platform to explore the origins of cuprate-like superconductivity. Experimental investigations however have largely been limited to the infinite-layer $R$NiO$_2$ ($R$=rare-earth) nickelates. Here, we construct a phase diagram of multi-layer square-planar Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{2n+2}$ compounds and discover signatures of superconductivity for $n$ = 4 - 8. Upon decreasing the dimensionality $n$, the superconducting anisotropy evolves due to 4$f$ electron effects, and electronic structure characteristics approach cuprate-like behavior. Magnetic fluctuations persist from within the superconducting regime and into the over-doped, non-superconducting regime. Remarkably, the superconducting regime overlaps with that of chemically-doped infinite-layer nickelates, demonstrating underlying commonalities and distinct differences across varying structural realizations of square-planar nickelates. Our work establishes this layered template for creating new nickel-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Nearly twofold overestimation of the superconducting volume fraction in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of the DC diamagnetic state in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates remained an unsolved experimental problem until recent experiments in which Zhu et al.$^1$ measured the DC diamagnetic responses in zero-field cooled (ZFC) mode in pressurized La4Ni3O10. Zhu et al.$^1$ reported that the ratio of the measured ZFC magnetic moment to the Meissner magnetic moment of the sample (and this ratio was termed the superconducting volume fraction$f$) reaches 81-86%. We regard outstanding experimental results$^1$; however, our calculations based on the reported experimental datasets$^1$ using the standard procedure showed the ratio to be 51-59%. Upon our request, Zhu et al.$^1$ provided detailed explanations and the equation they used to calculate$f$. To our knowledge, the procedure$^1$ and equation$^1$ for calculating $f$ have never been mentioned or described before, including in Ref.$^1$. Here we argue that the proposed equation$^1$ and procedure$^1$ are incorrect, and that this equation$^1$ results in multiple overestimations of the superconducting volume fraction in the sample. This overestimation error affects all superconducting volume fractions $f$ in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates reported to date$^{1-4}$. Therefore, we describe the error we discovered in this paper.</description>

      <title>Enhanced $T_\mathrm{c}$ in eutectic high-entropy alloy superconductors Hf-Nb-Sc-Ti-Zr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present investigation into the superconducting properties of eutectic high-entropy alloy (HEA) Hf-Nb-Sc-Ti-Zr systems reveals an enhanced superconducting critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) in body-centered cubic (bcc) phases compared to typical quinary bcc HEAs. In Hf$_{10}$Nb$_{25}$Sc$_{25}$Ti$_{20}$Zr$_{20}$, Hf$_{5}$Nb$_{45}$Sc$_{20}$Ti$_{15}$Zr$_{15}$, and Hf$_{5}$Nb$_{45}$Sc$_{10}$Ti$_{5}$Zr$_{35}$ systems, which span a broad range of valence electron concentration per atom, lattice strain and the presence of partial or absent eutectic phases are characteristic features at lower annealing temperatures. The eutectic regions expand rapidly following annealing at 600$^{\circ}$C in all systems. The $T_\mathrm{c}$ of each system increases markedly with rising annealing temperatures from 400$^{\circ}$C to 600$^{\circ}$C, reaching a maximum value of 9.93 K in the Hf$_{5}$Nb$_{45}$Sc$_{10}$Ti$_{5}$Zr$_{35}$ sample annealed at 800$^{\circ}$C. Nearly all samples can be classified as strong-coupling superconductors. The sample annealed at 500$^{\circ}$C in the Hf$_{5}$Nb$_{45}$Sc$_{10}$Ti$_{5}$Zr$_{35}$ system exhibits a critical current density ($J_\mathrm{c}$) exceeding the practical threshold of 10$^{5}$ A/cm$^{2}$ up to approximately 4 T at 4.2 K and 6 T at 2 K. The elevated $J_\mathrm{c}$ is attributed to significant lattice strain and phase instability. The underlying mechanism for the enhanced $T_\mathrm{c}$ in Hf-Nb-Sc-Ti-Zr systems is examined through specific heat data analysis, suggesting that the expansion of the eutectic regions induced by thermal annealing plays a pivotal role.</description>

      <title>Insight into high-entropy effect in body-centered cubic superconducting alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have characterized the superconducting critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$), the Debye temperature ($\theta_\mathrm{D}$), the electronic specific heat coefficient, and the Vickers microhardness of HfNbTiVZr, NbTiZr, HfNbTi, HfNbZr, and HfNbTa, all possessing a body-centered cubic (bcc) structure. By compiling a comparable dataset for other equiatomic quinary bcc high-entropy alloy (HEA) superconductors, we have examined the validity of the hypothesis regarding the high-entropy effect in bcc HEA superconductors, as proposed in our previous work. This hypothesis attributes the observed negative correlation between the electron-phonon coupling constant ($\lambda_\mathrm{e-p}$) and $\theta_\mathrm{D}$ to a reduced phonon lifetime at higher $\theta_\mathrm{D}$, arising from the uncertainty principle in highly disordered quinary alloys. However, a pronounced change in this negative correlation is not evident in equiatomic ternary alloys with a lower degree of atomic disorder, thereby providing limited support for the hypothesis. Alternatively, by assembling the full dataset of bcc alloys spanning binary through senary systems, we have identified a universal negative correlation between $\lambda_\mathrm{e-p}$ and $\theta_{D}$. This result would be useful for the materials design of bcc superconducting alloys. We further propose that the Vickers microhardness offers an alternative means to evaluate $\theta_{D}$ and may serve as a rapid screening metric for identifying bcc alloys with desired properties.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Superconducting Proximity Effect in S-S'-S Transition Edge Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximity effects at superconducting interfaces, between different superconductors (S-S') or between superconductors and normal metals (S-N), are fundamental to the performance of superconducting electronics, yet only few experiments have directly probed the spatial structure of proximity effects within a device. This is particularly relevant for transition edge sensors (TESs), where the interplay of direct and inverse proximity effects governs detector sensitivity. Here, we use scanning superconducting interference device (SQUID) susceptometry to directly image the local diamagnetic response in functional S-S'-S TES structures. We resolve long range proximity coupling extending over tens of micrometers, revealing that the local transition temperature is dramatically tuned by neighboring regions, being either enhanced by superconducting (S) leads or suppressed by normal metal (N) contacts. Our observations are quantitatively supported by Ginzburg Landau modeling of the device geometry and calculations of the temperature dependent diamagnetism based on self-consistent Usadel equations. By providing spatially resolved measurements of the interplay of proximity effects in TES devices, this work establishes a framework for understanding and controlling superconducting states in heterogeneous superconducting structures.</description>

      <title>Bridging atomic and mesoscopic length scales with Replica Scanning Tunneling Microscopy: Visualizing the intra-unit cell pair density modulation of superconducting FeSe at micron length scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is a cornerstone technique for visualizing the electronic density of states with atomic resolution (typically below 0.1 nm). While the field of view of most STM setups extends up to a few microns, obtaining atomic resolution over these large areas is often impractical and excessively time-consuming. This is due to the need to acquire maps with a point number reaching 107 or more with a full current or conductance vs voltage curve at each point. The standard procedure is to make large scale maps and then select small regions to zoom-in for high-resolution atomic scale analysis. However, this approach fails to address a question which is often critical: Does a specific atomic-scale modulation of the electronic density of states persist over much larger, mesoscopic length scales? Here we present a new method: Replica STM (R-STM), that overcomes this limitation, allowing the study of atomic-scale phenomena up to micron length scales. We obtained new large-area STM tunneling conductance maps in UTe2 and FeSe, spanning areas over 200 nm in size. In these large scale maps we discovered signals with wavelengths significantly exceeding interatomic distances. We show that these large-wavelength signals are replicas of the underlying atomic-scale density of states modulations. R-STM leverages these replica signals to efficiently track atomic-scale features over large areas. Using this novel technique, we show that the pair density modulation discovered recently in FeSe persists with the same characteristic wavelength up to hundreds of nm length scales. R-STM provides a powerful and practical new capability for STM to compare atomic scale with micrometer scale phenomena. The proof of principle of R-STM can be extended to any other scanning probe microscopy experiment where a periodic signal is traced as a function of position.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic fully-gapped superconductivity in quasi-one-dimensional Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity in quasi-one-dimensional Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$ emerges from an exotic, non-metallic normal state that exhibits signatures of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior, emergent symmetry and excitonic order. The high upper critical field, $H_{c2}$, in Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$ suggests that that the favored pairing state is spin-triplet in nature. Here, we report measurements of the magnetic penetration depth down to $0.08\,\mathrm{K}$ ($T/T_c \lesssim 0.04$) and the specific heat down to $0.4\,\mathrm{K}$ ($T/T_c \lesssim 0.2$), and show that they are consistent with a moderately-coupled, fully-gapped superconducting state with marked gap anisotropy and a minimum ($\Delta_{\rm min} \simeq 0.4\,k_{\mathrm{B}}T_c$) occurring over a very narrow region in $k$-space. Combined with knowledge of $H_{c2}$, these measurements support the presence of a nodeless and possibly odd-parity spin-triplet superconducting order parameter in Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$.</description>

      <title>Machine learning protocol to identify pairing symmetries via quasiparticle interference imaging in Ising superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the pairing symmetry in unconventional superconductors is essential for reliably characterizing their superconducting states and for enabling their integration into realistic quantum devices. Here, we introduce a machine-learning-guided strategy to determine pairing symmetry from quasiparticle interference (QPI) data, which integrates first-principles calculations, tight-binding modeling, and symmetry-based classification of the superconducting pairing function. We demonstrate the approach on monolayer NbSe2 as an experimentally accessible probe of superconductivity in real materials, within a single scalar-impurity Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework. Our analysis shows that the QPI-to-parameter inverse problem can be solved with high accuracy for most superconducting pairing channels in this setting, indicating that QPI carries rich, learnable information about the superconducting gap structure. Taken together, these results demonstrate that machine-learning-assisted QPI analysis provides a promising pathway for precise learning of superconducting pairing functions in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Periodic drive induced unconventional superconductivity in a half-filled system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-equilibrium control of electronic properties has emerged as a transformative paradigm for engineering novel quantum phases. The most intriguing example of such a phase is light-induced superconductivity (SC) in non-superconducting materials. However, realizing unconventional SC at commensurate half-filling remains a formidable challenge even in non-equilibrium, as the regime is typically dominated by the robust stability of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulating (MI) state. Here, we provide a novel non-equilibrium route to realize unconventional d-wave SC in a half-filled system through Floquet engineering. We analyze the periodically driven Fermi-Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice and demonstrate that a high-frequency drive can transform a weakly interacting insulator into a regime of strong correlations by the drive-induced renormalization of nearest-neighbor hopping. Furthermore, the drive induces staggered higher range hoppings that can frustrate the AFM order while simultaneously generate staggered potential that lifts the kinetic constraints inherent to the half-filled system, fostering the charge dynamics required to stabilize d-wave pairing against the competing AFM state. The resulting SC phase is protected by high-frequency prethermalization, maintaining stability over timescales exponentially large in the drive frequency. This protocol circumvents the need for chemical doping, offering a 'disorder-free' alternative for realizing unconventional pairing with direct applications in optimizing the performance of superconducting quantum computers, qubit arrays and other upcoming quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors offer an excellent platform for the study of vortex matter due to their low superfluid stiffness and inability to effectively screen applied magnetic fields. Here we explore vortices in a two-dimensional superconductor formed at the surface of the complex oxide KTaO$_3$. Multiple regimes of vortex-mediated transport are identified and studied, revealing switching behaviour attributed to nucleation of individual vortices. Analysis of this regime allows us to identify the quantum tunneling of vortices, which transitions to thermally activated behaviour at elevated temperatures. Magnetic field dependence reveals rich histograms of the switching currents which we attribute to different configurations of pinned vortices.</description>

      <title>Possible Liquid-Nitrogen-Temperature Superconductivity Driven by Perpendicular Electric Field in the Single-Bilayer Film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13554v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) is found in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ ultrathin film with critical temperature $T_c$ above the McMillan limit at ambient pressure (AP). It is eager to enhance $T_c$ of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. We propose that a perpendicular electric field strongly enhances $T_c$ in the single-bilayer film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. Under electric field, the layer with lower potential energy will accept electrons flowing from the other layer to fill in the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as the nearly half-filled Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital cannot accommodate more electrons. With the enhancement of the filling fraction in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, the interlayer $s$-wave pairing is suppressed, but the intralayer $d$-wave pairing in this layer is strongly enhanced. We numerically verify this idea and yield that an imposed voltage of about $0.1\sim0.2$ volt between layers is enough to realize liquid-nitrogen-temperature HTSC in this single bilayer at AP. Our results appeal for experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Pairing mechanism and superconductivity in pressurized La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$</title>

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity (SC) with critical temperature $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has sparked a surge of exploration of high-$T_c$ superconductors in the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase nickelates. More recently, the RP phase nicklate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$, which hosts layered structure with alternating bilayer and single-layer NiO$_2$ planes, is reported to accommodate SC under pressure, exhibiting a dome-shaped pressure dependence with highest $T_c\approx 64$ K, capturing a lot of interests. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) and random phase approximation (RPA) calculations, we systematically study the electronic properties and superconducting mechanism of this material. Our DFT calculations yield a band structure including two nearly decoupled sets of sub-band structures, with one set originating from the bilayer subsystem and the other from the single-layer one. RPA-based analysis demonstrates that SC in this material occurs primarily within the bilayer subsystem exhibiting an $s^\pm$ wave pairing symmetry similar to that observed in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, while the single-layer subsystem mainly serves as a bridge facilitating the inter-bilayer phase coherence through the interlayer Josephson coupling (IJC). Since the IJC thus attained is extremely weak, it experiences a prominent enhancement under pressure, leading to the increase of the bulk $T_c$ with pressure initially. When the pressure is high enough, the $T_c$ gradually decreases due to the reduced density of states on the $\gamma$-pocket. In this way, the dome-shaped pressure dependence of $T_c$ observed experimentally is naturally understood.</description>

      <title>Finite-momentum mixed singlet-triplet pairing in chiral antiferromagnets induced by even-parity spin texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-relativistic spin-splitting in unconventional antiferromagnets has garnered much attention for its promising spintronic applications and open fundamental questions. Here, we uncover a unique even-parity spin texture in chiral non-collinear antiferromagnets, exemplified using a kagome lattice. We consider two distinct types of electrons in the system: one with Schr\"odinger-like dispersion and the other exhibiting Dirac-like behavior. Remarkably, we show that, for both electron types, this spin texture induces an exotic coexistence of opposite-spin singlet and equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs with finite momentum when proximity-coupled to conventional superconductors. The triplet pairing arises from the intrinsic spin rotation of the antiferromagnet and does not require net magnetization or spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, we identify an unprecedented and tunable phase difference between singlet and triplet pairings, controllable through junction orientation. This mixed pairing state can be experimentally probed via damped oscillations in order parameters and 0-$\pi$ transitions in Josephson junctions. Additionally, we analyze the effect of out-of-plane spin canting, elucidating its role in generating spin-polarized supercurrents, and discuss Mn$_3$Ga and Mn$_3$Ge to test our predictions.</description>

      <title>Robust two-dimensional surface superconductivity and vortex lattice in the Weyl semimetal $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The layered compound $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$ is a topological semimetal with Fermi arcs at the surface joining bulk Weyl points. Recent work has found signatures of surface superconductivity consisting of gap openings compatible with a critical temperature orders of magnitude larger than the bulk value. However, no superconducting vortices have been identified, raising questions about the robustness of the phase coherence. Here we use very low temperature Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and find robust superconductivity with T$_C=$2.9 K and H$_{C2}\approx$1.8 T linked to the Fermi arcs. We observe quantized superconducting vortices, demonstrating two-dimensional macroscopic quantum phase coherence.</description>

      <title>Green's Function Methods for Computing Supercurrents in Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interest in Josephson junctions (JJs) has increased rapidly in recent years not only because of their use in qubits and other quantum devices but also due to the unique physics supported by the JJs. The advent of various novel quantum materials for both the barrier region and the superconducting leads has led to the possibility of adding new functionalities to the JJs. Thus, there is a growing need for accurate modeling of the JJs and related systems to enable their predictive control and atomistic level understanding. This review presents an in-depth discussion of a Green's function-based formalism for computing supercurrents in JJs. The formulation is tailored for large-scale atomistic simulations and encompasses both dc and ac supercurrents. We hope that this review will provide a timely and comprehensive reference for researchers as well as beginning practitioners interested in Green's-function-based methods to model supercurrents in JJs.</description>

      <title>Field-Induced SIT in Disordered 2D Electron systems: The case of amorphous Indium-Oxide thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenon of field-induced superconductor to insulator transition (SIT) in disordered 2D electron systems has been a subject of controversy since its discovery in the early 1990s. Here we present a phenomenological quantitative theory of this phenomenon which is not based exclusively on the boson-vortex duality used commonly in the field. Within a new low-temperature framework of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) functional approach to superconducting fluctuations we propose and develop a scenario in which bosons of Cooper-pair fluctuations (CPFs) condense and localize in real-space mesoscopic puddles under increasing magnetic field due to diminishing stiffness of the fluctuation modes at low temperatures in a broad range of momentum space. Quantum tunneled CPFs relieving the condensed mesoscopic puddles, which consequently pair break into fermionic quasi-particle excitations, dominate the thermally activated inter-puddles transport. The spatially shrinking puddles of CPFs, embedded in expanding normal-state regions, upon further increasing field, suppress the quasi-particle excitation gap and so lead to high-field negative magneto-resistance (MR). Application to amorphous Indium-Oxide thin films shows good quantitative agreement with experimental sheet resistance data. In particular, in agreement with the experiment at low temperatures (i.e. well below the quantum tunneling pair breaking "temperature"), the sheet resistance isotherms are predicted to show a single crossing point at a quantum critical field not far below the MR peak.</description>

      <title>Fast and Slow Sound Excitations in Nematic Aerogel in superfluid 3He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nematic aerogel (nAG) supports so-called polar phase in liquid 3He. The experiments by [Dmitriev et al, JETP Lett. 112, 780 (2020)] showed that the onset of polar phase inside the nAG is accompanied by emergence of a sound wave with frequency quickly growing with cooling down from transition temperature and reaching a plateau. To describe this behavior, we start by calculating the elastic properties of the dry nematic AG that appear to depend only on Young's modulus of the parent material (e.g. mullite), the volume fraction of the solid phase and the aspect ratio of the representative volume of nAG. The elastic constants are then used to solve elasto-hydrodynamic equations for various sound vibrations of nAG filled with 3He. The (isotropic) first sound and anisotropic second sound in the polar phase are strongly hybridized with fourth sound and standard elastic modes in nAG. The hybrid second and the transverse fourth sound start with zero velocity at the transition, similar to pure 3He, and quickly grow with lowering temperature until they hit the sample finite size cutoff.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces based on Ginzburg-Landau theory under Weyl gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometry design is a crucial and challenging strategy for improving the performance of type-II superconductors. Topology optimization is one of the most powerful approaches used to determine structural geometries. Therefore, a topology optimization approach is presented to inversely design structural geometries of both low- and high-temperature type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces. In the presented approach, the magnetic response of type-II superconductors is modeled using the Ginzburg-Landau theory, where the temporal evolution of the order parameter and vector potential is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations under the Weyl gauge.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the adiabatic limit in ballistic multiterminal Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on multiterminal Josephson junctions (MJJs) that probe different ranges of the size and bias voltage parameters, we explore the regime of increasing bias voltage in large-scale devices, where the electrochemical potential becomes comparable to the 1D energy level spacing. We find that the relative number of quantum-correlated pairs formed by colliding Floquet--Kulik quartet levels is equal to the inverse of the number of channels. This observation motivates a model for the intermediate regime in which the ballistic central two-dimensional normal metal is treated as a continuum under the adiabatic approximation, while Andreev modes propagate in a background of voltage- and flux-tunable nonequilibrium electronic populations. The model predicts characteristic voltage scales that govern the mesoscopic oscillations of the critical current, and these scales are at the crossroads of interpreting experiments in all sectors of the MJJs: quartets, topology, and Floquet theory. Our model is specifically inspired by the recent Harvard and Penn State group experiments.</description>
