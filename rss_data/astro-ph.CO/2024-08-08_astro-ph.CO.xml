      <title>Parity-breaking galaxy 4-point function from lensing by chiral gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent searches for parity breaking in the galaxy four-point correlation function, as well as the prospects for greatly improved sensitivity to parity breaking in forthcoming surveys, motivate the search for physical mechanisms that could produce such a signal. Here we show that a parity-violating galaxy four-point correlation function may be induced by lensing by a chiral gravitational-wave background. We estimate the amplitude of a signal that would be detectable with a current galaxy survey, taking into account constraints to the primordial gravitational-wave-background amplitude. We find that this mechanism is unlikely to produce a signal large enough to be seen with a galaxy survey but note that it may come within reach with future 21cm observations.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Early and Late Time Tensions with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of accommodating both early and late-time tensions using a novel reinforcement learning technique. By applying this technique, we aim to optimize the evolution of the Hubble parameter from recombination to the present epoch, addressing both tensions simultaneously. To maximize the goodness of fit, our learning technique achieves a fit that surpasses even the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our results demonstrate a tendency to weaken both early and late time tensions in a completely model-independent manner.</description>

      <title>Expanding covariant cosmography of the local Universe: incorporating the snap and axial symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies show that the model-independent, fully non-perturbative covariant cosmographic approach is suitable for analyzing the local Universe $(z\lesssim 0.1)$. However, accurately characterizing large and inhomogeneous mass distributions requires the fourth-order term in the redshift expansion of the covariant luminosity distance $d_L(z,\boldsymbol{n})$. We calculate the covariant snap parameter $\mathbb{S}$ and its spherical harmonic multipole moments using the matter expansion tensor and the evolution equations for lightray bundles. The fourth-order term adds 36 degrees of freedom, since the highest independent multipole of the snap is the 32-pole (dotriacontapole) $(\ell=5)$. Including this term helps to de-bias estimations of the covariant deceleration parameter. Given that observations suggest axially symmetric anisotropies in the Hubble diagram for $z \lesssim 0.1$ and theory shows that only a subset of multipoles contributes to the signal, we demonstrate that only 12 degrees of freedom are needed for a model-independent description of the local universe. We use an analytical axisymmetric model of the local Universe, with data that matches the Zwicky Transient Facility survey, in order to provide a numerical example of the amplitude of the snap multipoles and to forecast precision.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Hubble tension with a late time Modified Gravity scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a modified cosmological model aimed at addressing the Hubble tension, considering revised dynamics in the late Universe. The model introduces a parameter $c$ affecting the evolution equations, motivated by a modified Poisson algebra inspired by effective Loop Quantum Cosmology. Our analysis includes diverse background datasets such as Cosmic Chronometers, Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernovae (with and without the SH0ES calibration), SDSS, DESY6 and DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and background information of the Cosmic Microwave Background. We find that the model alleviates the Hubble tension in most of the dataset combinations, with cases reducing discrepancies to below $1\sigma$ when including SH0ES. However, the model exhibits minimal improvement in the overall fit when compared to $\Lambda$CDM, and Bayesian evidence generally favors the standard model. Theoretical foundations support this approach as a subtle adjustment to low-redshift dynamics, suggesting potential for further exploration into extensions of $\Lambda$CDM. Despite challenges in data fitting, our findings underscore the promise of small-scale modifications in reconciling cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Consistency tests between SDSS and DESI BAO measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from redshift surveys, like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), are consistent with each other. We do so by obtaining the Hubble and deceleration parameter, respectively $H(z)$ and $q(z)$, from both datasets using a non-parametric reconstruction, so that our results do not depend on any {\it a priori} assumptions about the underlying cosmological model. We find that the reconstructed $H(z)$ and $q(z)$ from SDSS are significantly inconsistent with those obtained from DESI, and that both are only marginally consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model ($\sim 3\sigma$ confidence level). Interestingly, the combined SDSS and DESI dataset reconciles with the standard model. These results are mostly unchanged with respect to different assumptions on the sound horizon scale value, as well as different reconstruction kernels. We also verify the results for the null diagnostic $\mathcal{O}_{\rm m}(z)$, finding that SDSS favours a quintessence-like dark energy model, whereas a phantom-like dark energy is preferred by DESI data, and once again the combined dataset strongly agrees with $\Lambda$CDM. Therefore, our results call the attention for further examination of such inconsistency, as they can lead to biased and divergent results regarding the validity of the standard model, or the suggestion of new physics.</description>

      <title>Multidimensionality of the Hubble tension: the roles of $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is inherently multidimensional, and bears important implications for parameters beyond $H_0$. We discuss the key role of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and the physical cold dark matter density $\omega_c$. We argue that once $\Omega_m$ and the physical baryon density $\omega_b$ are calibrated, through Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and/or Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) for $\Omega_m$, and via Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for $\omega_b$, any model raising $H_0$ inevitably raises $\omega_c$ and, under minimal assumptions, the clustering parameter $S_8$. We explicitly verify that this behaviour holds when analyzing recent BAO and SNeIa data. We argue that a calibration of $\Omega_m$ which is as reliable and model-independent as possible should be a priority in the Hubble tension discussion, and an interesting possibility in this sense could be represented by galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements.</description>

      <title>Spectra of fermions produced by a time-dependent axion in the radiation- and matter-dominated Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like degrees of freedom generally interact with fermions through a shift symmetric coupling. As a consequence, a time-dependent axion will lead to the generation of fermions by amplifying their vacuum fluctuations. We provide the formulae that allow one to determine the spectra of produced fermions in a generic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker Universe with flat spatial slices. Then we derive simple approximate formulae for the spectra of the produced fermions, as a function of the model parameters, in the specific cases of a radiation- and a matter-dominated Universe, in the regime in which the backreaction of the produced fermions on the axionic background can be neglected.</description>

      <title>$\gamma$-Cascade V4: A Semi-Analytical Code for Modeling Cosmological Gamma-Ray Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the universe is not transparent to gamma rays with energies above around one hundred GeV, it is necessary to account for the interaction of high-energy photons with intergalactic radiation fields in order to model gamma-ray propagation. Here, we present a public numerical software for the modeling of gamma-ray observables. This code computes the effects on gamma-ray spectra from the development of electromagnetic cascades and cosmological redshifting. The code introduced here is based on the original $\gamma$-Cascade, and builds on it by improving its performance at high redshifts, introducing new propagation modules, and adding many more extragalactic radiation field models, which enables the ability to estimate the uncertainties inherent to EBL modeling. We compare the results of this new code to existing electromagnetic transport models.</description>

      <title>A model independent approach to the study of structure growth in $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, much attention has been given to the study of modified gravity theories to find a more natural explanation for the late-time acceleration of the Universe. Particular attention has focused on the so-called $f(R)$ dark energy models. Instead of focusing on a particular f(R) model, we present a completely model-independent approach to study the background dynamics and the growth of matter density perturbations for those f(R) models that mimic the $\Lambda$CDM evolution at the background level. We do this by characterising the dynamics of the gravitational field using a set of dimensionless variables and using cosmography to determine the expansion history. We then illustrate the integrity of this method by fixing the cosmography to be the same as an exact $\Lambda$CDM model, allowing us to test the solution. We compare the exact evolution of the density contrast and growth index with what one obtains from various levels of the quasi-static approximation, without choosing the form of $f(R)$ dark energy.</description>

      <title>Secondary Gravitational Waves in Non-local Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how infinite derivative modifications of gravity impact on the stochastic background of Gravitational Waves from early Universe. The generic property of the ghost-free theory fixed on Minkowski space-time is the emergence of an infinite number of complex mass states when other classical backgrounds are considered. These additional states are shown to enhance the power spectrum of scalar perturbations generated during inflation. Current and future space-based and terrestrial interferometers offer indirect testing methods for the infinite derivative gravity action, enabling the exploration of new parameter spaces. In particular, we identify unconventional blue-tilted Gravitational Wave spectra, presenting a novel approach for testing infinite derivative quantum gravity in the future.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Interactions of the Cosmic Neutrino Background, Axions, Dark Matter, and Reactor Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we do three things. First, we outline the conditions under which the interaction rate of inelastic processes that change the internal state of a system of $N$ targets scales as $N^2$. This is an effect distinct from coherent elastic scattering, but with the same scaling. Second, we compute example rates for such processes for various weakly interacting particles. Finally, we point to potential quantum observables for these processes that go beyond traditional energy exchange.
  Maximal coherence in inelastic processes is achieved when the targets are placed in an equal superposition of the ground and excited states. These coherent inelastic processes are analogous to Dicke superradiance, and we thus refer to them as superradiant interactions.
  We compute the superradiant interaction rates for the C$\nu$B, dark matter scattering and absorption, and late-universe particles, such as reactor neutrinos, when the two-level system is realized by nuclear or electron spins in a magnetic field. The rates we find can be quite sizable on macroscopic yet small targets. For example, the C$\nu$B interacts with a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\text{Hz})$ when scattering off a 10~cm liquid or solid-state density spin-polarized sphere. For QCD axion dark matter, similar rates can be achieved with much smaller samples, $N \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{15})\left(\frac{m}{2\times 10^{-8}~\text{eV}}\right)^{-1/2}$, where $m$ is the axion mass.
  Using the Lindblad formalism for open quantum systems, we show that these superradiant interactions can manifest as a source of noise on the system. This points to new observables, sensitive to the sum of the excitation and de-excitation rates, and can be viewed as introducing diffusion and decoherence to the system. The effects presented in this paper may point to a new class of ultra-low threshold detectors.</description>

      <title>Structure functions with higher-order stencils as a probe to separate small- and large-scale magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are an energetically important component of star-formation galaxies, but it is often difficult to measure their properties from observations. One of the complexities stems from the fact that the magnetic fields, especially in spiral galaxies, have a two-scale nature: a large-scale field, coherent over ${\rm kpc}$ scales and a small-scale, random field with a scale of $\lesssim$ $100~{\rm pc}$. Moreover, it is known that the strength of small- and large-scale fields are comparable and this makes it even harder to find their imprints in radio polarisation observations such as the Faraday rotation measure, ${\rm RM}$, which is the integral over the path length of the product of the thermal electron density and the parallel component of the magnetic field to the line of sight. Here, we propose and demonstrate the use of second-order structure functions of ${\rm RM}$ computed with multiple higher-order stencils as a powerful analysis to separate the small- and large-scale magnetic field components. In particular, we provide new methods and calibrations to compute the scale and the strength of the large-scale magnetic field in the presence of small-scale magnetic fluctuations. We then apply the method to find the scale of large-scale magnetic fields in the nearby galaxies M51 and NGC 6946, using archival data and further discuss the need for computing the ${\rm RM}$ structure functions with higher-order stencils. With multiple modern radio polarisation observatories and eventually the Square Kilometre Array, ${\rm RM}$ observations will significantly improve in quantity and quality, and the higher-order stencil structure function techniques developed here can be used to extract information about multiscale magnetic fields in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Why artificial disruption is not a concern for current cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that cold dark matter subhalos are hard to disrupt and almost all cases of subhalo disruption observed in numerical simulations are due to numerical effects. However, these findings primarily relied on idealized numerical experiments, which do not fully capture the realistic conditions of subhalo evolution within a hierarchical cosmological context. Based on the Aquarius simulations, we identify clear segregation in the population of surviving and disrupted subhalos, which corresponds to two distinct acquisition channels of subhalos. We find that all of the first-order subhalos accreted after redshift 2 survive to the present time without suffering from artificial disruption. On the other hand, most of the disrupted subhalos are sub-subhalos accreted at high redshift. Unlike the first-order subhalos, sub-subhalos experience pre-processing and many of them are accreted through major mergers at high redshift, resulting in very high mass loss rates. We confirm these high mass loss rates are physical through both numerical experiments and semi-analytical modeling, thus supporting a physical origin for their rapid disappearance in the simulation. Even though we cannot verify whether these subhalos have fully disrupted or not, their extreme mass loss rates dictate that they can at most contribute a negligible fraction to the very low mass end of the subhalo mass function. We thus conclude that current state-of-the-art cosmological simulations have reliably resolved the subhalo population.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the work of H. Ellis, we study warp drives in the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that as long as the warp drive crosses the black hole horizon at a subluminal speed, the horizon would be effectively absent inside the warp bubble. Moreover, we discover that the black hole's gravitational field can alleviate the violations of the weak energy condition (WEC) and the null energy condition (NEC) and therefore decrease the amount of negative energy required to sustain a warp drive, which may be instrumental for creating microscopic warp drives in lab experiments. We also consider the thermodynamics of a warp bubble interacting with a black hole and point out some paradoxes that may indicate a gap in our understanding of them from the thermodynamic point of view.</description>

      <title>Resonant conversion of axion dark radiation into terahertz electromagnetic radiation in a neutron star magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the strong magnetic field of a neutron star's magnetosphere, axions coupled to electromagnetism develop a nonzero probability to convert into photons. Past studies have revealed that the axion-photon conversion can be resonantly enhanced. We recognize that the axion-photon resonance admits two parametrically distinct resonant solutions, which we call the mass-matched resonance and the Euler-Heisenberg assisted resonance. The mass-matched resonance occurs at a point in the magnetosphere where the radially-varying plasma frequency crosses the axion mass $\omega_\mathrm{pl} \approx m_a$. The Euler-Heisenberg assisted resonance occurs where the axion energy satisfies $\omega \approx (2 \omega_\mathrm{pl}^2 / 7 g_{\gamma\gamma\gamma\gamma} \bar{B}^2 )^{1/2}$. This second resonance is made possible though the strong background magnetic field $\bar{B}$ as well as the nonzero Euler-Heisenberg four-photon self interaction, which has the coupling $g_{\gamma\gamma\gamma\gamma} = 8 \alpha^2 / 45 m_e^4$. We study the resonant conversion of relativistic axion dark radiation into photons via the Euler-Heisenberg assisted resonance, and we calculate the expected electromagnetic radiation assuming different values for the axion-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ and different amplitudes for the axion flux onto the neutron star $\Phi_a$. We briefly discuss several possible sources of axion dark radiation. Achieving a sufficiently strong axion flux to induce a detectable electromagnetic signal seems unlikely.</description>

      <title>Probing the morphology of polarized emission induced by fluctuation dynamo using Minkowski functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The morphology and the characteristic scale of polarized structures provide crucial insights into the mechanisms that drives turbulence and maintains magnetic fields in magneto-ionic plasma. We aim to establish the efficacy of Minkowski functionals as quantitative statistical probes of filamentary morphology of polarized synchrotron emission resulting from fluctuation dynamo action. Using synthetic observations generated from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of fluctuation dynamos with varying driving scales ($\ell_{\rm f}$) of turbulence in isothermal, incompressible, and subsonic media, we study the relation between different morphological measures, and their connection to fractional polarization ($p_{\rm f}$). We find that Faraday depolarization at low frequencies give rise to small-scale polarized structures that have higher filamentarity as compared to the intrinsic structures that are comparable to $\ell_{\rm f}$. Above $\sim3\,{\rm GHz}$, the number of connected polarized structures per unit area ($N_{\rm CC, peak}$) is related to the mean $p_{\rm f}$ ($\langle p_{\rm f} \rangle$) of the emitting region as $\langle p_{\rm f} \rangle \propto N_{\rm CC, peak}^{-1/4}$, provided the scale of the detectable emitting region is larger than $\ell_{\rm f}$. This implies that $N_{\rm CC,peak}$ represents the number of turbulent cells projected on the plane of the sky and can be directly used to infer $\ell_{\rm f}$ via the relation $\ell_{\rm f} \propto N_{\rm CC,peak}^{-1/2}$. An estimate on $\ell_{\rm f}$ thus directly allows for pinning down the turbulence driving mechanism in astrophysical systems. While the simulated conditions are mostly prevalent in the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters, the qualitative morphological features are also applicable in the context of interstellar medium in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Axion production via trapped misalignment from Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry does not need to be exact, and even a tiny source of PQ breaking not aligned with the QCD anomaly might have significant phenomenological implications. In this study, we examine the effects of a general class of PQ-breaking operators on the axion cosmological production via misalignment, focussing on both temperature-dependent and independent PQ-breaking potentials. In particular, we show that a variant of the trapped misalignment mechanism can delay the onset of axion oscillation, leading to an axion dark matter window with $m_a \gg 10^{-5}$ eV. This scenario is testable through various experimental approaches, including standard axion haloscopes and helioscopes, as well as searches for electric dipole moments and axion-mediated forces.</description>

      <title>A quantitative comparison between velocity dependent SIDM cross sections constrained by the gravothermal and isothermal models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One necessary step for probing the nature of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) particles with astrophysical observations is to pin down any possible velocity dependence in the SIDM cross section. Major challenges for achieving this goal include eliminating, or mitigating, the impact of the baryonic components and tidal effects within the dark matter halos of interest -- the effects of these processes can be highly degenerate with those of dark matter self-interactions at small scales. In this work we select 9 isolated galaxies and brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with baryonic components small enough such that the baryonic gravitational potentials do not significantly influence the halo gravothermal evolution processes. We then constrain the parameters of Rutherford and Moller scattering cross section models with the measured rotation curves and stellar kinematics through the gravothermal fluid formalism and isothermal method. Cross sections constrained by the two methods are consistent at $1\sigma$ confidence level, but the isothermal method prefers cross sections greater than the gravothermal approach constraints by a factor of $\sim3$.</description>

      <title>Turbocharging constraints on dark matter substructure through a synthesis of strong lensing flux ratios and extended lensed arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03253v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing provides a purely gravitational means to infer properties of dark matter halos and thereby constrain the particle nature of dark matter. Strong lenses sometimes appear as four lensed images of a background quasar accompanied by spatially-resolved emission from the quasar host galaxy encircling the main deflector (lensed arcs). We present methodology to simultaneously reconstruct lensed arcs and relative image magnifications (flux ratios) in the presence of full populations of subhalos and line-of-sight halos. To this end, we develop a new approach for multi-plane ray tracing that accelerates lens mass and source light reconstruction by factors of $\sim 100-1000$. Using simulated data, we show that simultaneous reconstruction of lensed arcs and flux ratios isolates small-scale perturbations to flux ratios by dark matter substructure from uncertainties associated with the main deflector mass profile on larger angular scales. Relative to analyses that use only image positions and flux ratios to constrain the lens model, incorporating arcs strengthens likelihood ratios penalizing warm dark matter (WDM) with a suppression scale $m_{\rm{hm}} / M_{\odot}$ in the range $\left[10^7 - 10^{7.5}\right]$, $\left[10^{7.5} - 10^{8}\right]$, $\left[10^8 - 10^{8.5}\right]$, $\left[10^{8.5} - 10^{9}\right]$ by factors of $1.3$, $2.5$, $5.6$, and $13.1$, respectively, for a cold dark matter (CDM) ground truth. The $95\%$ exclusion limit improves by 0.5 dex in $\log_{10} m_{\rm{hm}}$. The enhanced sensitivity to low-mass halos enabled by these methods pushes the observational frontier of substructure lensing to the threshold of galaxy formation, enabling stringent tests of any theory that alters the properties of dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependent local primordial non-Gaussianity as a solution to the $S_8$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the last decade, several probes have pointed to a cosmological tension between the amplitude of density fluctuations extrapolated from the cosmic microwave background within the standard cosmological model and the one encapsulated by the $S_8$ parameter from large scale structure. The origin of this $S_8$ tension has not yet been elucidated and may hint at systematics in the data, unaccounted effects from baryonic physics, or new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology. Baryonic physics may in principle provide a nonlinear solution to the tension by suppressing the matter power spectrum more strongly on nonlinear scales than is traditionally assumed. Such a solution would not worsen the Hubble tension, contrary to many other proposed solutions to the $S_8$ tension. However, no realistic baryonic feedback in hydrodynamical simulations provides the needed suppression as a function of redshift. Here, we point out that a scale-dependence of local-type primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG), with significant PNG at scales of a few Mpc, can provide the needed suppression, since such PNG can suppress the power spectrum at slightly larger scales than baryons do. We demonstrate this by devising collisionless numerical simulations of structure formation in boxes of 0.5 Gpc/$h$ with scale-dependent local-type PNG. Our simple models show that, as a proof of principle, scale-dependent PNG, with a Gaussian random field for primordial density fluctuations on large scales and $f_{\rm NL} \simeq -300$ at $\lesssim 10$ Mpc scales, together with state-of-the-art baryonification of the matter power spectrum, can in principle solve the $S_8$ tension. The $S_8$ tension would then be a smoking-gun of non-trivial inflationary physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations of nearby black hole low-mass X-ray binaries have suggested possible evidence of dark matter density spikes. It has long been established that cold dark matter should form dense spikes around intermediate-mass and supermassive black holes due to adiabatic compression of the surrounding dark matter halo. Lighter black holes formed from stellar collapse, however, are not expected to develop such spikes, and so it is unclear how the stellar-mass black holes in these binaries could have acquired such features. Given that primordial black holes are expected to form ultra-dense dark matter mini-spikes, in this Letter we explore the possibility of a primordial origin for these stellar-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>The shape of dark matter halos: a new fundamental cosmological invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on the complex relationship between the shape of dark matter halos and the cosmological models underlying their formation. We used three realistic cosmological models from the Dark Energy Universe Simulation suite. They have significantly distinct cosmological parameters ($\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and $w$) but quasi-indistinguishable cosmic matter fields beyond the scale of DM halos. Firstly, we developed a robust method to measure the FoF halos shape, while avoiding numerical artifacts on shape measurements. These artifacts are generally induced by the presence of substructures (resolution-dependent) or by any spherical a priori in contradiction with the halos triaxiality. We obtain a marked dependence of the halos shape, both on their mass and on the cosmological model. However, when re-expressing the halos shape parameters in terms of the non-linear fluctuations of the cosmic matter field, the cosmological dependence disappears. This new fundamental cosmological invariance is a direct consequence of the matter field non-linear dynamics: as the universe evolves, the non-linear fluctuations of the cosmic field increase, driving the halos towards sphericity. The deviation from sphericity, measured by the prolaticity, triaxiality, and ellipticity of the dark matter halos, is therefore entirely encapsulated in the non-linear power spectrum. From this fundamental invariant relation, we can reconstruct with remarkable accuracy the non-linear variance of the cosmic matter field and, consequently, the non-linear power spectrum. We also re-find the $\sigma_8$ amplitude of the cosmological model. Our results highlight, not only the nuanced relationship between dark matter halo formation and the underlying cosmology, but also the potential of dark matter halo shape analysis as a powerful tool for probing the non-linear dynamics of the cosmic matter field.</description>

      <title>Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distances with JWST. II. I-band Measurements in a Sample of Hosts of 10 SN Ia Match HST Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubble Tension, a &gt;5 sigma discrepancy between direct and indirect measurements of the Hubble constant (H0), has persisted for a decade and motivated intense scrutiny of the paths used to infer H0. Comparing independently-derived distances for a set of galaxies with different standard candles, such as the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and Cepheid variables, can test for systematics in the middle rung of the distance ladder. The I band is the preferred filter for measuring the TRGB due to constancy with color, a result of low sensitivity to population differences in age and metallicity supported by stellar models. We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations with the maser host NGC 4258 as our geometric anchor to measure I-band (F090W vs F090W-F150W) TRGB distances to 8 hosts of 10 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) within 28 Mpc: NGC 1448, NGC 1559, NGC 2525, NGC 3370, NGC 3447, NGC 5584, NGC 5643, and NGC 5861. We compare these with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cepheid-based relative distance moduli for the same galaxies and anchor. We find no evidence of a difference between their weighted means, 0.01 +/- 0.04 (stat) +/- 0.04 (sys) mag. We produce fourteen variants of the TRGB analysis, altering the smoothing level and color range used to measure the tips to explore their impact. For some hosts, this changes the identification of the strongest peak, but this causes little change to the sample mean difference producing a full range of 0.01 to 0.03 mag, all consistent at 1 sigma with no difference. The result matches past comparisons of I-band TRGB and Cepheids when both use HST. SNe and anchor samples observed with JWST are too small to yield a measure of H0 that is competitive with the HST sample of 42 SNe Ia and 4 anchors; however, they already provide a vital systematic crosscheck to HST measurements of the distance ladder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The axion is a hypothetical elementary particle that could solve the long-standing strong CP problem in particle physics and the dark matter mystery in the cosmos. Due to the stimulation of the ambient photons, the axion dark matter decay into photons is significantly enhanced so that its echo signal could be detected by terrestrial telescopes. As a pathfinder, we study the expected sensitivity of searching for the axion dark matter in the mass range between $0.41$ and $1.6\mu\text{eV}$ with the 21 CentiMeter Array (21CMA). We aim to cover the whole 21CMA frequency range in two years by using a 1MW emitter. We find that the resulting sensitivity on the axion-photon coupling could surpass other existing limits by about one order of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Sterile neutrino is a fascinating candidate for dark matter. In this paper, we examine the Affleck-Dine (AD) leptogenesis scenario generating a large lepton asymmetry, which can induce the resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter via the Shi-Fuller (SF) mechanism. We also revisit the numerical calculation of the SF mechanism and the constraints from current X-ray and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations. We find that the AD leptogenesis scenario can explain the production of sterile neutrino dark matter by incorporating a non-topological soliton with a lepton charge called L-ball. Finally, we discuss an enhancement of second-order gravitational waves at the L-ball decay and investigate the testability of our scenario with future gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of dynamos from an autonomous generation of chiral asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At high energies, the dynamics of a plasma with charged fermions can be described in terms of chiral magnetohydrodynamics. Using direct numerical simulations, we demonstrate that chiral magnetic waves (CMWs) can produce a chiral asymmetry $\mu_5 = \mu_\mathrm{L} - \mu_\mathrm{R}$ from a spatially fluctuating (inhomogeneous) chemical potential $\mu = \mu_\mathrm{L} + \mu_\mathrm{R}$, where $\mu_\mathrm{L}$ and $\mu_\mathrm{R}$ are the chemical potentials of left- and right-handed electrically charged fermions, respectively. If the frequency of the CMW is less than or comparable to the characteristic growth rate of the chiral dynamo instability, the magnetic field can be amplified on small spatial scales. The growth rate of this small-scale chiral dynamo instability is determined by the spatial maximum value of $\mu_5$ fluctuations. Therefore, the magnetic field amplification occurs during periods when $\mu_5$ reaches temporal maxima during the CMW. If the small-scale chiral dynamo instability leads to a magnetic field strength that exceeds a critical value, which depends on the resistivity and the initial value of $\mu$, magnetically dominated turbulence is produced. Turbulence gives rise to a large-scale dynamo instability, which we find to be caused by the magnetic alpha effect. Our results have consequences for the dynamics of certain high-energy plasmas, such as the early Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Milky Way-est, a suite of 20 cosmological cold-dark-matter-only zoom-in simulations of Milky Way (MW)-like host halos. Milky Way-est hosts are selected such that they (i) are consistent with the MW's measured halo mass and concentration, (ii) accrete a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)-like ($\approx 10^{11}~M_{\odot}$) subhalo within the last $2~\mathrm{Gyr}$ on a realistic orbit, placing them near $50~\mathrm{kpc}$ from the host center at $z\approx 0$, and (iii) undergo a $&gt;$1:5 sub-to-host halo mass ratio merger with a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE)-like system at early times ($0.67&lt;z&lt;3$). Hosts satisfying these LMC and GSE constraints constitute $&lt; 1\%$ of all halos in the MW's mass range, and their total masses grow rapidly at late times due to LMC analog accretion. Compared to hosts of a similar final halo mass that are not selected to include LMC and GSE analogs, Milky Way-est hosts contain $22\%$ more subhalos with present-day virial masses above $10^8~M_{\odot}$ throughout the virial radius, on average. This enhancement reaches $\approx 80\%$ in the inner $100~\mathrm{kpc}$ and is largely, if not entirely, due to LMC-associated subhalos. These systems also induce spatial anisotropy in Milky Way-est subhalo populations, with $\approx 60\%$ of the total subhalo population within $100~\mathrm{kpc}$ found in the current direction of the LMC. Meanwhile, we find that GSE-associated subhalos do not significantly contribute to present-day Milky Way-est subhalo populations. These results provide context for our Galaxy's dark matter structure and subhalo population and will help interpret a range of measurements that are currently only possible in the MW.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Production of Completely Dark Photons with Nonminimal Couplings to Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark photons are a theorized massive spin-1 particle which can be produced via various mechanisms, including cosmological gravitational particle production (GPP) in the early universe. In this work, we extend previous results for GPP of dark photons to include nonminimal couplings to gravity. We find that nonminimal couplings can induce a ghost instability or lead to runaway particle production at high momentum and discuss the constraints on the parameter space such that the theory is free of instabilities. Within the instability-free regime we numerically calculate the particle production and find that the inclusion of nonminimal couplings can lead to an enhancement of the particle number. As a result, GPP of nonminimally coupled dark photons can open the parameter space for production of a cosmological relevant relic density (constituting all or part of the dark matter) as compared to the minimally-coupled theory. These results are independent of the choice of inflation model, which we demonstrate by repeating the analysis for a class of rapid-turn multi-field inflation models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two novel models in the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity to explain our accelerated universe, namely the exponential $f(Q)_{EXP}$ model and the hyperbolic tangent $f(Q)_{HT}$ model. The current cosmological electromagnetic observations including the cosmic microwave background anisotropies (CMB), the baryon acoustic oscillations(BAO), the type Ia supernovae (SN) and the direct measurements of H(z), combined with the simulated gravitational-wave data are used to constrain the $f(Q)$ models. We find that the Hubble tension can be significantly alleviated to $1.40\sigma$ level in the $f(Q)_{EXP}$ model. The fitting $\chi^2$ of the $f(Q)_{HT}$ model is $9.75\sigma$ poorer than that of the $f(Q)_{EXP}$ model, implying the $f(Q)_{HT}$ model would be excluded by future gravitational-wave observation.</description>
