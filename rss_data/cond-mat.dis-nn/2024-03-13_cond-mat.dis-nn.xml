      <title>Quantum skyrmion dynamics studied by neural network quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of quantum skyrmions under a magnetic field gradient using neural network quantum states. First, we obtain a quantum skyrmion lattice ground state using variational Monte Carlo with a restricted Boltzmann machine as the variational ansatz for a quantum Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Then, using the time-dependent variational principle, we study the real-time evolution of quantum skyrmions after a Hamiltonian quench with an inhomogeneous external magnetic field. We show that field gradients are an effective way of manipulating and moving quantum skyrmions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that quantum skyrmions can decay when interacting with each other. This work shows that neural network quantum states offer a promising way of studying the real-time evolution of quantum magnetic systems that are outside the realm of exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Floquet thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How a closed system thermalizes, especially in the absence of global conservation laws but in the presence of disorder and interactions, is one of the central questions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We explore this for a disordered, periodically driven Ising chain. Our numerical results reveal inhomogeneous thermalization leading to a distribution of thermalization timescales within a single disordered sample, which we encode via a distribution of effective local temperatures. Using this, we find an excellent collapse $\textit{without}$ $\textit{any}$ $\textit{fitting}$ $\textit{parameters}$ of the local relaxation dynamics for the entire range of disorder values in the ergodic regime when adapting the disorder-averaged diagonal entanglement entropy as internal `time' of the system. This approach evidences a remarkably uniform parametrization of the dynamical many-body evolution of local temperature within the otherwise highly heterogeneous ergodic regime, independent of the strength of the disorder.</description>

      <title>Small field chaos in spin glasses: universal predictions from the ultrametric tree and comparison with numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the chaotic behavior of the Gibbs state of spin-glasses under the application of an external magnetic field, in the crossover region where the field intensity scales proportional to $1/\sqrt{N}$, being $N$ the system size. We show that Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB) theory provides universal predictions for chaotic behavior: they depend only on the zero-field overlap probability function $P(q)$ and are independent of other features of the system. Using solely $P(q)$ as input we can analytically predict quantitatively the statistics of the states in a small field. In the infinite volume limit, each spin-glass sample is characterized by an infinite number of states that have a tree-like structure. We generate the corresponding probability distribution through efficient sampling using a representation based on the Bolthausen-Snitmann coalescent. In this way, we can compute quantitatively properties in the presence of a magnetic field in the crossover region, the overlap probability distribution in the presence of a small field and the degree of decorrelation as the field is increased. To test our computations, we have simulated the Bethe lattice spin glass and the 4D Edwards-Anderson model, finding in both cases excellent agreement with the universal predictions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in symmetric random circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry, which serves as a diagnostic tool for symmetry breaking and a proxy for thermalization, has recently been proposed and studied in the context of symmetry restoration for quantum many-body systems undergoing a quench. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration in various symmetric random quantum circuits, particularly focusing on the U(1) symmetry case. In contrast to non-symmetric random circuits where the U(1) symmetry of a small subsystem can always be restored at late times, we reveal that symmetry restoration can fail in U(1) symmetric circuits for certain small symmetry-broken initial states in finite-size systems. In the early-time dynamics, we observe an intriguing quantum Mpemba effect implying that symmetry is restored faster when the initial state is more asymmetric. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement asymmetry dynamics for SU(2) and $Z_{2}$ symmetric circuits and identify the presence and absence of the quantum Mpemba effect for the corresponding symmetries, respectively. A unified understanding of these results is provided through the lens of quantum thermalization with conserved charges.</description>

      <title>The Garden of Forking Paths: Observing Dynamic Parameters Distribution in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A substantial gap persists in understanding the reasons behind the exceptional performance of the Transformer architecture in NLP. A particularly unexplored area involves the mechanistic description of how the distribution of parameters evolves over time during training. In this work we suggest that looking at the time evolution of the statistic distribution of model parameters, and specifically at bifurcation effects, can help understanding the model quality, potentially reducing training costs and evaluation efforts and empirically showing the reasons behind the effectiveness of weights sparsification.</description>

      <title>Robust extended states in Anderson model on partially disordered random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we analytically explain the origin of the mobility edge in the partially disordered random regular graphs of degree d, i.e., with a fraction $\beta$ of the sites being disordered, while the rest remain clean. It is shown that the mobility edge in the spectrum survives in {a certain range of parameters} $(d,\beta)$ at infinitely large uniformly distributed disorder. The critical curve separating extended and localized states is derived analytically and confirmed numerically. The duality in the localization properties between the sparse and extremely dense RRG has been found and understood.</description>

      <title>Effects of the growth kinetics on solute diffusion in porous films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.11376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the development of porous materials with improved transport properties, a key missing ingredient is to determine the relations between growth kinetics, structure, and transport parameters. Here, we address these relations by studying solute diffusion through three-dimensional porous films produced by simple deposition models with controlled thickness and porosity. We simulate growing films with competitive aggregation rules that incorporate lateral aggregation (relative rate proportional to $p$), which leads to pore formation, and surface relaxation ($1-p$) that favors compaction. By connecting a solute source at the basis and a drain at the top outer surface of the films, we extract the effective diffusion coefficients from steady-state simulations. We find that for a given film thickness, the larger the $p$, the larger the effective porosity and diffusivity, but the smaller the tortuosity. Keeping constant growth conditions (i.e., same $p$), the increase of thickness always leads to an increase of effective porosity, but a nontrivial behavior in the diffusivity occurs: for $p\leq 0.7$, the diffusion coefficient is larger in thicker films; this is accompanied by a decrease of the tortuosity with the thickness, thus indicating that growth continuously improves pore structure for diffusion. Microscopically, such a result is associated with narrower distributions of local solute currents at higher points of films. Particularly for $p\geq 0.9$, in which film porosity is $\sim 0.65-0.7$, the tortuosity is between $1.3$ and $2$, increases with the thickness, and has maximal changes near $25\%$. Pairs of values of porosity and tortuosity that we obtain here, for the thickest films, agree with those experimentally measured in some porous electrodes. Noteworthy, the increase of film thickness is generally favorable for diffusion in their pores, and exceptions have small losses in tortuosity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-layer spreading processes on unidirectionally dependent networks are studied, where the spreading infection of diseases or malware in one layer can trigger cascading failures in another layer and lead to secondary disasters, e.g., disrupting public services, supply chains, or power distribution. We utilize the dynamic message-passing method to devise efficient algorithms for inferring the system states, which allows one to investigate systematically the nature of such complex intertwined spreading processes and evaluate their impact. Based on the dynamic message-passing framework and optimal control, we further develop an effective optimization algorithm for mitigating network failures.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions by matrix product states scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of long quantum spin chains subjected to continuous monitoring via matrix product states (MPS) at fixed bond dimension, with the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) algorithm. The latter gives an effective classical non-linear evolution with a conserved charge, which approximates the real quantum evolution up to an error. We show that the error rate displays a phase transition in the monitoring strength, which can be well detected by scaling analysis with relatively low values of bond dimensions. The method allows for an efficient numerical determination of the critical measurement-induced phase transition parameters in many-body quantum systems. Moreover, in the presence of U(1) global spin charge, we show the existence of a charge-sharpening transition well separated from the entanglement transition which we detect by studying the charge fluctuations of a local sub-part of the system at very large times. Our work substantiates the TDVP time evolution as a method to identify measured-induced phase transitions in systems of arbitrary dimensions and sizes.</description>

      <title>Existence of de Almeida-Thouless-type instability in the transverse field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interpolation method for mean field spin glass models developed by Guerra and Talagrand is extended to a quantum mean field spin glass model. This extension enables us to obtain both replica-symmetric (RS) and one step replica-symmetry breaking (1RSB) solutions of the free energy density in the transverse field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. It is shown that the RS solution is exact in the paramagnetic phase. We provide a sufficient condition on coupling constants where the 1RSB solution gives better bound than the RS one. This condition reduced to physical quantities in disordered single spin systems allows a simple computer-assisted proof for the existence of the de Almeida-Thouless-type instability.</description>
