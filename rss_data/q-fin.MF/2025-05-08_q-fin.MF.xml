      <title>Risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning Based on Convex Scoring Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework under a broad class of risk objectives, characterized by convex scoring functions. This class covers many common risk measures, such as variance, Expected Shortfall, entropic Value-at-Risk, and mean-risk utility. To resolve the time-inconsistency issue, we consider an augmented state space and an auxiliary variable and recast the problem as a two-state optimization problem. We propose a customized Actor-Critic algorithm and establish some theoretical approximation guarantees. A key theoretical contribution is that our results do not require the Markov decision process to be continuous. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary variable sampling method inspired by the alternating minimization algorithm, which is convergent under certain conditions. We validate our approach in simulation experiments with a financial application in statistical arbitrage trading, demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Calibration of Local Volatility Models with Stochastic Interest Rates using Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a non-parametric, semimartingale optimal transport, calibration methodology for local volatility models with stochastic interest rate. The method finds a fully calibrated model which is the closest, in a way that can be defined by a general cost function, to a given reference model. We establish a general duality result which allows to solve the problem by optimising over solutions to a second order fully non-linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Our methodology is analogous to Guo, Loeper, and Wang, 2022 and Guo, Loeper, Obloj, et al., 2022a but features a novel element of solving for discounted densities, or sub-probability measures. As an example, we apply the method to a sequential calibration problem, where a Vasicek model is already given for the interest rates and we seek to calibrate a stock price's local volatility model with volatility coefficient depending on time, the underlying and the short rate process, and the two processes driven by possibly correlated Brownian motions. The equity model is calibrated to any number of European options prices.</description>
