      <title>The potentials of the acceleration field and pressure field in rotating relativistic uniform system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalar and vector potentials of the acceleration field and the pressure field are calculated for the first time for a rotating relativistic uniform system, and the dependence of the potentials on the angular velocity is found. These potentials are compared with the potentials for the non-rotating uniform system that have been found previously. The rotation leads to the appearance of vector potentials, which at each point turn out to be directed along the corresponding linear velocity of rotation. The calculation shows that for rotating stellar objects the contribution to the fields vector potentials from the proper random motion of particles is small compared to the contribution from rotation and may not be taken into account. From the expression for the pressure field potential a relativistic formula follows that relates the pressure, mass density, and mean square velocity of the particles. This formula in the limit of low speeds corresponds to the expression for the pressure in molecular kinetic theory. When calculating the potentials, a new method is used that takes into account the potentials of two different bodies, a cylinder and a sphere, for solving the wave equation of rotating system.</description>

      <title>Does quantum mechanics apply to macroscopic objects? How to define macro?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to Quantum Mechanics a narrow wave-packet of the center of mass of any macroscopic object should smear out after some time. The problem is usually waved out by assuming that due to their heavy masses this occurs over astronomical times. Without a clear definition of macroscopic objects this remains ambiguous. On the other hand, Quantum Mechanics allows and energetically even prefers largely smeared out c.m. states that never been seen. Why is this the real state of the world we know? Does it suggest a micro-macro threshold with different theoretical descriptions? Does offer micro-miniaturization a hope for answering these questions?</description>

      <title>Physical uniqueness of the definitions of the Cartesian photon position operator leading to electric and magnetic strings eigenstates of the photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper provides three main definitions of the Cartesian photon position operator based on: boost generator, the transversality condition and the helicity operator. In each case, the correctness of the definition and Hermitianness of the operator in the domain of physical states are proven. All considered definitions lead to the same form of the Cartesian position operator in the domain of physical states. Radial photon position operators were also defined, but they turned out to be non-equivalent. Nevertheless, the most useful two radial operators turned out to be twin counterparts in the sense of the transformation to the helical representation, which is an alternative positional representation. The components of the photon position operator do not commute, but in analogy to the problem of eigenangular momentum, its eigenstates do exist.
  The eigenstates of the two components of the position operator (including the radial component) are called photon strings. Photon strings on a straight line and on a circle have been studied. The usual, previously known photon string states were named electric strings, but new magnetic strings were also introduced. Exact helical photon strings on a straight line, as well as hybrid helical photon strings on a circle, were also considered. On the other hand, infinitely short photon magnetic strings turned out to be flat photon vortices on planes with a normalization formula looks like as point-localized particles.</description>
