      <title>Existence of One-Step Replica Symmetry Breaking and phase transition in the Ising pure $p$-Spin Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the first example of one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) for the mean field Ising spin glasses at finite temperature and verify the first part of Gardner's conjecture. Specifically, Gardner conjectured that for Ising pure $p$-spin glasses with $p\geq 3,$ there are two phase transitions: the Parisi measure is Replica Symmetric (RS) at high temperatures, then transitions to One-Step Replica Symmetry Breaking (1RSB) at a lower temperature, and finally reaches Full Replica Symmetry Breaking (FRSB) at very low temperatures. Our main results verify the first part of the Gardner transition: for any $p \geq 3,$ there exists a unique $\beta^p_1&gt;0$ such that the Parisi measure is RS for $0 &lt; \beta \leq \beta^p_{1}$ and then 1RSB for $\beta^p_1 &lt; \beta \leq \beta^p_1+\epsilon_p$ with some $\epsilon_p&gt;0.$</description>

      <title>Lipschitz functions on weak expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a connected finite graph $G$, an integer-valued function $f$ on $V(G)$ is called $M$-Lipschitz if the value of $f$ changes by at most $M$ along the edges of $G$. In 2013, Peled, Samotij, and Yehudayoff showed that random $M$-Lipschitz functions on graphs with sufficiently good expansion typically exhibit small fluctuations, giving sharp bounds on the typical range of such functions, assuming $M$ is not too large. We prove that the same conclusion holds under a relaxed expansion condition and for larger $M$, (partially) answering questions of Peled et al. Our techniques involve a combination of Sapozhenko's graph container methods and entropy methods from information theory.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stochastic Laplace equation: Large Deviations and Measure Concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a large deviation principle for the strong solution of the p-Laplace equation on unbounded domain driven by small multiplicative Brownian noise is established. The weak convergence approach and the localized time increment estimate plays a crucial role to establish the large deviation principle. Moreover, based on the Girsanov transformation and the standard L2-uniqueness approach, the quadratic transportation cost information inequality is proved for the strong solution to the underlying problem which then implies the measure concentration phenomenon.</description>

      <title>An invitation to adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, which automatically tune their parameters based on past samples, have proved extremely useful in practice. The self-tuning mechanism makes them `non-Markovian', which means that their validity cannot be ensured by standard Markov chains theory. Several different techniques have been suggested to analyse their theoretical properties, many of which are technically involved. The technical nature of the theory may make the methods unnecessarily unappealing. We discuss one technique -- based on a martingale decomposition -- with uniformly ergodic Markov transitions. We provide an accessible and self-contained treatment in this setting, and give detailed proofs of the results discussed in the paper, which only require basic understanding of martingale theory and general state space Markov chain concepts. We illustrate how our conditions can accomodate different types of adaptation schemes, and can give useful insight to the requirements which ensure their validity.</description>

      <title>Conditioning the logistic continuous-state branching process on non-extinction via its total progeny</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of conditioning a continuous-state branching process with quadratic competition (logistic CB process) on non-extinction is investigated. We first establish that non-extinction is equivalent to the total progeny of the population being infinite. The conditioning we propose is then designed by requiring the total progeny to exceed arbitrarily large exponential random variables. This is related to a Doob's $h$-transform with an explicit excessive function $h$. The $h$-transformed process, i.e. the conditioned process, is shown to have a finite lifetime almost surely (it is either killed or it explodes continuously). When starting from positive values, the conditioned process is furthermore characterized, up to its lifetime, as the solution to a certain stochastic equation with jumps. The latter superposes the dynamics of the initial logistic CB process with an additional density-dependent immigration term. Last, it is established that the conditioned process can be starting from zero. Key tools employed are a representation of the logistic CB process through a time-changed generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, as well as Laplace and Siegmund duality relationships with auxiliary diffusion processes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dominance for super heavy-tailed random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of super heavy-tailed distributions and establish the inequality that any weighted average of independent and identically distributed super heavy-tailed random variables stochastically dominates one such random variable. We show that many commonly used extremely heavy-tailed (i.e., infinite-mean) distributions, such as the Pareto, Fr\'echet, and Burr distributions, belong to the class of super heavy-tailed distributions. The established stochastic dominance relation is further generalized to allow negatively dependent or non-identically distributed random variables. In particular, the weighted average of non-identically distributed random variables stochastically dominates their distribution mixtures. Applications of these results in portfolio diversification, goods bundling, and inventory management are discussed. Remarkably, in the presence of super heavy-tailedness, the results that hold for finite-mean models in these applications are flipped.</description>

      <title>Simulating Continuous-Time Autoregressive Moving Average Processes Driven By p-Tempered {\alpha}-Stable L\'evy Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss simulation schemes for continuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) processes driven by tempered stable L\'evy noises. CARMA processes are the continuous-time analogue of ARMA processes as well as a generalization of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. However, unlike Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with a tempered stable driver (see, e.g., Qu et al. (2021)) exact transition probabilities for higher order CARMA processes are not explicitly given. Therefore, we follow the sample path generation method of Kawai (2017) and approximate the driving tempered stable L\'evy process by a truncated series representations. We derive a result of a series representation for ptempered {\alpha}-stable distributions extending Rosi\'nski (2007). We prove approximation error bounds and conduct Monte Carlo experiments to illustrate the usefulness of the approach.</description>

      <title>The radial spanning tree in hyperbolic space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a stationary Poisson process $\eta$ in a $d$-dimensional hyperbolic space of constant curvature $-\varkappa$ and let the points of $\eta$ together with a fixed origin $o$ be the vertices of a graph. Connect each point $x\in\eta$ with its radial nearest neighbour, which is the hyperbolically nearest vertex to $x$ that is closer to $o$ than $x$. This construction gives rise to the hyperbolic radial spanning tree, whose geometric properties are in the focus of this paper. In particular, the degree of the origin is studied. For increasing balls around $o$ as observation windows, expectation and variance asymptotics as well as a quantitative central limit theorem for a class of edge-length functionals are derived. The results are contrasted with those for the Euclidean radial spanning tree.</description>

      <title>A new approach to the theory of optimal income tax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nobel-price winning Mirrlees' theory of optimal taxation inspired a long sequence of research on its refinement and enhancement. However, an issue of concern has been always the fact that, as was shown in many publications, the optimal schedule in Mirrlees' paradigm of maximising the total utility (constructed from individually optimised individual ones) usually did not lead to progressive taxation (contradicting the ethically supported practice in developed economies), and often even assigned minimal tax rates to the higher paid strata of society. The first objective of this paper is to support this conclusion by proving a theorem on optimal tax schedule in (practically most exploited) piecewise-linear environment under a simplest natural utility function. The second objective is to suggest a new paradigm for optimal taxation, where instead of just total average utility maximization one introduces a standard deviation of utility as a second parameter (in some analogy with Marcowitz portfolio optimization). We show that this approach leads to transparent and easy interpreted optimality criteria for income tax.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Gr\"unbaum's inequality in RCD$(0,N)$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize Gr\"unbaum's classical inequality in convex geometry to curved spaces with nonnegative Ricci curvature, precisely, to $\mathrm{RCD}(0,N)$-spaces with $N \in (1,\infty)$ as well as weighted Riemannian manifolds of $\mathrm{Ric}_N \ge 0$ for $N \in (-\infty,-1) \cup \{\infty\}$. Our formulation makes use of the isometric splitting theorem; given a convex set $\Omega$ and the Busemann function associated with any straight line, the volume of the intersection of $\Omega$ and any sublevel set of the Busemann function that contains a barycenter of $\Omega$ is bounded from below in terms of $N$. We also extend this inequality beyond uniform distributions on convex sets. Moreover, we establish some rigidity results by using the localization method, and the stability problem is also studied.</description>

      <title>Relative Entropy Method for Particle Approximation of the Landau Equation for Maxwellian Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the spatially homogeneous Landau equation for Maxwellian molecules from a natural stochastic interacting particle system. More precisely, we control the relative entropy between the joint law of the particle system and the tensorized law of the Landau equation. To obtain this, we establish as key tools the pointwise logarithmic gradient and Hessian estimates of the density function and also a new Law of Large Numbers result for the particle system. The logarithmic estimates are derived via the Bernstein method and the parabolic maximum principle, while the Law of Large Numbers result comes from crucial observations on the control of moments at the particle level.</description>

      <title>Some Rigorous Results on the L\'evy Spin Glass Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06084v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the L\'evy spin glass model, a fully connected model on $N$ vertices with heavy-tailed interactions governed by a power law distribution of order $0&lt;\alpha&lt;2.$ Our investigation is divided into three cases $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, $\alpha=1$, and $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2.$ When $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2,$ we identify a high temperature regime, in which the limit and fluctuation of the free energy are explicitly obtained and the site and bond overlaps are shown to exhibit concentration, interestingly, while the former is concentrated around zero, the latter obeys a positivity behavior. At any temperature, we further establish the existence of the limiting free energy and derive a variational formula analogous to Panchenko's framework in the setting of the Poissonian Viana-Bray model. For $\alpha=1$, the free energy scales super-linearly and converges to a constant proportional to $\beta$ in probability at any temperature. In the case of $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, the scaling for the free energy is again super-linear, however, it converges weakly to the sum of a Poisson Point Process at any temperature. Additionally, we show that the Gibbs measure puts most of its mass on the configurations that align with signs of the polynomially many heaviest edge weights.</description>

Abstract: We consider two continuous-time generalizations of conservative random walks introduced in [J.Englander and S.Volkov (2022)], an orthogonal and a spherically-symmetrical one; the latter model is known as {\em random flights}. For both models, we show the transience of the walks when $d\ge 2$ and the rate of changing of direction follows power law $t^{-\alpha}$, $0&lt;\alpha\le 1$, or the law $(\ln t)^{-\beta}$ where $\beta&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>A martingale approach to Gaussian fluctuations and laws of iterated logarithm for Ewens-Pitman model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ewens-Pitman model refers to a distribution for random partitions of $[n]=\{1,\ldots,n\}$, which is indexed by a pair of parameters $\alpha \in [0,1)$ and $\theta&gt;-\alpha$, with $\alpha=0$ corresponding to the Ewens model in population genetics. The large $n$ asymptotic properties of the Ewens-Pitman model have been the subject of numerous studies, with the focus being on the number $K_{n}$ of partition sets and the number $K_{r,n}$ of partition subsets of size $r$, for $r=1,\ldots,n$. While for $\alpha=0$ asymptotic results have been obtained in terms of almost-sure convergence and Gaussian fluctuations, for $\alpha\in(0,1)$ only almost-sure convergences are available, with the proof for $K_{r,n}$ being given only as a sketch. In this paper, we make use of martingales to develop a unified and comprehensive treatment of the large $n$ asymptotic behaviours of $K_{n}$ and $K_{r,n}$ for $\alpha\in(0,1)$, providing alternative, and rigorous, proofs of the almost-sure convergences of $K_{n}$ and $K_{r,n}$, and covering the gap of Gaussian fluctuations. We also obtain new laws of the iterated logarithm for $K_{n}$ and $K_{r,n}$.</description>

      <title>Impact of a block structure on the Lotka-Volterra model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09470v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lotka-Volterra (LV) model is a simple, robust, and versatile model used to describe large interacting systems such as food webs or microbiomes. The model consists of $n$ coupled differential equations linking the abundances of $n$ different species. We consider a large random interaction matrix with independent entries and a block variance profile. The $i$th diagonal block represents the intra-community interaction in community $i$, while the off-diagonal blocks represent the inter-community interactions. The variance remains constant within each block, but may vary across blocks.
  We investigate the important case of two communities of interacting species, study how interactions affect their respective equilibrium. We also describe equilibrium with feasibility (i.e., whether there exists an equilibrium with all species at non-zero abundances) and the existence of an attrition phenomenon (some species may vanish) within each community.
  Information about the general case of $b$ communities ($b&gt; 2$) is provided in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Viscosity Solutions of a class of Second Order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations in the Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to solving a class of second order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations in the Wasserstein space, associated with mean field control problems involving common noise. The well-posedness of viscosity solutions to the HJB equation under a new notion is established under general assumptions on the coefficients. Our approach adopts the smooth metric developed by Bayraktar, Ekren, and Zhang [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.

Further estimates and regularity of the metric, including a novel second order derivative estimate with respect to the measure variable, are derived in order to ensure the uniqueness and existence.</description>

Abstract: Whether Borel amenability implies hyperfiniteness is a main open question in the theory of Borel equivalence relations. Under a mild extra uniformity condition, we prove that Borel amenability of bounded degree Borel graphs is equivalent to a randomized version of hyperfiniteness. Our new approach yields simple proofs and generalizations for the Ornstein-Weiss theorem, the Quasi-Tiling theorem and the Connes-Feldman-Weiss theorem. One result is that the main conjecture holds up to a compressible set (that is, a set that admits no invariant probability measure).</description>
