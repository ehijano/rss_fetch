      <title>Existence of Equilibrium Mechanisms in Generalized Principal-Agent Problems with Interacting Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study incentive design when multiple principals simultaneously design mechanisms for their respective teams in environments with strategic spillovers. In this environment, each principal's set of incentive-compatible mechanisms--those that satisfy their own agents' incentive compatibility constraints--depends on the mechanisms offered by the other teams. Following a classic example by Myerson (1982), such games may lack equilibrium due to discontinuities in the correspondence of incentive-compatible mechanisms. We establish general conditions for equilibrium existence by introducing a novel approach that involves tracking both the outcome distributions along the truthful-obedient path and the sets of outcome distributions achievable through unilateral deviations, thereby providing a foundation for analyzing a wide range of multi-principal mechanism design with team production and agency problems.</description>

      <title>Robust Mechanism Design with Anonymous Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practice, auction data are often endogenously censored and anonymous, revealing only limited outcome statistics rather than full bid profiles. We study robust auction design when the seller observes only aggregated, anonymous order statistics and seeks to maximize worst-case expected revenue over all product distributions consistent with the observed statistic. We show that simple and widely used mechanisms are robustly optimal. Specifically, posted pricing is robustly optimal given the distribution of the highest value; the Myerson auction designed for the unique consistent i.i.d. distribution is robustly optimal given the lowest value distribution; and the second-price auction with an optimal reserve is robustly optimal when an intermediate order statistic is observed and the implied i.i.d. distribution is regular above its reserve. More generally, for a broad class of monotone symmetric mechanisms depending only on the top k order statistics, including multi-unit and position auctions, the worst-case revenue is attained under the i.i.d. distribution consistent with the observed k-th order statistic. Our results provide a tractable foundation for non-discriminatory auction design, where fairness and privacy are intrinsic consequences of the information structure rather than imposed constraints.</description>

      <title>Revenue Non-monotonicity in Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism is infamously revenue
  non-monotone in combinatorial auctions. I.e., when a buyer increases
  their value for a bundle of items, the total auction revenue may decrease.
  Combinatorial auctions exhibit complementarities which broadly
  result in complexities in auction theory. This brief note shows
  that non-monotonicity in multi-item auctions is not a result of
  complementarities, and in fact, VCG is revenue non-monotone even in matching
  markets.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Unitary Actor Assumption: Toward Realistic Aggregation of Individual Preferences in Strategy Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-standing unitary-actor assumption in strategy research -- treating firms as monolithic entities with coherent preferences -- misses that organizations are coalitions of individuals with diverse and often conflicting goals. Although behavioral perspectives have challenged this assumption, the field lacks an operational method for deriving an organizational utility function from the disparate preferences of its members and the specific structures used to aggregate them. We develop a mathematical framework that (i) maps individual utility functions into choice probabilities via a random-utility model, (ii) combines those probabilities using an explicit aggregation structure (e.g., unanimity or polyarchy), and (iii) recovers an organizational utility function that rationalizes the collective behavior. This establishes organizational utility functions as operationally meaningful: they summarize and predict organizational choice, yet are generally not simple averages of members' utilities. Instead, aggregation structures systematically reshape preferences -- unanimity approximates the pointwise minima of underlying utility functions, amplifying risk aversion; polyarchy approximates the pointwise maxima, promoting risk-seeking. We illustrate strategic implications in Cournot competition and principal-agent settings, showing how internal aggregation structures shift competitive and collaborative outcomes. Overall, the framework provides a parsimonious way to retrofit unitary-actor models with behaviorally grounded organizational preferences, reconciling the coalition view of the firm with rigorous and tractable strategic analysis.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Trading Networks: Equilibria and Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore stability and fairness considerations in decentralized networked markets with bilateral contracts, building on the trading networks framework [Hatfield et al., 2013]. In our trading network game, we show that a well-defined subset of Nash equilibria can be supported as competitive equilibria. Considering an offer-based trading dynamic as well as a stochastic price clock market, we prove new convergence results to Nash equilibrium and competitive equilibrium, providing a rationale for stability properties in decentralized, dynamic trading networks. Turning to the tension between fairness and (core) stability, we prove several negative results: inessential agents always receive zero utility in any core outcome, and even essential agents can get zero utility in all core outcomes.</description>

      <title>Markets are competitive if and only if P != NP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I prove that competitive market outcomes require computational intractability. If P = NP, firms can efficiently solve the collusion detection problem, identifying deviations from cooperative agreements in complex, noisy markets and thereby making collusion sustainable as an equilibrium. If P != NP, the collusion detection problem is computationally infeasible for markets satisfying a natural instance-hardness condition on their demand structure, rendering punishment threats non-credible and collusion unstable. Combined with Maymin (2011), who proved that market efficiency requires P = NP, this yields a fundamental impossibility: markets can be informationally efficient or competitive, but not both. Artificial intelligence, by expanding firms' computational capabilities, is pushing markets from the competitive regime toward the collusive regime, explaining the empirical emergence of algorithmic collusion without explicit coordination.</description>

      <title>An Infinite-Dimensional Insider Trading Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the seminal framework of Kyle (1985) to a many-asset setting, bridging the gap between informed-trading theory and modern trading practices. Specifically, we formulate an infinite-dimensional Bayesian trading game in which the informed trader's private information may concern arbitrary aspects of the cross-sectional payoff structure across a continuum of traded assets. In this general setting, we obtain a parsimonious equilibrium characterized by a single scalar fixed point, yielding closed-form characterizations of equilibrium trading strategy, price impact within and across markets, and the informational efficiency of equilibrium prices.</description>

      <title>Optimal Verification of (Mis)Information in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the diffusion of a true and a false message (misinformation) when agents are biased and able to verify messages. As a recipient of a false message who verifies it becomes informed of the truth, a higher prevalence of misinformation can increase the prevalence of the truth. We uncover conditions such that this happens and discuss policy implications. Specifically, a planner aiming to maximize the prevalence of the truth should allow misinformation to circulate if: non-verified messages may be ignored, transmission of information is relatively low, and the planner's budget to induce verification is neither too low nor too high. Homophily increases the spread of misinformation, but also facilitates diffusion of truth, and leads to similar results on the effect of verification.</description>

      <title>Information Design and Full Implementation in Nonatomic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the implementation of Bayes correlated equilibria in symmetric Bayesian games with nonatomic players, using direct information structures and obedient strategies. The main results demonstrate full implementation in a class of games with negative payoff externalities, such as congestion and Cournot games. Specifically, if the game admits a strictly concave potential in every state, then for every Bayes correlated equilibrium outcome with finite support and rational action distributions, there exists a direct information structure that implements this outcome under all equilibria. When the potential is weakly concave, we show that all equilibria implement the same expected total payoff. Additionally, all Bayes correlated equilibria, including those with infinite support or irrational action distributions, are approximately implemented.</description>
