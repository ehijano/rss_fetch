      <title>Compatibility studies of loquat scions with loquat and quince rootstocks</title>

Abstract: Experiment 1. Rooting of quince hardwood cuttings: Rooting success was influenced by both the concentrations of IBA and the selection of rooting media. However, the control group (without IBA) notably enhanced rooting when compared to the various IBA concentrations. Cuttings in the control group (without IBA) and those planted in river sand exhibited notably high percentages of successful rooting, underscoring the importance of the selected planting medium. Experiment 2. Bench grafting of loquat: The success of grafting loquat cutting stocks varied based on grafting dates, types of cuttings, and concentrations of IBA. However, IBA at different concentrations did not have a significant impact. Notably, certain interactions such as grafting on February 20 with loquat stock cuttings, yielded higher percentages of successful graft bud sprouting. Experiment 3. Performance of grafting loquats onto different rootstocks: Grafting success was notably influenced by the selection of rootstock, with loquat rootstock demonstrating superior performance compared to quince. The highest significant levels of successful grafting were attained on February 20, underscoring the crucial role of grafting dates. Experiment 4. Impact of tree stock types on grafting success: Grafting success percentage was higher in loquat tree stock when compared to quince. The consistency of grafting success percentages across three dates underscores the significant influence of rootstock type. Experiment 5. Bench grafting of loquat cutting stocks: Graft bud sprout percentages exhibited variations, with loquat stock cuttings surpassing quince. Grafting success demonstrated a consistent increase from February 20 to March 30, underscoring the importance of selecting appropriate grafting dates.</description>
