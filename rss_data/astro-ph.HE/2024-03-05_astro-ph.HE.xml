      <title>A note on identifying continuous gravitational wave emission signatures of magnetars in gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves (GWs) of neutrons stars haven't been detected directly until now. One possible way to indirectly identify their signatures is via the correlation between magnetars and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), since, under this magnetar scenario of GRBs, GW radiation can affect the evolution of GRB X-ray light curves. Nevertheless, relevant studies lack essential details of this GRB magnetar scenario. For instance, the authors tend to avoid answering the questions like why GRB X-ray light curves can record the information of gravitational wave emissions, what are the reliable criteria for selecting samples that can reveal GW information, and what are the limitations of this GRB-magnetar scenario. In this paper, we elucidate these issues in detail.</description>

      <title>Test for Echo: X-ray Reflection Variability in the Seyfert-2 AGN NGC 4388</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a study of the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line and reflection spectrum in the well-known Seyfert-2 AGN, NGC 4388. X-ray spectra summed from two extensive NICER monitoring campaigns, separated by years, show strong evidence of variation in the direct continuum and reflected emission, but only small variations in the obscuring gas. Fits to the spectra from individual NICER observations find a strong, positive correlation between the power-law photon index, $\Gamma$, and direct flux that is commonly observed in unobscured AGN. A search for a reverberation lag between the direct and reflected spectra -dominated by the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ emission line - measures a time scale of $t = 16.37^{+0.46}_{-0.38}$ days, or a characteristic radius of $r=1.374_{-0.032}^{+0.039}\times10^{-2}$ pc $=3.4_{-0.1}^{+0.1}\times10^4\;GM/c^2$. Only one cycle of this tentative lag is observed, but it is driven by a particularly sharp drop in the direct continuum that leads to the subsequent disappearance of the otherwise prominent Fe K$\alpha$ line. Physically motivated fits to high-resolution Chandra spectra of NGC 4388 measure a line production radius of $r =2.9^{+1.2}_{-0.7}~\times 10^{4}~GM/c^{2}$, formally consistent with the tentative lag. The line profile also prefers a Compton-thick reflector, indicating an origin in the disk and/or thick clumps within a wind. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our analysis and methods for testing our results in future observations, and we note the potential for X-ray reverberation lags to constrain black hole masses in obscured Seyferts wherein the optical broad line region is not visible.</description>

      <title>SN 2019nyk: A rapidly declining Type II supernova with early interaction signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an optical photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the fast-declining hydrogen-rich Type II supernova (SN) 2019nyk. The light curve properties of SN 2019nyk align well with those of other fast-declining Type II SNe, such as SNe 2013by and 2014G. SN 2019nyk exhibits a peak absolute magnitude of -18.09 $\pm$ 0.17 mag in the V band, followed by a rapid decline at 2.84 $\pm$ 0.03 mag (100 d)$^{-1}$ during the recombination phase. The early spectra of SN 2019nyk exhibit high-ionisation emission features as well as narrow H Balmer lines, persisting until 4.1 d since explosion, indicating the presence of circumstellar material (CSM) in close proximity. A comparison of these features with other Type II SNe displaying an early interaction reveals similarities between these features and those observed in SNe 2014G and 2023ixf. We also compared the early spectra to literature models, estimating a mass-loss rate of the order of 10$^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Radiation hydrodynamical modelling of the light curve also suggests the mass loss from the progenitor within a short period prior to explosion, totalling 0.16 M$_\odot$ of material within 2900 R$_\odot$ of the progenitor. Furthermore, light curve modelling infers a zero-age main sequence mass of 15 M$_\odot$ for the progenitor, a progenitor radius of 1031 R$_\odot$, and an explosion energy of 1.1 $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg.</description>

      <title>A New Determination of the Millisecond Pulsar Gamma-Ray Luminosity Function and Implications for the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested that the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess (GCE) could be produced by a large number of centrally-located millisecond pulsars. The fact that no such pulsar population has been detected implies that these sources must be very faint and very numerous. In this study, we use the contents of Fermi's recently released Third Pulsar Catalog (3PC) to measure the luminosity function of the millisecond pulsars in the Milky Way's Disk. We find that this source population exhibits a luminosity function with a mean gamma-ray luminosity of $\langle L_\gamma \rangle \sim 6 \times 10^{32}$ erg/s (integrated above 0.1 GeV). If the GCE were generated by millisecond pulsars with the same luminosity function, we find that $\sim$ 20 such sources from the Inner Galaxy population should have already been detected by Fermi and included in the 3PC. Given the lack of such observed sources, we exclude the hypothesis that the GCE is generated by pulsars with the same luminosity function as those in the Galactic Disk with a significance of $3.4\sigma$. We conclude that either less than 39% of the GCE is generated by pulsars, or that the millisecond pulsars in the Inner Galaxy are at least 5 times less luminous on average than those found in the Galactic Disk.</description>

      <title>Dwarf pulses of ten pulsars detected by FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How pulsars radiate is a long-standing problem. Detailed polarization measurements of individual pulses shed lights on currently unknown emission processes. Recently, based on super-sensitive observations, dwarf pulses have been recognized as weak narrow pulses often appearing during the nulling state. In this study, we report the detection of dwarf pulses from ten pulsars, PSRs B0525+21, B1237+25, J1538+2345, J1824$-$0127, J1851$-$0053, B1901+10, J1939+10, B1944+17, B2000+40 and J2112+4058, based on observations conducted with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Dwarf pulses of five pulsars are clearly discernible in the two-dimensional distribution of pulse intensity and pulse width. For the other five pulsars, PSRs J1538+2345, J1824$-$0127, J1939+10, B2000+40 and J2112+4058, only a few dwarf pulses are detected from pulse stacks. The dwarf pulses can emerge in both cone and core emission components for B1237+25, and the polarization angles of these dwarf pulses are mostly in the orthogonal polarization mode of normal pulses for B1944+17. In general, pulsars with detected dwarf pulses tend to be located within the `death valley' region of the distribution of pulsar periods and period derivatives.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Variability Analysis of Fermi-LAT Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars present highly variable $\gamma$-ray emission. This variability, which can range from a few minutes to several years, is also observed at other wavelengths across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. We make use of the first 12 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), complemented with multiwavelength (MWL) archival data from different observatories and facilities in radio, infrared and optical bands, to study the possible periodic emission from 19 blazars previously claimed as periodic candidates. A periodicity analysis is performed with a pipeline for periodicity searches. Moreover, we study the cross-correlations between the $\gamma$-ray and MWL light curves. Additionally, we use the fractional variability and the structure function to evaluate the variability timescales. We find five blazars showing hints of periodic modulation with $\geq$3.0$\sigma$ ($\approx$0$\sigma$ post-trials), with periods ranging from 1.2 to 4 years, both in their $\gamma$-ray and MWL emission. The results provide clues for understanding the physical mechanisms generating the observed periodicity.</description>

      <title>Radiation Process in Relativistic MHD Waves: the Case of Circularly Polarized Alfv\'{e}n Wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence in highly magnetized plasma can be relativistic and induce an electric field comparable to the background magnetic field. Such a strong electric field can affect the emission process of non-thermal electrons. As the first step toward elucidating the emission process in relativistic turbulence, we study the radiation process of electrons in relativistic circularly polarized Alfv\'{e}n waves. While the induced electric field boosts the average energy of low-energy electrons with a Larmor radius smaller than the wavelength, the emissivity for such electrons is suppressed because of the elongated gyro-motion trajectory. The trajectory of high-energy electrons is shaken by the small-scale electric field, which enhances the emissivity. Since the effective Lorentz factor of $E\times B$ drift is $\simeq\sqrt{2}$ in the circularly polarized Alfv\'{e}n waves, the deviation from the standard synchrotron emission is not so prominent. However, a power-law energy injection in the waves can produce a concave photon spectrum, which is similar to the GeV extra component seen in GRB spectra. If the turbulence electric field is responsible for the GeV extra component in GRBs, the estimates of the typical electron energy and magnetic field should be largely altered.</description>

      <title>AT2023lli: A Tidal Disruption Event with Prominent Optical Early Bump and Delayed Episodic X-ray Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-cadence, multiwavelength observations have continuously revealed the diversity of tidal disruption events (TDEs), thus greatly advancing our knowledge and understanding of TDEs. In this work, we conducted an intensive optical-UV and X-ray follow-up campaign of TDE AT2023lli, and found a remarkable month-long bump in its UV/optical light curve nearly two months prior to maximum brightness. The bump represents the longest separation time from the main peak among known TDEs to date. The main UV/optical outburst declines as $t^{-4.10}$, making it one of the fastest decaying optically selected TDEs. Furthermore, we detected sporadic X-ray emission 30 days after the UV/optical peak, accompanied by a reduction in the period of inactivity. It is proposed that the UV/optical bump could be caused by the self-intersection of the stream debris, whereas the primary peak is generated by the reprocessed emission of the accretion process. In addition, our results suggest that episodic X-ray radiation during the initial phase of decline may be due to the patched obscurer surrounding the accretion disk, a phenomenon associated with the inhomogeneous reprocessing process. The double TDE scenario, in which two stars are disrupted in sequence, is also a possible explanation for producing the observed early bump and main peak. We anticipate that the multicolor light curves of TDEs, especially in the very early stages, and the underlying physics can be better understood in the near future with the assistance of dedicated surveys such as the deep high-cadence survey of the 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST).</description>

      <title>How long will the quasar UV/optical flickering be damped?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The UV/optical light curves of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are commonly described by the Damped Random Walk (DRW) model. However, the physical interpretation of the damping timescale, a key parameter in the DRW model, remains unclear. Particularly, recent observations indicate a weak dependence of the damping timescale upon both wavelength and accretion rate, clearly being inconsistent with the accretion-disk theory. In this study, we investigate the damping timescale in the framework of the Corona Heated Accretion disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model, a physical model that describes AGN variability. We find that while the CHAR model can reproduce the observed power spectral densities of the 20-year light curves for 190 sources from \cite{Stone2022}, the observed damping timescale, as well as its weak dependence on wavelength, can also be well recovered through fitting the mock light curves with DRW. We further demonstrate that such weak dependence is artificial due to the effect of inadequate durations of light curves, which leads to best-fitting damping timescales lower than the intrinsic ones. After eliminating this effect, the CHAR model indeed yields a strong dependence of the intrinsic damping timescale on the bolometric luminosity and rest-frame wavelength. Our results highlight the demand for sufficiently long light curves in AGN variability studies and important applications of the CHAR model in such studies.</description>

      <title>Radio AGN jet alignment: Radio and Optical Position Angle of Radio Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established that AGNs play an important role in the evolution of galaxies. These AGNs can be linked to the accretion processes onto massive black holes and past merger events in their host galaxies, which may lead to different alignments of the jets with respect to the host galaxies. This paper presents a study of the PA differences between radio and optical images of radio AGNs based on the LoTSS DR2, the FIRST, the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and the SDSS. We assessed PA measurement biases in the data and classified the radio AGNs based on the radio luminosity and infrared colour from the WISE. This resulted in the largest yet published sample of 3682 radio AGNs with reliable radio and optical PA measurements. The PA difference (dPA) distributions for the radio AGN sample show a prominent minor-axis alignment tendency. Based on some simple assumptions, we simulated the projection effect to estimate the intrinsic jet-galaxy alignment. The observed dPA distribution can be well described by a two-component jet-alignment model in which one component is more aligned with the minor axis of the host galaxy than the other. The fitting results indicate that the jet alignment is dependent on radio luminosity and the shape of the host galaxies, with the jets being more likely to be aligned with the minor axis of the galaxy for lower radio luminosity and for optically more elongated radio AGNs. The minor-axis alignment of the entire sample may suggest a coherent accretion model present in most AGN host galaxies, while a considerable number of luminous radio-AGN with massive host galaxies might have undergone an accretion according to the chaotic model or past merger events.</description>

      <title>Stochastic acceleration in Extreme TeV BL Lacs through MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme TeV BL Lacs are a class of blazars with unique spectral and temporal features, not easily reproducible using standard one-zone models based on single shock acceleration. To account for their peculiar properties we elaborated a two-steps acceleration model where a recollimation shock and the subsequent downstream turbulence energize non-thermal electrons. We apply the model to a sample of Extreme TeV BL Lacs with well characterized spectral energy distributions. Since we are considering several sources, we automatized the exploration of the parameter space. This also allows us to derive the parameter distributions and to study the correlations among them. We numerically solved a system of two coupled non-linear differential equations to obtain the non-thermal particles and turbulence spectra. We calculated the spectral energy distribution via the Synchrotron Self-Compton emission model. The automatization of the parameter space exploration is possible through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ensemble sampler, in our case emcee. We derived well defined posterior distributions for the parameters, showing that the model is well constrained by available data and supporting the suitability of our method. The cross-correlations among some of the physical parameters are not trivial, therefore we conclude that MCMC sampling is a key instrument to characterize the complexity of our multi-parametric phenomenological model.</description>

      <title>Probing the emission mechanism and nature of the pulsating compact object in the X-ray binary SAX J1324.4-6200</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been renewed interest in the Be X-ray binary (Be/XRB) SAX J1324.4-6200 because of its spatial coincidence with a gamma-ray source detected by Fermi/LAT. To explore more thoroughly its properties, new observations were carried out in 2023 by NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and Swift, jointly covering the energy range 0.2-79 keV. The X-ray spectrum of SAX J1324.4-6200 fits well with an absorbed power law with a high energy cut-off. We measured a NuSTAR spin period of 175.8127 +/- 0.0036 s and an XMM-Newton spin period of 175.862 +/- 0.025 s. All the available spin period measurements of SAX J1324.4-6200, spanning 29 years, are correlated with time, resulting in a remarkably stable spin-down of dP/dt=(6.09 +/- 0.06)*1E-9 s/s. If SAX J1324.4-6200 hosts an accretion powered pulsar, accretion torque models indicate a surface magnetic field of ~1E12-1E13 G. The X-ray properties emerging from our analysis strenghten the hypothesis that SAX J1324.4-6200 belongs to the small group of persistent Be/XRBs. We also performed radio observations with the Parkes Murriyang telescope, to search for radio pulsations. However, no radio pulsations compatible with the rotational ephemeris of SAX J1324.4-6200 were detected. We rule out the hypothesis that SAX J1324.4-6200 is a gamma-ray binary where the emission is produced by interactions between the pulsar and the companion winds. Other models commonly used to account for the production of gamma-rays in accreting pulsars cannot reproduce the bright emission from SAX J1324.4-6200. We examined other mechanisms for the gamma-ray emission and noted that there is a ~0.5% chance probability that an unknown extragalactic AGN observed through the Galactic plane may coincidentally fall within the Fermi/LAT error circle of the source and be the responsible of the gamma-ray emission.

      <title>X-ray polarization measurement of the gold standard of radio-quiet active galactic nuclei : NGC 1068</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) satellite to measure, for the first time, the 2-8 keV polarization of NGC 1068. We pointed IXPE for a net exposure time of 1.15 Ms on the target, in addition to two ~ 10 ks each Chandra snapshots in order to account for the potential impact of several ultraluminous X-ray source (ULXs) within IXPE's field-of-view. We measured a 2 - 8 keV polarization degree of 12.4% +/- 3.6% and an electric vector polarization angle of 101{\deg} +/- 8{\deg} at 68% confidence level. If we exclude the spectral region containing the bright Fe K lines and other soft X-ray lines where depolarization occurs, the polarization fraction rises up to 21.3% +/- 6.7% in the 3.5 - 6.0 keV band, with a similar polarization angle. The observed polarization angle is found to be perpendicular to the parsec scale radio jet. Using a combined Chandra and IXPE analysis plus multi-wavelength constraints, we estimated that the circumnuclear "torus" may sustain a half-opening angle of 50{\deg} - 55{\deg} (from the vertical axis of the system). Thanks to IXPE, we have measured the X-ray polarization of NGC 1068 and found comparable results, both in terms of polarization angle orientation with respect to the radio-jet and torus half-opening angle, to the X-ray polarimetric measurement achieved for the other archetypal Compton-thick AGN : the Circinus galaxy. Probing the geometric arrangement of parsec-scale matter in extragalactic object is now feasible thanks to X-ray polarimetry.</description>

Abstract: Rotating and oscillating neutron stars can give rise to long-lived Continuous Gravitational Waves (CGWs). Despite many years of searching, the detection of such a CGW signal remains elusive. In this article we describe the main astrophysical uncertainties regarding such emission, and their relation to the behaviour of matter at extremely high density. We describe the main challenges in searching for CGWs, and the prospects of detecting them using third-generation gravitational wave detectors. We end by describing some pressing issues in the field, whose resolution would help turn the detection and exploitation of CGWs into reality.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Nature of Gravitational-Wave Emission in Core-collapse Supernovae with Perturbative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) can provide crucial information about the central engines of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). In order to unveil the nature of GW emission in CCSNe, we apply perturbative analyses with the same underlying equations as simulations to diagnose oscillations of the proto-neutron star (PNS) during $\sim$1 s postbounce. In the pseudo-Newtonian case, we find that radial profiles of GW emission match well between the perturbative analysis with $l=2$ and simulations inside the PNS at \emph{any} frequency and time. This confirms that the GW emission of CCSNe arises from the global PNS oscillations in the perturbative regime. Based on this, we solve for the discrete eigenmodes with a free PNS surface and tentatively identify a set of $g$ modes and the $f$ mode contributing to the peak GW emission. We also offer a possible explanation for the power gap in the GW spectrum found in simulations that lies at the frequency with vanishing cumulative emission of the PNS. Our results enhance the predictive power of perturbative analyses in the GW signals of CCSNe.</description>

      <title>Nucleosynthesis in the Innermost Ejecta of Magnetorotational Supernova Explosions in 3-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions powered by rotation and magnetic fields present an interesting astrophysical site for nucleosynthesis that potentially contributes to the production of $r$-process elements. Here we present yields of the innermost ejecta in 3D magnetorotational CCSN models simulated using the CoCoNuT-FMT code. Strong magnetic fields tap the rotational energy of the proto-neutron star and lead to earlier and more energetic ($\sim 3\times 10^{51}$ erg) explosions than typical neutrino-driven CCSNe. Compared to a reference non-magnetic model, the ejecta in the magnetorotational models have much more neutron-rich components with Ye down to $\sim$0.25. Our post-processing calculations with the reaction network SkyNet show significant production of weak $r$-process elements up to mass number $\sim$130. We find negligible differences in the synthesis of heavy elements between two magnetorotational models with different initial field strength of 10$^{10}$ and 10$^{12}$ G, in accord with their similar explosion dynamics. The magnetorotational models produce about $\sim$0.19 and 0.14 Msun of radioactive $^{56}$Ni, on the low end of inferred hypernova nickel masses. The yields are publicly available at Zenodo: doi:10.5281/zenodo.10578981 for comparison with stellar abundance patterns, inclusion in modelling galactic chemical evolution, and comparison with other yield calculations. Our results add to the yet restricted corpus of nucleosynthesis yields from 3D magnetorotational supernova simulations and will help quantify yield uncertainties.</description>

      <title>The variability patterns of the TeV blazar PG 1553+113 from a decade of MAGIC and multi-band observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PG 1553+113 is one of the few blazars with a convincing quasi-periodic emission in the gamma-ray band. The source is also a very high-energy (VHE; &gt;100 GeV) gamma-ray emitter. To better understand its properties and identify the underlying physical processes driving its variability, the MAGIC Collaboration initiated a multiyear, multiwavelength monitoring campaign in 2015 involving the OVRO 40-m and Medicina radio telescopes, REM, KVA, and the MAGIC telescopes, Swift and Fermi satellites, and the WEBT network. The analysis presented in this paper uses data until 2017 and focuses on the characterization of the variability. The gamma-ray data show a (hint of a) periodic signal compatible with literature, but the X-ray and VHE gamma-ray data do not show statistical evidence for a periodic signal. In other bands, the data are compatible with the gamma-ray period, but with a relatively high p-value. The complex connection between the low and high-energy emission and the non-monochromatic modulation and changes in flux suggests that a simple one-zone model is unable to explain all the variability. Instead, a model including a periodic component along with multiple emission zones is required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cooling of isolated neutron stars, employing different nuclear equations of state with or without active direct Urca process, and investigate the interplay with the nuclear pairing gaps. We find that a consistent description of all current cooling data requires fast DU cooling and reasonable proton 1S0 gaps, but no neutron 3P2 pairing. We then deduce the neutron star mass distributions compatible with the cooling analysis and compare with current theoretical models. Reduced 1S0 gaps and unimodal mass distributions are preferred by the analysis.</description>

      <title>Varying linear polarisation in the dust-free GRB 210610B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are produced by the collapse of some very massive stars, which emit ultra-relativistic jets. When the jets collide with the interstellar medium they decelerate and generate the so-called afterglow emission, which has been observed to be polarised. In this work we study the polarimetric evolution of GRB 210610B afterglow, at $z = 1.1341$. This allows to evaluate the role of geometric and/or magnetic mechanisms in the GRB afterglow polarisation. We observed GRB 210610B using imaging polarimetry with CAFOS on the 2.2 m Calar Alto Telescope and FORS2 on the 4 $\times$ 8.1 m Very Large Telescope. Complementary optical spectroscopy was obtained with OSIRIS on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias. We study the GRB light-curve from X-rays to optical bands and the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). This allows us to strongly constrain the line-of-sight extinction. Finally, we study the GRB host galaxy using optical/NIR data to fit the SED and derive its integrated properties. GRB 210610B had a bright afterglow with a negligible line-of-sight extinction. Polarimetry was obtained at three epochs: during an early plateau phase, at the time when the light curve breaks, and after the light curve steepened. We observe an initial polarisation of $\sim 4\%$ that goes to zero at the time of the break, and then increases again to $\sim 2\%$ with a change of the position angle of $54 \pm 9$ deg. The spectrum show features with very low equivalent widths, indicating a small amount of material in the line-of-sight within the host. The lack of dust and the low amount of material on the line-of-sight to GRB 210610B allow us to study the intrinsic polarisation of the GRB optical afterglow. We find the GRB polarisation signals are consistent with ordered magnetic fields in refreshed shock or/and hydrodynamics-scale turbulent fields in the forward shock.</description>

      <title>Particle motion around luminous neutron stars: effects of deviation from Schwarzschild spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study trajectories of test particles around a luminous, static, spherically symmetric neutron star, under the combined influence of gravity and radiation. In general relativity, for Schwarzschild spacetime, an equilibrium sphere (the Eddington Capture Sphere) is formed for near-Eddington luminosities. We generalize these results to a broad class of static, spherical spacetimes. We also study the dynamics of particles in a strong radiation field in spherical spacetimes. The results are illustrated for two cases, Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime of a charged spherical object in general relativity and Kehagias-Sfetsos spacetime, arising from the Horava-Lifshitz gravity theory. Our findings apply to neutron stars under gravitational field equations different from the vacuum Einstein field equations of general relativity, such as in modified theories of gravity, the only requirement being that test particles follow geodesics in the absence of the radiation field. We show that it is possible, in principle, to test the gravity theory by investigating such test particle equilibria and trajectories with observations of neutron stars' X-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>MeV gamma rays from Q-ball decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the supersymmetric Q balls which decay at present and find that they create a distinctive spectrum of gamma rays at around O(10) MeV. The charge of the Q ball is lepton numbers in order for the lifetime to be as long as the present age of the universe, and the main decay products are light leptons. However, as the charge of the Q ball decreases, the decay channel into pions becomes kinematically allowed towards the end of the decay, and the pions are produced at rest. Immediately, $\pi^0$ decays into two photons with the energy of 67.5 MeV, half the pion mass, which exhibits a unique emission line. In addition, $\pi^\pm$ decay into $\mu^\pm$, which further decay with emitting internal bremsstrahlung, whose spectrum has a sharp cutoff at $\sim$50 MeV. If the observations would find these peculiar features of the gamma-ray spectrum in the future, it could be a smoking gun of the supersymmetric Q-ball decay at present.</description>

      <title>Density-dependent quark mean-field model for nuclear matter and neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a density-dependent quark mean-field (DDQMF) model to study the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars, where the coupling strength between $\sigma$ meson and nucleon is generated by the degree of freedom of quarks, while other meson coupling constants are regarded as density-dependent ones. Two values for the nucleon effective mass, $M^*_{N0}/M_N=0.556,~0.70$ at the saturation density are chosen based on the consideration of the core-collapse supernova simulation and finite nuclei when the meson-nucleon coupling constants are fixed. We find that the equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter, the symmetry energy, the mass-radius relations, and the tidal deformabilities of neutron stars with larger nucleon effective mass are more sensitive to the skewness coefficient $J_0$. The EOSs with $M^*_{N0}/M_N=0.70$ are softer when the skewness coefficient $J_0=-800$ MeV. However, the maximum masses of the neutron star can be around $2.32M_\odot$ with $J_0=400$ MeV regardless of the value of the nucleon effective mass. By manipulating the coupling strength of the isovector meson to generate different slopes of symmetry energy, we construct the neutron star EOSs that can satisfy the different variables from the simultaneous mass-radius measurements of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620 by the NICER collaboration, the mass-radius relations of HESS J1731-347, and the radius constraints from the gravitational-wave signal GW170817 in the framework of DDQMF model. At the same time, most of these constructed EOSs can also satisfy the constraints of the tidal deformability from GW170817 event.</description>

      <title>Density jump for oblique collisionless shocks in pair plasmas: physical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless shocks are frequently analyzed using the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) formalism, even though MHD assumes a small mean free path. Yet, isotropy of pressure, fruit of binary collisions and assumed in MHD, may not apply in collisionless shocks. This is especially true within a magnetized plasma, where the field can stabilize an anisotropy.
  In a previous article \citep{BretJPP2022b}, a model was presented capable of dealing with the anisotropies that may arise at the front crossing. It was solved for any orientation of the field with respect to the shock front. Yet, for some values of the upstream parameters, several downstream solutions were found.
  Here, we complete the work started in \cite{BretJPP2022b} by showing how to pick the physical solution out of the ones offered by the algebra. This is achieved by 2 means: 1) selecting the solution that has the downstream field obliquity closest to the upstream one. This criterion is exemplified on the parallel case and backed up by Particle-in-Cell simulations. 2) Filtering out solutions which do not satisfy a criteria already invoked to trim multiple solutions in MHD: the evolutionarity criterion, that we assume valid in the collisionless case.
  The end result is a model in which a given upstream configuration results in a unique, or none (like in MHD), downstream configuration. The largest departure from MHD is found for the case of a parallel shock.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Dark Matter in Light of the NICER Precise Mass-Radius Measurements</title>

Abstract: We explore the presence of self-interacting bosonic dark matter (DM) within neutron stars (NSs) in light of the latest multi-messenger observations of the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and LIGO/Virgo detectors. The bosonic DM is distributed as a core inside the NS or as a halo around it leading to formation of a DM admixed NS. We focus on the variation of the visible and dark radius of the mixed object due to DM model parameters and fractions. It is shown that DM core formation reduces the visible radius and the total mass pushing them below observational limits while halo formation is in favor of the latest mass-radius observations. Moreover, we scan over the parameter space of the bosonic DM model considering two nuclear matter equation of states by applying the radius, maximum mass and tidal deformability constraints. Our investigation allows for the exclusion of a range of DM fractions, self-coupling constant and sub-GeV boson masses, which limits the amount of accumulated DM to relatively low values to be consistent with astrophysical bounds. In this paper, we introduce main features of the pulse profile corresponding to the DM admixed NS as a novel observable quantity. We find that the depth of minimum fluxes in the pulse profiles crucially depends on the amount of DM around NS and its compactness. The current/future astrophysics missions may test the possibility of the existence of DM within NSs and break the degeneracies between different scenarios via multiple observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GRB 221009A has been referred to as the Brightest Of All Time (the BOAT). We investigate the veracity of this statement by comparing it with a half century of prompt gamma-ray burst observations. This burst is the brightest ever detected by the measures of peak flux and fluence. Unexpectedly, GRB 221009A has the highest isotropic-equivalent total energy ever identified, while the peak luminosity is at the $\sim99$th percentile of the known distribution. We explore how such a burst can be powered and discuss potential implications for ultra-long and high-redshift gamma-ray bursts. By geometric extrapolation of the total fluence and peak flux distributions GRB 221009A appears to be a once in 10,000 year event. Thus, while it almost certainly not the BOAT over all of cosmic history, it may be the brightest gamma-ray burst since human civilization began.</description>

      <title>Primordial magnetic field as a common solution of nanohertz gravitational waves and the Hubble tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of interstellar and intergalactic magnetic fields remains largely unknown. One possibility is that they are related to the primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) produced by, for instance, the phase transitions of the early Universe. In this paper, we show that the PMF-induced turbulence generated at around the QCD phase transition epoch--the characteristic magnetic field strength $B_{\rm ch}^* \sim \mathcal{O}(1)~\rm{\mu G}$ and coherent length scale $\ell_{\rm ch}^* \sim \mathcal{O}(1)~\rm{pc}$--can naturally accommodate nanohertz gravitational waves reported by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations. Moreover, the evolution of the PMFs to the recombination era with the form of $B_{\rm ch}\sim \ell_{\rm ch}^{-\alpha}$ can induce baryon density inhomogeneities, alter the recombination history, and alleviate the tension of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the matter clumpiness parameter $S_8$ between early- and late-time measurements for $0.88\leq \alpha \leq 1.17$ (approximate 95\% credible region based on three PTA likelihoods). The further evolved PMFs may account for the $\sim {\cal O}(10^{-16})$ Gauss extragalactic magnetic field inferred with GRB 221009A.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new spectroscopic and photometric follow-up observations of the known sample of extreme coronal line emitting galaxies (ECLEs) identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). With these new data, observations of the ECLE sample now span a period of two decades following their initial SDSS detections. We confirm the nonrecurrence of the iron coronal line signatures in five of the seven objects, further supporting their identification as the transient light echoes of tidal disruption events (TDEs). Photometric observations of these objects in optical bands show little overall evolution. In contrast, mid-infrared (MIR) observations show ongoing long-term declines. The remaining two objects had been classified as active galactic nuclei (AGN) with unusually strong coronal lines rather than being TDE related, given the persistence of the coronal lines in earlier follow-up spectra. We confirm this classification, with our spectra continuing to show the presence of strong, unchanged coronal-line features and AGN-like MIR colours and behaviour. We have constructed spectral templates of both subtypes of ECLE to aid in distinguishing the likely origin of newly discovered ECLEs. We highlight the need for higher cadence, and more rapid, follow-up observations of such objects to better constrain their properties and evolution. We also discuss the relationships between ECLEs, TDEs, and other identified transients having significant MIR variability.</description>

      <title>Leptohadronic Multimessenger Modeling of 324 Gamma-Ray Blazars</title>

Abstract: The origin of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux observed by the IceCube experiment is still under debate. In recent years there have been associations of neutrino events with individual blazars, which are active galaxies with relativistic jets pointing toward Earth, such as the source TXS 0506+056. From a theoretical perspective, the properties of these sources as neutrino emitters are not yet well understood. In this work we model a sample of 324 blazars detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), most of which are flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). This amounts to 34% of all FSRQs in the latest Fermi catalog. By numerically modelling the interactions of cosmic-ray electrons and protons, we explain the emitted multi-wavelength fluxes from each source and self-consistently predict the emitted neutrino spectrum. We demonstrate that the optical and GeV gamma-ray broadband features are generally well described by electron emission. For 33% of the blazars in our sample, a description of the observed X-ray spectrum benefits from an additional component from proton interactions, in agreement with recent studies of individual IceCube candidate blazars. We conclude that blazars that are brighter in GeV gamma rays tend to have a higher neutrino production efficiency but a lower best-fit baryonic loading. The predicted neutrino luminosity shows a positive correlation with the observed GeV gamma-ray flux and with the predicted MeV gamma-ray flux. By extrapolating the results for this sample, we show that the diffuse neutrino flux from the population of gamma-ray-bright blazars may be at the level of about 20% of the IceCube flux, in agreement with current limits from stacking analyses. We discuss the implications of our results for future neutrino searches and suggest promising sources for potential detections with future experiments.</description>

Abstract: Neutrinos are known to play important roles in many astrophysical scenarios from the early period of the big bang to current stellar evolution being a unique messenger of the fusion reactions occurring in the center of our sun. In particular, neutrinos are crucial in determining the dynamics and the composition evolution in explosive events such as core-collapse supernovae and the merger of two neutron stars. In this paper, we review the current understanding of supernovae and binary neutron star mergers by focusing on the role of neutrinos therein. Several recent improvements on the theoretical modeling of neutrino interaction rates in nuclear matter as well as their impact on the heavy element nucleosynthesis in the supernova neutrino-driven wind are discussed, including the neutrino-nucleon opacity at the mean field level taking into account the relativistic kinematics of nucleons, the effect due to the nucleon-nucleon correlation, and the nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. We also review the framework used to compute the neutrino-nucleus interactions and the up-to-date yield prediction for isotopes from neutrino nucleosynthesis occurring in the outer envelope of the supernova progenitor star during the explosion. Here improved predictions of energy spectra of supernova neutrinos of all flavors have had significant impact on the nucleosynthesis yields. Rapid progresses in modeling the flavor oscillations of neutrinos in these environments, including several novel mechanisms for collective neutrino oscillations and their potential impacts on various nucleosynthesis processes are summarized.</description>

      <title>Viscous torque in turbulent magnetized AGN accretion disks and its effects on EMRI's gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The merger of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) produces mHz gravitational waves (GW), which are potentially detectable by future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Such binary systems are usually embedded in an accretion disk environment at the centre of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Recent studies suggest the plasma environment imposes measurable imprints on the GW signal if the mass ratio of the binary is around q $ \sim10^{-4}-10^{-3}$. The effect of the gaseous environment on the GW signal is strongly dependent on the disk's parameters, therefore it is believed that future low-frequency GW detections will provide us with precious information about the physics of AGN accretion disks. We investigate this effect by measuring the viscous torque via modelling the evolution of magnetized tori around the primary massive black hole. Using GRMHD HARM-COOL code, we perform 2D and 3D simulations of weakly-magnetized thin accretion disks, with a possible truncation and transition to advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). We study the angular momentum transport and turbulence generated by magnetorotational instability (MRI). We quantify the disk's effective alpha viscosity and its evolution over time. We apply our numerical results to quantify the relativistic viscous torque on a hypothetical low-mass secondary black hole via a 1D analytical approach, and we estimate the GW phase shift due to the gas environment.</description>

      <title>Simulating the tidal disruption of stars by stellar-mass black holes using moving-mesh hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the centers of dense star clusters, close encounters between stars and compact objects are likely to occur. We study tidal disruption events of main-sequence (MS) stars by stellar-mass black holes (termed $\mu$TDEs), which can shed light on the processes occurring in these clusters, including being an avenue in the mass growth of stellar-mass BHs. Using the moving-mesh hydrodynamics code \texttt{AREPO}, we perform a suite of hydrodynamics simulations of partial $\mu$TDEs of realistic, \texttt{MESA}-generated MS stars by varying the initial mass of the star ($0.5\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$ and $1\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$), the age of the star (zero-age, middle-age and terminal-age), the mass of the black hole ($10\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$ and $40\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$) and the impact parameter (yielding almost no mass loss to full disruption). We then examine the dependence of the masses, spins, and orbital parameters of the partially disrupted remnant on the initial encounter parameters. We find that the mass lost from a star decreases exponentially with increasing distance of approach and that a $1\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$ star loses lesser mass than a $0.5\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$. Moreover, a more evolved star is less susceptible to mass loss. Tidal torques at the closest approach spin up the remnant by factors of $10^2$--$10^4$ depending on the impact parameter. The remnant star can be bound (eccentric) or unbound (hyperbolic) to the black hole: hyperbolic orbits occur when the star's central density concentration is relatively low and the black hole-star mass ratio is high, which is the case for the disruption of a $0.5\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$ star. Finally, we provide best-fit analytical formulae for a range of parameters that can be incorporated into cluster codes to model star-black hole interaction more accurately.</description>

Abstract: We show that the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the tightly focused radiation generated by the superluminally moving current sheet in the magnetosphere of a non-aligned neutron star fits the gamma-ray spectra of the Crab, Vela and Geminga pulsars over the entire range of photon energies so far detected by Fermi-LAT, MAGIC and HESS from them: over $10^2$ MeV to $20$ TeV. While emblematic of any emission that entails caustics, the SED introduced here radically differs from those of the disparate emission mechanisms currently invoked in the literature to fit the data in different sections of these spectra. We specify, moreover, the connection between the values of the fit parameters for the analysed spectra and the physical characteristics of the central neutron stars of the Crab, Vela and Geminga pulsars and their magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Penrose process in the magnetized Kerr spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic Penrose process (MPP) could be highly efficient (efficiency can even exceed $100\%$) for extracting the energy from a Kerr black hole, if it is immersed in a mG order magnetic field. Considering the exact solution of the magnetized Kerr spacetime, here we derive the exact expression of efficiency ($\eta_{\rm MPP}$) for MPP, which is valid for both the Kerr black hole (BH) as well as Kerr superspinar (SS), and also from the weak magnetic field to an ultra-strong magnetic field $(B)$ which can even distort the original Kerr geometry. We show that although the value of $\eta_{\rm MPP}$ increases upto a certain value of ultra-strong magnetic field ($B_p$), it decreases to zero for $B &gt; B_p$, in case of the Kerr BHs. On the other hand, $\eta_{\rm MPP}$ shows the opposite behavior in case of the Kerr SSs. One intriguing feature that emerges is, $\eta_{\rm MPP}$ acquires the maximum value for the Kerr parameter $a_* \approx 0.786$ (unlike $a_*=1$ for the ordinary PP), decreases for $0.786 &lt; a_* \leq 1$. This indicates that the BH starts to expel the effect of magnetic field for $a_* &gt; 0.786$, and is fully expelled from the extremal Kerr BH due to the gravitational Meissner effect. As a special case of MPP, we also study the ordinary Penrose process (PP) for magnetized Kerr spacetime. We show that MPP for Kerr BHs, Kerr SSs and ordinary PP for Kerr SSs can be superefficient for the astrophysical applications to powering engines in the high-energy sources like active galactic nuclei and quasars, in the weak magnetic fields. Our strong magnetic field result of MPP could be important to the primordial BHs in the early Universe immersed in the primordial magnetic fields, and to the transmuted BHs which are formed by collapsing and/or by merging of the magnetized progenitors. It is almost impossible to extract the energy from a BH (SS) through MPP (PP) in the ultra-strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we present the results from further X-ray and UV observations of the nuclear transient eRASSt J045650.3-203750 (hereafter J0456-20). We detected five repeating X-ray and UV flares from J0456-20, making it one of the most promising repeating partial tidal disruption event (pTDE) candidates. More importantly, we also found rapid changes in the recurrence time $T_\text{recur}$ of the X-ray flares by modelling the long-term X-ray light curve of J0456-20. $T_\text{recur}$ first decreased rapidly from about 300 days to around 230 days. It continued to decrease to around 190 days with an indication of a constant $T_\text{recur}$ evidenced from the latest three cycles. Our hydrodynamic simulations suggest that, in the repeating pTDE scenario, such rapid evolution of $T_\text{recur}$ could be reproduced if the original star is a $1~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ main-sequence star near the terminal age and loses nearly 80-90% of its mass during the initial encounter with a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass around $10^5~\mathrm{M}_\odot$. The inferred mass loss of 0.8-0.9 $\mathrm{M}_\odot$ is higher than the estimated value of around 0.13 $\mathrm{M}_\odot$ from observation, which could be explained if the radiation efficiency is low (i.e. $\ll0.1$). Our results indicate that repeating pTDEs could be effective tools to explore the dynamics around supermassive black holes beyond our own Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Spectrogram correlated stacking: A novel time-frequency domain analysis of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) originates from numerous faint sub-threshold gravitational wave (GW) signals arising from the coalescing binary compact objects. This background is expected to be discovered from the current (or next-generation) network of GW detectors by cross-correlating the signal between multiple pairs of GW detectors. However, detecting this signal is challenging and the correlation is only detectable at low frequencies due to the arrival time delay between different detectors. In this work, we propose a novel technique, \texttt{Spectrogram Correlated Stacking} (or \texttt{SpeCs}), which goes beyond the usual cross-correlation (and to higher frequencies) by exploiting the higher-order statistics in the time-frequency domain which accounts for the \textit{chirping} nature of the individual events that comprise SGWB. We show that \texttt{SpeCs} improves the signal-to-noise for the detection of SGWB by a factor close to $8$, compared to standard optimal cross-correlation methods which are tuned to measure only the power spectrum of the SGWB signal.\texttt{SpeCs} can probe beyond the power spectrum and its application to the GW data available from the current and next-generation GW detectors would speed up the SGWB discovery.</description>

      <title>Black Holes as Neutrino Factories</title>

Abstract: Ultralight bosons near rotating black holes can grow significantly via superradiant energy extraction, potentially reaching field values close to the Planck scale, thereby turning black holes into effective transducers for these fields. The interaction between a boson field and fermions can initiate a parametric production of fermions, potentially halting the exponential growth and leading to a saturated state of the boson cloud. This dynamic offers a framework for establishing limits on boson-neutrino interactions, which have traditionally been restricted by neutrino self-interaction considerations. At the saturation phase, boson clouds have the capacity to propel neutrinos to TeV-scale energies, generating fluxes that surpass atmospheric neutrino fluxes from nearby black holes. This mechanism extends to dark sector fermions, leading to the generation of boosted dark matter. These fluxes open novel avenues for observation through high-energy neutrino detectors like IceCube, as well as through dark matter direct detection, by directing observational efforts towards targeted black holes.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of Einstein--scalar--Gauss--Bonnet black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate quasinormal modes of scalar and electromagnetic fields in the background of Einstein--scalar--Gauss--Bonnet (EsGB) black holes. Using the scalar and electromagnetic field equations in the vicinity of the EsGB black hole, we study nature of the effective potentials. The dependence of real and imaginary parts of the fundamental quasinormal modes on parameter $p$ (which is related to the Gauss--Bonnet coupling parameter $\alpha$) for different values of multipole numbers $l$ are studied. We analyzed the effects of massive scalar fields on the EsGB black hole, which tells us the existence of quasi--resonances. In the eikonal regime, we find the analytical expression for the quasinormal frequency and show that the correspondence between the eikonal quasinormal modes and null geodesics is valid in the EsGB theory for the test fields. Finally, we study grey-body factors of the electromagnetic fields for different multipole numbers $l$, which deviates from Schwarzschild's black hole.</description>

      <title>The Redshift Evolution of the $M_\bullet-M_\star$ Relation for JWST's Supermassive Black Holes at $z &gt; 4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST has detected many overmassive galactic systems at $z &gt; 4$, where the mass of the black hole, $M_\bullet$, is $10-100$ times larger than expected from local relations, given the host's stellar mass, $M_\star$. This Letter presents a model to describe these overmassive systems in the high-$z$ Universe. We suggest that the black hole mass is the main driver of high-$z$ star formation quenching. SMBHs globally impact their high-$z$ galaxies because their hosts are physically small, and the black holes have duty cycles close to unity at $z &gt; 4$. In this regime, we assume that black hole mass growth is regulated by the quasar's output, while stellar mass growth is quenched by it and uncorrelated to the global properties of the host halo. We find that the ratio $M_\bullet/M_\star$ controls the average star formation efficiency: if $M_\bullet/M_\star &gt; 8\times 10^{18} (n \Lambda/f_{edd})[(\Omega_b M_h)/(\Omega_m M_\star) - 1]$, then the galaxy is unable to form stars efficiently. Once this ratio exceeds the threshold, a runaway process brings the originally overmassive system towards the local $M_\bullet - M_\star$ relation. Furthermore, the $M_\bullet - M_\star$ relation evolves with redshift as $\propto (1+z)^{5/2}$. At $z \sim 5$, we find an overmassive factor of $\sim 55$, in excellent agreement with current JWST data and the high-$z$ relation inferred from those. Extending the black hole horizon farther in redshift and lower in mass will test this model and improve our understanding of the early co-evolution of black holes and galaxies.</description>

      <title>A Short Intense Dynamo at the Onset of Crystallization in White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of large magnetic fields ($\gtrsim 10^6~\mathrm{G}$) in isolated white dwarfs is not clear. One possible explanation is that crystallization of the star's core drives compositional convection, which when combined with the star's rotation, can drive a dynamo. However, whether convection is efficient enough to explain the large intensity of the observed magnetic fields is still under debate. Recent work has shown that convection in cooling white dwarfs spans two regimes: efficient convection at the onset of crystallization, and thermohaline convection during most of the star's cooling history. Here, we calculate the properties of crystallization-driven convection for cooling models of several white dwarfs of different masses. We combine mixing-length theory with scalings from magneto-rotational convection to estimate the typical magnitude of the convective velocity and induced magnetic field for both scenarios. In the thermohaline regime, we find velocities $\sim 10^{-6}$--$10^{-5}~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$, with fields restricted to $\lesssim~100~\mathrm{G}$. However, when convection is efficient, the flow velocity can reach magnitudes of $\sim 10^2$--$10^3~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$, with fields of $\sim 10^6$--$10^8~\mathrm{G}$, independent of the star's rotation rate. Thus, dynamos driven at the onset of crystallization could explain the large intensity magnetic fields measured for single white dwarfs.</description>
