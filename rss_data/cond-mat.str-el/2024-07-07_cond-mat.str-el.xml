      <title>Cheshire qudits from fractional quantum spin Hall states in twisted MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted MoTe$_2$ homobilayers exhibit transport signatures consistent with a fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) state. We describe a route to construct topological quantum memory elements, dubbed Cheshire qudits, formed from punching holes in such a FQSH state and using proximity-induced superconductivity to gap out the resulting helical edge states. Cheshire qudits encode quantum information in states that differ by a fractional topological "Cheshire" charge that is hidden from local detection within a condensate anyons. Control of inter-edge tunneling by gates enables both supercurrent-based readout of a Cheshire qudit, and capacitive measurement of the thermal entropy associated with its topological ground-space degeneracy. Additionally, we systematically classify different types of gapped boundaries, Cheshire qudits, and parafermionic twist defects for various Abelian and non-Abelian candidate FQSH orders that are consistent with the transport data, and describe experimental signatures to distinguish these orders.</description>

      <title>Theory of quasiparticle interference in Kitaev quantum spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quasiparticle interference (QPI) in the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL) for electrons tunneling into the QSL. The local tunneling conductance around a spin vacancy or localized vison reveals unique features associated with fractionalized Majorana fermions, chargons, and visons. In certain parameter regimes, the single-spinon density of states and momentum dispersion can both be directly extracted from the tunneling conductance. Our results suggest that QPI is a promising tool for identifying the Kitaev QSL and its fractionalized excitations.</description>

      <title>Stability of correlated insulating states in molecular conductors from first-principles calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic properties of molecular conductors exhibiting antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin order and charge order (CO) owing to electron correlation are studied using first-principles density functional theory calculations. We investigate two systems, a quasi-two-dimensional Mott insulator $\beta^\prime$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$ICl$_{2}$ with an AFM ground state, and several members of quasi-one-dimensional (TMTTF)$_2$$X$ showing CO. The stabilities of the AFM and CO states are compared between the use of a standard exchange-correlation functional based on the generalized gradient approximation and that of a range-separated hybrid functional; we find that the latter describes these states better. For $\beta^\prime$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$ICl$_{2}$, the AFM order is much stabilized with a wider band gap. For (TMTTF)$_2$$X$, only by using the hybrid functional, the AFM insulating state is realized and the CO states coexisting with AFM order are stable under structural optimization, whose stability among different \textit{X} shows the tendency consistent with experiments.</description>

      <title>Topologically nontrivial $1/3$-magnetization plateau state in a spin-1/2 trimer chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically nontrivial Haldane phase is theoretically proposed to be realized in the 1/3-magnetization ($M$) plateau of spin-1/2 trimer systems. However, the spin excitation gap, typical characteristic of Haldane phase, is not yet experimentally verified. Here, we report the nuclear magnetic resonance investigations into the low-energy spin dynamics in the $S=1/2$ spin-trimer antiferromagnetic chain compound Na$_2$Cu$_3$Ge$_{4-x}$Si$_{x}$O$_{12}$ ($x=0, 0.1\sim1.5$). In the parent compound ($x=0$), the spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/$T_1$) shows significantly different temperature dependence when the external magnetic field is increased above the critical field of $\mu_0$$H_{c}$ = 29 T. The spin excitation gap is evidenced from the thermally activated behavior of $1/T_1(T)$ in the 1/3-$M$ plateau state. By substituting Ge$^{4+}$ with Si$^{4+}$, the critical field for the 1/3-$M$ plateau significantly decreases, e.g. $\mu_0H_{c}=17$ T in $x=1.0$ samples, which results from the suppressed inter-trimer coupling $J_2$. The gapped spin excitation is confirmed again above 17 T, whose size shows temperature-dependent behavior for $\mu_0H\geq25.72$ T. These observations provide further insights into the Haldane physics.</description>

      <title>Triplons, triplon pairs and dynamical symmetries in laser-driven Shastry-Sutherland magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In frustrated magnets, a variety of novel phenomena arise due to their peculiar magnetic states, whose excitations usually reside in the GHz to THz range. Intense THz lasers, therefore, lead to examining nonlinear optical effects in such magnets. Employing an unbiased numerical method, we calculate the laser-pulse driven harmonic spectra of the Shastry-Sutherland magnets, which is well known as the model of a quantum frustrated magnet~\ce{SrCu2(BO3)2}. As a result, nonlinear responses of triplons and a two-triplon bound state are observed through the Zeeman or magnetoelectric couplings between the laser and the electron spin. Furthermore, we find that one can obtain information on magnetic anisotropy and symmetry from the spectra by manipulating external fields or two-color lasers. Our results indicate that laser-driven harmonic spectra are useful as a probe of less-detectable quantum many-body states in frustrated magnets.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum critical points in fermionic systems with spin-charge separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points are exotic transition points not predicted by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson symmetry-breaking paradigm. They are associated to a one-point gap closing between distinct locally ordered phases, thus to a continuous phase transition. Because of this intrinsic criticality, at deconfined quantum critical points algebraic decay of all the correlation functions is expected. Here, we show that it is possible to go beyond this assumption. Specifically, we consider one dimensional interacting fermions where the phenomenon of spin-charge separation arises. We first explore the low energy regimes where a sine-Gordon Hamiltonian can provide accurate results. By means of a field theory approach we find that continuous phase transitions between different locally ordered phases can occur. As a consequence of the decoupled spin and charge degrees of freedom, we find that in two cases only one gap vanishes while the other remains finite. We then derive a microscopic model where such phase transitions take place. By performing a numerical analysis, we unambiguously find that deconfined quantum critical points can indeed be further characterized by the long-range order of a parity operator signaling the presence of a finite gap. Our results provide new interesting insights on the widely investigated topic of quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Unifying principle for Hall coefficient in systems near magnetic instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typically, Hall coefficient of materials near magnetic instabilities exhibits pronounced temperature dependence. To explore the reasons involved, we studied the temperature dependence of Hall coefficient in $Cr_{1-x}V_x$, $V_{2-y}O_3$ and some high-$T_c$ superconducting cuprates. We argue that it can be rationalized using the following unifying principle:\textit{ When a system is near a magnetic instability and temperature is reduced towards the instability, there is a progressive "loss" of carriers (progressive "tying down" of electrons) as they participate in long-lived and long-ranged magnetic correlations.} In other words, magnetic correlations grow in space and are longer-lived as temperature is reduced towards the magnetic instability. This is the mechanism behind reduced carrier density with reducing temperature and leads to an enhancement of the Hall coefficient. This unifying principle is implemented and quantitative analysis is done using the Gor'kov Teitel'baum Thermal Activation (GTTA) model. We also show that the Hall angle data can be understood using one relaxation time (in contrast to the "two-relaxation" times idea of Anderson) by taking into consideration of temperature dependence of carrier density. This unifying principle is shown to be working in above studied systems, but authors believe that it is of much more general validity.</description>

      <title>Muon spectroscopy investigation of anomalous dynamic magnetism in NiI$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of muon-spin relaxation ($\mu^{+}$SR) measurements of the van der Waals magnet NiI$_2$, which probe magnetic phase transitions at $T_{\mathrm{N1}}=73$K and $T_{\mathrm{N2}}=60$K. Supporting density functional theory (DFT) calculations allow the determination of a single muon stopping site whose magnetic environment is consistent with the proposed ground-state magnetic structure. $\mu^{+}$SR measurements of the dynamics reveal behavior consistent with spin-wave excitations below $T_{\mathrm{N2}}$, with an additional contribution from a nonmagnetic component of the material. In the region $T_{\mathrm{N1}}&lt;T&lt;T_{\mathrm{N2}}$ the system is magnetically ordered throughout the bulk, but the character of the dynamics changes qualitatively, resulting in an unusual region of temperature-independent fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Gapped Low Energy Excitations Across an Entanglement Percolation Transition in the Quantum Spin Liquid Candidate NaYbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of quantum magnetism in frustrated triangular lattices has promised the discovery of exotic excitations emerging from many-body entanglement, like the quantum spin liquid. This field is vexed by the interplay of disorder, correlations and long-range order, whose properties are challenging to control and disentangle. We study the entropy-carrying excitations of a leading candidate in this search, the material NaYbSe$_2$, as a function of site dilution to directly address this challenge. We map the evolution of the entangled spins across the percolation transition, showing unequivocal evidence for the presence of an energy gap in the excitations of the system. However, we also show that this gap onsets at the percolation transition where disorder is the greatest, strongly suggesting that it is unlikely be associated with a quantum spin liquid. Instead we suggest the more universal scenario of a short-range ordered state with entropy-carrying boundaries.</description>

      <title>Flat and tunable moire phonons in twisted transition-metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Displacement fields are one of the main tuning knobs employed to engineer flat electronic band dispersions in twisted van der Waals multilayers. Here, we show that electric fields can also be used to tune the phonon dispersion of moir\'e superlattices formed by non-centrosymmetric materials, focusing on twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers. This effect arises from the intertwining between the local stacking configuration and the formation of polar domains within the moir\'e supercell. For small twist angles, increasing the electric field leads to a universal moir\'e phonon spectrum characterized by a substantially softened longitudinal acoustic phason mode and a flat optical phonon mode, both of which cause a significant enhancement in the vibrational density of states. The phasons also acquire a prominent chiral character, displaying a nonzero angular momentum spread across the Brillouin zone. We discuss how the tunability of the moir\'e phonon spectra may affect electronic properties, focusing on the recently discovered phenomenon of van der Waals ferroelectricity.</description>

      <title>Meson Mass Sets Onset Time of Anomalous Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have been established as a rigorous framework for investigating far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body criticality. Although initially thought to be trivially connected to an order parameter flipping sign, a certain kind of \textit{anomalous} DQPTs have been discovered that exhibit no direct connection to the order parameter and have been shown to arise in the presence of confinement. Here, we show in two paradigmatic models how the onset time of anomalous DQPTs is directly connected, through a power law, to the meson mass in the confined regime of a global symmetry-broken phase. This relation becomes more prominent the closer the initial parameters are to the equilibrium quantum critical point, where a relativistic quantum field theory emerges. Our findings draw a direct connection between mesons and anomalous DQPTs, highlighting the power of the latter to classify exotic far-from-equilibrium criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the effective internal entropy of quasiparticles within the non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall effect manifests in the heat current through a tunneling barrier. We derive the electric current and heat current resulting from voltage and heat biases of the junction, taking into account the quasiparticles' internal entropy. We find that when the tunneling processes are dominated by quasiparticle tunneling of one type of charge, the effective internal entropy can be inferred from the measurement of the heat current and the charge current. Our methods may be used to conclusively identify non-Abelian quasiparticles, such as the anyons that emerge in the $\nu = 5/2$ fractional quantum Hall state.</description>

      <title>Ballistic Modes as a Source of Anomalous Charge Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steady-state currents generically occur both in systems with continuous translation invariance and in nonequilibrium settings with particle drift. In either case, thermal fluctuations advected by the current act as a source of noise for slower hydrodynamic modes. This noise is unconventional, since it is highly correlated along spacetime rays. We argue that, in quasi-one-dimensional geometries, the correlated noise from ballistic modes generically gives rise to anomalous full counting statistics (FCS) for diffusively spreading charges. We present numerical evidence for anomalous FCS in two settings: (1) a two-component continuum fluid, and (2) the totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) initialized in a nonequilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence by magnetic fluctuations in a candidate axion insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In magnetic topological insulators, spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking by intrinsic magnetic order can open an energy gap in the topological surface spectrum. In the resulting state, exotic properties like axion electrodynamics, the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and other topological magnetoelectric responses are expected to emerge. A detailed understanding of the magnetic order and its coupling to the topological surface states is essential to harness and tune these properties. Here, we leverage near-resonant electric quadrupole optical second harmonic generation to probe magnetic fluctuations in the candidate axion insulator EuSn$_2$(As,P)$_2$ across its antiferromagnetic phase boundary. We observe a pronounced dimensional crossover in the quantum decoherence induced by magnetic fluctuations, where two-dimensional in-plane ferromagnetic correlations at high temperatures give way to three-dimensional long-range order at the N\'eel temperature. We also observe the breaking of rotational symmetry within the long-range-ordered antiferromagnetic state and map out the resulting spatial domain structure. More generally, we demonstrate the unique capabilities of nonlinear optical spectroscopy to study quantum coherence and fluctuations in magnetic quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Diffusive dynamics of fractionalized particles and the enhanced conductivity at the border of the neutral-ionic transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the diffusive dynamics of the classical one-dimensional lattice model of mobile particles featuring the incoherent metallic state of the organic TTF-CA found in the vicinity of the neutral-ionic(NI)-transition. The particles are strongly correlated and feel the alternating site potentials, exhibiting uniform ionic (I) Mott insulating and neutral band insulating (N) phases when the Coulomb interaction and site potentials are large, respectively. We focus on the neutral-ionic domain walls (NIDW) activated by their competition, which is typically regarded as fractionalized particles. The finite temperature phase diagram reveals a thermodynamically stable NIDW phase not found in previous literature that emerges at the triple point, where the transition line splits into two first-order lines toward the critical endpoints. We analyze the long-time behavior of dynamics of the NIDWs and find that it captures the incoherent transport of the system. The conductivity derived from the diffusion constant and the number population of NIDWs shows a strong enhancement inside the NIDW phase, which can explain the large conductivity at the NI crossover recently found in TTF-CA.</description>

      <title>On Krylov Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Thesis explores the notion of Krylov complexity as a probe of quantum chaos and as a candidate for holographic complexity. The first Part is devoted to presenting the fundamental notions required to conduct research in this area. Namely, an extensive introduction to the Lanczos algorithm, its properties and associated algebraic structures, as well as technical details related to its practical implementation, is given. Subsequently, an overview of the seminal references and the main debates regarding Krylov complexity and its relation to chaos and holography is provided. The text throughout this first Part combines review material with original analyses which either intend to contextualize, compare and criticize results in the literature, or are the fruit of the investigations leading to the publications on which this Thesis is based. These research projects are the subject of the second Part of the manuscript. In them, methods for the efficient implementation of the Lanczos algorithm in finite many-body systems were developed, allowing to compute numerically the Krylov complexity of models like SYK or the XXZ spin chain up to time scales exponentially large in system size. It was observed that the operator Krylov complexity profile in SYK, a paradigmatic low-dimensional chaotic system with a holographic dual, agrees with holographic expectations, while in the case of integrable models like XXZ complexity is affected by a novel localization effect in the so-called Krylov space which hinders its growth. Finally, an exact, analytical, correspondence between the Krylov complexity of the infinite-temperature thermofield double state in the low-energy regime of the double-scaled SYK model and bulk length in the theory of JT gravity is established.</description>

      <title>Quantum Convolutional Neural Network for Phase Recognition in Two Dimensions</title>

Abstract: Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) are quantum circuits for recognizing quantum phases of matter at low sampling cost and have been designed for condensed matter systems in one dimension. Here we construct a QCNN that can perform phase recognition in two dimensions and correctly identify the phase transition from a Toric Code phase with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-topological order to the paramagnetic phase. The network also exhibits a noise threshold up to which the topological order is recognized. Our work generalizes phase recognition with QCNNs to higher spatial dimensions and intrinsic topological order, where exploration and characterization via classical numerics become challenging.</description>

      <title>Quantum subspace expansion approach for simulating dynamical response functions of Kitaev spin liquids</title>

Abstract: We develop a quantum simulation-based approach for studying properties of strongly correlated magnetic materials at increasing scale. We consider a paradigmatic example of a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state hosted by the honeycomb Kitaev model, and use a trainable symmetry-guided ansatz for preparing its ground state. Applying the tools of quantum subspace expansion (QSE), Hamiltonian operator approximation, and overlap measurements, we simulate the QSL at zero temperature and finite magnetic field, thus moving outside of the symmetric subspace. Next, we implement a protocol for quantum subspace expansion-based measurement of spin-spin correlation functions. Finally, we perform QSE-based simulation of the dynamical structure factor obtained from Green's functions of the finite field Kitaev model. Our results show that quantum simulators offer an insight to quasiparticle properties of strongly correlated magnets and can become a valuable tool for studying material science.</description>

      <title>Quantized circular dichroism on the edge of quantum Hall systems: The many-body Chern number as seen from the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Hall states are characterized by a topological invariant, the many-body Chern number, which determines the quantized value of the Hall conductivity. Interestingly, this topological property can also be accessed through a dissipative response, by subjecting the system to a circular drive and comparing excitation rates obtained for opposite orientations of the drive. This quantized circular dichroism assumes that only the bulk contributes to the response. Indeed, in a confined and isolated system, the edge contribution exactly cancels the bulk response. This work explores an important corollary of the latter observation: If properly isolated, the circular dichroic response stemming from the edge of a quantum Hall droplet must be quantized, thus providing an appealing way to probe the many-body Chern number. Importantly, we demonstrate that this quantized edge response is entirely captured by low-energy chiral edge modes, allowing for a universal description of this effect based on Wen's edge theory. Its low-energy nature implies that the quantized edge response can be distinguished from the bulk response in the frequency domain. We illustrate our findings using realistic models of integer and fractional Chern insulators, with different edge geometries, and propose detection schemes suitable for ultracold atoms. Edge dichroic responses emerge as a practical probe for strongly-correlated topological phases, accessible in cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Atomistic theory of moir\'e Hofstadter's butterfly in magic-angle graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present here a Hofstadter's butterfly spectrum for the magic angle twisted bilayer graphene obtained using an ab initio based multi-million atom tight-binding model. We incorporate a hexagonal boron nitride substrate and out-of-plane atomic relaxation. The effects of a magnetic field are introduced via the Peierls modification of the long-range tight-binding matrix elements and the Zeeman spin splitting effects. A nanoribbon geometry is studied, and the quantum size effects for the sample widths up to 1 $\mu$m are analyzed both for a large energy window and for the flatband around the Fermi level. For sufficiently wide ribbons, where the role of the finite geometry is minimized, we obtain and plot the Hofstadter spectrum and identify the in-gap Chern numbers by counting the total number of chiral edge states crossing these gaps. Subsequently, we examine the Wannier diagrams to identify the insulating states at charge neutrality. We establish the presence of three types of electronic states: moir\'e, mixed, and conventional. These states describe both the bulk Landau levels and the edge states crossing gaps in the spectrum. The evolution of the bulk moir\'e flatband wavefunctions in the magnetic field is investigated, predicting a decay of the electronic density from the moir\'e centers as the magnetic flux increases. Furthermore, the spatial properties of the three types of edge states are studied, illustrating the evolution of their localization as a function of the nanoribbon momentum.</description>

      <title>Optical and acoustic plasmons in the layered material Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use momentum-dependent electron energy-loss spectroscopy in transmission to study collective charge excitations in the layer metal Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. This metal has a transition from a perfect Fermi liquid below $T\approx30\,$K into a "strange" metal phase above $T\approx800\,$K. We cover a complete range between in-phase and out-of-phase oscillations. Outside the classical range of electron-hole excitations, leading to a Landau damping, we observe well-defined plasmons. The optical (acoustic) plasmon due to an in-phase (out-of-phase) charge oscillation of neighbouring layers exhibits a quadratic (linear) positive dispersion. Using a model for the Coulomb interaction of the charges in a layered system, it is possible to describe the range of optical plasmon excitations at high energies in a mean-field random phase approximation without taking correlation effects into account. In contrast, RIXS data show at low energies an enhancement of the acoustic plasmon velocity due to correlation effects. This difference can be explained by an energy dependent effective mass which changes from $\approx$ 4 at low energy to 1 at high energy near the optical plasmon energy. There are no signs of over-damped plasmons predicted by holographic theories.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall States and First Landau Level Physics in Second Moir\'e Band of Twisted Bilayer MoTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing the realistic continuum description of twisted bilayer MoTe2 and many-body exact diagonalization calculation, we establish that the second moir\'e band of twisted bilayer MoTe2, at a small twist angle of approximately 2{\deg}, serves as an optimal platform for achieving the long-sought non-Abelian fractional quantum anomalous Hall states without the need for external magnetic fields. Across a wide parameter range, our exact diagonalization calculations reveal that the half-filled second moir\'e band demonstrates the ground state degeneracy and spectral flows, which are consistent with the pfaffian state in the first Landau level. We further elucidate that the emergence of the non-Abelian state is deeply connected to the remarkable similarity between the second moir\'e band and the first Landau level. Essentially, the band not only exhibits characteristics akin to the first Landau level, $\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\mathrm{BZ}\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{k}\:\mathrm{tr}\:\eta(\mathbf{k}) \approx 3$ where $\eta_{ab}(\mathbf{k})$ is the Fubini-Study metric of the band, but also that its projected Coulomb interaction closely mirrors the Haldane pseudopotentials of the first Landau level. Motivated from this observation, we introduce a novel metric of "first Landau level"-ness of a band, which quantitatively measures the alignment of the projected Coulomb interaction with the Haldane pseudopotentials in Landau levels. This metric is then compared with the global phase diagram of the half-filled second moir\'e band, revealing its utility in predicting the parameter region of the non-Abelian state. In addition, we uncover that the first and third moir\'e bands closely resemble the lowest and second Landau levels, revealing a remarkable sequential equivalence between the moir\'e bands and Landau levels. We finally discuss the potential implications on experiments.</description>

Abstract: An exactly solvable strongly correlated electron model with two independent parameters is constructed in the frame of the quantum inverse scattering method, which can be seen as a generalization of the Bariev model. Through the Bethe ansatz method, a set of Bethe ansatz equations is derived. In the thermodynamic limit, to study the ground state of the model, we obtain the integral equations for the density of Bethe roots. Numerical validation are done to confirm the accuracy of our analytic results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-electron collisions lead to a T-square component in the electrical resistivity of Fermi liquids. The case of liquid $^3$He illustrates that the \textit{thermal} resitivity of a Fermi liquid has a T-square term, expressed in m$\cdot$W$^{-1}$. Its natural units are $\hbar/k_FE_F^2$. Here, we present a high-resolution study of the thermal conductivity in bismuth, employing magnetic field to extract the tiny electronic component of the total thermal conductivity and resolving signals as small as $\approx 60 \mu$K. We find that the electronic thermal resistivity follows a T-square temperature dependence with a prefactor twice larger than the electric T-square prefactor. Adding this information to what has been known for other semi-metals, we find that the prefactor of the T-square thermal resistivity scales with the square of the inverse of the Fermi temperature, implying that the dimensionless fermion-fermion collision cross-section is roughly proportional to the Fermi wavelength, indicating that it is not simply set by the strength of the Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional honeycomb ferromagnets offer the unprecedented opportunity to study interactions between collective modes that in standard bulk ferromagnets do not cross paths. Indeed, they harbor an optical spin-wave branch, i.e. a spin wave which disperses weakly near the Brillouin zone center. When doped with free carriers, they also host the typical gapless plasmonic mode of 2D itinerant electron/hole systems. When the plasmon branch meets the optical spin-wave branch, energy and momentum matching occurs, paving the way for interactions between the charge and spin sector. In this Letter we present a microscopic theory of such plasmon-magnon interactions, which is based on a double random phase approximation. We comment on the possibility to unveil this physics in recently isolated 2D honeycomb magnets such as ${\rm Cr}_2{\rm Ge}_2{\rm Te}_6$.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of Anomalous Conductance Plateaus in Abelian Quantum Hall Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-terminal conductance quantization in the context of quantum Hall (QH) physics is intimately related to current carried by a discrete number of edge modes. Upon pinching off of a QH bar, one may reach regimes in which some modes which are fully transmitted (while the others are fully reflected), giving rise to quantized conductance plateaus. Here we study an alternative protocol for quantized values of the conductance, which relies on inter-mode equilibration. Concretely this is the result of considering different inequalities between charge equilibration and thermal equilibration lengths on one hand and geometrical lengths on the other hand, and accounting for the possibility of edge reconstruction. Taking the 2/3 state as a prototypical example, we obtain a host of scenarios leading to conductance plateaus at $e^2/3h$ (observed previously), $e^2/2h$ (recently observed), and $5e^2/9h$ (our prediction). Our approach facilitates distinguishing among various scenarios based on dc current auto- and cross-correlation (shot noise).</description>

      <title>Measuring Trotter error and its application to precision-guaranteed Hamiltonian simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trotterization is the most common and convenient approximation method for Hamiltonian simulations on digital quantum computers, but estimating its error accurately is computationally difficult for large quantum systems. Here, we develop a method for measuring the Trotter error without ancillary qubits on quantum circuits by combining the $m$th- and $n$th-order ($m&lt;n$) Trotterizations rather than consulting with mathematical error bounds. Using this method, we make Trotterization precision-guaranteed, developing an algorithm named Trotter$(m,n)$, in which the Trotter error at each time step is within an error tolerance $\epsilon$ preset for our purpose. Trotter$(m,n)$ is applicable to both time- independent and dependent Hamiltonians, and it adaptively chooses almost the largest stepsize $\mathrm{d}t$, which keeps quantum circuits shallowest within the error tolerance. Benchmarking it in a quantum spin chain, we find the adaptively chosen $\mathrm{d}t$ to be about ten times larger than that inferred from known upper bounds of Trotter errors.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Mixed Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry in mixed quantum states can manifest in two distinct forms: \textit{strong symmetry}, where each individual pure state in the quantum ensemble is symmetric with the same charge, and \textit{weak symmetry}, which applies only to the entire ensemble. This paper explores a novel type of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) where a strong symmetry is broken to a weak one. While the SSB of a weak symmetry is measured by the long-ranged two-point correlation function $\mathrm{Tr}(O_xO^{\dagger}_y\rho)$, the strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) is measured by the fidelity $F(\rho, O_xO^{\dagger}_y\rho O_yO^{\dagger}_x)$, dubbed the \textit{fidelity correlator}. We prove that SW-SSB is a universal property of mixed-state quantum phases, in the sense that the phenomenon of SW-SSB is robust against symmetric low-depth local quantum channels. { We also show that the symmetry breaking is "spontaneous
" in the sense that the effect of a local symmetry-breaking measurement cannot be recovered locally.} We argue that a thermal state at a nonzero temperature in the canonical ensemble (with fixed symmetry charge) should have spontaneously broken strong symmetry. Additionally, we study non-thermal scenarios where decoherence induces SW-SSB, leading to phase transitions described by classical statistical models with bond randomness. In particular, the SW-SSB transition of a decohered Ising model can be viewed as the "ungauged" version of the celebrated toric code decodability transition. We confirm that, in the decohered Ising model, the SW-SSB transition defined by the fidelity correlator is the only physical transition in terms of channel recoverability. We also comment on other (inequivalent) definitions of SW-SSB, through correlation functions with higher R\'enyi indices.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>

Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and delve into a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We also show that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model. We also introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>Learning tensor networks with tensor cross interpolation: new algorithms and libraries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm is a rank-revealing algorithm for decomposing low-rank, high-dimensional tensors into tensor trains/matrix product states (MPS). TCI learns a compact MPS representation of the entire object from a tiny training data set. Once obtained, the large existing MPS toolbox provides exponentially fast algorithms for performing a large set of operations. We discuss several improvements and variants of TCI. In particular, we show that replacing the cross interpolation by the partially rank-revealing LU decomposition yields a more stable and more flexible algorithm than the original algorithm. We also present two open source libraries, xfac in Python/C++ and TensorCrossInterpolation.jl in Julia, that implement these improved algorithms, and illustrate them on several applications. These include sign-problem-free integration in large dimension, the superhigh-resolution quantics representation of functions, the solution of partial differential equations, the superfast Fourier transform, the computation of partition functions, and the construction of matrix product operators.</description>
