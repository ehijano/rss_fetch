      <title>Three-dimensional quantum Hall states as a chiral electromagnetic filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive research has explored the optical properties of topological insulating materials, driven by their inherent stability and potential applications. In this study, we unveil a novel functionality of three-dimensional integer quantum Hall (3D IQH) states as broad-band filters for circularly polarized light, particularly effective in the terahertz (THz) frequency range under realistic system parameters. We also investigate the impact of practical imperfections, demonstrating the resilience of this filtering effect. Our findings reveal that this phenomenon is independent of the microscopic origin of the 3D IQH state, prompting discussions on its feasibility across diverse candidate materials. These results contribute to our understanding of fundamental optical properties and hold promise for practical applications in optical technologies.</description>

      <title>Room temperature magnetic skyrmions in gradient-composition engineered CoPt single layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically protected magnetic skyrmions in magnetic materials are stabilized by interfacial or bulk Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Interfacial DMI decays with increase of the magnetic layer thickness in just a few nanometers and bulk DMI only stabilizes magnetic skyrmions at low temperatures. Consequently, more flexibility in manipulation of DMI is required for utilizing nanoscale skyrmions in energy efficient memory and logic devices at room temperature (RT). Here, we demonstrate the observation of RT skyrmions stabilized by gradient DMI (g-DMI) in composition gradient engineered CoPt single layer films by employing topological Hall effect, magnetic force microscopy, and nitrogen vacancy scanning magnetometry. Skyrmions remain stable at a wide range of applied magnetic fields and are confirmed to be Bloch-type from micromagnetic simulation and analytical magnetization reconstruction. Furthermore, we observe skyrmion pairs which may be explained by skyrmion-antiskyrmion interactions. Our findings expand the family of magnetic materials hosting RT magnetic skyrmions by tuning g-DMI via gradient polarity and choice of magnetic elements.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric and viscous contributions to the hydrodynamic ratchet effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study thermoelectric and viscous contributions to the ratchet effect, i.e. radiation-induced generation of the direct electric current, $J_{\rm rat},$ in asymmetric dual-grating gate structure without inversion center. Previously [E.M\"onch et al, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 105}, 045404 (2022)], it was demonstrated that frequency dependence of the $J_{\rm rat}$ is essentially different within hydrodynamic (HD) and drift-diffusion (DD) regimes of the electron transport: $ J_{\rm rat}^{\rm HD} \propto 1/\omega^6 $ and $ J_{\rm rat}^{\rm DD} \propto 1/\omega^2 $ for $\omega \to \infty.$ Here we analyze previously neglected thermoelectric contribution and find that it yields high-frequency asymptotic $1/\omega^2$ even in the HD regime and can change sign of the response. Account of the finite viscosity of the electron liquid yields contribution which scales at high frequency as $1/\omega^4.$ We also find plasmonic resonances in the $J_{\rm rat},$ and demonstrate that asymmetry of the structure allows for excitation of the so-called directional travelling plasmons.</description>

      <title>Optical Properties of Gated Bilayer Graphene Quantum Dots with Trigonal Warping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the optical properties of gated bilayer graphene quantum dots with trigonal warping (TW) of single-particle energy spectra. The lateral structure of metallic gates confines electrons and holes in a quantum dot (QD) electrostatically. The gated bilayer graphene energy spectrum is characterized by two K-valleys surrounded by three minivalleys with energies depending on the applied vertical electric field. Employing an atomistic tight-binding model, we compute the single-particle QD states and analyze the influence of TW on the energy spectrum as the lateral confining potential depth varies. We find a regime where the QD levels are dominated by the presence of three minivalleys around each K-valley. Next, we compute dipole matrix elements and analyze the oscillator strengths and optical selection rules for optical valence to conduction band transitions. We then include electron-electron interactions by first computing the microscopic Coulomb matrix elements, electron self-energy, and solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation to obtain the excitonic spectrum. Finally, we obtain the absorption spectrum for a shallow confining potential depth, which further amplifies the effects of TW on the optical properties. Our results predict the existence of two degenerate bright exciton states, each built of the three minivalley states that do not exist in the deep confinement regime, where the effects of TW are negligible.</description>

      <title>The effect of temperature oscillations on energy storage rectification in harmonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rectification, the preferential transport of a current in one direction through a system, has garnered significant attention in molecules because of its importance for controlling thermal and electronic currents at the nanoscale. Here, we report the presence of energy storage rectification effects in a molecular chain. This phenomenon is generated by subjecting a harmonic molecular chain to an oscillating temperature gradient and showing that the energy absorption rate of the system depends on the direction of the gradient. We examine how the energy storage rectification ratios in the chain are affected by the oscillating gradient, asymmetry in the chain, and the system parameters. We find that energy storage rectification can be observed in harmonic lattice structures with time-dependent temperatures and that, correspondingly, anharmonicity is not required to generate this rectification mechanism in such systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Topology in Hermitian Topological Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity leads to distinctive topological phenomena absent in Hermitian systems. However, connection between such intrinsic non-Hermitian topology and Hermitian topology has remained largely elusive. Here, considering the bulk and boundary as an environment and system, we demonstrate that anomalous boundary states in Hermitian topological insulators exhibit non-Hermitian topology. We study the self-energy capturing the particle exchange between the bulk and boundary, and demonstrate that it detects Hermitian topology in the bulk and induces non-Hermitian topology at the boundary. As an illustrative example, we show the non-Hermitian topology and concomitant skin effect inherently embedded within chiral edge states of Chern insulators. We also find the emergence of hinge states within effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians at surfaces of three-dimensional topological insulators. Furthermore, we comprehensively classify our correspondence across all the tenfold symmetry classes of topological insulators and superconductors. Our work uncovers a hidden connection between Hermitian and non-Hermitian topology, and provides an approach to identifying non-Hermitian topology in quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Mechanism for the Broadened Linewidth in Antiferromagnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linewidth of antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) is found to be significantly broader than that of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), even when the intrinsic Gilbert damping parameter is the same for both systems. We investigate the origin of this enhanced damping rate in AFMR by studying a bipartite magnet model. Through analytical calculations and numerical simulations, we present three perspectives on understanding this linewidth broadening in AFMR: i) The non-dissipative Heisenberg exchange interaction develops a damping-like component in the presence of Gilbert damping, ii) The transverse component of the exchange coupling reduces the AFMR frequency, thereby increasing the damping rate, and iii) The antiferromagnetic eigenmode exhibits characteristics of a two-mode squeezed state, which is inherently linked to an enhanced damping rate. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics governing magnetic dissipation in antiferromagnet and offer insights into the experimentally observed broadened linewidths in AFMR spectra.</description>

      <title>An extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with time-reversal symmetry protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we theoretically study a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model in which each unit cell consists of three sites. Unlike existing extensions of the SSH model which are made by enlarging the periodicity of the (nearest-neighbor) hopping amplitudes, our modification is obtained by replacing the Pauli matrices in the system's Hamiltonian by their higher dimensional counterparts. This in turn leads to the presence of next-nearest neighbor hopping terms and the emergence of different symmetries than those of other extended SSH models. Moreover, the system supports a number of edge states that are protected by the time-reversal symmetry rather than the usual chiral symmetry. Finally, our system could be potentially realized in various experimental platforms including superconducting circuits as well as acoustic/optical waveguide arrays.</description>

      <title>L\'evy flight for electrons in graphene in the presence of regions with enhanced spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an electronic L\'evy glass built from graphene nanoribbons in the presence of regions with enhanced spin-orbit coupling. Although electrons in graphene nanoribbons present a low spin-orbit coupling strength, it can be increased by a proximity effect with an appropriate substrate. We consider graphene nanoribbons with different edge types, which contain circular regions with a tunable Rashba spin-orbit coupling, whose diameter follow a power-law distribution. We find that spin-orbital clusters induce a transition from superdiffusive to diffusive charge transport, similar to what we recently reported for nanoribbons with electrostatic clusters [Phys. Rev. B. 107, 155432 (2023)]. We also investigate spin polarization in the spin-orbital L\'evy glasses, and show that a finite spin polarization can be found only in the superdiffusive regime. In contrast, the spin polarization vanishes in the diffusive regime, making the electronic L\'evy glass a useful device whose electronic transmission and spin polarization can be controlled by its Fermi energy. Finally, we apply a multifractal analysis to charge transmission and spin polarization, and find that the transmission time series in the superdiffusive regime are multifractal, while they tend to be monofractal in the diffusive regime. In contrast, spin polarization time series are multifractal in both regimes, characterizing a marked difference between mesoscopic fluctuations of charge transport and spin polarization in the proposed electronic L\'evy glass.</description>

      <title>Emergence of moir\'e superlattice potential in graphene by twisted-hBN layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices formed in stacks of two or more 2D crystals with similar lattice structures have recently become excellent platforms to reveal new physics in low-dimensional systems. They are, however, highly sensitive to the angle and lattice constant differences between the associated crystals, limiting the range of the material choice and the possible moir\'e patterns for a given 2D crystal. Here, we present a novel approach to realize an atomically flat substrate with a periodic moir\'e pattern that can induce the moir\'e potential on the material on top by van der Waals (vdW) interactions, without suffering from the lattice and angle mismatch. By constructing a twisted hBN (thBN) moir\'e substrate at an angle of about 1$^\circ$, we show that the graphene on top, aligned around 15$^\circ$ with the neighboring hBN layers, exhibits typical transport properties under a hexagonal moir\'e potential, including multiple satellite Dirac points (DPs), Hofstadter butterfly effect, and Brown-Zak oscillations. All features point to the existence of the moir\'e potential in graphene formed by thBN with $\sim$1$^\circ$ twist angle. Further statistical study shows that the twist from a parallel interface between the hBN layers is critical to induce the moir\'e potential. Our study demonstrates that the thBN moir\'e substrate can be used to investigate moir\'e physics in arbitrary materials without being constrained by their lattice constants.</description>

      <title>Direct magnetic imaging of fractional Chern insulators in twisted MoTe$_2$ with a superconducting sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the absence of time reversal symmetry, orbital magnetization provides a sensitive probe of topology and interactions, with particularly rich phenomenology in Chern insulators where topological edge states carry large equilibrium currents. Here, we use a nanoscale superconducting sensor to map the magnetic fringe fields in twisted bilayers of MoTe$_2$, where transport and optical sensing experiments have revealed the formation of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states at zero magnetic field. At a temperature of 1.6K, we observe oscillations in the local magnetic field associated with fillings $\nu=-1,-2/3,-3/5,-4/7$ and $-5/9$ of the first moir\'e hole band, consistent with the formation of FCIs at these fillings. By quantitatively reconstructing the magnetization, we determine the local thermodynamic gaps of the most robust FCI state at $\nu=-2/3$, finding $^{-2/3}\Delta$ as large as 7 meV. Spatial mapping of the charge density- and displacement field-tuned magnetic phase diagram further allows us to characterize sample disorder, which we find to be dominated by both inhomogeneity in the effective unit cell area as well as inhomogeneity in the band edge offset and bound dipole moment. Our results highlight both the challenges posed by structural disorder in the study of twisted homobilayer moir\'e systems and the opportunities afforded by the remarkably robust nature of the underlying correlated topological states.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Edge Modes and Fragile Surface States of Symmetry Protected Integer Quantum Hall Effect of Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt the fluid description of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) states, as seen in (arXiv:2203.06516), to model a system of interacting two-component bosons. This system represents the simplest physical realization of an interacting bosonic Symmetry-Protected Topological (SPT) phase, also known as the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) of bosons. In particular, we demonstrate how the fluid dynamical boundary conditions of no-penetration and no-stress at a hard wall naturally give rise to the two counter-propagating boundary modes expected in these SPT phases. Moreover, we identify energy-conserving hydro boundary conditions that can either create a gap in these edge modes or completely isolate the edge states from the bulk, as described in (Physical Review X 14, 011057 (2024)), where they are termed fragile surface states. These fragile surface states are typically absent in K-matrix edge theories and require bulk dynamics to manifest. By leveraging insights from hydrodynamical boundary dynamics, we can further elucidate the intricate surface properties of SPTs beyond the usual topological quantum field theory based approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry and Stabilization of Fractional Chern Insulators Far from the Ideal Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of strong electronic interactions, a partially filled Chern band may stabilize a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) state, the zero-field analog of the fractional quantum Hall phase. While FCIs have long been hypothesized, feasible solid-state realizations only recently emerged, largely due to the rise of moir\'e materials. In these systems, the quantum geometry of the electronic bands plays a critical role in stabilizing the FCI in the presence of competing correlated phases. In the limit of ``ideal'' quantum geometry, where the quantum geometry is identical to that of Landau levels, this role is well understood. However, in more realistic scenarios only empiric numerical evidence exists, accentuating the need for a clear understanding of the mechanism by which the FCI deteriorates moving further away from these ideal conditions. We introduce and analyze an anisotropic model of a $\left|C \right|=1$ Chern insulator, whereupon partial filling of its bands, an FCI phase is stabilized over a certain parameter regime. We incorporate strong electronic interaction analytically by employing a coupled-wires approach, studying the FCI stability and its relation to the the quantum metric. We identify an unusual anti-FCI phase benefiting from non-ideal geometry, generically subdominant to the FCI. However, its presence hinders the formation of FCI in favor of other competitive phases at fractional fillings, such as the charge density wave. Though quite peculiar, this anti-FCI phase may have already been observed in experiments at high magnetic fields. This establish a direct link between quantum geometry and FCI stability in a tractable model far from any ideal band conditions, and illuminates a unique mechanism of FCI deterioration.</description>

      <title>Sign-Alternating Thermoelectric Quantum Oscillations and Insulating Landau Levels in Monolayer WTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of Landau-level-like energy structures near the chemical potential of an insulator is essential to the search for a class of correlated electronic matter hosting charge-neutral fermions and Fermi surfaces, a long-proposed concept that remains elusive experimentally. Here we introduce and demonstrate that the magneto-thermoelectric response of a quantum insulator can reveal critical information not available via other approaches. We report large quantum oscillations (QOs) in the Seebeck response of the hole-doped insulating state of monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) in magnetic fields. The QOs remarkably undergo sign-changes as the field is swept, mimicking those in metals with Landau quantization. The sign-change in the thermoelectric response directly implies the presence of a field-induced Landau-level-like structure at the chemical potential of the insulator. Our results reinforce WTe2 as a platform for investigating insulating Landau levels and mobile neutral fermions in two-dimensional insulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In strongly correlated quantum materials, electrons behave in ways that often extend beyond the confines of conventional Fermi-liquid theory. Interesting results include the observation of low-temperature metallic behavior in systems that are highly resistive. Here we provide an overview of experiments in which insulators exhibit characteristics of a metal such as the Shubnikov de Haas like quantum oscillations, focusing on recent findings in the correlated insulating states of two-dimensional WTe2. We discuss the status of current research, clarify the debates and challenges in interpreting the experiments, rule out extrinsic explanations and discuss promising future directions.</description>

      <title>Interference between distinguishable photons</title>

Abstract: Two-photon interference (TPI) lies at the heart of photonic quantum technologies. TPI is generally regarded as quantum interference stemming from the indistinguishability of identical photons, hence a common intuition prevails that TPI would disappear if photons are distinguishable. Here we disprove this perspective and uncover the essence of TPI. We report the first demonstration of TPI between distinguishable photons with their frequency separation up to $10^4$ times larger than their linewidths. We perform time-resolved TPI between an independent laser and single photons with ultralong coherence time ($&gt;10\ \mu$s). We observe a maximum TPI visibility of $72\%\pm 2\%$ well above the $50\%$ classical limit indicating the quantum feature, and simultaneously a broad visibility background and a classical beat visibility of less than $50\%$ reflecting the classical feature. These visibilities are independent of the photon frequency separation and show no difference between distinguishable and indistinguishable photons. Based on a general wave superposition model, we derive the cross-correlation functions which fully reproduce and explain the experiments. Our results reveal that TPI as the fourth-order interference arises from the second-order interference of two photons within the mutual coherence time and TPI is not linked to the photon indistinguishability. This work provides new insights into the nature of TPI with great implications in both quantum optics and photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>CMOS-compatible Strain Engineering for High-Performance Monolayer Semiconductor Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strain engineering has played a key role in modern silicon electronics, having been introduced as a mobility booster in the 1990s and commercialized in the early 2000s. Achieving similar advances with two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors in a CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) compatible manner would radically improve the industrial viability of 2D transistors. Here, we show silicon nitride capping layers can impart strain to monolayer MoS2 transistors on conventional silicon substrates, enhancing their electrical performance with a low thermal budget (350 {\deg}C), CMOS-compatible approach. Strained back-gated and dual-gated MoS2 transistors demonstrate median increases up to 60% and 45% in on-state current, respectively. The greatest improvements are found when both transistor channels and contacts are reduced to ~200 nm, reaching saturation currents of 488 uA/um, higher than any previous reports at such short contact pitch. Simulations reveal that most benefits arise from tensile strain lowering the contact Schottky barriers, and that further reducing device dimensions (including contacts) will continue to offer increased strain and performance improvements.</description>

      <title>3D-2D crossover and phase shift of beats of quantum oscillations of interlayer magnetoresistance in quasi-2D metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic quantum oscillations (MQO) are traditionally applied to investigate the electronic structure of metals. In layered quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) materials the MQO have several qualitative features giving additional useful information, provided their theoretical description is developed. Within the framework of the Kubo formula and the self-consistent Born approximation, we reconsider the phase of beats in the amplitude of Shubnikov oscillations of interlayer conductivity in Q2D metals. We show that the phase shift of beats of the Shubnikov (conductivity) oscillations relative to the de Haas - van Alphen (magnetization) oscillations is larger than expected previously and, under certain conditions, can reach the value of $\pi/2$, as observed experimentally. We explain the phase inversion of MQO during the 3D - 2D crossover and predict the decrease of relative MQO amplitude of interlayer magnetoresistance in a strong magnetic field, larger than the beat frequency.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and Kibble-Zurek scaling in the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Stark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore quantum criticality and Kibble-Zurek scaling (KZS) in the Aubry-Andre-Stark (AAS) model, where the Stark field of strength $\varepsilon$ is added onto the one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice. We perform scaling analysis and numerical calculations of the localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy gap between the ground and first excited states to characterize critical properties of the delocalization-localization transition. Remarkably, our scaling analysis shows that, near the critical point, the localization length $\xi$ scales with $\varepsilon$ as $\xi\propto\varepsilon^{-\nu}$ with $\nu\approx0.3$ a new critical exponent for the AAS model, which is different from the counterparts for both the pure Aubry-Andre (AA) model and Stark model. The IPR $\mathcal{I}$ scales as $\mathcal{I}\propto\varepsilon^{s}$ with the critical exponent $s\approx0.098$, which is also different from both two pure models. The energy gap $\Delta E$ scales as $\Delta E\propto \varepsilon^{\nu z}$ with the same critical exponent $z\approx2.374$ as that for the pure AA model. We further reveal hybrid scaling functions in the overlap between the critical regions of the Anderson and Stark localizations. Moreover, we investigate the driven dynamics of the localization transitions in the AAS model. By linearly changing the Stark (quasiperiodic) potential, we calculate the evolution of the localization length and the IPR, and study their dependence on the driving rate. We find that the driven dynamics from the ground state is well described by the KZS with the critical exponents obtained from the static scaling analysis. When both the Stark and quasiperiodic potentials are relevant, the KZS form includes the two scaling variables. This work extends our understanding of critical phenomena on localization transitions and generalizes the application of the KZS to hybrid models.</description>

      <title>Gauge theory of giant phonon magnetic moment in doped Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum theory for phonon magnetic moment in doped Dirac semimetals. Our theory is based on an emergent gauge field approach to the electron-phonon coupling, applicable for both gapless and gapped systems. We find that the magnetic moment is directly proportional to the electrical Hall conductivity through the phonon Hall viscosity. Our theory is combined with the first-principles calculations, allowing us to quantitatively implement it to realistic materials. Magnetic moments are found to be on the order of Bohr magneton for certain phonon modes in graphene and $\text{Cd}_3 \text{As}_2$. Our results provide practical guidance for the dynamic generation of large magnetization in the topological quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: Stoner magnetism in bands endowed with Berry curvature is shown to be profoundly influenced by the coupling between spin chirality density $\vec s\cdot(\partial_x\vec s\times\partial_y\vec s)$ and Berry's orbital magnetization. The key effect is that carriers moving in the presence of a spin texture see it as a source of a geometric magnetic field coupled to the carrier's orbital motion through a spin-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect. This emergent spin-orbit interaction effect was recently predicted to enable chiral magnons propagating along system boundaries. Here we show that it also favors chiral spin textures such as skyrmions -- the topologically protected objects with particle-like properties, stabilized in the ground state. The threshold for Stoner instability is found to soften, rendering chiral spin-ordered phases accessible under realistic conditions. We present a detailed analysis of the chiral effect for Bernal bilayer graphene and discuss the unique properties of skyrmion textures in graphene multilayers.</description>

Abstract: Topological quantum matter exhibits novel transport phenomena driven by entanglement between internal degrees of freedom, as for instance generated by spin-orbit coupling effects. Here we report on a direct connection between the mechanism driving spin relaxation and the intertwined dynamics between spin and sublattice degrees of freedom in disordered graphene. Beyond having a direct observable consequence, such intraparticle entanglement is shown to be resilient to disorder, pointing towards a novel resource for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>New three-dimensional dispersion in the type-II Dirac semimetals PtTe$_2$ and PdTe$_2$ revealed through Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PtTe$_2$ and PdTe$_2$ are among the first transition metal dichalcogenides that were predicted to host type-II Dirac fermions, exotic particles prohibited in free space. These materials are layered and air-stable, which makes them top candidates for technological applications that take advantage of their anisotropic magnetotransport properties. Here, we provide a detailed characterization of the electronic structure of PtTe$_2$ and PdTe$_2$ using Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, unveiling a new three-dimensional dispersion in these materials. Through the use of circularly polarized light, we report a different behavior of such dispersion in PdTe$_2$ compared to PtTe$_2$, that we relate to a symmetry analysis of the dipole matrix element. Such analysis reveals a link between the observed circular dichroism and the different momentum-dependent terms in the dispersion of these two compounds, despite their close similarity in crystal structure. Additionally, our data shows a clear difference in the circular dichroic signal for the type-II Dirac cones characteristic of these materials, compared to their topologically protected surface states. Our work provides a useful reference for the ARPES characterization of other transition metal dichalcogenides with topological properties and illustrates the use of circular dichroism as a guide to identify the topological character of two otherwise equivalent band dispersions, and to recognize different attributes in the band structure of similar materials.</description>

Abstract: One of the fundamental facts of condensed matter physics is that sufficient amount of disorder always turns a Fermi liquid metal into an Anderson insulator: a compressible, but non-conducting phase of matter. Recently, topological semimetals have emerged as another way a metallic phase may be realized. In this paper we point out that, unlike ordinary metals, at least some topological semimetals are immune to localization, provided certain conditions are satisfied. We present several physical arguments, based on diagrammatic perturbation theory and Keldysh field theory, as well as domain wall network construction, to back up this claim.</description>

      <title>Universal spectral moment theorem and its applications in non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high sensitivity of the spectrum and wavefunctions to boundary conditions, termed the non-Hermitian skin effect, represents a fundamental aspect of non-Hermitian systems. While it endows non-Hermitian systems with unprecedented physical properties, it presents notable obstacles in grasping universal properties that are robust against microscopic details and boundary conditions. In this Letter, we introduce a pivotal theorem: in the thermodynamic limit, for any non-Hermitian systems with finite-range interactions, all spectral moments are invariant quantities, independent of boundary conditions, posing strong constraints on the spectrum. Utilizing this invariance, we propose a new criterion for bulk dynamical phases based on experimentally observable features and applicable to any dimensions and any boundary conditions. Based on this criterion, we define the bulk dispersive-to-proliferative phase transition, which is distinct from the real-to-complex spectral transition and contrary to traditional expectations. We verify these findings in 1D and 2D lattice models.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion lattice in centrosymmetric magnets with local Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.12850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is common for the local inversion symmetry to break in crystals, even though the whole crystal has global inversion symmetry. This local inversion symmetry breaking allows for a local Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI) in magnetic crystals. Here we show that the local DMI can stabilize a skyrmion as a metastable excitation or as a skyrmion crystal in equilibrium. We consider the crystal structure with layered structure as an example, where local inversion is violated in each layer but a global inversion center exists in the middle of the two layers. These skyrmions come in pairs that are related by inversion symmetry. The two skyrmions with opposite helicity in a pair form a bound state. We study the properties of a skyrmion pair in the ferromagnetic background and determine the equilibrium phase diagram, where a robust lattice of skyrmion pairs is stabilized. Our results point to a new direction to search for the skyrmion lattice in centrosymmetric magnets.</description>

Abstract: In scenarios where electrons are confined to a flat surface, such as graphene, quantizing electrodynamics reveals intriguing insights. We find that one of Maxwell's equations manifests as part of the Hamiltonian, leading to novel constraints on physical states due to residual gauge invariance. We identify two quantum states with zero energy expectation values: one replicates the scattering and absorption of light, a phenomenon familiar in classical optics, while the other is more fundamentally associated with photon creation. These states form an inseparable two-state system, giving a new formula for reflection and transmission coefficients with photon emission effects. Notably, there exists a special thickness of the surface where these states decouple, offering intriguing possibilities for exploring physics through symmetry-based perturbations involving concepts of parity, axial gauge fields, and surface deformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indium selenide, In2Se3, has recently attracted growing interest due to its novel properties, including room temperature ferroelectricity, outstanding photoresponsivity, and exotic in-plane ferroelectricity, which open up new regimes for next generation electronics. In2Se3 also provides the important advantage of tuning the electrical properties of ultra-thin layers with an external electrical and magnetic field, making it a potential platform to study novel two-dimensional physics. Yet, In2Se3 has many different polymorphs, and it has been challenging to synthesize single-phase material, especially using scalable growth methods, as needed for technological applications. In this paper, we use aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy to characterize the microstructure of twin-free single-phase ultra-thin layers of beta-In2Se3, prepared by a unique molecular beam epitaxy approach. We emphasize features of the In2Se3 layer and In2Se3/InP interface which provide evidence for understanding the growth mechanism of the single-phase In2Se3. This novel approach for forming high-quality twin-free single phase two-dimensional crystals on InP substrates is likely to be applicable to other technologically important substrates.</description>
