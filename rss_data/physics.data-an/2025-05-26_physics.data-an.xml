      <title>PolyStan: PolyChord nested sampling and Bayesian evidences for Stan models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling from multi-modal distributions and estimating marginal likelihoods, also known as evidences and normalizing constants, are well-known challenges in statistical computation. They can be overcome by nested sampling, which evolves a set of live points through a sequence of distributions upwards in likelihood. We introduce PolyStan -- a nested sampling inference engine for Stan. PolyStan provides a Stan interface to the PolyChord nested sampling algorithm using bridgestan. PolyStan introduces a new user-base to nested sampling algorithms and provides a black-box method for sampling from challenging distributions and computing marginal likelihoods. We demonstrate the robustness of nested sampling on several degenerate and multi-modal problems, comparing it to bridge sampling and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Searching for extreme mass ratio inspirals in LISA: from identification to parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a planned space-based observatory designed to detect gravitational waves (GWs) within the millihertz frequency range. LISA is anticipated to observe the inspiral of compact objects into black holes at the centers of galaxies, so called extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). However, the extraction of these long-lived complex signals is challenging due to the large size and multimodality of the search space. In this study, we introduce a new search strategy that allows us to find EMRI signals in noisy data from wide priors all the way to performing parameter estimation. This work is an important step in understanding how to extract EMRIs from future LISA data.</description>

      <title>Recovering Hidden Degrees of Freedom Using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction represents a crucial step in extracting meaningful insights from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Conventional approaches, including linear methods such as principal component analysis as well as various autoencoder architectures, typically operate under the assumption of independent and identically distributed data, disregarding the sequential nature of MD simulations. Here, we introduce a physics-informed representation learning framework that leverages Gaussian Processes combined with variational autoencoders to exploit the temporal dependencies inherent in MD data. Time-dependent kernel functions--such as the Mat\'ern kernel--directly impose impose the temporal correlation structure of the input coordinates onto a low-dimensional space, preserving Markovianity in the reduced representation while faithfully capturing the essential dynamics. Using a three-dimensional toy model, we demonstrate that this approach can successfully identify and separate dynamically distinct states that are geometrically indistinguishable due to hidden degrees of freedom. The resulting embedding features enhance metastability, facilitating the construction of Markov state models with smaller lag times and better convergence of implied timescales. This time-aware perspective provides a promising framework for understanding complex biomolecular systems, in which conventional collective variables may fail to capture the full dynamical picture.</description>

      <title>Are EEG functional networks really describing the brain? A comparison with other information-processing complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional networks representing human brain dynamics have become a standard tool in neuroscience, providing an accessible way of depicting the computation performed by the brain in healthy and pathological conditions. Yet, these networks share multiple characteristics with those representing other natural and man-made complex systems, leading to the question of whether they are actually capturing the uniqueness of the human brain. By resorting to a large set of data representing multiple financial, technological, social, and natural complex systems, and by relying on Deep Learning classification models, we show how they are highly similar. We specifically reach the conclusion that, under some general reconstruction methodological choices, it is as difficult to understand whether a network represents a human brain or a financial market, as to diagnose a major pathology. This suggests that functional networks are describing information processing mechanisms that are common across complex systems; but that are not currently defining the uniqueness of the human mind. We discuss the consequence of these findings for neuroscience and complexity science in general, and suggest future avenues for exploring this interesting topic.</description>

      <title>Quantifying urban socio-economic segregation through co-residence network reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban segregation poses a critical challenge in cities, exacerbating inequalities, social tensions, fears, and polarization. It emerges from a complex interplay of socio-economic disparities and residential preferences, disproportionately impacting migrant communities. In this paper, using a comprehensive administrative data from Vienna, where nearly 40% of the population consists of international migrants, we analyse co-residence preferences between migrants and locals at the neighbourhood level. Our findings reveal two major clusters in Vienna shaped by wealth disparities, district diversity, and nationality-based homophily. These insights shed light on the underlying mechanisms of urban segregation and designing policies for better integration.</description>
