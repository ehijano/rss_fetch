      <title>Wakefield Acceleration in a Layered Plasma Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma wakefield accelerators (PWFA) represent one of the promising new accelerator concepts that are now being developed intensively for future applications in high-energy physics and industry. Among the unresolved problems of practical implementation of PWFA there are maintaining the required quality (emittance, size, energy spread of bunches) and stable transportation of drive and accelerated (witness) bunches over long acceleration distances. For improving the bunch transport, we propose to fill the bunch transport channel with the background plasma, the density of which is lower than the main plasma density building up an accelerating wake wave. We call this waveguide structure a layered plasma waveguide (LPW). The wakefield excitation by a regular sequence of electron bunches in the LPW of cylindrical configuration has been explored both analytically and numerically. The layered plasma has been modeled as a combination of a tubular plasma and a plasma column of significantly different densities. The plasma column has a lower density. The dispersion dependencies of the TM-modes of the LPW was obtained and analyzed, and it was found that there was a single TM wave resonant with the electron bunch. Based on the obtained analytical expressions, the structures of the axial and radial wakefield amplitudes have been numerically investigated for the cases of a single drive bunch and a regular train of bunches. It is shown that for certain density ratios of the outer and inner plasmas, it is possible both to accelerate and focus simultaneously the drive and witness bunches. The 2.5D particle-in-cell code was used to simulate the witness acceleration of an electron bunch by a wakefield created by drive electron bunches in a two-layer plasma wakefield accelerator. The simulation showed good agreement with the results of analytical calculations.</description>

      <title>Beam Halo and Bunch Purity Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.07027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beam halo measurements imply measurements of beam profiles with a very high dynamic range, both in transverse and longitudinal planes. This lesson gives an overview of high dynamic range instruments for beam halo measurements. In addition, halo definitions and quantifications in view of beam instrumentation are discussed.</description>

      <title>Optimization of laser-driven proton acceleration in a near-critical-density plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing laser and plasma parameters is crucial for enhancing accelerated proton energy in laser-driven proton acceleration with finite laser energy for applications such as cancer therapy. Tight focusing plays a significant role in improving laser-driven proton acceleration, which is generally believed as a result of the enhancement of laser intensity. However, we find that even at a fixed laser intensity, reducing the focal spot size still enhances the proton energy. Through particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical modeling, we find that at a small spot size (0.8 {\mu}m), the maximum proton energy is enhanced by 56.3% compared to that obtained at a conventional spot size (3 {\mu}m). This improvement is attributed to the dominance of ponderomotive-force-driven electrons at reduced spot sizes, which generate stronger charge-separation fields that propagate at higher velocities. Furthermore, to optimize proton acceleration, we analytically derive an ideal plasma density profile that promotes phase-stable proton acceleration, yielding an additional energy increase of 61.3% over the case of a tightly focused laser interacting with a planar target of uniform density. These findings remain robust under parameter variations, indicating that advanced focusing techniques combined with optimized plasma profiles could relax the demand for high laser energies, thereby reducing the reliance on large-scale laser facilities in medical and scientific applications.</description>
