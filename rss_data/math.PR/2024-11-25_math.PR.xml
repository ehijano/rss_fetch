      <title>Axis-Driven Random Walks on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ (transient cases)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axis-driven random walks were introduced by P. Andreoletti and P. Debs [AD23] to provide a rough description of the behaviour of a particle trapped in a localized force field. In contrast to their work, we examine the scenario where a repulsive force (controlled by a parameter $\alpha$) is applied along the axes, with the hypothesis that the walk remains diffusive within the cones. This force gradually pushes the particle away from the origin whenever it encounters an axis. We prove that even with a minimal force (i.e., a small $\alpha$), the walk exhibits transient, superdiffusive behaviour, and we derive the left and right tails of its distribution.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits of solitons in the box-ball system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the space-time scaling limits of solitons in the box-ball system with random initial distribution. In particular, we show that any recentered tagged soliton converges to a Brownian motion in the diffusive space-time scale, and also prove the large deviation principle for the tagged soliton under certain shift-ergodic invariant distributions, including Bernoulli product measures and two-sided Markov distributions. Furthermore, in the diffusive space-time scaling, we show that two tagged solitons converge to the same Brownian motion even if they are macroscopically far apart.</description>

      <title>Convex combinations of random variables stochastically dominate the parent for a large class of heavy-tailed distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic dominance of a random variable by a convex combination of its independent copies has recently been shown to hold within the relatively narrow class of distributions with concave odds function. We show that a key property for this stochastic dominance result to hold is the subadditivity of the cumulative distribution function of the reciprocal of the random variable of interest, referred to as the inverted distribution. This enlarges significantly the family of distributions for which the dominance is verified. Moreover, we study the relation between the class of distributions with concave odds function and the class we introduce showing conditions under which the concavity of the odds function implies the subadditivity of inverted distribution-</description>

      <title>Massive Particle Systems, Wasserstein Brownian Motions, and the Dean--Kawasaki Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unifying theory for four different objects: (1) infinite systems of interacting massive particles; (2) solutions to the Dean-Kawasaki equation with singular drift and space-time white noise; (3) Wasserstein diffusions with a.s. purely atomic reversible random measures; (4) metric measure Brownian motions induced by Cheeger energies on $L^2$-Wasserstein spaces.
  For the objects in (1)-(3) we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions, and several characterizations, on an arbitrary locally compact Polish ambient space $M$ with exponentially recurrent Feller driving noise. In the case of the Dean-Kawasaki equation, this amounts to replacing the Laplace operator with some arbitrary diffusive Markov generator $\mathsf{L}$ with ultracontractive semigroup. In addition to a complete discussion of the free case, we consider singular interactions, including, e.g., mean-field repulsive isotropic pairwise interactions of Riesz and logarithmic type under the assumption of local integrability.
  We further show that each Markov diffusion generator $\mathsf{L}$ on $M$ induces in a natural way a geometry on the space of probability measures over $M$. When $M$ is a manifold and $\mathsf{L}$ is a drifted Laplace-Beltrami operator, this geometry coincides with the geometry of $L^2$-optimal transportation. The corresponding `geometric Brownian motion' coincides with the 'metric measure Brownian motion' in (4).</description>

      <title>Deciding Bank Interest Rates -- A Major-Minor Impulse Control Mean-Field Game Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deciding bank interest rates has been a long-standing challenge in finance. It is crucial to ensure that the selected rates balance market share and profitability. However, traditional approaches typically focus on the interest rate changes of individual banks, often neglecting the interactions with other banks in the market. This work proposes a novel framework that models the interest rate problem as a major-minor mean field game within the context of an interbank game. To incorporate the complex interactions between banks, we utilize mean-field theory and employ impulsive control to model the overhead in rate adjustments. Ultimately, we solve this optimal control problem using a new deep Q-network method, which iterates the parameterized action value functions for major and minor players and updates the networks in a Fictitious Play way. Our proposed algorithm converges, offering a solution that enables the analysis of strategies for major and minor players in the market under the Nash Equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Sparsifying Suprema of Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a dimension-independent sparsification result for suprema of centered Gaussian processes: Let $T$ be any (possibly infinite) bounded set of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and let $\{{\boldsymbol{X}}_t\}_{t\in T}$ be the canonical Gaussian process on $T$. We show that there is an $O_\varepsilon(1)$-size subset $S \subseteq T$ and a set of real values $\{c_s\}_{s \in S}$ such that $\sup_{s \in S} \{{\boldsymbol{X}}_s + c_s\}$ is an $\varepsilon$-approximator of $\sup_{t \in T} {\boldsymbol{X}}_t$. Notably, the size of $S$ is completely independent of both the size of $T$ and of the ambient dimension $n$.
  We use this to show that every norm is essentially a junta when viewed as a function over Gaussian space: Given any norm $\nu(x)$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, there is another norm $\psi(x)$ which depends only on the projection of $x$ along $O_\varepsilon(1)$ directions, for which $\psi({\boldsymbol{g}})$ is a multiplicative $(1 \pm \varepsilon)$-approximation of $\nu({\boldsymbol{g}})$ with probability $1-\varepsilon$ for ${\boldsymbol{g}} \sim N(0,I_n)$.
  We also use our sparsification result for suprema of centered Gaussian processes to give a sparsification lemma for convex sets of bounded geometric width: Any intersection of (possibly infinitely many) halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that are at distance $O(1)$ from the origin is $\varepsilon$-close, under $N(0,I_n)$, to an intersection of only $O_\varepsilon(1)$ many halfspaces.
  We describe applications to agnostic learning and tolerant property testing.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Chaos for 2D Log Gas on the Whole Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the quantitative propagation of chaos in the sense of relative entropy for the first time for the 2D Log gas or the weakly interacting particle systems with 2D Coulomb interactions on the whole space. We resolve this problem by adapting the modulated free energy method in [BJW23] to the whole space setting and establishing the crucial logarithmic growth estimates for the mean-field Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equation of single component via the parabolic maximum principle.</description>

      <title>A note on the geodesic normal distribution on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an alternative formulation of the geodesic normal distribution on the sphere, building on the work of Hauberg (2018). While the isotropic version of this distribution is naturally defined on the sphere, the anisotropic version requires projecting points from the hypersphere onto the tangent space. In contrast, our approach removes the dependence on the tangent space and defines the geodesic normal distribution directly on the sphere. Moreover, we demonstrate that the density contours of this distribution are exactly ellipses on the sphere, providing intriguing alternative characterizations for describing this locus of points.</description>

      <title>Linear convergence of proximal descent schemes on the Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate proximal descent methods, inspired by the minimizing movement scheme introduced by Jordan, Kinderlehrer and Otto, for optimizing entropy-regularized functionals on the Wasserstein space. We establish linear convergence under flat convexity assumptions, thereby relaxing the common reliance on geodesic convexity. Our analysis circumvents the need for discrete-time adaptations of the Evolution Variational Inequality (EVI). Instead, we leverage a uniform logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) and the entropy "sandwich" lemma, extending the analysis from arXiv:2201.10469 and arXiv:2202.01009. The major challenge in the proof via LSI is to show that the relative Fisher information $I(\cdot|\pi)$ is well-defined at every step of the scheme. Since the relative entropy is not Wasserstein differentiable, we prove that along the scheme the iterates belong to a certain class of Sobolev regularity, and hence the relative entropy $\operatorname{KL}(\cdot|\pi)$ has a unique Wasserstein sub-gradient, and that the relative Fisher information is indeed finite.</description>

      <title>Color-avoiding percolation on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a recently introduced model of color-avoiding percolation defined as follows. Every edge in a graph $G$ is colored in some of $k\ge 2$ colors. Two vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$ are said to be CA-connected if $u$ and $v$ may be connected using any subset of $k-1$ colors. CA-connectivity defines an equivalence relation on the vertex set of $G$ whose classes are called CA-components.
  We study the component structure of a randomly colored Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph of constant average degree. We distinguish three regimes for the size of the largest component: a supercritical regime, a so-called intermediate regime, and a subcritical regime, in which the largest CA-component has respectively linear, logarithmic, and bounded size. Interestingly, in the subcritical regime, the bound is deterministic and given by the number of colors.</description>

      <title>Complex balanced distributions for chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reaction networks have become a major modelling framework in the biological sciences from epidemiology and population biology to genetics and cellular biology. In recent years, much progress has been made on stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) that in particular are applicable when copy numbers are low (as in cellular systems) or when noise and drift are ubiquitous (as in population genetic models). Often a main interest is the long term behaviour of a system: does the system settle towards stochastic equilibrium in some sense? In that context, we are concerned with SRNs, modelled as continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs) and their stationary distributions. In particular, we are interested in complex balanced stationary distributions, where the probability flow out of a complex equals the flow into the complex. We characterise the existence and the form of complex balanced distributions of SRNs with arbitrary transition functions through conditions on the cycles of a corresponding reaction graph (a digraph). Furthermore, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of a complex balanced distribution and give precise conditions for when it is also necessary. The sufficient condition is also necessary for mass-action kinetics (and certain generalisations of that) or if the connected components of the digraph are cycles. Moreover, we state a deficiency theorem, a generalisation of the deficiency theorem for stochastic mass-action kinetics to arbitrary stochastic genetics. The theorem gives the co-dimension of the parameter space for which a complex balanced distribution exists.</description>

      <title>Density of Brown measure of free circular Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Brown measure of the free circular Brownian motion, $\boldsymbol{a}+\sqrt{t}\boldsymbol{x}$, with an arbitrary initial condition $\boldsymbol{a}$, i.e. $\boldsymbol{a}$ is a general non-normal operator and $\boldsymbol{x}$ is a circular element $*$-free from $\boldsymbol{a}$. We prove that, under a mild assumption on $\boldsymbol{a}$, the density of the Brown measure has one of the following two types of behavior around each point on the boundary of its support -- either (i) sharp cut, i.e. a jump discontinuity along the boundary, or (ii) quadratic decay at certain critical points on the boundary. Our result is in direct analogy with the previously known phenomenon for the spectral density of free semicircular Brownian motion, whose singularities are either a square-root edge or a cubic cusp. We also provide several examples and counterexamples, one of which shows that our assumption on $\boldsymbol{a}$ is necessary.</description>

As part of our construction, we expand the concept of quadratic variation, introduced by Veraar and Yaroslavtsev (2016), to the case of cylindrical martingale-valued measures that are allowed to have discontinuous paths (this is carried out within the context of separable Banach spaces). Our theory of stochastic integration is applied to address the existence and uniqueness of solutions to stochastic partial differential equations in Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limits for Consensus-Based Optimization and Sampling</title>

Abstract: For algorithms based on interacting particle systems that admit a mean-field description, convergence analysis is often more accessible at the mean-field level. In order to transfer convergence results obtained at the mean-field level to the finite ensemble size setting, it is desirable to show that the particle dynamics converge in an appropriate sense to the corresponding mean-field dynamics. In this paper, we prove quantitative mean-field limit results for two related interacting particle systems: Consensus-Based Optimization and Consensus-Based Sampling. Our approach requires a generalization of Sznitman's classical argument: in order to circumvent issues related to the lack of global Lipschitz continuity of the coefficients, we discard an event of small probability, the contribution of which is controlled using moment estimates for the particle systems. In addition, we present new results on the well-posedness of the particle systems and their mean-field limit, and provide novel stability estimates for the weighted mean and the weighted covariance.</description>

      <title>Weak Poincar\'e Inequalities, Simulated Annealing, and Sampling from Spherical Spin Glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been a recent surge of powerful tools to show rapid mixing of Markov chains, via functional inequalities such as Poincar\'e inequalities. In many situations, Markov chains fail to mix rapidly from a worst-case initialization, yet are expected to approximately sample from a random initialization. For example, this occurs if the target distribution has metastable states, small clusters accounting for a vanishing fraction of the mass that are essentially disconnected from the bulk of the measure. Under such conditions, a Poincar\'e inequality cannot hold, necessitating new tools to prove sampling guarantees.
  We develop a framework to analyze simulated annealing, based on establishing so-called weak Poincar\'e inequalities. These inequalities imply mixing from a suitably warm start, and simulated annealing provides a way to chain such warm starts together into a sampling algorithm. We further identify a local-to-global principle to prove weak Poincar\'e inequalities, mirroring the spectral independence and localization schemes frameworks for analyzing mixing times of Markov chains.
  As our main application, we prove that simulated annealing samples from the Gibbs measure of a spherical spin glass for inverse temperatures up to a natural threshold, matching recent algorithms based on algorithmic stochastic localization. This provides the first Markov chain sampling guarantee that holds beyond the uniqueness threshold for spherical spin glasses, where mixing from a worst-case initialization is provably slow due to the presence of metastable states. As an ingredient in our proof, we prove bounds on the operator norm of the covariance matrix of spherical spin glasses in the full replica-symmetric regime.
  Additionally, we resolve a question related to sampling using data-based initializations.</description>

      <title>Geodesics and dynamical information projections on the manifold of H\"older equilibrium probabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.09677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider here the discrete time dynamics described by a transformation $T:M \to M$, where $T$ is either the action of shift $T=\sigma$ on the symbolic space $M=\{1,2,...,d\}^\mathbb{N}$, or, $T$ describes the action of a $d$ to $1$ expanding transformation $T:S^1 \to S^1$ of class $C^{1+\alpha}$ (\,for example $x \to T(x) =d\, x $ (mod $1) $\,), where $M=S^1$ is the unit circle. It is known that the infinite-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{N}$ of equilibrium probabilities for H\"older potentials $A:M \to \mathbb{R}$ is an analytical manifold and carries a natural Riemannian metric associated with the asymptotic variance. We show here that under the assumption of the existence of a Fourier-like Hilbert basis for the kernel of the Ruelle operator there exists geodesics paths. When $T=\sigma$ and $M=\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ such basis exists.
  In a different direction, we also consider the KL-divergence $D_{KL}(\mu_1,\mu_2)$ for a pair of equilibrium probabilities. If $D_{KL}(\mu_1,\mu_2)=0$, then $\mu_1=\mu_2$. Although $D_{KL}$ is not a metric in $\mathcal{N}$, it describes the proximity between $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$. A natural problem is: for a fixed probability $\mu_1\in \mathcal{N}$ consider the probability $\mu_2$ in a convex set of probabilities in $\mathcal{N}$ which minimizes $D_{KL}(\mu_1,\mu_2)$. This minimization problem is a dynamical version of the main issues considered in information projections. We consider this problem in $\mathcal{N}$, a case where all probabilities are dynamically invariant, getting explicit equations for the solution sought. Triangle and Pythagorean inequalities will be investigated.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Self Selection of Service Type in a Queueing System where Long Service Postpones the Need for the Next Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a closed queueing system that offers two types of service. After obtaining service the customer is active for a period of time whose random duration depends on the service type: the longer service type enables longer activity time. Users can choose a service type every time they are in service, and we are interested in the system efficiency which is the average number of active users. Applications include but are not limited to inventory control, electrical vehicle charging, mobile robotics charging, and machine maintenance. We prove that choosing the more efficient service is not always optimal. We demonstrate that if we constrain the strategy to be a threshold strategy depending on the number of inactive users, then the resulting maximal efficiency is not significantly lower than the maximal efficiency. We also study individuals' optimal selection of the service type, and observe that individuals and the manager have opposite incentives: when the queue is long, individuals choose the long service, while the manager prefers the short service in this case.</description>

      <title>Sampling from convex sets with a cold start using multiscale decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04439v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Running a random walk in a convex body $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ is a standard approach to sample approximately uniformly from the body. The requirement is that from a suitable initial distribution, the distribution of the walk comes close to the uniform distribution $\pi_K$ on $K$ after a number of steps polynomial in $n$ and the aspect ratio $R/r$ (i.e., when $rB_2 \subseteq K \subseteq RB_{2}$).
  Proofs of rapid mixing of such walks often require the probability density $\eta_0$ of the initial distribution with respect to $\pi_K$ to be at most $\mathrm{poly}(n)$: this is called a "warm start". Achieving a warm start often requires non-trivial pre-processing before starting the random walk. This motivates proving rapid mixing from a "cold start", wherein $\eta_0$ can be as high as $\exp(\mathrm{poly}(n))$. Unlike warm starts, a cold start is usually trivial to achieve. However, a random walk need not mix rapidly from a cold start: an example being the well-known "ball walk". On the other hand, Lov\'asz and Vempala proved that the "hit-and-run" random walk mixes rapidly from a cold start. For the related coordinate hit-and-run (CHR) walk, which has been found to be promising in computational experiments, rapid mixing from a warm start was proved only recently but the question of rapid mixing from a cold start remained open.
  We construct a family of random walks inspired by classical decompositions of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ into countably many axis-aligned dyadic cubes. We show that even with a cold start, the mixing times of these walks are bounded by a polynomial in $n$ and the aspect ratio. Our main technical ingredient is an isoperimetric inequality for $K$ for a metric that magnifies distances between points close to the boundary of $K$. As a corollary, we show that the CHR walk also mixes rapidly both from a cold start and from a point not too close to the boundary of $K$.</description>

      <title>Huber-energy measure quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a measure quantization procedure i.e., an algorithm which finds the best approximation of a target probability law (and more generally signed finite variation measure) by a sum of $Q$ Dirac masses ($Q$ being the quantization parameter). The procedure is implemented by minimizing the statistical distance between the original measure and its quantized version; the distance is built from a negative definite kernel and, if necessary, can be computed on the fly and feed to a stochastic optimization algorithm (such as SGD, Adam, ...). We investigate theoretically the fundamental questions of existence of the optimal measure quantizer and identify what are the required kernel properties that guarantee suitable behavior. We propose two best linear unbiased (BLUE) estimators for the squared statistical distance and use them in an unbiased procedure, called HEMQ, to find the optimal quantization. We test HEMQ on several databases: multi-dimensional Gaussian mixtures, Wiener space cubature, Italian wine cultivars and the MNIST image database. The results indicate that the HEMQ algorithm is robust and versatile and, for the class of Huber-energy kernels, matches the expected intuitive behavior.</description>

      <title>Deep Quadratic Hedging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel computational procedure for quadratic hedging in high-dimensional incomplete markets, covering mean-variance hedging and local risk minimization. Starting from the observation that both quadratic approaches can be treated from the point of view of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), we (recursively) apply a deep learning-based BSDE solver to compute the entire optimal hedging strategies paths. This allows us to overcome the curse of dimensionality, extending the scope of applicability of quadratic hedging in high dimension. We test our approach with a classic Heston model and with a multiasset and multifactor generalization thereof, showing that this leads to high levels of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Testing Convex Truncation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the basic statistical problem of testing whether normally distributed $n$-dimensional data has been truncated, i.e. altered by only retaining points that lie in some unknown truncation set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. As our main algorithmic results,
  (1) We give a computationally efficient $O(n)$-sample algorithm that can distinguish the standard normal distribution $N(0,I_n)$ from $N(0,I_n)$ conditioned on an unknown and arbitrary convex set $S$.
  (2) We give a different computationally efficient $O(n)$-sample algorithm that can distinguish $N(0,I_n)$ from $N(0,I_n)$ conditioned on an unknown and arbitrary mixture of symmetric convex sets.
  These results stand in sharp contrast with known results for learning or testing convex bodies with respect to the normal distribution or learning convex-truncated normal distributions, where state-of-the-art algorithms require essentially $n^{\sqrt{n}}$ samples. An easy argument shows that no finite number of samples suffices to distinguish $N(0,I_n)$ from an unknown and arbitrary mixture of general (not necessarily symmetric) convex sets, so no common generalization of results (1) and (2) above is possible.
  We also prove that any algorithm (computationally efficient or otherwise) that can distinguish $N(0,I_n)$ from $N(0,I_n)$ conditioned on an unknown symmetric convex set must use $\Omega(n)$ samples. This shows that the sample complexity of each of our algorithms is optimal up to a constant factor.</description>

      <title>Geometry and analytic properties of the sliced Wasserstein space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05134v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sliced Wasserstein metric compares probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ by taking averages of the Wasserstein distances between projections of the measures to lines. The distance has found a range of applications in statistics and machine learning, as it is easier to approximate and compute in high dimensions than the Wasserstein distance. While the geometry of the Wasserstein metric is quite well understood, and has led to important advances, very little is known about the geometry and metric properties of the sliced Wasserstein (SW) metric. Here we show that when the measures considered are "nice" (e.g. bounded above and below by positive multiples of the Lebesgue measure) then the SW metric is comparable to the (homogeneous) negative Sobolev norm $\dot H^{-(d+1)/2}$. On the other hand when the measures considered are close in the infinity transportation metric to a discrete measure, then the SW metric between them is close to a multiple of the Wasserstein metric. We characterize the tangent space of the SW space, show that the speed of curves in the space can be described by a quadratic form, but that the SW space is not a length space. We establish a number of properties of the metric given by the minimal length of curves between measures -- the SW length. Finally we highlight the consequences of these properties to the gradient flows in the SW metric.</description>

      <title>Seat number configuration of the box-ball system, and its relation to the 10-elimination and invariant measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The box-ball system (BBS) is a soliton cellular automaton introduced by [TS], and it is known that the dynamics of the BBS can be linearized by several methods. Recently, a new linearization method, called the seat number configuration, is introduced by [MSSS]. The aim of this paper is fourfold. First, we introduce the $k$-skip map $\Psi_{k} : \Omega \to \Omega$, where $\Omega$ is the state space of the BBS, and show that the $k$-skip map induces a shift operator of the seat number configuration. Second, we show that the $k$-skip map is a natural generalization of the $10$-elimination, which was originally introduced by [MIT] to solve the initial value problem of the periodic BBS. Third, we generalize the notions and results of the seat number configuration and the $k$-skip map for the BBS on the whole-line. Finally, we investigate the distribution of $\Psi_{k}(\eta), \eta \in \Omega$ when the distribution of $\eta$ belongs to a certain class of invariant measures of the BBS introduced by [FG]. As an application of the above results, we obtain the long-time behavior of the integrated current of $\Psi_{k}(\eta)$ with Markov stationary initial distributions.</description>

Abstract: A set of points with finite density is constructed in $\mathbb{R}^d$, with $d\geq2$, by adding points to a Poisson process such that any line segment of length $O\left(\varepsilon^{-(d-1)}\ln\varepsilon^{-1}\right)$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ will contain one of the points of the set within distance $\varepsilon$ of it. The constant implied by the big-$O$ notation depends on dimension only.</description>
