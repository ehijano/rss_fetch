      <title>Modeling ICD-10 Morbidity and Multidimensional Poverty as a Spatial Network: Evidence from Thailand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Health and poverty in Thailand exhibit pronounced geographic structuring, yet the extent to which they operate as interconnected regional systems remains insufficiently understood. This study analyzes ICD-10 chapter-level morbidity and multidimensional poverty as outcomes embedded in a spatial interaction network. Interpreting Thailand's 76 provinces as nodes within a fixed-degree regional graph, we apply tools from spatial econometrics and social network analysis, including Moran's I, Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA), and Spatial Durbin Models (SDM), to assess spatial dependence and cross-provincial spillovers.
  Our findings reveal strong spatial clustering across multiple ICD-10 chapters, with persistent high-high morbidity zones, particularly for digestive, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and symptom-based diseases, emerging in well-defined regional belts. SDM estimates demonstrate that spillover effects from neighboring provinces frequently exceed the influence of local deprivation, especially for living-condition, health-access, accessibility, and poor-household indicators. These patterns are consistent with contagion and contextual influence processes well established in social network theory.
  By framing morbidity and poverty as interdependent attributes on a spatial network, this study contributes to the growing literature on structural diffusion, health inequality, and regional vulnerability. The results highlight the importance of coordinated policy interventions across provincial boundaries and demonstrate how network-based modeling can uncover the spatial dynamics of health and deprivation.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study on User Profile Analysis and SEO Performance: A Case of Taiwan Cultural Memory Bank 2.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taiwan Cultural Memory Bank 2.0 is an online curation platform that invites the public to become curators, fostering diverse perspectives on Taiwan's society, humanities, natural landscapes, and daily life. Built on a material bank concept, the platform encourages users to co-create and curate their own works using shared resources or self-uploaded materials. At its core, the system follows a collect, store, access, and reuse model, supporting dynamic engagement with over three million cultural memory items from Taiwan. Users can search, browse, explore stories, and engage in creative applications and collaborative productions. Understanding user profiles is crucial for enhancing website service quality, particularly within the framework of the Visitor Relationship Management model. This study conducts an empirical analysis of user profiles on the platform, examining demographic characteristics, browsing behaviors, and engagement patterns. Additionally, the research evaluates the platform's SEO performance, search visibility, and organic traffic effectiveness. Based on the findings, this study provides strategic recommendations for optimizing website management, improving user experience, and leveraging social media for enhanced digital outreach. The insights gained contribute to the broader discussion on digital cultural platforms and their role in audience engagement, online visibility, and networked communication.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Relationship Between Local Election Results and Online Public Opinion in Taiwan: A Case Study of Taitung County</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between online buzz and local election outcomes in Taiwan, with a focus on Taitung County. As social media becomes a major channel for public discourse, online buzz is increasingly seen as a factor influencing elections. However, its impact on local elections in Taiwan remains underexplored. This research addresses that gap through a comparative analysis of social media data and actual vote shares during the election period. A review of existing literature establishes the study's framework and highlights the need for empirical investigation in this area.
  The findings aim to reveal whether online discussions align with electoral results and to what extent digital sentiment reflects voter behavior. The study also discusses methodological and data limitations that may affect interpretation. Beyond its academic value, the research offers practical insights into how online buzz can inform campaign strategies and enhance election predictions. By analyzing the Taitung County case, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of online discourse in Taiwan's local elections and offers a foundation for future research in the field.</description>

      <title>Cross-Platform Digital Discourse Analysis of the Israel-Hamas Conflict: Sentiment, Topics, and Event Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains one of the most polarizing geopolitical issues, with the October 2023 escalation intensifying online debate. Social media platforms, particularly Telegram, have become central to real-time news sharing, advocacy, and propaganda. In this study, we analyze Telegram, Twitter/X, and Reddit to examine how conflict narratives are produced, amplified, and contested across different digital spheres. Building on our previous work on Telegram discourse during the 2023 escalation, we extend the analysis longitudinally and cross-platform using an updated dataset spanning October 2023 to mid-2025. The corpus includes more than 187,000 Telegram messages, 2.1 million Reddit comments, and curated Twitter/X posts. We combine Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), BERTopic, and transformer-based sentiment and emotion models to identify dominant themes, emotional dynamics, and propaganda strategies. Telegram channels provide unfiltered, high-intensity documentation of events; Twitter/X amplifies frames to global audiences; and Reddit hosts more reflective and deliberative discussions. Our findings reveal persistent negative sentiment, strong coupling between humanitarian framing and solidarity expressions, and platform-specific pathways for the diffusion of pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli narratives. This paper offers three contributions: (1) a multi-platform, FAIR-compliant dataset on the Israel-Hamas war, (2) an integrated pipeline combining topic modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, and spam filtering for large-scale conflict discourse, and (3) empirical insights into how platform affordances and affective publics shape the evolution of digital conflict communication.</description>

      <title>Fair Distribution of Digital Payments: Balancing Transaction Flows for Regulatory Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concentration of digital payment transactions in just two UPI apps like PhonePe and Google Pay has raised concerns of duopoly in India s digital financial ecosystem. To address this, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has mandated that no single UPI app should exceed 30 percent of total transaction volume. Enforcing this cap, however, poses a significant computational challenge: how to redistribute user transactions across apps without causing widespread user inconvenience while maintaining capacity limits? In this paper, we formalize this problem as the Minimum Edge Activation Flow (MEAF) problem on a bipartite network of users and apps, where activating an edge corresponds to a new app installation. The objective is to ensure a feasible flow respecting app capacities while minimizing additional activations. We further prove that Minimum Edge Activation Flow is NP-Complete. To address the computational challenge, we propose scalable heuristics, named Decoupled Two-Stage Allocation Strategy (DTAS), that exploit flow structure and capacity reuse. Experiments on large semi-synthetic transaction network data show that DTAS finds solutions close to the optimal ILP within seconds, offering a fast and practical way to enforce transaction caps fairly and efficiently.</description>

      <title>Spiking Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world graphs or networks are usually heterogeneous, involving multiple types of nodes and relationships. Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) can effectively handle these diverse nodes and edges, capturing heterogeneous information within the graph, thus exhibiting outstanding performance. However, most methods of HGNNs usually involve complex structural designs, leading to problems such as high memory usage, long inference time, and extensive consumption of computing resources. These limitations pose certain challenges for the practical application of HGNNs, especially for resource-constrained devices. To mitigate this issue, we propose the Spiking Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks (SpikingHAN), which incorporates the brain-inspired and energy-saving properties of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) into heterogeneous graph learning to reduce the computing cost without compromising the performance. Specifically, SpikingHAN aggregates metapath-based neighbor information using a single-layer graph convolution with shared parameters. It then employs a semantic-level attention mechanism to capture the importance of different meta-paths and performs semantic aggregation. Finally, it encodes the heterogeneous information into a spike sequence through SNNs, simulating bioinformatic processing to derive a binarized 1-bit representation of the heterogeneous graph. Comprehensive experimental results from three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets show that SpikingHAN delivers competitive node classification performance. It achieves this with fewer parameters, quicker inference, reduced memory usage, and lower energy consumption. Code is available at https://github.com/QianPeng369/SpikingHAN.</description>

Abstract: Higher-order interactions provide a nuanced understanding of the relational structure of complex systems beyond traditional pairwise interactions. However, higher-order network analyses also incur more cumbersome interpretations and greater computational demands than their pairwise counterparts. Here we present an information-theoretic framework for determining the extent to which a hypergraph representation of a networked system is structurally redundant, and for identifying its most critical higher orders of interaction that allow us to remove these redundancies while preserving essential higher-order structure.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Estimation of Localized Treatment Effects in High-Dimensional Design Spaces using Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population-scale agent-based simulations of the opioid epidemic help evaluate intervention strategies and overdose outcomes in heterogeneous communities and provide estimates of localized treatment effects, which support the design of locally-tailored policies for precision public health. However, it is prohibitively costly to run simulations of all treatment conditions in all communities because the number of possible treatments grows exponentially with the number of interventions and levels at which they are applied. To address this need efficiently, we develop a metamodel framework, whereby treatment outcomes are modeled using a response function whose coefficients are learned through Gaussian process regression (GPR) on locally-contextualized covariates. We apply this framework to efficiently estimate treatment effects on overdose deaths in Pennsylvania counties. In contrast to classical designs such as fractional factorial design or Latin hypercube sampling, our approach leverages spatial correlations and posterior uncertainty to sequentially sample the most informative counties and treatment conditions. Using a calibrated agent-based opioid epidemic model, informed by county-level overdose mortality and baseline dispensing rate data for different treatments, we obtained county-level estimates of treatment effects on overdose deaths per 100,000 population for all treatment conditions in Pennsylvania, achieving approximately 5% average relative error using one-tenth the number of simulation runs required for exhaustive evaluation. Our bi-level framework provides a computationally efficient approach to decision support for policy makers, enabling rapid evaluation of alternative resource-allocation strategies to mitigate the opioid epidemic in local communities. The same analytical framework can be applied to guide precision public health interventions in other epidemic settings.</description>

      <title>Unpacking Generative AI in Education: Computational Modeling of Teacher and Student Perspectives in Social Media Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) technologies are quickly reshaping the educational landscape. As adoption accelerates, understanding how students and educators perceive these tools is essential. This study presents one of the most comprehensive analyses to date of stakeholder discourse dynamics on GAI in education using social media data. Our dataset includes 1,199 Reddit posts and 13,959 corresponding top-level comments. We apply sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and author classification. To support this, we propose and validate a modular framework that leverages prompt-based large language models (LLMs) for analysis of online social discourse, and we evaluate this framework against classical natural language processing (NLP) models. Our GPT-4o pipeline consistently outperforms prior approaches across all tasks. For example, it achieved 90.6% accuracy in sentiment analysis against gold-standard human annotations. Topic extraction uncovered 12 latent topics in the public discourse with varying sentiment and author distributions. Teachers and students convey optimism about GAI's potential for personalized learning and productivity in higher education. However, key differences emerged: students often voice distress over false accusations of cheating by AI detectors, while teachers generally express concern about job security, academic integrity, and institutional pressures to adopt GAI tools. These contrasting perspectives highlight the tension between innovation and oversight in GAI-enabled learning environments. Our findings suggest a need for clearer institutional policies, more transparent GAI integration practices, and support mechanisms for both educators and students. More broadly, this study demonstrates the potential of LLM-based frameworks for modeling stakeholder discourse within online communities.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models can Achieve Social Balance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be deployed in situations where they process positive/negative interactions with other agents. We study how this is done under the sociological framework of social balance, which explains the emergence of one faction or multiple antagonistic ones among agents. Across different LLM models, we find that balance depends on the (i) type of interaction, (ii) update mechanism, and (iii) population size. Across (i)-(iii), we characterize the frequency at which social balance is achieved, the justifications for the social dynamics, and the diversity and stability of interactions. Finally, we explain how our findings inform the deployment of agentic systems.</description>

      <title>SaVe-TAG: LLM-based Interpolation for Long-Tailed Text-Attributed Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16882v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world graph data often follows long-tailed distributions, making it difficult for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generalize well across both head and tail classes. Recent advances in Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) have shown promise in mitigating class imbalance with numeric interpolation; however, existing approaches largely rely on embedding-space arithmetic, which fails to capture the rich semantics inherent in text-attributed graphs. In this work, we propose our method, SaVe-TAG (Semantic-aware Vicinal Risk Minimization for Long-Tailed Text-Attributed Graphs), a novel VRM framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform text-level interpolation, generating on-manifold, boundary-enriching synthetic samples for minority classes. To mitigate the risk of noisy generation, we introduce a confidence-based edge assignment mechanism that uses graph topology as a natural filter to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical justification for our method and conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing that our approach consistently outperforms both numeric interpolation and prior long-tailed node classification baselines. Our results highlight the importance of integrating semantic and structural signals for balanced and effective learning on text-attributed graphs.

      <title>Personality-Enhanced Social Recommendations in SAMI: Exploring the Role of Personality Detection in Matchmaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social belonging is a vital part of learning, yet online course environments present barriers to the organic formation of social groups. SAMI (Social Agent Mediated Interactions) offers one solution by facilitating student connections, but its effectiveness may be constrained by an incomplete Theory of Mind, limiting its ability to create an effective 'mental model' of a student. One facet of this is its inability to intuit personality, which may influence the relevance of its recommendations.
  To explore this gap, we examine the viability of automated personality inference by proposing a personality detection model utilizing GPT's zeroshot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from forum introduction posts, often encouraged in online courses. We benchmark its performance against established models, finding that while GPT models show promising results on this specific dataset, performance varies significantly across traits. We identify potential biases toward optimistic trait inference, particularly for traits with skewed distributions.
  We demonstrate a proof-of-concept integration of personality detection into SAMI's entity-based matchmaking system, focusing on three traits with established connections to positive social formation: Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Openness. This work represents an initial exploration of personality-informed social recommendations in educational settings. While our implementation shows technical feasibility, significant questions remain. We discuss these limitations and outline directions for future work, examining what LLMs specifically capture when performing personality inference and whether personality-based matching meaningfully improves student connections in practice.</description>

      <title>Framing Unionization on Facebook: Communication around Representation Elections in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital media have become central to how labor unions communicate, organize, and sustain collective action. Yet little is known about how unions' online discourse relates to concrete outcomes such as representation elections. This study addresses the gap by combining National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election data with 158k Facebook posts published by U.S. labor unions between 2015 and 2024. We focused on five discourse frames widely recognized in labor and social movement communication research: diagnostic (identifying problems), prognostic (proposing solutions), motivational (mobilizing action), community (emphasizing solidarity), and engagement (promoting social media interaction). Using a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier, we systematically annotated unions' posts and analyzed patterns of frame usage around election events. Our findings showed that diagnostic and community frames dominated union communication overall, but that frame usage varied substantially across organizations. Greater use of diagnostic, prognostic, and community frames prior to an election was associated with higher odds of a successful outcome. After elections, framing patterns diverged depending on results: after wins, the use of prognostic and motivational frames decreased, whereas after losses, the use of prognostic and engagement frames increased. By examining variation in message-level framing, the study highlights how communication strategies correlate with organizational success, contributing open tools and data, and complementing prior research in understanding digital communication of unions and social movements.</description>

Abstract: Social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping political discourse, but analyzing their vast and rapidly evolving content remains a major challenge. We introduce an end-to-end framework for automatically inducing an interpretable topic taxonomy from unlabeled text corpora. By combining unsupervised clustering with prompt-based inference, our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to iteratively construct a taxonomy without requiring seed sets (predefined labels) or domain expertise. We validate the framework through a study of political advertising ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The induced taxonomy yields semantically rich topic labels and supports downstream analyses, including moral framing, in this setting. Results suggest that structured, iterative labeling yields more consistent and interpretable topic labels than existing approaches under human evaluation, and is practical for analyzing large-scale political advertising data.</description>
