      <title>Beyond the heat: The mental health toll of temperature and humidity in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence on the heat-mental health nexus remains mixed. I show that this can be partly explained by previous studies focusing solely on temperature while neglecting temperature-humidity interactions. Using a measure that considers both indicators (wet bulb temperature), I assess the causal link between extreme heat and mental health, and its heterogeneity across socioeconomic indicators. I combine self-reported depression and anxiety levels from three Indian WHO-SAGE survey waves with climate data, leveraging quasi-random variation in heat exposure due to survey timing and location. The results reveal that extreme heat increases the risk of depression but not of anxiety. Importantly, these effects are consistently smaller when humidity is not considered. Finally, the study provides evidence that the District Mental Health Program plays a protective role in mitigating adverse mental health effects. The findings suggest that the costs induced by climate change need to account for the economic consequences of deteriorated mental health.</description>

      <title>Impact of Multi-Platform Social Media Strategy on Sales in E-Commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past several decades, major social media platforms have become crucial channels for e-commerce retailers to connect with consumers, maintain engagement, and promote their offerings. While some retailers focus their efforts on a few key platforms, others choose a more diversified approach by spreading their efforts across multiple sites. Which strategy proves more effective and why? Drawing on a longitudinal dataset on e-commerce social media metrics and performance indicators, we find that, all else being equal, companies with a more diversified social media strategy outperform those focusing on fewer platforms, increasing total web sales by 2 to 5 percent. The key mechanism driving this finding appears to be the complementary effect of overlapping impressions across platforms. When followers are present on multiple platforms, repeated exposure to consistent messaging reinforces brand awareness and enhances purchase intent. Our findings highlight important managerial implications for diversifying social media efforts to reach potential customers more efficiently and ultimately boost sales.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Adoption and Higher Order Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how Generative AI (GenAI) adoption is reshaping work. While prior studies show that GenAI enhances role-level productivity and task composition, its influence on skills - the fundamental enablers of task execution, and the ultimate basis for employability - is less understood. Using job postings from 378 US public firms that recruited explicitly for GenAI skills (2021-2023), we analyze how GenAI adoption shifts the demand for workers' skills. Our findings reveal that the advertised roles which explicitly rely on GenAI tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot, etc., have 36.7 percent higher requirements for cognitive skills. Further, a difference-in-differences analysis shows that the demand for social skills within GenAI roles increases by 5.2 percent post-ChatGPT launch. These emerging findings indicate the presence of a hierarchy of skills in organizations with GenAI adoption associated with roles that rely on cognitive skills and social skills.</description>

      <title>Topological Components in a Community Currency Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transaction data from digital payment systems can be used to study economic processes in such detail that was not possible previously. Here, data from the Sarafu token network, a Community Inclusion Currency in Kenya, is analysed. During the COVID-19 emergency, Sarafu was distributed as part of a humanitarian aid project. In this work, the transactions are analysed using network science. A topological categorisation is defined to identify cyclic and acyclic components. Furthermore, temporal aspects of the circulation that takes place within these components are considered. The significant presence of different types of strongly connected components compared to randomised null models shows the importance of cycles in this economic network. Especially, indicating their key role in currency recirculation. In some acyclic components, the most significant triad suggests the presence of a group of users collecting currency from accounts that are active only once, hinting at a possible misuse of the system. In some other acyclic components, small isolated groups of users were active only once, suggesting the presence of users only interested in trying the system out. The methods used in this paper can answer specific questions related to user activities, currency design, and assessment of monetary interventions. The methodology provides a general quantitative tool to analyse the behaviour of users in a currency network.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Pandemic on Currency Circulation in Brazil: Projections using the SARIMA Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on currency circulation in Brazil by comparing actual data from 2000 to 2023 with counterfactual projections using the \textbf{SARIMA(3,1,1)(3,1,4)\textsubscript{12}} model. The model was selected based on an extensive parameter search, balancing accuracy and simplicity, and validated through the metrics MAPE, RMSE, and AIC. The results indicate a significant deviation between projected and observed values, with an average difference of R\$ 47.57 billion (13.95\%). This suggests that the pandemic, emergency policies, and the introduction of \textit{Pix} had a substantial impact on currency circulation. The robustness of the SARIMA model was confirmed, effectively capturing historical trends and seasonality, though findings emphasize the importance of considering exogenous variables, such as interest rates and macroeconomic policies, in future analyses. Future research should explore multivariate models incorporating economic indicators, long-term analysis of post-pandemic currency circulation trends, and studies on public cash-holding behavior. The results reinforce the need for continuous monitoring and econometric modeling to support decision-making in uncertain economic contexts.</description>
