      <title>Antennas in Walls: Performance Analysis of Microstrip Patch Antennas Designed for Internet of Paint (IoP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a simulated transceiver with a microstrip patch antenna (MPA) designed to operate at 150 GHz and embedded in a dielectric paint. The in-paint MPA (IP-MPA) is designed for the Internet of Paint (IoP) paradigm, which envisions seamless device communication through a paint layer on walls. Due to the paint's dielectric properties, the resonant frequency of the IP-MPA lowers to 141.3 GHz, with lower spreading loss. The study introduces a comprehensive channel model between transceivers in paint at arbitrary depths as well as IP-MPA angle orientations. The best transceiver orientations are analyzed for IoP channel performance. Our extensive evaluations shows that the lateral waves, which propagate along the air-paint interface, have the lowest loss, making this path the most reliable communication path between transceivers in paint. Further, all multipaths, except the reflected paths, are depth-independent when the received power is maximized. The findings suggest that the proposed network of IP-MPA-enabled transceivers for IoP has the potential to transform conventional walls into an integrated high-speed wireless communication infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Internet of Paint (IoP): Design, Challenges, Applications and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of nano-technology has enabled novel applications in various fields, including the potential for miniaturized terahertz (THz)-enabled devices. The extra-large bandwidth available in the THz spectrum can facilitate high-speed communication, even for transmission through lossy media. Culminating these capabilities, this paper introduces a new paradigm: Internet of Paint (IoP), transforming the 40,000-year-old concept of paint with extensive connectivity and sensing capabilities. IoP will enable seamless, massively parallel, and high-capacity communication and sensing capabilities, enabling innovative applications. IoP is expected to offer communication and sensing using nano-devices embedded in paint. In this paper, challenges towards the realization of IoP are discussed. Simulations indicate that THz signals in this stratified medium can form lateral waves that propagate along the Air-Paint interface and that relatively high channel capacity can be achieved by optimizing the transceiver locations, the paint thickness, and color. Addressing the challenges regarding nano-devices, nano-transceivers, materials, antennas, and power for IoP holds the potential to transform communication technologies and their seamless integration with living spaces.</description>

      <title>Hardware architecture and routing-aware training for optimal memory usage: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient deployment of neural networks on resource-constrained hardware demands optimal use of on-chip memory. In event-based processors, this is particularly critical for routing architectures, where substantial memory is dedicated to managing network connectivity. While prior work has focused on optimizing event routing during hardware design, optimizing memory utilization for routing during network training remains underexplored. Key challenges include: (i) integrating routing into the loss function, which often introduces non-differentiability, and (ii) computational expense in evaluating network mappability to hardware. We propose a hardware-algorithm co-design approach to train routing-aware neural networks. To address challenge (i), we extend the DeepR training algorithm, leveraging dynamic pruning and random re-assignment to optimize memory use. For challenge (ii), we introduce a proxy-based approximation of the mapping function to incorporate placement and routing constraints efficiently. We demonstrate our approach by optimizing a network for the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset using a small-world connectivity-based hardware architecture as a case study. The resulting network, trained with our routing-aware methodology, is fully mappable to the hardware, achieving 5% more accuracy using the same number of parameters, and iso-accuracy with 10x less memory usage, compared to non-routing-aware training methods. This work highlights the critical role of co-optimizing algorithms and hardware to enable efficient and scalable solutions for constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Demographic Predictability in 3D CT Foundation Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised foundation models have recently been successfully extended to encode three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) images, with excellent performance across several downstream tasks, such as intracranial hemorrhage detection and lung cancer risk forecasting. However, as self-supervised models learn from complex data distributions, questions arise concerning whether these embeddings capture demographic information, such as age, sex, or race. Using the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset, which contains 3D CT images and demographic data, we evaluated a range of classifiers: softmax regression, linear regression, linear support vector machine, random forest, and decision tree, to predict sex, race, and age of the patients in the images. Our results indicate that the embeddings effectively encoded age and sex information, with a linear regression model achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.8 years for age prediction and a softmax regression model attaining an AUC of 0.998 for sex classification. Race prediction was less effective, with an AUC of 0.878. These findings suggest a detailed exploration into the information encoded in self-supervised learning frameworks is needed to help ensure fair, responsible, and patient privacy-protected healthcare AI.</description>

      <title>Road User Classification from High-Frequency GNSS Data Using Distributed Edge Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world traffic involves diverse road users, ranging from pedestrians to heavy trucks, necessitating effective road user classification for various applications within Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). Traditional approaches often rely on intrusive and/or expensive external hardware sensors. These systems typically have limited spatial coverage. In response to these limitations, this work aims to investigate an unintrusive and cost-effective alternative for road user classification by using high-frequency (1-2 Hz) positional sequences. A cutting-edge solution could involve leveraging positioning data from 5G networks. However, this feature is currently only proposed in the 3GPP standard and has not yet been implemented for outdoor applications by 5G equipment vendors. Therefore, our approach relies on positional data, that is recorded under real-world conditions using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and processed on distributed edge devices. As a start-ing point, four types of road users are distinguished: pedestri-ans, cyclists, motorcycles, and passenger cars. While earlier approaches used classical statistical methods, we propose Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as the preferred classification method, as they repre-sent state-of-the-art in processing sequential data. An RNN architecture for road user classification, based on selected motion characteristics derived from raw positional sequences is presented and the influence of sequence length on classifica-tion quality is examined. The results of the work show that RNNs are capable of efficiently classifying road users on dis-tributed devices, and can particularly differentiate between types of motorized vehicles, based on two- to four-minute se-quences.</description>

      <title>LAMBDA: Covering the Multimodal Critical Scenarios for Automated Driving Systems by Search Space Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scenario-based virtual testing is one of the most significant methods to test and evaluate the safety of automated driving systems (ADSs). However, it is impractical to enumerate all concrete scenarios in a logical scenario space and test them exhaustively. Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) was introduced to accelerate the scenario-based test of ADSs by utilizing the historical test information to generate new test cases. However, a single optimum found by the BBO algorithm is insufficient for the purpose of a comprehensive safety evaluation of ADSs in a logical scenario. In fact, all the subspaces representing danger in the logical scenario space, rather than only the most critical concrete scenario, play a more significant role for the safety evaluation. Covering as many of the critical concrete scenarios in a logical scenario space through a limited number of tests is defined as the Black-Box Coverage (BBC) problem in this paper. We formalized this problem in a sample-based search paradigm and constructed a coverage criterion with Confusion Matrix Analysis. Furthermore, we propose LAMBDA (Latent-Action Monte-Carlo Beam Search with Density Adaption) to solve BBC problems. LAMBDA can quickly focus on critical subspaces by recursively partitioning the logical scenario space into accepted and rejected parts. Compared with its predecessor LaMCTS, LAMBDA introduces sampling density to overcome the sampling bias from optimization and Beam Search to obtain more parallelizability. Experimental results show that LAMBDA achieves state-of-the-art performance among all baselines and can reach at most 33 and 6000 times faster than Random Search to get 95% coverage of the critical areas in 2- and 5-dimensional synthetic functions, respectively. Experiments also demonstrate that LAMBDA has a promising future in the safety evaluation of ADSs in virtual tests.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Proof-of-Work: A Secure Dynamic Approach to Fair and Efficient Blockchain Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems face critical challenges, including excessive energy consumption and the centralization of mining power among entities with expensive hardware. Static mining pools exacerbate these issues by reducing competition and undermining the decentralized nature of blockchain networks, leading to economic inequality and inefficiencies in resource allocation. Their reliance on centralized pool managers further introduces vulnerabilities by creating a system that fails to ensure secure and fair reward distribution. This paper introduces a novel Collaborative Proof-of-Work (CPoW) mining approach designed to enhance efficiency and fairness in the Ethereum network. We propose a dynamic mining pool formation protocol that enables miners to collaborate based on their computational capabilities, ensuring fair and secure reward distribution by incorporating mechanisms to accurately verify and allocate rewards. By addressing the centralization and energy inefficiencies of traditional mining, this research contributes to a more sustainable blockchain ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Automating Feedback Analysis in Surgical Training: Detection, Categorization, and Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the first framework for reconstructing surgical dialogue from unstructured real-world recordings, which is crucial for characterizing teaching tasks. In surgical training, the formative verbal feedback that trainers provide to trainees during live surgeries is crucial for ensuring safety, correcting behavior immediately, and facilitating long-term skill acquisition. However, analyzing and quantifying this feedback is challenging due to its unstructured and specialized nature. Automated systems are essential to manage these complexities at scale, allowing for the creation of structured datasets that enhance feedback analysis and improve surgical education. Our framework integrates voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and automated speech recaognition, with a novel enhancement that 1) removes hallucinations (non-existent utterances generated during speech recognition fueled by noise in the operating room) and 2) separates speech from trainers and trainees using few-shot voice samples. These aspects are vital for reconstructing accurate surgical dialogues and understanding the roles of operating room participants. Using data from 33 real-world surgeries, we demonstrated the system's capability to reconstruct surgical teaching dialogues and detect feedback instances effectively (F1 score of 0.79+/-0.07). Moreover, our hallucination removal step improves feedback detection performance by ~14%. Evaluation on downstream clinically relevant tasks of predicting Behavioral Adjustment of trainees and classifying Technical feedback, showed performances comparable to manual annotations with F1 scores of 0.82+/0.03 and 0.81+/0.03 respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of our framework in supporting clinically relevant tasks and improving over manual methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Power Allocation in Uplink NOMA with Simultaneous Cache-Enabled D2D Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is widely viewed as a potential candidate for providing enhanced multiple access in future mobile networks by eliminating the orthogonal distribution of radio resources amongst the users. Nevertheless, the performance of NOMA can be significantly improved by combining it with other sophisticated technologies such as wireless data caching and device-to-device (D2D) communications. In this letter, we propose a novel cellular system model which integrates uplink NOMA with cache based device-to-device (D2D) communications. The proposed system would enable a cellular user to upload data file to base station while simultaneously exchanging useful cache content with another nearby user. We maximize the system sum rate by deriving closed form solutions for optimal power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model over other potential combinations of uplink NOMA and D2D communications.</description>

      <title>Global Estimation of Building-Integrated Facade and Rooftop Photovoltaic Potential by Integrating 3D Building Footprint and Spatio-Temporal Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research tackles the challenges of estimating Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) potential across various temporal and spatial scales, accounting for different geographical climates and urban morphology. We introduce a holistic methodology for evaluating BIPV potential, integrating 3D building footprint models with diverse meteorological data sources to account for dynamic shadow effects. The approach enables the assessment of PV potential on facades and rooftops at different levels-individual buildings, urban blocks, and cities globally. Through an analysis of 120 typical cities, we highlight the importance of 3D building forms, cityscape morphology, and geographic positioning in measuring BIPV potential at various levels. In particular, our simulation study reveals that among cities with optimal facade PV performance, the average ratio of facade PV potential to rooftop PV potential is approximately 68.2%. Additionally, approximately 17.5% of the analyzed samples demonstrate even higher facade PV potentials compared to rooftop installations. This finding underscores the strategic value of incorporating facade PV applications into urban sustainable energy systems.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Ambient Drift and Negative-Bias Temperature Instability in Foundry Carbon Nanotube Transistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Back-end-of-line (BEOL) logic integration is emerging as a complementary scaling path to supplement front-end-of-line (FEOL) Silicon. Among various options for BEOL logic, Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors (CNFETs) have been integrated within commercial silicon foundries, and complex CNFET circuits (e.g., RISC-V core, SRAM arrays) have been demonstrated. However, there lacks comprehensive studies that analyze the ambient drift (i.e., air-stability) and reliability of CNFETs. Here, for the first time, we thoroughly characterize and demonstrate how to overcome ambient drift and negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) in CNFETs using the following techniques: (1) Silicon Nitride encapsulation to limit ambient atmosphere induced threshold voltage shift (~8x reduction of median VT shift over 90 days) and (2) AC/pulsed operation to significantly improve CNFET NBTI vs. DC operation across a wide frequency range (e.g., 20% duty cycle AC operation at 10 MHz could extend CNFET NBTI time-to-failure by &gt;10000x vs. DC for a target VT shift tolerance &lt; 100 mV with gate stress bias VGS,stress = -1.2 V at 125 C).</description>

      <title>Analysis on reservoir activation with the nonlinearity harnessed from solution-processed molybdenum disulfide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a recurrent neural network designed for approximating complex dynamics in, for instance, motion tracking, spatial-temporal pattern recognition, and chaotic attractor reconstruction. Its implementation demands intense computation for the nonlinear transformation of the reservoir input, i.e. activating the reservoir. Configuring physical nonlinear networks as the reservoir and employing the physical nonlinearity for the reservoir activation is an emergent solution to address the challenge. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of harnessing the nonlinearity from solution-processed molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) for reservoir activation. We fit the high-order nonlinearity, achieved by Stark modulation of MoS2, as the activation function to facilitate implementation of a reservoir computing model. Due to the high-order nonlinearity, the model can achieve long-term synchronization and robust generalization for complex dynamical system regression. As a potential application exploring this ability, we appoint the model to generate chaotic random numbers for secure data encryption. Given this reservoir activation capability, and the scalability of solution-processed MoS2, our results suggest the potential for realizing physical reservoir computing with solution-processed MoS2.</description>

      <title>Enabling more efficient and cost-effective AI/ML systems with Collective Mind, virtualized MLOps, MLPerf, Collective Knowledge Playground and reproducible optimization tournaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This white paper introduces my educational community initiative to learn how to run AI, ML and other emerging workloads in the most efficient and cost-effective way across diverse models, data sets, software and hardware. This project leverages Collective Mind (CM), virtualized MLOps and DevOps (CM4MLOps), MLPerf benchmarks, and the Collective Knowledge playground (CK), which I have developed in collaboration with the community and MLCommons.
  I created Collective Mind as a small and portable Python package with minimal dependencies, a unified CLI and Python API to help researchers and engineers automate repetitive, tedious, and time-consuming tasks. I also designed CM as a distributed framework, continuously enhanced by the community through the CM4* repositories, which function as the unified interface for organizing and managing various collections of automations and artifacts. For example, CM4MLOps repository includes many automations, also known as CM scripts, to streamline the process of building, running, benchmarking, and optimizing AI, ML, and other workflows across ever-evolving models, data, and systems.
  I donated CK, CM and CM4MLOps to MLCommons to foster collaboration between academia and industry to learn how to co-design more efficient and cost-effective AI systems while capturing and encoding knowledge within Collective Mind, protecting intellectual property, enabling portable skills, and accelerating the transition of the state-of-the-art research into production. My ultimate goal is to collaborate with the community to complete my two-decade journey toward creating self-optimizing software and hardware that can automatically learn how to run any workload in the most efficient and cost-effective manner based on user requirements and constraints such as cost, latency, throughput, accuracy, power consumption, size, and other critical factors.</description>

Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices necessitates efficient data compression techniques to handle the vast amounts of data generated by these devices. Chemiresistive sensor arrays (CSAs), a simple-to-fabricate but crucial component in IoT systems, generate large volumes of data due to their simultaneous multi-sensor operations. Classical principal component analysis (cPCA) methods, a common solution to the data compression challenge, face limitations in preserving critical information during dimensionality reduction. In this study, we present self-adaptive quantum kernel (SAQK) PCA as a superior alternative to enhance information retention. Our findings demonstrate that SAQK PCA outperforms cPCA in various back-end machine-learning tasks, especially in low-dimensional scenarios where access to quantum bits is limited. These results highlight the potential of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers to revolutionize data processing in real-world IoT applications by improving the efficiency and reliability of CSA data compression and readout, despite the current constraints on qubit availability.</description>

      <title>RIRAG: Regulatory Information Retrieval and Answer Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05677</link>

Abstract: Regulatory documents, issued by governmental regulatory bodies, establish rules, guidelines, and standards that organizations must adhere to for legal compliance. These documents, characterized by their length, complexity and frequent updates, are challenging to interpret, requiring significant allocation of time and expertise on the part of organizations to ensure ongoing compliance. Regulatory Natural Language Processing (RegNLP) is a multidisciplinary field aimed at simplifying access to and interpretation of regulatory rules and obligations. We introduce a task of generating question-passages pairs, where questions are automatically created and paired with relevant regulatory passages, facilitating the development of regulatory question-answering systems. We create the ObliQA dataset, containing 27,869 questions derived from the collection of Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM) financial regulation documents, design a baseline Regulatory Information Retrieval and Answer Generation (RIRAG) system and evaluate it with RePASs, a novel evaluation metric that tests whether generated answers accurately capture all relevant obligations while avoiding contradictions.</description>

      <title>Unveiling and Mitigating Bias in Large Language Model Recommendations: A Path to Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10825</link>

Abstract: excel in delivering comprehensive suggestions by deeply analyzing content and user behavior. However, they often inherit biases from skewed training data, favoring mainstream content while underrepresenting diverse or non-traditional options. This study explores the interplay between bias and LLM-based recommendation systems, focusing on music, song, and book recommendations across diverse demographic and cultural groups. This paper analyzes bias in LLM-based recommendation systems across multiple models (GPT, LLaMA, and Gemini), revealing its deep and pervasive impact on outcomes. Intersecting identities and contextual factors, like socioeconomic status, further amplify biases, complicating fair recommendations across diverse groups. Our findings reveal that bias in these systems is deeply ingrained, yet even simple interventions like prompt engineering can significantly reduce it. We further propose a retrieval-augmented generation strategy to mitigate bias more effectively. Numerical experiments validate these strategies, demonstrating both the pervasive nature of bias and the impact of the proposed solutions.</description>

      <title>"Give me the code" -- Log Analysis of First-Year CS Students' Interactions With GPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3, GPT-4, and Bard in computer science (CS) education is expected to be profound. Students now have the power to generate code solutions for a wide array of programming assignments. For first-year students, this may be particularly problematic since the foundational skills are still in development and an over-reliance on generative AI tools can hinder their ability to grasp essential programming concepts. This paper analyzes the prompts used by 69 freshmen undergraduate students to solve a certain programming problem within a project assignment, without giving them prior prompt training. We also present the rules of the exercise that motivated the prompts, designed to foster critical thinking skills during the interaction. Despite using unsophisticated prompting techniques, our findings suggest that the majority of students successfully leveraged GPT, incorporating the suggested solutions into their projects. Additionally, half of the students demonstrated the ability to exercise judgment in selecting from multiple GPT-generated solutions, showcasing the development of their critical thinking skills in evaluating AI-generated code.</description>
