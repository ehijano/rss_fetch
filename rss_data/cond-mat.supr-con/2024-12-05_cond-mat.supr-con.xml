      <title>Understanding the origin of superconducting dome in electron-doped MoS$_2$ monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting properties of molybdenum disulphide (MoS$_2$) monolayer across a broad doping range, successfully recreating the so far unresolved superconducting dome. Our first-principles findings reveal several dynamically stable phases across the doping-dependent phase diagram. We observe a doping-induced increase in the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$, followed by a reduction in $T_c$ due to the formation of charge density waves (CDWs), polaronic distortions, and structural transition from the H to the 1T$'$ phase. Our work reconciles various experimental observations of CDWs in MoS$_2$ with its doping-dependent superconducting dome structure, which occurs due to the $1\times 1$ H to $2\times 2$ CDW phase transition.</description>

      <title>Proposal for Superconducting Photodiode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a concept of a superconducting photodiode - a device that transforms the energy and `spin' of an external electromagnetic field into the rectified steady-state supercurrent and develop a microscopic theory describing its properties. For this, we consider a two-dimensional thin film cooled down below the temperature of superconducting transition with the injected dc supercurrent and exposed to an external electromagnetic field with a frequency smaller than the superconducting gap. As a result, we predict the emergence of a photoexcited quasiparticle current, and, as a consequence, oppositely oriented stationary flow of Cooper pairs. The strength and direction of this photoinduced supercurrent depend on (i) such material properties as the effective impurity scattering time and the nonequilibrium quasiparticles' energy relaxation time and (ii) such electromagnetic field properties as its frequency and polarization.</description>

      <title>Gapped commensurate antiferromagnetic response in a strongly underdoped model cuprate superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a distinct possibility that spin fluctuations are the pairing interactions in a wide range of unconventional superconductors. In the case of the high-transition-temperature (high-$T_c$) cuprates, in which superconductivity emerges upon doping an antiferromagnetic Mott-insulating state, spin correlations might furthermore drive unusual pseudogap phenomena. Here we use polarized and unpolarized magnetic neutron scattering to study the simple tetragonal cuprate $\mathrm{HgBa}_{2}\mathrm{CuO}_{4+\delta}$ at very low doping ($T_c \approx 55$ K, hole concentration $p \approx 0.064$). In stark contrast to prior results for other underdoped cuprates, we find no evidence of incommensurate spin-density-wave, charge-spin stripe, or $q = 0$ magnetic order. Instead, the antiferromagnetic response in both the superconducting and pseudogap states is gapped below $\Delta_\mathrm{AF} \approx 6$ meV, commensurate over a wide energy range, and disperses above about 55 meV. Given the documented model nature of $\mathrm{HgBa}_{2}\mathrm{CuO}_{4+\delta}$, which exhibits high structural symmetry and minimal point disorder effects, we conclude that the observed behavior signifies the unmasked response of the quintessential $\mathrm{CuO}_{2}$ planes near the Mott-insulating state. These results for $\mathrm{HgBa}_{2}\mathrm{CuO}_{4+\delta}$ can therefore be expected to serve as a benchmark for a refined theoretical understanding of the cuprates.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek Dynamics &amp; Statistics of Topological Defects in Chiral Superfluid $^3$He Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In equilibrium, confined films of superfluid $^3$He-A have the chiral axis, $\hat{\ell}$, locked normal to the surface of the film. There are two degenerate ground states $\hat{\ell}\;||\pm\hat{z}$. However, for a temperature quench, i.e. cool down through the phase transition at a finite rate, causally disconnected regions of order parameter fluctuations develop and evolve into an inhomogeneous ordered phase that hosts both domain walls between time-reversed chiral phases as well as vortices with winding numbers $p\in\mathbb{Z}$. We present simulations based on a time-dependent generalization of Ginzburg-Landau theory for strong-coupling $^3$He that reveal both types of topological defects to be present following the temperature quench. Results for the dynamics of vortices interacting with anti-vortices as well as domain walls are presented. The vortex number density as a function of quench rate agrees well with the scaling predicted by Kibble and Zurek. We also present results for the number distribution and compare with other theoretical models for full counting statistics of the topological defect density. Finally, we present results for an asymmetry in the post-freeze-out populations of inequivalent vortex core structures that are characteristic of a chiral superfluid.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent nuclear energy-density functional theory toolkit for neutron star crust: Dynamics of a nucleus in a neutron superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new numerical tool designed to probe the dense layers of neutron star crusts. It is based on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory with generalized Skyrme nuclear energy-density functionals of the Brussels-Montreal family. We use it to study the time evolution of a nucleus accelerating through superfluid neutron medium in the inner crust of a neutron star. We extract an effective mass in the low velocity limit. We observe a threshold velocity and specify mechanisms of dissipation: phonon emission, Cooper pairs breaking, and vortex rings creation. These microscopic effects are of key importance for understanding various neutron star phenomena. Moreover, the mechanisms we describe are general and apply also to other fermionic superfluids interacting with obstacles like liquid helium or ultracold gases.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Majorana and Shiba states in a minimal Kitaev chain coupled to a superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07050v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two semiconducting quantum dots (QDs) coupled through a superconductor constitute a minimal realisation of a Kitaev chain with Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Such MZMs can be detected by e.g., tunneling conductance between each QD and normal leads [Dvir et al, Nature 614, 445 (2023)]. We here discuss how the seemingly trivial substitution of one of the normal leads by a superconducting (SC) one gives rise to a plethora of new effects. In particular, the coupling to the SC lead induces non-local Majorana effects upon variations of the QDs' energies. Furthermore, the lowest excitation of the chain is no longer determined by the bulk gap but rather by the energy of an emergent subgap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) state coexisting with the MZMs. The YSR state hybridizes with the MZMs when the coupling between the SC and the QD is larger than the spin splitting, spoiling the Majorana properties, including the quantized conductance.</description>

      <title>Origin of Robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Phases in Stacked Hermitian Systems: Non-Hermitian Level Repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators, which possess a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase, have attracted great attention for two decades. It is generally believed that when an even number of layers of the quantum spin Hall insulators are stacked, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase becomes unstable due to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ nature. While the counterexamples of the instability were observed in several literates, there is no systematic understanding. In this work, we provide a systematic understanding that the robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase in a Hermitian system with chiral symmetry against stacking. We clarify that the robustness generally originates from level repulsion in the corresponding non-Hermitian system derived from Hermitization. We demonstrate this by treating a class DIII superconductor in 1D with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology and the corresponding non-Hermitian 1D system in class AII$^\dagger$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topology.</description>

      <title>Quantized electrical, thermal, and spin transports of non-Hermitian clean and dirty two-dimensional topological insulators and superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From lattice-regularized models, devoid of any non-Hermitian (NH) skin effects, here we compute the electrical ($\sigma_{xy}$), thermal ($\kappa_{xy}$), and spin ($\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$) Hall, and the electrical ($G_{xx}$) and thermal ($G^{th}_{xx}$) longitudinal conductivities for appropriate NH planar topological insulators and superconductors related to all five non-trivial Altland-Zirbauer symmetry classes in their Hermitian limits. These models feature real eigenvalues over an extended NH parameter regime, only where the associated topological invariants remain quantized. In this regime, the NH quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators show quantized $\sigma_{xy}$ and $G_{xx}$, respectively, the NH $p+ip$ ($p \pm ip$) pairing shows half-quantized $\kappa_{xy}$ ($G^{th}_{xx}$), while the NH $d+id$ pairing shows quantized $\kappa_{xy}$ and $\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$ in the clean and weak disorder (due to random pointlike charge impurities) regimes. We compute these quantities in experimentally realizable suitable six-terminal setups using the Kwant software package. But, in the strong disorder regime, all these topological responses vanish and with the increasing non-Hermiticity in the system this generic phenomenon occurs at weaker disorder.</description>
