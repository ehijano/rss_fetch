      <title>Multi-Parameter Rating Methodology for Systematic Comparison of Theoretical Models with Experimental Data in Heavy-Ion Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel multi-parameter rating methodology for objective comparison of theoretical models with experimental data in heavy-ion collisions, addressing fundamental limitations of the traditional global $\chi^2$/ndf criterion. The methodology divides phase space into seven physically motivated kinematic regions reflecting distinct production mechanisms from thermal freeze-out to perturbative QCD. Each region receives a quality score $Q_i \in [10, 1000]$ via logarithmic transformation of local $\chi^2_i/\nu_i$ statistics, ranging from 10 (very poor agreement) to 1000 (perfect agreement). A composite rating $R$ aggregates weighted average, geometric mean, and minimum scores with dispersion penalty, preventing compensation of poor agreement in one region by artificial success elsewhere. Demonstrated on real ALICE and representative LHCb data for $K^0_S$ mesons and $\Lambda$ hyperons at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV in p-Pb collisions, the methodology reveals that no universal model exists: PYTHIA8 excels for mesons ($R=879$) via nuclear PDFs, while models with coalescence are potentially superior for baryons. The baryon anomaly peak serves as critical discriminator, with highest quality scores $Q_i \sim 950\text{--}1000$ in zones $3\text{--}4$. The methodology is transparent, reproducible, fully algorithmic, and ready for integration into standard analysis frameworks.</description>

      <title>Tailored PDFs for New Physics searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the non-negligible interplay between parton distribution functions (PDFs) at large x and potential New Physics (NP) effects in the high-energy tails of hadron collider observables, a central question is which PDFs can be reliably employed in beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) analyses. In this work, we examine the fine balance between using PDF sets with small uncertainties in the large-x region -- crucial for maximising BSM sensitivity -- and adopting conservative PDF fits that exclude high-energy data potentially contaminated by unaccounted NP contributions. We systematically assess a range of conservative PDF fitting strategies designed to mitigate such biases and provide a recommendation for the class of PDFs best suited for robust BSM searches. In addition, we investigate the alternative approach of performing simultaneous fits of Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) Wilson coefficients and PDFs, thereby consistently accounting for their mutual correlations. Starting from a toy model to illustrate the underlying mechanisms, we then analyse two realistic NP scenarios: one modifying high-mass Drell-Yan production and another affecting the high-invariant-mass tail of top-quark pair production. Both cases are representative of measurements that will be probed with high precision during the High-Luminosity phase of the LHC.</description>

      <title>Linking Leptogenesis and Asymmetric Dark Matter: A Testable Framework for Neutrino Mass and the Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a minimal extension of the Leptogenesis framework that simultaneously explains the observed baryon asymmetry and dark matter (DM) abundance through the decay of a heavy Majorana neutrino. In this scenario, CP violation arises from complex Yukawa couplings, enabling the generation of asymmetries in both the Standard Model (SM) and DM sectors. We explore two regimes: (i) wash-in, where an initial dark asymmetry is transferred to SM leptons by $2 \leftrightarrow 2$ scattering processes; and (ii) co-genesis, featuring a hierarchical coupling structure that allows enhanced CP violation while supporting a low-scale seesaw mechanism at order $\mathcal{O}(2)$ TeV. This setup not only links light neutrino masses to the Majorana mass term but also suggests that lepton-number violation may occur at experimentally accessible energy scales. In the co-genesis scenario, we show spin-independent cross sections for DM heavier than 10 GeV that can be tested in current direct detection experiments and motivate the exploration of cross sections inside the neutrino fog for lighter DM masses, establishing asymmetric leptogenesis as a predictive benchmark framework for direct-detection experiments and identifying a new hierarchical-coupling regime enabling TeV-scale leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Warm dark matter from freeze-in at stronger coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study warm Higgs portal dark matter (DM) in the framework of freeze-in at stronger coupling. This scenario assumes that the Standard Model thermal bath temperature has always been relatively low, which suppresses dark matter production. As a result, a significant DM-Higgs coupling is allowed, enabling warm dark matter detection via Higgs decay at colliders. We find that the Lyman-{\alpha} bound on the DM mass is particularly strong, excluding masses below 50-100 keV, depending on further details. The shape of the DM momentum distribution is highly non-thermal, with low momenta being effectively cut off, and not captured by the common {\alpha}{\beta}{\gamma}-parametrization.</description>

      <title>Unitarity violation and restoration in radiative bound-state formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art calculations motivated by dark matter exhibit severe violation of partial-wave unitarity in the non-relativistic regime in radiative bound-state-formation processes. It has been recently shown, in a model-independent fashion, that unitarity is restored by the proper resummation of the inelastic contributions to the self-energy of the incoming state. In this work, we first derive Kramers-like formulae for individual partial waves, demonstrating that existing calculations of bound-state formation severely violate unitarity. We then discuss how unitarity is restored through the resummation of the absorptive contributions to the incoming-state self-energy, generated by bound-state formation processes, taking into account their analytic structure in the complex momentum plane. Our results can be generalized in a variety of theories and employed in phenomenological studies, such as dark-matter freeze-out, indirect detection and self-interactions.</description>

      <title>Charged Higgs Decay to Bottom and Charm Quarks from $Z_3$-Flavored Two Higgs Doublet Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenology of a charged Higgs present in a model with two Higgs SU(2) doublets and a $Z_3$ flavor symmetry is analyzed. It is shown that it is possible to generate an enhancement of its flavor changing coupling to c and b quarks and also to reproduce the ATLAS excess associated to the process $H^\pm \to bc$ for a charge Higgs mass of $130$~GeV. Furthermore, by considering the possibility of a search at the future LHeC, the analysis suggests viability for its detection.</description>

      <title>Supercooled Phase Transitions with Radiative Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions produce gravitational waves and primordial black holes. They always occur in field theories where symmetries are radiatively broken and masses are correspondingly generated. These theories predict a period of supercooling: phase transitions become effective at temperatures much smaller than the symmetry-breaking scale. This paper reviews a model-independent approach to study phase transitions in this scenario, which can be adopted if supercooling is strong enough. Perturbative methods can be used to determine the effective action and such model-independent approach allows us to obtain ready-to-use formulas that can be applied to any specific model of this sort.</description>

      <title>Resummed azimuthal decorrelation and transverse momentum imbalance of dijets at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the azimuthal decorrelation $\delta\phi$ and transverse momentum imbalance $q_T$ in dijet production at the LHC, offering intriguing insights into the dynamics of quantum chromodynamics. We define the jet axes using the recoil-free winner-take-all (WTA) recombination scheme. For the azimuthal decorrelation $\delta\phi$, this axis choice eliminates non-global logarithms (NGLs) entirely. For the transverse momentum imbalance $q_T$, NGLs emerge specifically in the small jet radius limit ($R \ll 1$). In this regime, the WTA scheme simplifies the theoretical framework by restricting jet radius logarithms to the soft sector. We derive factorization formulae for both observables within soft-collinear effective theory. To address the small-$R$ NGLs in the $q_T$ distribution, we refactorize the soft function into global soft, collinear-soft, and ultra-collinear-soft modes. We perform the resummation of global large logarithms $\ln(\delta\phi)$ and $\ln(q_T/Q)$ up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. For the $q_T$ distribution, this is combined with a leading-logarithmic resummation of the non-global $\ln R$ terms. We match our predictions to leading fixed-order $O(\alpha_s^3)$ calculations. We also numerically investigate the structure of the first subleading power corrections. Comparisons with PYTHIA8 simulations demonstrate that the observables we consider are robust against non-perturbative multi-parton interactions and hadronization effects.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Radiation from Cosmic-Ray Scatterings on Relic Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray scatterings on the cosmic neutrino background induce a flux of gamma-rays and X-rays from boosted meson decays and charged lepton processes. Here we present the first estimate of this flux and its cumulative cosmological contribution. Confronting expectations with Fermi-LAT diffuse gamma-ray data, we find a limit on the cosmic neutrino background overdensity at the level of $\eta \lesssim 2 \times 10^{4}$ for a lightest neutrino mass of $m_{\nu}\gtrsim0.1$ eV, orders of magnitude stronger than current direct laboratory probes, and comparable to constraints on the cosmic neutrino background obtained with IceCube. We further show that X-ray synchrotron emission from cascade electron-positron pairs in intergalactic magnetic fields provides a complementary, albeit weaker, constraint. We discuss how anisotropic signatures and future gamma-ray data from CTA could further improve bounds on the relic neutrino overdensity, approaching in sensitivity the $\Lambda$CDM expected density.</description>

      <title>INFLAVON: CMB as cosmic tracer of Flavor physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unify one of the most widely studied frameworks to explain the hierarchical structure of the flavor sector in the Standard Model, the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism, with cosmic inflation. We propose that the complex scalar field, the so-called flavon, which breaks the Froggatt-Nielsen $U(1)$ symmetry and generates the Yukawa couplings of the Standard Model, to also drive inflation, which we dub as Inflavon. After inflation ends, the decay of the inflavon reheats the Universe, establishing a novel link between early Universe cosmology and flavor physics. As concrete examples, we present realizations where the inflavon potential is described by an $\alpha$-attractor potential. We then compute the resulting CMB observables, specifically the spectral index ($n_s$), the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$), and the amplitude of scalar perturbations ($A_s$) as functions of the underlying Froggatt-Nielsen model parameters. We identify the parameter space in Froggatt-Nielsen models involving the scale of Flavor symmetry breaking $\Lambda_{\rm FN}$ and FN charges which is ruled out by Planck and ACT data, as well as the region that could be probed by next-generation CMB experiments like CMB-S4, SO and LiteBIRD. We also discuss inflavon as dark matter and its isocurvature constraints.</description>

      <title>Earth Matter Enhanced Axion Dark Matter Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laboratory searches for ultralight axion dark matter (DM) have traditionally assumed the terrestrial density of axions is equal to the average density of DM in the solar system. However, quadratic couplings to matter introduce a non-trivial field profile near the Earth. In this work, we present the first dedicated experimental implementation of this environment-aware axion DM wind search framework. Leveraging the extreme sensitivity of a K--Rb--$^{21}$Ne comagnetometer to pseudo-magnetic fields induced by axion DM, we analyzed our data in the context of the massively enhanced local gradient of axions due to interactions with matter, though no signal candidates were found. Consequently, we have set the most stringent limits on axion-neutron derivative interactions for masses $m_a \in [0.041, ~28.9]~\rm feV$, improving from previous experiments that ignore terrestrial matter effects by as much as three orders of magnitude for certain masses. Our work highlights the necessity of accounting for environmental modifications in precision frontier experiments and demonstrates how geophysical variations can be harnessed to act as a natural amplifier for DM possibly enabling future detection in parts of the parameter space that were previously beyond reach.</description>

      <title>Probing $D_s^+ \to \eta^{(\prime)} \ell^+\nu_\ell$ semileptonic decay within LCSR under chiral heavy quark effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the successful application of Heavy Quark Effective Field Theory in describing decays from heavy to light mesons, this work explores its applicability to the semileptonic decays of charmed mesons. So in this paper we investigate the $D_s^+\to \eta^{(\prime)} \ell^+ \nu_\ell$ transition form factors using the light-cone sum rules approach within the framework of heavy-quark effective field theory. To address the large uncertainties arsing from the $\eta^{(\prime)}$-meson twist-3 distribution amplitudes, we employ the right-handed chiral correlation function. By applying the converging simplified series expansion method, we extrapolate the form factors to the entire physical $q^2$-region. Our analysis yields the branching fractions precise predictions for semi-leptonic decays $D_s^+\to \eta^{(\prime)}\ell^+\nu_\ell$ with : $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+\to\eta \ell^+\nu_\ell)=2.300^{+0.230}_{-0.227}\%$ ($\ell = e$) and $2.249_{-0.206}^{+0.209}\%$ ($\ell = \mu$); $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+\to\eta^\prime \ell^+\nu_\ell)=0.861^{+0.095}_{-0.093}\%$ ($\ell = e$) and $0.821^{+0.082}_{-0.080}\%$ ($\ell = \mu$). The derived lepton flavor universality ratios $R^{\eta}_{\mu,e}=0.977^{+0.008}_{-0.006}$ and $R^{\eta^{\prime}}_{\mu,e} = 0.953^{+0.011}_{-0.009}$ are consistent with lasted BESIII experimental measurements. Additionally, the forward-backward asymmetry parameters $\langle \mathcal{A}^{\eta}_{\rm FB}\rangle=-0.034^{+0.003}_{-0.003}$ and $\langle \mathcal{A}^{\eta^\prime}_{\rm FB}\rangle=-0.073^{+0.007}_{-0.008}$ suggest that no significant violation of lepton flavor universality in this decay process.</description>

      <title>Is a covariant virtual tachyon viable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sidney Coleman has noted that superluminal particles or observers would be able to go back in time and have no definite trajectory according to subluminal observers, while not violating Lorentz invariance [1]. Recently, Dragan and Ekert have significantly developed similar ideas even further, which lead to formulation of ``quantum principle of relativity'' that intimately links the two theories [2]. However, field theory descriptions of an on-shell tachyon, described by scalar field $\phi$ with negative mass squared parameter, lead to violation of basic principles of relativity or quantum mechanics. In this work, we investigate whether purely virtual tachyons can be consistent within the fakeon framework-the only known viable formulation of purely virtual particles. We identify two fatal obstructions. First, Lorentz boosts mix creation and annihilation operators, rendering the canonical commutation relations non-invariant despite formal invariance of the vacuum. Second, the real part of the tachyon Feynman propagator and Wheeler propagator have disjoint support, preventing application of both the fakeon prescription and Wheeler-Feynman absorber mechanism. Interactions with stable Standard Model fields further violate Lorentz invariance and the equivalence principle, and we provide quantitative limit on coupling strength of such scenario. Our analysis excludes possibility of formulating covariant quantum field theory of interacting virtual tachyons.</description>

      <title>Update analysis of $\psi(3686)\to p\bar{p}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated analysis of the angular distribution for $\psi(3686) \to p\bar{p}$ decay, taking into account transverse beam polarization, to investigate potential sources of forward-backward asymmetry and azimuthal modulation beyond the simple $1+\alpha\cos^2\theta$ form. We focus on the interference between the $\psi(3686)$ resonance and the two-photon exchange continuum process, as well as the background from initial-state-final-state radiation interference. A maximum-likelihood fit to the $\cos\theta$ distribution of $\psi(3686)\to p\bar{p}$ yields $\alpha = 1.00 \pm 0.03$, consistent with previous results. The fitted contributions from the two-photon interference are small but non-negligible, while the ISR-FSR background is negligible. Our model predicts a significant $\sin(2\phi)$ modulation in the azimuthal angle, indicating the influence of transverse beam polarization. These findings motivate future two-dimensional angular analyses to fully disentangle the polarization and interference dynamics in charmonium decays to baryon pairs.</description>

      <title>Sterile Neutrino as an Asymmetric Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a minimal and predictive framework for asymmetric sterile neutrino dark matter (DM) produced via freeze-in. The Standard Model (SM) is extended by a gauge-singlet Dirac sterile neutrino carrying a conserved dark charge, a real scalar mediator, and an auxiliary singlet fermion. DM is generated through the out-of-equilibrium decay of the mediator, which simultaneously produces a particle{antiparticle asymmetry in the sterile sector controlled by a CP-violating parameter. We show that the observed relic abundance can be naturally reproduced without thermal equilibration with the SM plasma. The resulting non-thermal momentum distribution is colder than a thermal Fermi{Dirac spectrum, ensuring consistency with structure formation constraints. Combining relic density, Lyman-{\alpha}, Higgs invisible decay, and big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) bounds, we identify correlated and predictive regions of the parameter space characterized by non-trivial relations among the sterile neutrino mass and the decay parameters. This scenario provides a self-consistent realization of Dirac asymmetric sterile neutrino DM within an asymmetric freeze-in (AFI) framework, offering a constrained and testable alternative to conventional production mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Structure of near-threshold states in systems with Coulomb and short-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nature of near-threshold eigenstates in systems with the attractive Coulomb plus short-range interactions. Using a model providing the Coulomb-modified effective range expansion, we analyze pole trajectories and the internal structure of near-threshold states characterized by the compositeness. We find that bound state and resonance poles are disconnected in the presence of the attractive Coulomb interaction, in contrast to the repulsive Coulomb force. Near the threshold, bound states become almost purely composite, while the behavior of the compositeness near unityis controlled by the competition between the Coulomb and short-range interactions, characterized by the Bohr radius and the Coulomb effective range.</description>

      <title>Atomic Spectroscopy Probes of New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision spectroscopy has long played a central role in testing the foundations of physics, from the early insights that led to the development of quantum mechanics to the validation of quantum electrodynamics and the determination of fundamental constants. Today, advances in atomic and molecular spectroscopy enable sensitive searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. A broad class of well-motivated extensions predicts new light degrees of freedom with feeble couplings to electrons, muons, and nucleons, giving rise to tiny spin-independent interactions that can be probed at low energies. In this review, we present a unified overview of spectroscopic searches for such interactions. We discuss the effective theoretical framework connecting fundamental interactions to atomic and nuclear observables, survey the key experimental and theoretical strategies, and review the atomic and molecular systems providing the strongest sensitivity. We conclude with updated spectroscopic constraints on representative benchmark models, highlighting the unique and complementary role of precision spectroscopy in exploring new fundamental interactions.</description>

      <title>Dark Temperature Hierarchies and Gravitational Waves from the Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of a semi-decoupled dark sector with a temperature hierarchy relative to the Standard Model plasma on the electroweak phase transition and its associated gravitational wave signal. Working within a minimal Higgs-portal extension, we allow the dark sector to possess a higher temperature at the electroweak epoch while remaining consistent with cosmological bounds on additional relativistic degrees of freedom. The temperature hierarchy modifies the thermal structure of the effective potential and alters nucleation dynamics without requiring large portal couplings or extreme supercooling. Within the cosmologically allowed window, we find a monotonic enhancement of the gravitational wave amplitude by more than an order of magnitude compared to the standard thermal case, accompanied by a shift of the peak frequency within the millihertz regime. The resulting stochastic background moves substantially closer to the projected sensitivity of future space-based interferometers. Our results demonstrate that hidden-sector temperature hierarchies can leave observable imprints on electroweak-scale phase transitions even in minimal and perturbative frameworks.</description>

      <title>GOOFy -- a systematic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate in detail a new class (GOOFy) of transformations for bosonic and fermionic fields that leave the Lagrangian density unchanged. The transformations act upon complex scalar fields \Phi and \Phi^\dagger employing generalized charge conjugation (C) transformation in a non-consistent manner, i.e. allowing for \Phi\dagger \to (\Phi\dagger)^\prime \neq (\Phi^\prime)^\dagger. Requiring invariance of the kinetic terms under such transformations specifies the form of (\Phi\dagger)^\prime. An analogous strategy is also adopted for fermionic fields. This offers a systematic way to construct new GOOFy-invariant field-theoretical models. It turns out that theories which are invariant with respect these GOOFy transformations satisfy relations among parameters that are found to be RGE-stable up to two and three loop orders, thus constituting fixed-points under running of the RGE. This has been verified for various theories containing different numbers of bosonic and fermionic fields. In particular it has been shown that the Standard Model (SM) can not be a viable electroweak theory if demanding invariance under GOOFy transformations. However, the two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) may be invariant under GOOFy transformations (Yukawa couplings included), providing an interesting phenomenological example of physics beyond the SM. The most striking aspect of this study is the RGE stability of new relations between model parameters in a wide class of field theories. We also present a set of new relations between 2HDM potential parameters that constitute a fixed point under the running of the RGE up to at least three loop order.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence of Top Quark Pairs Produced at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum coherence in top-antitop production at the LHC by comparing Standard Model predictions with CMS data across different kinematic regimes. Theory and experiment are statistically consistent in the near-threshold and boosted central regions, confirming that the spin-density framework captures the dominant helicity-interference structure. The intermediate-mass window shows a noticeable deviation, indicating enhanced sensitivity to radiative QCD effects. This work reinterprets measured spin-correlation data within a quantum-coherence framework, thereby introducing coherence as a complementary and experimentally grounded probe of the Standard Model spin structure and a potentially sensitive diagnostic of new-physics effects in the top-quark sector.</description>

      <title>Scalar Lie point symmetries of the Standard Model with one or two real gauge singlets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a classification of all scalar Lie point symmetries of the Standard Model with one or two real gauge-singlet scalars (SM+S and SM+2S). By analyzing the associated field equations, we identify all realizable and inequivalent Lie point symmetry algebras of these models, distinguishing strict variational, variational (including divergence symmetries), and Euler--Lagrange cases. In addition, we devise efficient algorithms that, for any given numerical instance of the models, determine the Lie point symmetry algebra in each of the three categories by a parameter-based decision procedure using affine reparametrizations and simple parameter tests, thereby avoiding explicit symmetry analysis and the need to derive and solve the determining equations. Finally, we prove several relevant general results, including a characterization of the three disjoint types of Lie point symmetry generators -- strict variational, divergence, and non-variational -- for a broad class of Lagrangians with potentials, including the SM+S and SM+2S.</description>

      <title>Extending the Kinetic Mass to Higher Orders in $1/m_Q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, the kinetic mass is defined in terms of the pole mass and operators at order $1/m_Q^2$, which are known to N$^3$LO accuracy in $\alpha_s$. At the same time, the Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE) for inclusive semileptonic decays is known up to and including terms of order $1/m_Q^5$. Therefore, it is desirable to extend the definition of the kinetic mass to higher orders in $1/m_Q$. The original kinetic mass is based on the hadron-mass formula in Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET). However, the HQE is formulated in terms of matrix elements defined in full QCD to avoid the appearance of non-local matrix elements. To avoid this, we develop a definition of the kinetic mass rooted in full QCD. Starting from the hadron-mass formula derived from the energy-momentum tensor of full QCD, we define a relation between a general mass and the pole mass. Using a simple cut-off scheme, we compute a generalized kinetic mass at one loop to all powers of $1/m_Q$, which reproduces the well-known results for the kinetic mass up to $1/m_Q^2$. Our approach opens the road to a consistent use of the kinetic mass at higher-orders in the heavy quark expansion.</description>

      <title>CP Violation in $D \to KK$ Decays: A Comparative Analysis of Triplet and Sextet Diquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the CP asymmetry in the decay $D^0 \rightarrow K_S^0 K_S^0$ by the CMS collaboration, $A_{CP}(K_S^0 K_S^0) = (6.2 \pm 3.0 \pm 0.2 \pm 0.8)\%$, and by LHCb, $A_{CP}(D^0 \to K_S^0 K_S^0) = (1.86 \pm 0.23 \pm 0.11)\%$, suggest possible deviations from Standard Model (SM) expectations, which predict asymmetries below the percent level. This singly Cabibbo-suppressed decay is particularly sensitive to new physics, as the leading amplitudes vanish in the exact U-spin symmetry limit and the process is dominated by W-exchange topologies. We investigate scalar diquark contributions to this decay, comparing color-sextet and color-triplet representations. We find that the color-sextet diquark, characterized by a symmetric color structure $(C_1^{\mathrm{NP}} = C_2^{\mathrm{NP}})$, avoids color suppression and can generate CP asymmetries in the range $0.5\%$--$1.5\%$ for a diquark mass of order 1~TeV. In contrast, the color-triplet contribution is strongly suppressed due to destructive interference from its antisymmetric color structure. We further show that a flavor hierarchy in the sextet couplings, with $\lambda_{ud} &gt; \lambda_{us}$, can simultaneously account for the observed deviation from the U-spin sum rule in $D^0 \to K^+ K^-$ and $D^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ and the measured CP asymmetry in $D^0 \to K_S^0 K_S^0$. These results identify color-sextet scalar diquarks as viable candidates for explaining enhanced CP violation in charm decays.</description>

      <title>Optimal alignment of Lorentz orientation and generalization to matrix Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14994v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist elegant methods of aligning point clouds in $\mathbb R^3$. Unfortunately, these methods fail to generalize to the case of Minkowski space, as we will show. Instead, we propose two solutions to the following problem: given inertial reference frames $A$ and $B$, and given (possibly noisy) measurements of a set of 4-vectors $\{v_i\}$ made in those reference frames with components $\{v_{A,i}\}$ and $\{v_{B,i}\}$, find the optimal Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$ such that $\Lambda v_{A,i}=v_{B,i}$. The first method is direct least squares optimization through a parametrization of $SO(3,1)_+$ in terms of the familiar boost and rotation vectors. The second method takes a detour through the Lorentz algebra; in addition to being conceptually simple and possessing a computational advantage over the first method, it can easily be generalized to the alignment of vector representations in other matrix Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Physical Predictions in Closed Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in gravitational path integrals indicate that the nonperturbative physical Hilbert space of a closed universe is one-dimensional within each superselection sector. This raises a basic puzzle: how can a unique quantum-gravity state give rise to semiclassical physics, measurement outcomes, and classical probabilities? In this paper, we develop a framework in which nontrivial and statistically stable predictions emerge despite the one-dimensionality of the fully constrained Hilbert space. The key idea is to extract physical predictions in an enlarged, unconstrained Hilbert space by conditioning on observational data. We show that partial observability -- reflecting the limited access of observers to the degrees of freedom of the universe -- suppresses ensemble fluctuations associated with microscopic structure in the gravitational path integral, thereby restoring semiclassical predictability with exponential accuracy. We formulate the construction explicitly including contributions from the Hartle--Hawking no-boundary state, define a gauge-invariant Hilbert space for observations via a density operator, and generalize the formalism to conditioning on histories, clarifying the emergence of classical probabilities and an effective arrow of time. Finally, we explore whether this framework can support a realistic cosmology and identify assumptions that the underlying theory of quantum gravity must satisfy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a quintessence field with an exponential potential motivated by the suggestion of time-varying dark energy from the DESI galaxy survey. Assuming a kination epoch in the early Universe, we analytically derive constraints on initial conditions that are consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the current dark energy density. Compared to the severe 120-digit fine-tuning required for dark energy to be a cosmological constant, our result suggests that the degree of fine-tuning is naturally relaxed by dozens of orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we discuss the method for testing this model through future observations of the gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess from a Generic Triaxial Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of Galactic surveys, such as Gaia, have revealed that the Milky Way's gravitational potential comes from a matter distribution that is triaxial and rotated with respect to the Galactic center-Sun axis. This, in turn, could mean that the dark matter halo also shares these properties. In this work, by fitting to the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations, we test the compatibility of the morphology of the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) from dark matter annihilation with a triaxial dark matter halo. In particular, we consider both untilted triaxial halos and halos whose principal axes are tilted with respect to the Galactic disk. In our fits of the Fermi-LAT data, by testing over a large library of galactic diffuse emission models, we quantify how the halo triaxiality and tilt affect the line-of-sight-integrated annihilation signal and, consequently, the preferred GCE spatial templates. We find that the GCE spectrum and inner cuspiness are robust against variations in the triaxiality and tilt of the dark matter halo. However, in terms of its overall morphology, the GCE in the gamma-ray data can discriminate between choices for the dark matter halo's triaxiality and tilt. Finally, we find that the GCE is more compatible with originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of dark matter than originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of stars, a result important for understanding the GCE's origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Known holographic dictionaries, especially AdS/CFT, rely on symmetry matching between the bulk and the boundary. We take a step toward a holographic dictionary with no symmetry requirement and without assuming the geometry being asymptotically AdS. Starting from any interacting Majorana generalized free field on a $(0+1)$d boundary and its two-point function data, we derive a concise analytic formula for the dual $(1+1)$d bulk geometry, borrowing techniques from unitary matrix integral and inverse scattering. Using this formula, we compute the near-horizon curvature, give conditions for positive versus negative curvature, and identify simple boundary models with de Sitter or anti-de Sitter near-horizon duals. We also study the large-$q$ SYK model, finding an unusual temperature dependence of the near-horizon curvature, related to the discrepancy between physical temperature and the ``fake disk'' temperature. We also construct, directly from boundary operators, approximate algebras generated by null translations and boost that become exact at the bifurcate horizon.</description>

      <title>Exploring differential two-particle correlations in $\gamma p$ and low-multiplicity pp collisions using PYTHIA8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A study of two-particle differential number ($B$) and transverse momentum ($P_{2}^\mathrm{CD}$) balance functions in photon-proton ($\gamma p$) and proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 5.36 TeV is presented. The analysis focuses on inclusive charged hadrons within the pseudorapidity coverage $|\eta|&lt;2.4$ and the transverse momentum interval $0.3 &lt; p_\mathrm{T} &lt; 3.0$ GeV and examines their correlations in terms of relative pseudorapidity ($\Delta\eta$) and relative azimuthal angle ($\Delta\phi$). The correlation functions are evaluated for same- and opposite-sign pairs, and their combinations are used to extract charge-dependent (CD) and charge-independent (CI) components. The evolution of the near-side peak of the CD correlations is investigated in terms of $\Delta\eta$ and $\Delta\phi$ as a function of charged-particle multiplicity ($N_\mathrm{ch}$) for $\gamma p$ collisions and compared to pp collisions at a similar multiplicity range. A clear multiplicity dependence of the balance function width is obtained. The width is found systematically lower in $\gamma p$ events than in pp collisions. This study provides valuable information on particle correlations and production mechanisms in low-$N_\mathrm{ch}$ regimes for upcoming measurements in small systems.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on Neutrino Masses in Quintessential Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quintessential inflation provides a unified description of the early and late accelerated phases of the Universe, linking the inflationary epoch to the present-day dark energy-dominated era through a single scalar degree of freedom. In this work, we explore the implications of this unification for cosmological constraints on the sum of neutrino masses. Focusing on the $\alpha$-attractor scenario, we implement the model in a modified version of the Boltzmann solver CLASS to compute the relevant cosmological observables and perform a Bayesian parameter estimation analysis using data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), and Type Ia supernovae. The model naturally breaks the degeneracy between the dark energy equation of state and the total neutrino mass, yielding tight upper bounds of $\sum m_\nu&lt; 0.067$ eV for flat spatial geometry and $\sum m_\nu&lt; 0.116$ eV when curvature is included. We also provide forecasts for future probes, showing that the Simons Observatory, LiteBIRD, and Euclid configurations may reduce the uncertainty on $\sum m_\nu$ by $\approx 9\%$, while the precision on the quintessential parameter $\alpha_{QI}$ is improved by $\approx 72\%$. These results highlight the importance of consistently accounting for neutrino mass when assessing the viability of extensions to the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Spatial confinement-deconfinement transition in accelerated gluodynamics within lattice simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the influence of weak acceleration on the confinement-deconfinement phase transition in gluodynamics. Our study is carried out within lattice simulation in the comoving reference frame of accelerated observer which is parameterized by the Rindler coordinates. We find that finite temperature confinement-deconfinement phase transition turns into spatial crossover in the Rindler spacetime. In other words, spatially separated confinement and deconfinement phases can coexist in the Rindler spacetime within certain intervals of temperature and acceleration. We determine the position of the boundary between the phases as a function of temperature for several accelerations and find that it can be described by the Tolman-Ehrenfest law with rather good accuracy although a minor deviation takes place. Moreover, the critical temperature of the system in the weak acceleration regime is found to remain unchanged as that of the standard homogeneous gluodynamics. Our results imply that the spatial confinement-deconfinement transition might take place in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild black hole horizon.</description>

      <title>Self-duality of massless scalar three-point amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that massless scalar three-point amplitudes are self-dual under Fourier transformation. This implies that the momentum space amplitude can be expressed as the position space amplitude of the same graph with transformed edge-weights (not the dual graph) if external vertices are labeled accordingly. In particular, a massless scalar three-point integral can be expressed as a graphical function. The result follows immediately from a theorem by M. Golz, E. Panzer and the author on parametric representations of position space integrals (2015), but it was only observed by X. Jiang in 2025 in the context of four-dimensional Super-Yang-Mills theory. We generalize Jiang's result and discuss the consequences of the self-duality in the context of graphical functions. In particular, we derive a new identity for graphical functions and a new twist relation for scalar integrals (Feynman periods) in $\phi^4$ theory.</description>

      <title>Empirical formula for total inelastic cross-section of proton-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generic empirical formula for total inelastic cross-sections for various target nuclei scattered by a proton at different energies, which is applicable over a wide range of energy from $15 ~MeV$ to $1~ TeV$. The proposed model is parameterized based on the fitting of extensively studied experimental cross-section data for the Aluminium and Carbon nucleus targets, considering factorization over high-energy and low-energy regimes. The parameters in high-energy formula are determined by the fitting of the high-energy saturation value of the inelastic scattering cross-section data with mass numbers. The universality of the empirical formula is investigated by comparing the model prediction with the experimental data of inelastic proton-nucleus scattering over a wide range from light elements such as Deuterium to heavy elements such as Uranium. A detailed comparison with the existing models and GEANT4 simulation is also presented.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Consistent Description of Compact Stars of Two Interacting Fluids: The Case of Neutron Stars with Higgs Portal Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a thermodynamically consistent approach for the computation of the masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities of compact stars consisting of two interacting fluids with separately conserved quantum numbers. We apply this interacting fluid approach to the case of compact stars of neutron star matter with the Higgs portal fermionic dark matter model for the first time in a thermodynamically consistent manner. The patterns for the mass-radius curves and the tidal deformability depend on the dark matter particle mass and are different from former studies. Compared to ordinary neutron star properties, we obtain smaller masses and radii for dark matter particle masses similar to the nucleon mass and, hence, smaller tidal deformabilities as a result of the softening of the equation of state due to the presence of dark matter. For dark matter particle masses below the nucleon mass and sizable chemical potentials with respect to the dark matter particle mass, there will be a dark halo instead of dark core. Our investigation provides the basis for studying mergers of compact stars where the two fluids of neutron star matter and dark matter are coupled kinetically to each other and are described by one combined energy-momentum tensor of the two interacting fluids but are chemically different with two separately conserved number currents.</description>

      <title>Resolving the QCD Axion Domain Wall Problem with a Light Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two novel solutions to the domain wall problem of the QCD axion by introducing a massless or light axion that also couples to gluons. The first solution applies when the new axion forms strings after inflation. Due to its mixing with the QCD axion, domain walls of the QCD axion are bounded by these strings and confined into cosmologically safe string bundles. This scenario predicts the existence of such string bundles, which may survive until today and leave observable signatures, such as gravitational waves, cosmic birefringence, and CMB anisotropies. The simultaneous detection of the QCD axion and any of these cosmological signatures would serve as a smoking-gun signal. The second solution assumes a homogeneous initial condition for the new axion. If it is sufficiently light, its potential temporarily induces a bias in the QCD axion potential before the onset of oscillations, rendering the domain walls unstable. In both scenarios, the Peccei-Quinn mechanism remains effective, and the strong CP problem is not reintroduced. We identify the viable parameter regions and discuss the resulting dark matter abundance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the advantages of a polarized electron beam at Belle II, as proposed for ``Chiral Belle'', in the search for invisibly decaying (dark) bosons that weakly couple to the Standard Model. By measuring the polarization dependence of the production cross section of dark bosons in association with a photon, the dark boson's spin and Lorentz structure of its couplings can potentially be determined. We analyze the mono-photon channel, $e^+ e^- \rightarrow \gamma + \text{invisible}$, in detail, focusing on the production of an on-shell spin-1 boson. We explore this in the context of three separate scenarios for a new dark vector: a dark photon, a mass-mixed ``dark $Z$'', and a vector that couples to right-handed electrons, and estimate how well the couplings of such bosons to electrons can be constrained in the event of a positive signal.</description>

      <title>Dihadron fragmentation framework for near-side energy-energy correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an approach to analyze the free hadron and transition (nonperturbative) regions of near-side energy-energy correlators (EECs) based on dihadron fragmentation functions (DiFFs). We introduce a (nonperturbative) function we call the "EEC-DiFF" and explicitly show that expanding it for large relative transverse momentum between the two hadrons gives the $O(\alpha_s)$ expression for the "EEC jet" function used in the quark/gluon (perturbative) region. This connection indicates that a formal theoretical matching will be able to bridge the free hadron, transition, and quark/gluon regions and allow all of them to be analyzed simultaneously. We further derive a result valid for near-side EECs in the free hadron and transition regions of $e^+e^-$ annihilation in terms of the EEC-DiFF. Using a simple model for the function, we perform the first fit within the dihadron framework to experimental data in this regime. We find reasonable agreement with the measurements and reproduce the salient features of near-side EECs in the free hadron and transition regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forward muon detection at high-energy muon colliders is crucial for resolving the underlying electroweak process. Detecting these muons is challenging in current detector designs, limited by the shielding required to suppress the beam-induced background. This work proposes using asymmetric beam energies to boost one of the forward muons into the detector acceptance, enhancing the ability to distinguish between $W$- and $Z$-initiated vector boson fusion processes. We demonstrate the capabilities of such an asymmetric collider using VBF Higgs production at 3 and 10 TeV muon colliders with modest boost asymmetries. Asymmetric beam configurations can partially recover the physics potential lost in forward regions when detector coverage is limited.</description>

Abstract: Electromagnetic radiation by accelerated charges is a fundamental process in physics. Here, we introduce a quantum-optical framework for controlling the emission of radiation of an electron in an intense laser field via squeezed vacuum states. By engineering the quantum fluctuations of the emission modes, we demonstrate that the probability of nonlinear Compton scattering can be significantly enhanced or suppressed through tunable squeezing amplitude and angle. We show numerically that our predictions are experimentally accessible with current squeezing technologies, establishing a new paradigm for quantum control in high-intensity light-matter interactions.</description>

Abstract: We evaluate the Koba-Nielsen-Olesen (KNO) scaling functions for quark- and gluon-initiated jets by incorporating energy conservation into the Double Logarithmic Approximation (DLA). The resulting modified DLA (MDLA) expressions differ substantially from the DLA predictions and qualitatively align with the recently proposed QCD-inspired expressions, albeit with some quantitative differences. By fixing the two parameters in the MDLA expressions, we show that the inclusive charged-particle multiplicity distributions of the two leading jets in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, measured by ATLAS over a wide jet $p_T$ range of $0.1$-$2.5$ TeV, are well described within experimental uncertainties and consistent with PYTHIA simulations. This conclusion is further supported by direct comparisons with quark- and gluon-initiated jet distributions extracted via jet topics, though the propagated uncertainties from experimental data remain sizable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalisation of our previous approach of a renormalon-motivated resummation of the QCD observables. Previously it was applied to the spacelike observables whose perturbation expansion was $D(Q^2) = a(Q^2) + O(a^2)$, where $a(Q^2) \equiv \alpha_s(Q^2)/\pi$ is the running QCD coupling. Now we generalise the resummation to spacelike quantities $D(Q^2) = a(Q^2)^{\nu_0} + O(a^{\nu_0+1})$ and timelike quantities $F(\sigma) = a(\sigma)^{\nu_0} + O(a^{\nu_0+1})$, where $\nu_0$ is in general a noninteger number ($0&lt;\nu_0 \leq 1$). We evaluate with this approach a timelike quantity, namely the scheme-invariant factor of the Wilson coefficient of the chromomagnetic operator in the heavy-quark effective Lagrangian, and related quantities.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the decays $B_c^- \rightarrow \bar{D}^{(*)0}\ell^-\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ and $B_c^- \rightarrow D^{(*)-}\ell^+\ell^-$ within the Standard Model (SM), employing perturbative QCD form factors that are sensitive to the wave functions of $B_c$ and $D^{(*)}$ mesons. Using lattice QCD inputs for $B \to D^{(*)}$ and $B_c \to D$ transitions, we extract the shape parameters of the meson wave functions and estimate the $q^2$-dependence of $B_c \to D^*$ form factors via heavy quark spin symmetry. We present predictions for branching fractions, lepton flavor violating observables, and perform a detailed angular analysis of the cascade decay $B_{c}^{-} \to D^{*-}(\to D^{0}\pi^{-}) \ell^+\ell^-$, providing SM expectations for several angular observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate inclusive $J/\psi$ production in proton-proton collisions at tens of GeV $\sqrt{s}$ energy, relevant for forthcoming measurements with the Spin Physics Detector (SPD) at NICA. Simulations are performed using the PEGASUS event generator with transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) gluon densities, comparing the recent KMR-based KL$'2025$ and CCFM-based LLM$'2024$ parametrizations. Differential cross sections in rapidity and transverse momentum exhibit smooth, stable behavior under renormalization-scale variation. Normalized $p_T$ spectra reveal distinct hardening patterns linked to the underlying gluon $k_T$ broadening in each model. The relative contributions of color-singlet and color-octet channels are also quantified, demonstrating the dominance of color-octet mechanisms in the SPD energy regime. These results provide the first detailed assessment of quarkonium production sensitivity to gluon TMDs near threshold, offering timely theoretical guidance for upcoming $J/\psi$ measurements at SPD/NICA.</description>

      <title>Ward-Takahashi identity in the light-front formalism for a bound state of fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Ward-Takahashi identity at one-loop in the light-front (LF) formalism for a bound state of fermions. We consider a spinless bound state made up of two fermions in which the Ward-Takahashi identity is satisfied in the covariant formulation. Considering the same system in the light-front formalism, we investigate the proof of Ward-Takahashi identity by integrating the light-front energy component through the identification of the relevant ranges of the longitudinal LF momentum. We elucidate that the pair production diagram plays a crucial role in establishing the Ward-Takahashi identity. We also point out the necessity of taking into account the corresponding zero modes for truly establishing the Ward-Takahashi identity in the LF formalism.</description>

      <title>Modified TM2 for Reproducing All Best-Fit Values of Neutrino Mixing Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15111v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As measurements of neutrino mixing angles continue to become more precise, it is increasingly likely that in the very near future a realistic neutrino mixing model will be required to precisely reproduce their best-fit values. In this study, a modified TM$_2$ mixing model which reproduces the best-fit values of all three neutrino mixing angles is proposed. The model reproduces the correct mixing angles within 1$\sigma$ of the current best-fit values and is robust against any future changes of the best-fit values.</description>

      <title>Viability of $A_4$, $S_4$ and $A_5$ Flavour Symmetries in Light of the First JUNO Result</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We update the analysis of the viability of the lepton mixing patterns originating from $A_4$, $S_4$ and $A_5$ discrete flavour symmetries and leading to predictions for the solar neutrino mixing angle, $\theta_{12}$. We perform a statistical analysis using as an input (i) the results of the latest global fit to neutrino oscillation data, and (ii) the first JUNO measurement of $\sin^2\theta_{12}$. Out of the five (four) cases compatible with the global data at $3\sigma$ for normal (inverted) neutrino mass ordering, only three (two) cases remain compatible with the global data at the same confidence level after taking into account the JUNO result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MadSpace is a new modular phase-space and event-generation library written in C++ with native GPU support via CUDA and HIP. It provides a unified compute-graph-based framework for phase-space construction, adaptive and neural importance sampling, and event unweighting. It includes a wide range of mappings, from the standard MadGraph multi-channel phase space to optimized normalizing flows with analytic inverse transformations. All components operate on batches of events and support end-to-end on-device workflows. A high-level Python interface enables seamless integration with machine-learning libraries such as PyTorch.</description>

      <title>The Too Visible QCD Axion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Murayama proposed a GeV-scale axion theory where the up-quark mass term is generated dynamically by the QCD chiral condensate, spontaneously breaking a Peccei-Quinn symmetry. It predicts a too large mass splitting between neutral and charged pions. Trying to solve this problem we explore extensions. Despite some partial improvements, we identify a structural obstruction: the new Peccei-Quinn spurion breaks the accidental isospin symmetry of the chiral Lagrangian, leading to an enhanced higher-order operator. As a consequence, pion scatterings too are distorted. We also examine the limit in which the axion becomes light, finding that it is excluded by fifth-force constraints.</description>

      <title>On the simulated kinematic distributions of semileptonic $B$ decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern measurements in flavour physics rely on accurate simulations of signal and background processes, provided by a wide range of general-purpose and specialised Monte-Carlo event generators. Due to the inclusion of a larger amount of specialised decays of heavy hadrons, EvtGen is often the tool of choice for many scenarios. We investigate the phase-space sampling algorithm of EvtGen and demonstrate that it generates unphysical features in kinematic distributions of semileptonic $B$ decays involving resonances, originating from neglected phase-space factors. We provide a short-term solution to correct the affected simulated samples through reweighting of the hadronic invariant mass distribution.</description>

      <title>2025 EIC-France Workshop: Physics Highlights and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This document presents a synthesis of the theory contributions and discussions from the 2nd EIC-France Workshop, held at IJCLab (Orsay) on 1-3 December 2025. The workshop brought together members of the French hadron-physics community to review recent theoretical developments relevant to the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) and to coordinate national efforts in preparation for its early physics program. The report first summarizes the collider's initial running conditions and luminosity performance, as outlined in the EIC Early Science Matrix. It then provides concise overviews of the theoretical presentations on inclusive, semi-inclusive, exclusive, heavy-flavor, and small-x physics.
  Based on these discussions, two measurements emerged as especially well suited for early EIC operation and strongly aligned with areas of established French expertise: inclusive diffraction and inclusive quarkonium production. These channels offer clean signatures, robust theoretical interpretability, and direct sensitivity to fundamental QCD phenomena such as gluon saturation, heavy-quark dynamics, and the small-x structure of hadrons and nuclei.
  In addition, the workshop identified longer-term physics opportunities that will benefit from the full capabilities of the EIC after its ramp-up phase. These include accessing the three-dimensional structure of the pion through the Sullivan process and a broader program of exclusive three-body final states, both of which represent high-impact avenues for exploring hadronic structure and non-perturbative QCD. Together, the elements summarized in this report provide a coherent overview of the strategic priorities and scientific ambitions shaping the French community's contribution to the EIC physics program.</description>

      <title>Effective interaction of Chern-Simons boson with fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a vector extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a Chern-Simons-type interaction. This extension introduces a new massive vector boson (the Chern-Simons (CS) boson) that does not couple directly to SM fermions at tree level. We analyze the effective loop-induced interaction of this new vector boson with SM fermions and study its renormalizability in the $R_\xi$ gauge. We find that, in the effective interaction between the CS boson and same-flavor fermions, the divergent contributions from individual loop diagrams do not cancel when all relevant diagrams are taken into account. In contrast, for interactions involving fermions of different flavors, the corresponding loop-induced contributions are finite and well defined. This indicates that, in the low-energy limit, the theory exhibits nonrenormalizable behavior in the sector describing the loop-induced interaction of the CS boson with same-flavor fermions. The interaction terms between the CS boson and same-flavor fermions, characterized by divergent coefficients, are identified and must be treated within the framework of effective field theory. Finally, we derive the leading-order effective Lagrangian describing the interaction of a GeV-scale CS boson with SM fermions and discuss the number of independent parameters entering this Lagrangian. The leading-order interaction we obtained turns out to be similar to the interaction of a $Z^\prime$ boson with SM fermions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of QED in Coulomb Gauge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent work considered quantum simulation of Quantum Electrodynamics on a lattice in the Coulomb gauge with gauge degrees of freedom represented in the occupation basis in momentum space. Here we consider the more efficient representation of the gauge degrees of freedom in field basis in position space and develop a quantum algorithm for real-time simulation. We show that the continuum Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian is equivalent to the temporal gauge Hamiltonian when acting on physical states consisting of fermion and transverse gauge fields. The Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian is discretized by using the Green's function of the discrete Laplacian operator under the Dirichlet boundary conditions. Both the continuum Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian and the discretized one proposed here guarantee that the unphysical longitudinal gauge fields are decoupled and commute with the corresponding Hamiltonian. Thus there is no need to impose any constraint. The local gauge field basis and the canonically conjugate variable basis are swapped efficiently using the quantum Fourier transform. We prove that the qubit cost to represent physical states and the gate count for real-time simulation scale polynomially with the lattice size, energy, time, accuracy, and Hamiltonian parameters in lattice units. The gate cost here for implementing the time evolution of the gauge field is reduced at least by a factor on the order of $10^8$ for modest lattice size and accuracy level compared with the previous work.</description>

      <title>Two-neutrino $\beta\beta$ decay to excited states at next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two-neutrino double-beta decay ($2\nu\beta\beta$) into first-excited $0^+_2$ states of nuclei used in $\beta\beta$ decay experiments, including $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se, $^{130}$Te, and $^{136}$Xe. We calculate the corresponding nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) within the nuclear shell model, using various Hamiltonians that describe well the spectroscopy of the initial and final nuclei. We evaluate the next-to-leading order (NLO) long-range NMEs recently introduced within chiral effective field theory, keeping three terms in the expansion of the energy denominator. In most cases, NLO contributions to the half-life are below 5%, but they can significantly increase due to cancellations in the leading-order Gamow-Teller NME. A detailed analysis in terms of nuclear deformation, including triaxiality, indicates that larger deformation differences between the initial and final states generally lead to smaller NMEs, but the seniority structure of the states also plays a relevant role. The lower range of our predicted half-lives, with uncertainties dominated by the nuclear Hamiltonian used, are slightly longer than the current experimental limit in $^{76}$Ge and consistent with the very recent half-life indication in $^{82}$Se.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Inference for Direction Reconstruction of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays with Radio Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) observatories require unbiased direction reconstruction to enable multi-messenger astronomy with sparse, nanosecond-scale radio pulses. Explicit likelihood methods often rely on simplified models, which may bias results and understate uncertainties. We introduce a simulation-based inference pipeline that couples a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) to a normalizing-flow posterior within the Learning the Universe Implicit Likelihood Inference framework. Each event is seeded by an analytic plane-wavefront fit; the GNN refines this estimate by learning spatiotemporal correlations among antenna signals, and its frozen embedding conditions an eight-block autoregressive flow that returns the full Bayesian posterior. Trained on about $8,000$ realistic UHECR air-shower simulations generated with the ZHAireS code, the posteriors are temperature-calibrated to meet empirical coverage targets. We demonstrate a sub-degree median angular resolution on test UHECR events, and find that the nominal 68% highest-posterior-density contours capture $71\% \pm 2\%$ of true arrival directions, indicating a mildly conservative uncertainty calibration. This approach provides physically interpretable reconstructions, well-calibrated uncertainties, and rapid inference, making it ideally suited for upcoming experiments targeting highly inclined events, such as GRAND, AugerPrime Radio, and BEACON.</description>

      <title>Towards the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND): the GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger prototypes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a proposed multi-messenger observatory of Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) particles of cosmic origin. Its main goal is to find the long-sought origin of UHE cosmic rays by detecting large numbers of them and the secondary particles created by their interactions like gamma rays and neutrinos. The GRAND Collaboration plans to achieve this using large arrays of radio antennas that look for the radio signals emitted by the air showers initiated by the interactions of the UHE particles in the atmosphere. Since 2023, three small-scale prototype GRAND arrays have been in operation: GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay in France, GRAND@Auger in Argentina, and GRANDProto300 in China. Together, their goal is to validate the detection principle of GRAND under prolonged field conditions, achieving efficient, autonomous radio-detection of air showers. We describe the hardware, software, layout, and operation of the GRAND prototypes. Using their data, we show a first characterization of the local electromagnetic environment of each site and a measurement of the Galactic synchrotron emission. Despite challenges, the successful operation of the prototypes confirms that the GRAND instrumentation is apt to address the goals of the experiment and lays the groundwork for its ensuing stages.</description>

      <title>Predictions of baryon directed flow in heavy-ion collisions at high baryon density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictions of the proton directed flow ($v_1$) in semicentral Au+Au collisions in the energy range between 4.5 and 7.7 GeV are done. The calculations are performed within the model of three-fluid dynamics with crossover equation of state, which well reproduces the proton $v_1$ both below 4.5 GeV and above 7.7 GeV, as well as bulk observables in the energy range of interest. It is predicted that the proton flow evolves non-monotonously. At the energy of 7.2 GeV it exhibits antiflow (i.e. negative slope of $v_1(y)$) in the midrapidity. At 7.7 GeV, the flow returns to the normal pattern in accordance with the STAR data. The midrapidity $v_1$-slope excitation functions within the first-order phase and crossover transitions to quark-gluon phase (QGP) turn out to be qualitatively similar, but the amplitude of the wiggle in the crossover scenario is much smaller than that in the strong first-order phase transition. Therefore, the change of sign followed by minimum at 7.2 GeV in the $v_1$-slope excitation function indicates onset of (weak phase or crossover) transition to QGP. The second change of the sign around 10 GeV results from interplay between incomplete baryon stopping and transverse expansion of the system.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry Breaking with Fields, Strings and Branes</title>

Abstract: The first part of this review tries to provide a self-contained view of supersymmetry breaking from the bottom-up perspective. We thus describe N=1 supersymmetry in four dimensions, the Standard Model and the MSSM, with emphasis on the ``soft terms'' that can link it to supergravity. The second part deals with the top-down perspective. It addresses, insofar as possible in a self-contained way, the basic setup provided by ten-dimensional strings and their links with supergravity, toroidal orbifolds, Scherk-Schwarz deformations and Calabi-Yau reductions, before focusing on a line of developments that is closely linked to our own research. Its key input is drawn from ten-dimensional non-tachyonic string models where supersymmetry is absent or non-linearly realized, and runaway ``tadpole potentials'' deform the ten-dimensional Minkowski vacua. We illustrate the perturbative stability of the resulting most symmetrical setups, which are the counterparts of circle reduction but involve internal intervals. We then turn to a discussion of fluxes in Calabi-Yau vacua and the KKLT setup, and conclude with some aspects of Cosmology, emphasizing some intriguing clues that the tadpole potentials can provide for the onset of inflation. The appendices collect some useful material on global and local N=1 supersymmetry, in components and in superspace, on string vacuum amplitudes, and on convenient tools used to examine the fluctuations of non-supersymmetric string vacua.</description>

      <title>Insights for Early Dark Energy with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), as one of the earliest processes in the universe accessible to direct observation, offers a powerful and independent probe of the cosmic expansion history. With recent advances in both theory and observation, including efficient and flexible BBN codes, percent-level measurements of primordial deuterium and helium-4 abundances, refined measurements of nuclear reaction rates, and precise determinations of the baryon density from the cosmic microwave background, particularly keen insights can be gained from BBN. In this work, we leverage these developments to place model-independent constraints on deviations from the Standard Model expansion history during BBN. Using the latest abundance data, we apply principal component analysis to identify the most constrained and physically meaningful modes of expansion history variation. This approach allows us to impose the most general constraints on early dark energy during the epoch of BBN. We further examine whether general modifications to the expansion rate could alleviate the long-standing lithium problem. Our results demonstrate that BBN, sharpened by modern data and statistical techniques, remains an indispensable probe of dark energy and new physics in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Observation of partonic collectivity via $p_{\rm T}$-differential radial flow fluctuations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 200$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of partonic radial collectivity in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 200$~GeV via the $p_{\rm T}$-differential flow observable $v_{0}(p_{\rm T})$ using the \texttt{AMPT} String Melting model. For inclusive charged hadrons, we establish three signatures of collectivity: long-range pseudorapidity correlations, the factorization of two-particle correlations, and a centrality-independent scaling of $v_{0}(p_{\rm T})$ normalized by its $p_{\rm T}$-integrated value $v_{0}$, analogous to anisotropic flow. For identified particles ($\pi^{\pm}, K^{\pm}, p + \overline p$), the $v_{0}(p_{\rm T})$ spectra show mass ordering at low-$p_{\rm T}$ and meson-baryon separation at intermediate-$p_{\rm T}$. In \textit{central} collisions, $v_{0}(p_{\rm T})/n_{q}$ exhibits robust \textit{Number of Constituent Quark} (NCQ) scaling with $(m_{\rm T} - m_{0})/n_{q}$, a scaling that breaks down in \textit{peripheral} collisions and is more precise at RHIC than at LHC energies, consistent with earlier $v_{2}$ studies. These findings provide strong evidence that radial collectivity originates predominantly at the partonic stage, extending the paradigm of quark-level dynamics from anisotropic to isotropic flow.</description>
