      <title>Suppression of neutral pion production in deep-inelastic scattering off nuclei with the CLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first three-fold differential measurement for neutral pion multiplicity ratios produced in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic electron scattering on carbon, iron and lead nuclei normalized to deuterium from CLAS at Jefferson Lab. We found that the neutral pion multiplicity ratio is maximally suppressed for the leading hadrons (energy fraction z approaching unity), suppression varying from 25% in carbon up to 75% in lead. An enhancement of the multiplicity ratio at low z and high p2T is observed, suggesting an interconnection between these two variables. This behavior is qualitatively similar to the previous two-fold differential measurement of charged pions by the HERMES Collaboration. However, in contrast to the published CLAS and HERMES results on charged pions, the largest enhancement was observed at high pT2 for the lightest nucleus - carbon and the lowest enhancement for the heaviest nucleus - lead. This behavior suggests a competition between partonic multiple scattering, which causes enhancement, and hadronic inelastic scattering, which causes suppression.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the branching fractions of $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{0}$, $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\eta$, and $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\eta^{\prime}$ and asymmetry parameter of $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{0}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{0}$, $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\eta$, and $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\eta^{\prime}$ decays using the Belle and Belle~II data samples, which have integrated luminosities of 980~$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ and 426~$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, respectively. We measure the following relative branching fractions $${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{0})/{\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+}) = 0.48 \pm 0.02 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.03 ({\rm syst}) ,$$ $${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\eta)/{\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+}) = 0.11 \pm 0.01 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.01 ({\rm syst}) ,$$ $${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\eta^{\prime})/{\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+}) = 0.08 \pm 0.02 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.01 ({\rm syst}) $$ for the first time, where the uncertainties are statistical ($\rm stat$) and systematic ($\rm syst$). By multiplying by the branching fraction of the normalization mode, ${\mathcal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+})$, we obtain the following absolute branching fraction results $(6.9 \pm 0.3 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.5 ({\rm syst}) \pm 1.3 ({\rm norm})) \times 10^{-3}$, $(1.6 \pm 0.2 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.2 ({\rm syst}) \pm 0.3 ({\rm norm})) \times 10^{-3}$, and $(1.2 \pm 0.3 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.1 ({\rm syst}) \pm 0.2 ({\rm norm})) \times 10^{-3}$, for $\Xi_{c}^{0}$ decays to $\Xi^{0}\pi^{0}$, $\Xi^{0}\eta$, and $\Xi^{0}\eta^{\prime}$ final states, respectively. The third errors are from the uncertainty on ${\mathcal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+})$. The asymmetry parameter for $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{0}$ is measured to be $\alpha(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{0}) = -0.90\pm0.15({\rm stat})\pm0.23({\rm syst})$.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of 400 GeV/c proton interactions with the SHiP-charm project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SHiP-charm project was proposed to measure the associated charm production induced by 400 GeV/c protons in a thick target, including the contribution from cascade production. An optimisation run was performed in July 2018 at CERN SPS using a hybrid setup. The high resolution of nuclear emulsions acting as vertex detector was complemented by electronic detectors for kinematic measurements and muon identification. Here we present first results on the analysis of nuclear emulsions exposed in the 2018 run, which prove the capability of reconstructing proton interaction vertices in a harsh environment, where the signal is largely dominated by secondary particles produced in hadronic and electromagnetic showers within the lead target.</description>

      <title>Measurement of inclusive and differential cross sections for W$^+$W$^-$ production in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV of the opposite-sign W boson pair production cross section in proton-proton collisions are presented. The data used in this study were collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2022, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 34.8 fb$^{-1}$. Events are selected by requiring one electron and one muon of opposite charge. A maximum likelihood fit is performed on signal- and background-enriched data categories defined by the flavour and charge of the leptons, the number of jets, and number of jets originating from b quarks. An inclusive W$^+$W$^-$ production cross section of 125.7 $\pm$ 5.6 pb is measured, in agreement with standard model predictions. Cross sections are also reported in a fiducial region close to that of the detector acceptance, both inclusively and differentially, as a function of the jet multiplicity in the event. For first time in proton-proton collisions, WW events with at least two reconstructed jets are studied and compared with recent theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>TIDMAD: Time Series Dataset for Discovering Dark Matter with AI Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter makes up approximately 85% of total matter in our universe, yet it has never been directly observed in any laboratory on Earth. The origin of dark matter is one of the most important questions in contemporary physics, and a convincing detection of dark matter would be a Nobel-Prize-level breakthrough in fundamental science. The ABRACADABRA experiment was specifically designed to search for dark matter. Although it has not yet made a discovery, ABRACADABRA has produced several dark matter search results widely endorsed by the physics community. The experiment generates ultra-long time-series data at a rate of 10 million samples per second, where the dark matter signal would manifest itself as a sinusoidal oscillation mode within the ultra-long time series. In this paper, we present the TIDMAD -- a comprehensive data release from the ABRACADABRA experiment including three key components: an ultra-long time series dataset divided into training, validation, and science subsets; a carefully-designed denoising score for direct model benchmarking; and a complete analysis framework which produces a community-standard dark matter search result suitable for publication as a physics paper. This data release enables core AI algorithms to extract the signal and produce real physics results thereby advancing fundamental science. The data downloading and associated analysis scripts are available at https://github.com/jessicafry/TIDMAD</description>

      <title>Decaying sterile neutrinos at short baselines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-standing anomalous experimental results from short-baseline neutrino experiments have persisted for decades. These results, when interpreted with one or more light sterile neutrinos, are inconsistent with numerous null results experimentally. However, if the sterile neutrino decays en route to the detector, this can mimic $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ oscillation signals while avoiding many of these external constraints. We revisit this solution to the MiniBooNE and LSND puzzles in view of new data from the MicroBooNE experiment at Fermilab. Using MicroBooNE's liquid-argon time-projection chamber search for an excess of $\nu_e$ in the Booster beam, we derive new limits in two models' parameter spaces of interest: where the sterile neutrino decays (I) via mixing with the active neutrinos, or (II) via higher-dimensional operators. We also provide an updated, comprehensive fit to the MiniBooNE neutrino- and antineutrino-beam data, including appearance ($\nu_e$) and disappearance ($\nu_\mu$) channels. Despite alleviating the tension with muon neutrino disappearance experiments, we find that the latest MicroBooNE analysis rules out the decaying sterile neutrino solution in a large portion of the parameter space at more than $99\%$ CL.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Bell nonlocality with bottom-quark pairs at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past years, it was shown that entanglement and Bell nonlocality, which are key concepts in Quantum Mechanics, can be probed in high-energy colliders, via processes of fundamental particle scattering. Recently, it has been shown that spin correlations can be measured in pairs of bottom quarks at the LHC. Given the low mass of the bottom quark compared to typical scattering processes at the LHC, many of the bottom-quark pairs are in the ultrarelativistic regime, where they can exhibit strong spin entanglement. We find that entanglement of bottom-quark pairs may be measurable even with Run 2 data, especially with the CMS $B$ parking dataset, while observation of Bell nonlocality may become feasible at the high-luminosity phase of the LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\mu$TRISTAN is a realistic high energy lepton collider based on the existing technology aiming at indirect and direct search for the physics beyond the standard model (SM). We propose a measurement to determine one of the most prominent parameters of the SM, weak mixing angle to test the SM and probe the new physics effect in M\o ller-like scattering with a wide range of interaction scales. We show that this experiment not only can determine the weak mixing angle with percent to milli-level accuracy but also scan over a wide range of interaction scales that have never been archived in a single experiment elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Upgrade of the online data quality monitoring system for future PandaX experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PandaX-4T is a xenon-based multi-purpose experiment, focusing on particle and astrophysics research. The data quality monitoring system plays a crucial role in the experiment. This system enables the prompt detection of potential issues during data collection. In order to meet the upgrade requirements of the experiment, we have implemented several updates to improve overall data throughput and provide users with more comprehensive information. As a result, the system is capable of monitoring half of the collected data in future operations of the PandaX-4T experiment. Furthermore, with updated hardware, the system is also well-equipped to meet the requirements of the future multi-ten-tonne level PandaX-xT experiment.</description>

      <title>Proton 3D reconstruction with T-odd TMD gluon densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present studies aimed at probing the 3D gluon content of the proton through spin-dependent TMD gluon densities, computed by means of the spectator-model approach. Our formalism incorporates a fit-based modulation function for the spectator mass, designed to capture longitudinal-momentum effects across a broad kinematic range. Special emphasis is placed on the time-reversal even Boer-Mulders and the time-reversal odd Sivers functions. Accurate understanding of these functions is crucial for conducting precise 3D analyses of nucleons, highlighting the importance of collaborative efforts between the LHC and EIC Communities.</description>

      <title>Timing-based mass measurement of exotic long-lived particles at the FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The very high luminosity run foreseen at the $Z$-pole for the FCC-ee will allow the detection in $Z$ decays of new particles with very low couplings to the Standard Model. These particles will have measurable flight paths before they decay. If the timing and the position of the decay vertex can be measured with high precision, the mass of such particles can be measured by exploiting the constrained kinematics of an $e^+e^-$ collider. The mass resolution achievable with this technique is studied through a detailed analysis in the framework of a parametrised simulation of the performance of the IDEA detector. The adopted benchmark model is the production of Heavy Neutral Leptons, which is one of the key channels for new physics discovery at the FCC-ee.</description>

Abstract: The ALICE Collaboration reports a search for jet quenching effects in high-multiplicity (HM) proton$-$proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, using the semi-inclusive azimuthal-difference distribution $\Delta\varphi$ of charged-particle jets recoiling from a high transverse momentum (high-$p_{\mathrm{T,trig}}$) trigger hadron. Jet quenching may broaden the $\Delta\varphi$ distribution measured in HM events compared to that in minimum bias (MB) events. The measurement employs a $p_{\mathrm{T,trig}}$-differential observable for data-driven suppression of the contribution of multiple partonic interactions, which is the dominant background. While azimuthal broadening is indeed observed in HM compared to MB events, similar broadening for HM events is observed for simulations based on the PYTHIA 8 Monte Carlo generator, which does not incorporate jet quenching. Detailed analysis of these data and simulations show that the azimuthal broadening is due to bias of the HM selection towards events with multiple jets in the final state. The identification of this bias has implications for all jet quenching searches where selection is made on the event activity.</description>

      <title>Light-flavor particle production in high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{\textit{s}} = 13}$ TeV as a function of transverse spherocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Results on the transverse spherocity dependence of light-flavor particle production ($\pi$, K, p, $\phi$, ${\rm K^{*0}}$, ${\rm K}^{0}_{\rm{S}}$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi$) at midrapidity in high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV were obtained with the ALICE apparatus. The transverse spherocity estimator ($S_{{\rm O}}^{{\it p}_{\rm T}=1}$) categorizes events by their azimuthal topology. Utilizing narrow selections on $S_{\text{O}}^{{\it p}_{\rm T}=1}$, it is possible to contrast particle production in collisions dominated by many soft initial interactions with that observed in collisions dominated by one or more hard scatterings. Results are reported for two multiplicity estimators covering different pseudorapidity regions. The $S_{{\rm O}}^{{\it p}_{\rm T}=1}$ estimator is found to effectively constrain the hardness of the events when the midrapidity ($\left | \eta \right |&lt; 0.8$) estimator is used. The production rates of strange particles are found to be slightly higher for soft isotropic topologies, and severely suppressed in hard jet-like topologies. These effects are more pronounced for hadrons with larger mass and strangeness content, and observed when the topological selection is done within a narrow multiplicity interval. This demonstrates that an important aspect of the universal scaling of strangeness enhancement with final-state multiplicity is that high-multiplicity collisions are dominated by soft, isotropic processes. On the contrary, strangeness production in events with jet-like processes is significantly reduced. The results presented in this article are compared with several QCD-inspired Monte Carlo event generators. Models that incorporate a two-component phenomenology, either through mechanisms accounting for string density, or thermal production, are able to describe the observed strangeness enhancement as a function of $S_{{\rm O}}^{{\it p}_{\rm T}=1}$.</description>

      <title>Combined search for electroweak production of winos, binos, higgsinos, and sleptons in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A combination of the results of several searches for the electroweak production of the supersymmetric partners of standard model bosons, and of charged leptons, is presented. All searches use proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016-2018. The analyzed data correspond to an integrated luminosity of up to 137 fb$^{-1}$. The results are interpreted in terms of simplified models of supersymmetry. Two new interpretations are added with this combination: a model spectrum with the bino as the lightest supersymmetric particle together with mass-degenerate higgsinos decaying to the bino and a standard model boson, and the compressed-spectrum region of a previously studied model of slepton pair production. Improved analysis techniques are employed to optimize sensitivity for the compressed spectra in the wino and slepton pair production models. The results are consistent with expectations from the standard model. The combination provides a more comprehensive coverage of the model parameter space than the individual searches, extending the exclusion by up to 125 GeV, and also targets some of the intermediate gaps in the mass coverage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search for the production of long-lived particles in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the CERN LHC is presented. The search is based on data collected by the CMS experiment in 2016-2018, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 137 fb$^{-1}$. This search is designed to be sensitive to long-lived particles with mean proper decay lengths between 0.1 and 1000 mm, whose decay products produce a final state with at least one displaced vertex and missing transverse momentum. A machine learning algorithm, which improves the background rejection power by more than an order of magnitude, is applied to improve the sensitivity. The observation is consistent with the standard model background prediction, and the results are used to constrain split supersymmetry (SUSY) and gauge-mediated SUSY breaking models with different gluino mean proper decay lengths and masses. This search is the first CMS search that shows sensitivity to hadronically decaying long-lived particles from signals with mass differences between the gluino and neutralino below 100 GeV. It sets the most stringent limits to date for split-SUSY models and gauge-mediated SUSY breaking models with gluino proper decay length less than 6 mm.</description>

Abstract: The J/$\psi$ $\to$ $\mu^+\mu^-\mu^+\mu^-$ decay has been observed with a statistical significance in excess of five standard deviations. The analysis is based on an event sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment in 2018 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 33.6 fb$^{-1}$. Normalizing to the J/$\psi$ $\to$ $\mu^+\mu^-$ decay mode leads to a branching fraction [10.1 $^{+3.3}_{-2.7}$ (stat) $\pm$ 0.4 (syst)] $\times$ 10$^{-7}$, a value that is consistent with the standard model prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) has been conceived and constructed as a heavy-ion experiment at the LHC. During LHC Runs 1 and 2, it has produced a wide range of physics results using all collision systems available at the LHC. In order to best exploit new physics opportunities opening up with the upgraded LHC and new detector technologies, the experiment has undergone a major upgrade during the LHC Long Shutdown 2 (2019-2022). This comprises the move to continuous readout, the complete overhaul of core detectors, as well as a new online event processing farm with a redesigned online-offline software framework. These improvements will allow to record Pb-Pb collisions at rates up to 50 kHz, while ensuring sensitivity for signals without a triggerable signature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a state-of-the-art prediction for cross sections of neutrino deep inelastic scattering (DIS) from nucleon at high neutrino energies, $E_\nu$, from 100 GeV to 1000 EeV ($10^{12}$ GeV). Our calculations are based on the latest CT18 NNLO parton distribution functions (PDFs) and their associated uncertainties. In order to make predictions for the highest energies, we extrapolate the PDFs to small $x$ according to several procedures and assumptions, thus affecting the uncertainties at ultra-high $E_\nu$; we quantify the uncertainties corresponding to these choices. Similarly, we quantify the uncertainties introduced by the nuclear corrections which are required to evaluate neutrino-nuclear cross sections for neutrino telescopes. These results can be applied to currently-running astrophysical neutrino observatories, such as IceCube and KM3NeT, as well as various future experiments which have been proposed.</description>

      <title>The ATLAS Experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider: A Description of the Detector Configuration for Run 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ATLAS detector is installed in its experimental cavern at Point 1 of the CERN Large Hadron Collider. During Run 2 of the LHC, a luminosity of $\mathcal{L}=2\times 10^{34}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ was routinely achieved at the start of fills, twice the design luminosity. For Run 3, accelerator improvements, notably luminosity levelling, allow sustained running at an instantaneous luminosity of $\mathcal{L}=2\times 10^{34}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, with an average of up to 60 interactions per bunch crossing. The ATLAS detector has been upgraded to recover Run 1 single-lepton trigger thresholds while operating comfortably under Run 3 sustained pileup conditions. A fourth pixel layer 3.3 cm from the beam axis was added before Run 2 to improve vertex reconstruction and $b$-tagging performance. New Liquid Argon Calorimeter digital trigger electronics, with corresponding upgrades to the Trigger and Data Acquisition system, take advantage of a factor of 10 finer granularity to improve triggering on electrons, photons, taus, and hadronic signatures through increased pileup rejection. The inner muon endcap wheels were replaced by New Small Wheels with Micromegas and small-strip Thin Gap Chamber detectors, providing both precision tracking and Level-1 Muon trigger functionality. Tile Calorimeter scintillation counters were added to improve electron energy resolution and background rejection. Upgrades to Minimum Bias Trigger Scintillators and Forward Detectors improve luminosity monitoring and enable total proton-proton cross section, diffractive physics, and heavy ion measurements. These upgrades are all compatible with operation in the much harsher environment anticipated after the High-Luminosity upgrade of the LHC and are the first steps towards preparing ATLAS for the High-Luminosity upgrade of the LHC. This paper describes the Run 3 configuration of the ATLAS detector.</description>

      <title>Measurement of inclusive charged-particle jet production in pp and p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of inclusive charged-particle jet production in pp and p-Pb collisions at center-of-mass energy per nucleon-nucleon collision $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV and the corresponding nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm pPb}^{\rm ch\,jet}$ are presented, using data collected with the ALICE detector at the LHC. Jets are reconstructed in the central rapidity region $|\eta_{\rm jet}| &lt; 0.5$ from charged particles using the anti-$k_{\rm T}$ algorithm with resolution parameters $R = 0.2$, 0.3, and 0.4. The $p_{\rm T}$-differential inclusive production cross section of charged-particle jets, as well as the corresponding cross section ratios, are reported for pp and p-Pb collisions in the transverse momentum range $10 &lt; p^{\rm ch}_{\rm T,jet} &lt; 140$ GeV/$c$ and $10 &lt; p^{\rm ch}_{\rm T,jet} &lt; 160$ GeV/$c$, respectively, together with the nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm pPb}^{\rm ch\,jet}$ in the range $10 &lt; p^{\rm ch}_{\rm T,jet} &lt; 140$ GeV/$c$. The analysis extends the $p_{\rm T}$ range of the previously-reported charged-particle jet measurements by the ALICE Collaboration. The nuclear modification factor is found to be consistent with one and independent of the jet resolution parameter with the improved precision of this study, indicating that the possible influence of cold nuclear matter effects on the production cross section of charged-particle jets in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV is smaller than the current precision. The obtained results are in agreement with other minimum bias jet measurements available for RHIC and LHC energies, and are well reproduced by the NLO perturbative QCD POWHEG calculations with parton shower provided by PYTHIA8 as well as by JETSCAPE simulations.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity-dependent production of $\Sigma(1385)^{\pm}$ and $\Xi(1530)^{0}$ in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The production yields of the $\Sigma(1385)^{\pm}$ and $\Xi(1530)^{0}$ resonances are measured in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with ALICE. The measurements are performed as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity $\langle \mathrm{d}N_\mathrm{ch}/\mathrm{d}\eta \rangle$, which is related to the energy density produced in the collision. The results include transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) distributions, $p_{\rm T}$-integrated yields, mean transverse momenta of $\Sigma(1385)^{\pm}$ and $\Xi(1530)^{0}$, as well as ratios of the $p_{\rm T}$-integrated resonance yields relative to yields of other hadron species. The $\Sigma(1385)^{\pm}/\pi^{\pm}$ and $\Xi(1530)^{0}/\pi^{\pm}$ yield ratios are consistent with the trend of the enhancement of strangeness production from low to high multiplicity pp collisions, which was previously observed for strange and multi-strange baryons. The yield ratio between the measured resonances and the long-lived baryons with the same strangeness content exhibits a hint of a mild increasing trend at low multiplicity, despite too large uncertainties to exclude the flat behaviour. The results are compared with predictions from models such as EPOS-LHC and PYTHIA 8 with Rope shoving. The latter provides the best description of the multiplicity dependence of the $\Sigma(1385)^{\pm}$ and $\Xi(1530)^{0}$ production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective behavior has been observed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions for several decades. Collectivity is driven by the high particle multiplicities that are produced in these collisions. At the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), features of collectivity have also been seen in high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions that can attain particle multiplicities comparable to peripheral Pb-Pb collisions. One of the possible signatures of collective behavior is the decrease of femtoscopic radii extracted from pion and kaon pairs emitted from high-multiplicity collisions with increasing pair transverse momentum. This decrease can be described in terms of an approximate transverse mass scaling. In the present work, femtoscopic analyses are carried out by the ALICE Collaboration on charged pion and kaon pairs produced in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV from the LHC to study possible collectivity in pp collisions. The event-shape analysis method based on transverse sphericity is used to select for spherical versus jet-like events, and the effects of this selection on the femtoscopic radii for both charged pion and kaon pairs are studied. This is the first time this selection method has been applied to charged kaon pairs. An approximate transverse-mass scaling of the radii is found in all multiplicity ranges studied when the difference in the Lorentz boost for pions and kaons is taken into account. This observation does not support the hypothesis of collective expansion of hot and dense matter that should only occur in high-multiplicity events. A possible alternate explanation of the present results is based on a scenario of common emission conditions for pions and kaons in pp collisions for the multiplicity ranges studied.</description>

      <title>Observation of abnormal suppression of $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) production in p$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dependence of $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) production on the final-state charged-particle multiplicity in p$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV is reported. The production of $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) is measured with the ALICE detector via the $\mathrm{f}_0 (980) \rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decay channel in a midrapidity region of $-0.5&lt;y&lt;0$. Particle yield ratios of $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) to $\pi$ and $\mathrm{K}^{*}$(892)$^{0}$ are found to be decreasing with increasing charged-particle multiplicity. The magnitude of the suppression of the $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980)/$\pi$ and $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980)/$\mathrm{K}^{*}$(892)$^{0}$ yield ratios is found to be dependent on the transverse momentum $p_{\mathrm{T}}$, suggesting different mechanisms responsible for the measured effects. Furthermore, the nuclear modification factor $Q_{\mathrm{pPb}}$ of $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) is measured in various multiplicity ranges. The $Q_{\mathrm{pPb}}$ shows a strong suppression of the $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) production in the $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ region up to about 4 GeV/$c$. The results on the particle yield ratios and $Q_{\mathrm{pPb}}$ for $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) may help to understand the late hadronic phase in p$-$Pb collisions and the nature of the internal structure of $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) particle.</description>

      <title>Photoproduction of K$^{+}$K$^{-}$ pairs in ultra-peripheral collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: K$^{+}$K$^{-}$ pairs may be produced in photonuclear collisions, either from the decays of photoproduced $\phi (1020)$ mesons, or directly as non-resonant K$^{+}$K$^{-}$ pairs. Measurements of K$^{+}$K$^{-}$ photoproduction probe the couplings between the $\phi (1020)$ and charged kaons with photons and nuclear targets. The kaon$-$proton scattering occurs at energies far above those available elsewhere. We present the first measurement of coherent photoproduction of K$^{+}$K$^{-}$ pairs on lead ions in ultra-peripheral collisions using the ALICE detector, including the first investigation of direct K$^{+}$K$^{-}$ production. There is significant K$^{+}$K$^{-}$ production at low transverse momentum, consistent with coherent photoproduction on lead targets. In the mass range $1.1 &lt; M_{\rm{KK}} &lt; 1.4$ GeV/$c^2$ above the $\phi (1020)$ resonance, for rapidity $|y_{\rm{KK}}|&lt;0.8$ and $p_{\rm T,KK} &lt; 0.1$ GeV/$c$, the measured coherent photoproduction cross section is $\mathrm{d}\sigma/\mathrm{d}y$ = 3.37 $\pm\ 0.61$ (stat.) $\pm\ 0.15 $ (syst.) mb. The center-of-mass energy per nucleon of the photon-nucleus (Pb) system $W_{\gamma \mathrm{Pb, n}}$ ranges from 33 to 188 GeV, far higher than previous measurements on heavy-nucleus targets. The cross section is larger than expected for $\phi (1020)$ photoproduction alone. The mass spectrum is fit to a cocktail consisting of $\phi (1020)$ decays, direct K$^{+}$K$^{-}$ photoproduction, and interference between the two. The confidence regions for the amplitude and relative phase angle for direct K$^{+}$K$^{-}$ photoproduction are presented.</description>

      <title>Data reduction strategy in the PandaX-4T experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The PandaX-4T experiment is designed for multiple purposes, including searches for solar neutrinos, weakly interacting massive particles, and rare double beta decays of xenon isotopes. The experiment produces a huge amount of raw data that needs to be stored for related physical analyses in a wide energy range. With the upgrading of the PandaX-4T experiment, the doubled sampling rate resulted in a larger data size, which challenges both the cost and the data processing speed. To address this issue, we propose a data reduction strategy by removing the noise tail of large signals and downsampling the remaining parts of them. This strategy reduces the requirement for storage by 65% while increasing data processing speed. The influences on physical analyses on different topics at different energy regions are negligible.</description>

      <title>Emergence of long-range angular correlations in low-multiplicity proton-proton collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This Letter presents the measurement of near-side associated per-trigger yields, denoted ridge yields, from the analysis of angular correlations of charged hadrons in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. Long-range ridge yields are extracted for pairs of charged particles with a pseudorapidity difference of $1.4 &lt; |\Delta\eta| &lt; 1.8$ and a transverse momentum of $1 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 2$ GeV/$c$, as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity measured at midrapidity. This study extends the measurements of the ridge yield to the low multiplicity region, where in hadronic collisions it is typically conjectured that a strongly-interacting medium is unlikely to be formed. The precision of the new low multiplicity results allows for the first direct quantitative comparison with the results obtained in $\mathrm {e^{+}e^{-}}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 91 GeV and $\sqrt{s}$ = 183$-$209 GeV, where initial-state effects such as pre-equilibrium dynamics and collision geometry are not expected to play a role. In the multiplicity range $8\lesssim\langle N_\mathrm{ch}\rangle\lesssim 24$ where the $\mathrm {e^{+}e^{-}}$ results have good precision, the measured ridge yields in pp collisions are substantially larger than the limits set in $\mathrm {e^{+}e^{-}}$ annihilations. Consequently, the findings presented in this Letter suggest that the processes involved in $\mathrm {e^{+}e^{-}}$ annihilations do not contribute significantly to the emergence of long-range correlations in pp collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of axions and axion-like particles in top-pair production at the LHC. Our main goal is to probe the axion coupling to top quarks at high energies. To this end, we calculate the top-antitop cross section and differential distributions including ALP effects up to one-loop level. By comparing these predictions with LHC precision measurements, we constrain the top coupling of axion-like particles with masses below the top-antitop threshold. Our results apply to all UV completions of the ALP effective theory with dominant couplings to top quarks, in particular to DFSZ-like axion models.</description>

      <title>Troubles mounting for multipolar dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the experimental constraints on the multipolar dark matter that has derivative coupling to the visible sector mediated by the Standard Model photon. The momentum dependent interaction enables them to be captured efficiently within massive celestial bodies boosted by their steep gravitational potential. This phenomena makes compact celestial bodies as an efficient target to probe such type of dark matter candidates. We demonstrate that a synergy of the updated direct detection results from DarkSide-50 and LUX-ZEPLIN together with IceCube bounds on high energy solar neutrinos from dark matter capture disfavour the viable parameter space of the dipolar dark matter scenario. Whereas, for the anapole dark matter scenario, a narrow window survives that lies within the reach of prospective heating signals due to the capture of dark matter at cold neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Front-end electronics development of large-area SiPM arrays for high-precision single-photon time measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TRopIcal DEep-sea Neutrino Telescope (TRIDENT) plans to incorporate silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) with superior time resolution in addition to photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) into its detection units, namely hybrid Digital Optical Modules (hDOMs), to improve its angular resolution. However, the time resolution significantly degrades for large-area SiPMs due to the large detector capacitance, posing significant challenges for the readout electronics of SiPMs in hDOM. We analyzed the influences of series and parallel connections when constructing a large-area SiPM array and designed a series-parallel connection SiPM array with differential output. We also designed a high-speed pre-amplifier based on transformers (MABA-007159) and radio frequency amplifiers (BGA2803), and an analog multi-channel summing circuit based on operational amplifiers (LMH6629). We measured the single photon time resolution (SPTR) of a $4\times4$ SiPM (Hamamatsu S13360-3050PE) array ($12\times12~\mathrm{mm}^2$) of approximately 300 ps FWHM. This front-end readout design enables the large-area SiPM array to achieve high-precision single photon time measurement in one readout channel.</description>

      <title>Majorana Neutrinos and Dark Matter from Anomaly Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a simple theory for neutrino masses where the total lepton number is a local gauge symmetry spontaneously broken below the multi-TeV scale. In this context, the neutrino masses are generated through the canonical seesaw mechanism and a Majorana dark matter candidate is predicted from anomaly cancellation. We discuss in great detail the dark matter annihilation channels and find out the upper bound on the symmetry breaking scale using the cosmological bounds on the relic density. Since in this context the dark matter candidate has suppressed couplings to the Standard Model quarks, one can satisfy the direct detection bounds even if the dark matter mass is close to the electroweak scale. This theory predicts a light pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (the Majoron) associated to the mechanism of neutrino mass. We discuss briefly the properties of the Majoron and the impact of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis bounds.</description>

      <title>Simulating Heavy Neutral Leptons with General Couplings at Collider and Fixed Target Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are motivated by attempts to explain neutrino masses and dark matter. If their masses are in the MeV to several GeV range, HNLs are light enough to be copiously produced at collider and accelerator facilities, but also heavy enough to decay to visible particles on length scales that can be observed in particle detectors. Previous studies evaluating the sensitivities of experiments have often focused on simple, but not particularly well-motivated, models in which the HNL mixes with only one active neutrino flavor. In this work, we accurately simulate models for HNL masses between 100 MeV and 10 GeV and arbitrary couplings to $e$, $\mu$, and $\tau$ leptons. We include over 150 HNL production channels and over 100 HNL decay modes, including all of the processes that can be dominant in some region of the general parameter space. The result is HNLCalc, a user-friendly, fast, and flexible library to compute the properties of HNL models. As examples, we implement HNLCalc to extend the FORESEE package to evaluate the prospects for HNL discovery at forward LHC experiments. We present sensitivity reaches for FASER and FASER2 in five benchmark scenarios with coupling ratios $|U_e|^2 : |U_\mu|^2 : |U_{\tau}|^2$ = 1:0:0, 0:1:0, 0:0:1, 0:1:1, and 1:1:1, where the latter two have not been studied previously. Comparing these to current constraints, we identify regions of parameter space with significant discovery prospects.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Unfolding of Detector Effects in High-Energy Physics using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unfolding of detector effects in experimental data is critical for enabling precision measurements in high-energy physics. However, traditional unfolding methods face challenges in scalability, flexibility, and dependence on simulations. We introduce a novel unfolding approach using conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (cDDPM). Our method utilizes the cDDPM for a non-iterative, flexible posterior sampling approach, which exhibits a strong inductive bias that allows it to generalize to unseen physics processes without explicitly assuming the underlying distribution. We test our approach by training a single cDDPM to perform multidimensional particle-wise unfolding for a variety of physics processes, including those not seen during training. Our results highlight the potential of this method as a step towards a "universal" unfolding tool that reduces dependence on truth-level assumptions.</description>
