      <title>Sentiment trading with large language models</title>

Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in sentiment analysis of U.S. financial news and their potential in predicting stock market returns. We analyze a dataset comprising 965,375 news articles that span from January 1, 2010, to June 30, 2023; we focus on the performance of various LLMs, including BERT, OPT, FINBERT, and the traditional Loughran-McDonald dictionary model, which has been a dominant methodology in the finance literature. The study documents a significant association between LLM scores and subsequent daily stock returns. Specifically, OPT, which is a GPT-3 based LLM, shows the highest accuracy in sentiment prediction with an accuracy of 74.4%, slightly ahead of BERT (72.5%) and FINBERT (72.2%). In contrast, the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model demonstrates considerably lower effectiveness with only 50.1% accuracy. Regression analyses highlight a robust positive impact of OPT model scores on next-day stock returns, with coefficients of 0.274 and 0.254 in different model specifications. BERT and FINBERT also exhibit predictive relevance, though to a lesser extent. Notably, we do not observe a significant relationship between the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model scores and stock returns, challenging the efficacy of this traditional method in the current financial context. In portfolio performance, the long-short OPT strategy excels with a Sharpe ratio of 3.05, compared to 2.11 for BERT and 2.07 for FINBERT long-short strategies. Strategies based on the Loughran-McDonald dictionary yield the lowest Sharpe ratio of 1.23. Our findings emphasize the superior performance of advanced LLMs, especially OPT, in financial market prediction and portfolio management, marking a significant shift in the landscape of financial analysis tools with implications to financial regulation and policy analysis.</description>
