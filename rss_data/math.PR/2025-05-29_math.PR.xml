      <title>Langevin SDEs have unique transient dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The overdamped Langevin stochastic differential equation (SDE) is a classical physical model used for chemical, genetic, and hydrological dynamics. In this work, we prove that the drift and diffusion terms of a Langevin SDE are jointly identifiable from temporal marginal distributions if and only if the process is observed out of equilibrium. This complete characterization of structural identifiability removes the long-standing assumption that the diffusion must be known to identify the drift. We then complement our theory with experiments in the finite sample setting and study the practical identifiability of the drift and diffusion, in order to propose heuristics for optimal data collection.</description>

      <title>The friendship paradox for trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the friendship paradox on finite and infinite trees. In particular, we monitor the vertices for which the friendship-bias is positive, neutral and negative, respectively. For an arbitrary finite tree, we show that the number of positive vertices is at least as large as the number of negative vertices, a property we refer to as significance, and derive a lower bound in terms of the branching points in the tree. For an infinite Galton-Watson tree, we compute the densities of the positive and the negative vertices and show that either may dominate the other, depending on the offspring distribution. We also compute the densities of the edges having two given types of vertices at their ends, and give conditions in terms of the offspring distribution under which these types are positively or negatively correlated.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the Probability Measure and the Coupling Parameters in a Curie-Weiss Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Curie-Weiss model is used to study phase transitions in statistical mechanics and has been the object of rigorous analysis in mathematical physics. We analyse the problem of reconstructing the probability measure of a multi-group Curie-Weiss model from a sample of data by employing the maximum likelihood estimator for the coupling parameters of the model, under the assumption that there is interaction within each group but not across group boundaries. The estimator has a number of positive properties, such as consistency, asymptotic normality, and exponentially decaying probabilities of large deviations of the estimator with respect to the true parameter value. A shortcoming in practice is the necessity to calculate the partition function of the Curie-Weiss model, which scales exponentially with respect to the population size. There are a number of applications of the estimator in political science, sociology, and automated voting, centred on the idea of identifying the degree of social cohesion in a population. In these applications, the coupling parameter is a natural way to quantify social cohesion. We treat the estimation of the optimal weights in a two-tier voting system, which requires the estimation of the coupling parameter.</description>

      <title>On Some Time-changed Variants of Erlang Queue with Multiple Arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First, we introduce and study a time-changed variant of the Erlang queue with multiple arrivals where the time-changing component used is the first hitting time of a tempered stable subordinator. We refer to this model as the tempered Erlang queue with multiple arrivals. The system of fractional difference-differential equations that governs its state probabilities is derived which is solved to obtain their explicit expressions. An equivalent representation in terms of phases and the mean queue length is obtained. Also, the distribution of inter-arrival times, inter-phase times, sojourn times and that of busy period are presented for the tempered Erlang queue. Later, a similar study is done for two other time-changed variants of the Erlang queue with multiple arrivals. The other time changing components considered are the first hitting time of a gamma subordinator and that of an inverse Gaussian subordinator. Various distributional properties for these time-changed variants are obtained.</description>

      <title>Discrete snakes with globally centered displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a scaling limit for globally centered discrete snakes on size-conditioned critical Bienaym\'e trees. More specifically, under a global finite variance condition, we prove convergence in the sense of random finite-dimensional distributions of the head of the discrete snake (suitably rescaled) to the head of the Brownian snake driven by a Brownian excursion. When the third moment of the offspring distribution is finite, we further prove the uniform functional convergence under a tail condition on the displacements. We also consider displacement distributions with heavier tails, for which we instead obtain convergence to a variant of the hairy snake introduced by Janson and Marckert. We further give two applications of our main result. Firstly, we obtain a scaling limit for the difference between the height process and the Lukasiewicz path of a size-conditioned critical Bienaym\'e tree. Secondly, we obtain a scaling limit for the difference between the height process of a size-conditioned critical Bienaym\'e tree and the height process of its associated looptree.</description>

      <title>New chaos decomposition of Gaussian nodal volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the random variable defined by the volume of the zero set of a smooth Gaussian field, on a general Riemannian manifold possibly with boundary, a fundamental object in probability and geometry. We prove a new explicit formula for its Wiener-It\^o chaos decomposition that is notably simpler than existing alternatives and which holds in greater generality, without requiring the field to be compatible with the geometry of the manifold. A key advantage of our formulation is a significant reduction in the complexity of computing the variance of the nodal volume. Unlike the standard Hermite expansion, which requires evaluating the expectation of products of $2+2n$ Hermite polynomials, our approach reduces this task--in any dimension $n$--to computing the expectation of a product of just four Hermite polynomials. As a consequence, we establish a new exact formula for the variance, together with lower and upper bounds. Our approach introduces two parameters associated to any Gaussian field: the frequency and the eccentricity. We use them to establish a quantitative version of Berry's cancellation phenomenon for Riemannian random waves on general manifolds.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for contact processes on sparse random graphs via metastability and local limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new perspective on the asymptotic regimes of fast and slow extinction in the contact process on locally converging sequences of sparse finite graphs. We characterise the phase boundary by the existence of a metastable density, which makes the study of the phase transition particularly amenable to local-convergence techniques. We use this approach to derive general conditions for the coincidence of the critical threshold with the survival/extinction threshold in the local limit. We further argue that the correct time scale to separate fast extinction from slow extinction in sparse graphs is, in general, the exponential scale, by showing that fast extinction may occur on stretched exponential time scales in sparse scale-free spatial networks. Together with recent results by Nam, Nguyen and Sly (Trans. Am. Math. Soc. 375, 2022), our methods can be applied to deduce that the fast/slow threshold in sparse configuration models coincides with the survival/extinction threshold on the limiting Galton-Watson tree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a spectral correspondence between random Schr\"odinger operators and deterministic convolution operators on wreath products, generalizing previous results that relate Lamplighter groups to Schr\"odinger operators with Bernoulli potentials. Using this correspondence in both directions, we obtain an elementary criterion for the absolute continuity of convolutions on wreath products, Lifschitz tail estimates for Schr\"odinger operators on Cayley graphs of polynomial growth, and an exact formula for the second moment of the Green function, expressed in terms of the wreath product with an Abelian group of lamps.</description>

      <title>Convergence in law for quasi-linear SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the quasi-linear stochastic wave and heat equations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d\in \{1,2,3\}$ and $d\geq 1$, respectively, and perturbed by an additive Gaussian noise which is white in time and has a homogeneous spatial correlation with spectral measure $\mu_n$. We allow the Fourier transform of $\mu_n$ to be a genuine distribution. Let $u^n$ be the mild solution to these equations. We provide sufficient conditions on the measures $\mu_n$ and the initial data to ensure that $u^n$ converges in law, in the space of continuous functions, to the solution of our equations driven by a noise with spectral measure $\mu$, where $\mu_n\to\mu$ in some sense. We apply our main result to various types of noises, such as the anisotropic fractional noise. We also show that we cover existing results in the literature, such as the case of Riesz kernels and the fractional noise with $d=1$.</description>

      <title>Learning with Expected Signatures: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expected signature maps a collection of data streams to a lower dimensional representation, with a remarkable property: the resulting feature tensor can fully characterize the data generating distribution. This "model-free" embedding has been successfully leveraged to build multiple domain-agnostic machine learning (ML) algorithms for time series and sequential data. The convergence results proved in this paper bridge the gap between the expected signature's empirical discrete-time estimator and its theoretical continuous-time value, allowing for a more complete probabilistic interpretation of expected signature-based ML methods. Moreover, when the data generating process is a martingale, we suggest a simple modification of the expected signature estimator with significantly lower mean squared error and empirically demonstrate how it can be effectively applied to improve predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Efficient Diffusion Models for Symmetric Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for designing efficient diffusion models for $d$-dimensional symmetric-space Riemannian manifolds, including the torus, sphere, special orthogonal group and unitary group. Existing manifold diffusion models often depend on heat kernels, which lack closed-form expressions and require either $d$ gradient evaluations or exponential-in-$d$ arithmetic operations per training step. We introduce a new diffusion model for symmetric manifolds with a spatially-varying covariance, allowing us to leverage a projection of Euclidean Brownian motion to bypass heat kernel computations. Our training algorithm minimizes a novel efficient objective derived via Ito's Lemma, allowing each step to run in $O(1)$ gradient evaluations and nearly-linear-in-$d$ ($O(d^{1.19})$) arithmetic operations, reducing the gap between diffusions on symmetric manifolds and Euclidean space. Manifold symmetries ensure the diffusion satisfies an "average-case" Lipschitz condition, enabling accurate and efficient sample generation. Empirically, our model outperforms prior methods in training speed and improves sample quality on synthetic datasets on the torus, special orthogonal group, and unitary group.</description>

      <title>A General-Purpose Theorem for High-Probability Bounds of Stochastic Approximation with Polyak Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polyak-Ruppert averaging is a widely used technique to achieve the optimal asymptotic variance of stochastic approximation (SA) algorithms, yet its high-probability performance guarantees remain underexplored in general settings. In this paper, we present a general framework for establishing non-asymptotic concentration bounds for the error of averaged SA iterates. Our approach assumes access to individual concentration bounds for the unaveraged iterates and yields a sharp bound on the averaged iterates. We also construct an example, showing the tightness of our result up to constant multiplicative factors. As direct applications, we derive tight concentration bounds for contractive SA algorithms and for algorithms such as temporal difference learning and Q-learning with averaging, obtaining new bounds in settings where traditional analysis is challenging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate discrete regularity estimates for a broad class of temporal numerical schemes for parabolic stochastic evolution equations. We provide a characterization of discrete stochastic maximal $\ell^p$-regularity in terms of its continuous counterpart, thereby establishing a unified framework that yields numerous new discrete regularity results. Moreover, as a consequence of the continuous-time theory, we establish several important properties of discrete stochastic maximal regularity such as extrapolation in the exponent $p$ and with respect to a power weight. Furthermore, employing the $H^\infty$-functional calculus, we derive a powerful discrete maximal estimate in the trace space norm $D_A(1-\frac1p,p)$ for $p \in [2,\infty)$.</description>

This builds on earlier work by Bourgain, who treated the cubic nonlinearity. The key new ingredient is a growth estimate for the infinite-volume $\Phi^{p+1}_1$-measures, which is proven via the stochastic quantization method.</description>

      <title>Path-Dependent SDEs: Solutions and Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a consistent method for estimating the parameters of a rich class of path-dependent SDEs, called signature SDEs, which can model general path-dependent phenomena. Path signatures are iterated integrals of a given path with the property that any sufficiently nice function of the path can be approximated by a linear functional of its signatures. This is why we model the drift and diffusion of our signature SDE as linear functions of path signatures. We provide conditions that ensure the existence and uniqueness of solutions to a general signature SDE. We then introduce the Expected Signature Matching Method (ESMM) for linear signature SDEs, which enables inference of the signature-dependent drift and diffusion coefficients from observed trajectories. Furthermore, we prove that ESMM is consistent: given sufficiently many samples and Picard iterations used by the method, the parameters estimated by the ESMM approach the true parameter with arbitrary precision. Finally, we demonstrate on a variety of empirical simulations that our ESMM accurately infers the drift and diffusion parameters from observed trajectories. While parameter estimation is often restricted by the need for a suitable parametric model, this work makes progress toward a completely general framework for SDE parameter estimation, using signature terms to model arbitrary path-independent and path-dependent processes.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of causal distributionally robust optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the causal distributionally robust optimization (DRO) in both discrete- and continuous- time settings. The framework captures model uncertainty, with potential models penalized in function of their adapted Wasserstein distance to a given reference model. Strength of the penalty is controlled using a real-valued parameter which, in the special case of an indicator penalty, is simply the radius of the uncertainty ball. Our main results derive the first-order sensitivity of the value of causal DRO with respect to the penalization parameter, i.e., we compute the sensitivity to model uncertainty. Moreover, we investigate the case where a martingale constraint is imposed on the underlying model, as is the case for pricing measures in mathematical finance. We introduce different scaling regimes, which allow us to obtain the continuous-time sensitivities as nontrivial limits of their discrete-time counterparts. We illustrate our results with examples. The sensitivities are naturally expressed using optional projections of Malliavin derivatives. To establish our results we obtain several novel results which are of independent interest. In particular, we introduce pathwise Malliavin derivatives and show these extend the classical notion. We also establish a novel stochastic Fubini theorem.</description>

      <title>Large Deviation Analysis for Canonical Gibbs Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a large-deviation theory developed for functionals of canonical Gibbs processes, i.e., Gibbs processes with respect to the binomial point process. We study the regime of a fixed intensity in a sequence of increasing windows. Our method relies on the traditional large-deviation result for local bounded functionals of Poisson point processes noting that the binomial point process is obtained from the Poisson point process by conditioning on the point number. Our main methodological contribution is the development of coupling constructions allowing us to handle delicate and unlikely pathological events. The presented results cover three types of Gibbs models - a model given by a bounded local interaction, a model given by a non-negative possibly unbounded increasing local interaction and the hard-core interaction model. The derived large deviation principle is formulated for the distributions of individual empirical fields driven by canonical Gibbs processes, with its special case being a large deviation principle for local bounded observables of the canonical Gibbs processes. We also consider unbounded non-negative increasing local observables, but the price for treating this more general case is that we only get large-deviation bounds for the tails of such observables. Our primary setting is the one with periodic boundary condition, however, we also discuss generalizations for different choices of the boundary condition.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we expand and generalize the findings presented in our previous work on the law of large numbers and the large deviation principle for Poisson processes with uniform catastrophes. We study three distinct scalings: sublinear (moderate deviations), linear (large deviations), and superlinear (superlarge deviations). Across these scales, we establish different yet coherent rate functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider long-range percolation, Ising model, and self-avoiding walk on $\mathbb Z^d$, with couplings decaying like $|x|^{-(d+\alpha)}$ where $0 &lt; \alpha \le 2$, above the upper critical dimensions. In the spread-out setting where the lace expansion applies, we show that the two-point function for each of these models exactly coincides with a random walk two-point function, up to a constant prefactor. Using this, for $0&lt;\alpha &lt; 2$, we prove upper and lower bounds of the form $|x|^{-(d-\alpha)} \min\{ 1, (p_c - p)^{-2} |x|^{-2\alpha} \}$ for the two-point function near the critical point $p_c$. For $\alpha=2$, we obtain a similar upper bound with logarithmic corrections. We also give a simple proof of the convergence of the lace expansion, assuming diagrammatic estimates.</description>

      <title>Extending P\'olya's random walker beyond probability I. Complex weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Working in combinatorial model $\mathrm{W_{co}}(d)$, $d=1,2,\dots$, of P\'olya's random walker in $\mathbb{Z}^d$, we prove two theorems on recurrence to a vertex. We obtain an effective version of the first theorem if $d=2$. Using a semi-formal approach to generating functions, we extend both theorems beyond probability to a more general model $\mathrm{W_{\mathbb{C}}}$ with complex weights. We relate models $\mathrm{W_{co}}(d)$ to standard models $\mathrm{W_{Ma}}(d)$ based on Markov chains. The follow-up article will treat non-Archimedean models $\mathrm{W_{fo}}(k)$ in which weights are formal power series in $\mathbb{C}[[x_1,x_2,\dots,x_k]]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.01426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate extreme values of Mahonian and Eulerian distributions arising from counting inversions and descents of random elements of finite Coxeter groups. To this end, we construct a triangular array of either distribution from a sequence of Coxeter groups with increasing ranks. To avoid degeneracy of extreme values, the number of i.i.d. samples $k_n$ in each row must be asymptotically bounded. We employ large deviations theory to prove the Gumbel attraction of Mahonian and Eulerian distributions. It is shown that for the two classes, different bounds on $k_n$ ensure this.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we studied the stochastic ordering behavior of series as well as parallel systems' lifetimes comprising dependent and heterogeneous components, experiencing random shocks, and exhibiting distinct dependency structures. We establish certain conditions on the lifetime of individual components where the dependency among components defined by Archimedean copulas, and the impact of random shocks on the overall system lifetime to get the results. We consider components whose survival functions are either increasing log-concave or decreasing log-convex functions of the parameters involved. These conditions make it possible to compare the lifetimes of two systems using the usual stochastic order framework. Additionally, we provide examples and graphical representations to elucidate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Mahalanobis Distance with Applications to Kernelized Novelty Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mahalanobis distance is a classical tool used to measure the covariance-adjusted distance between points in $\bbR^d$. In this work, we extend the concept of Mahalanobis distance to separable Banach spaces by reinterpreting it as a Cameron-Martin norm associated with a probability measure. This approach leads to a basis-free, data-driven notion of anomaly distance through the so-called variance norm, which can naturally be estimated using empirical measures of a sample. Our framework generalizes the classical $\bbR^d$, functional $(L^2[0,1])^d$, and kernelized settings; importantly, it incorporates non-injective covariance operators. We prove that the variance norm is invariant under invertible bounded linear transformations of the data, extending previous results which are limited to unitary operators. In the Hilbert space setting, we connect the variance norm to the RKHS of the covariance operator and establish consistency and convergence results for estimation using empirical measures. Using the variance norm, we introduce the notion of a kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance. In an empirical study on 12 real-world data sets, we demonstrate that the kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance outperforms the traditional kernelized Mahalanobis distance for multivariate time series novelty detection, using state-of-the-art time series kernels such as the signature, global alignment, and Volterra reservoir kernels.</description>

      <title>On absolute continuity of inhomogeneous and contracting on average self-similar measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a condition for absolute continuity of self-similar measures in arbitrary dimensions. This allows us to construct the first explicit absolutely continuous examples of inhomogeneous self-similar measures in dimension one and two. In fact, for $d\geq 1$ and any given rotations in $O(d)$ acting irreducibly on $\mathbb{R}^d$ as well as any distinct translations, all having algebraic coefficients, we construct absolutely continuous self-similar measures with the given rotations and translations. We furthermore strengthen Varj\'u's result for Bernoulli convolutions, treat complex Bernoulli convolutions and in dimension $\geq 3$ improve the condition on absolute continuity by Lindenstrauss-Varj\'u. Moreover, self-similar measures of contracting on average measures are studied, which may include expanding similarities in their support.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Solving FBSDEs and their Associated Semilinear Elliptic PDEs with Small Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forward-backwards stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) play an important role in optimal control, game theory, economics, mathematical finance, and in reinforcement learning. Unfortunately, the available FBSDE solvers operate on \textit{individual} FBSDEs, meaning that they cannot provide a computationally feasible strategy for solving large families of FBSDEs, as these solvers must be re-run several times. \textit{Neural operators} (NOs) offer an alternative approach for \textit{simultaneously solving} large families of decoupled FBSDEs by directly approximating the solution operator mapping \textit{inputs:} terminal conditions and dynamics of the backwards process to \textit{outputs:} solutions to the associated FBSDE. Though universal approximation theorems (UATs) guarantee the existence of such NOs, these NOs are unrealistically large. Upon making only a few simple theoretically-guided tweaks to the standard convolutional NO build, we confirm that ``small'' NOs can uniformly approximate the solution operator to structured families of FBSDEs with random terminal time, uniformly on suitable compact sets determined by Sobolev norms using a logarithmic depth, a constant width, and a polynomial rank in the reciprocal approximation error.
  This result is rooted in our second result, and main contribution to the NOs for PDE literature, showing that our convolutional NOs of similar depth and width but grow only \textit{quadratically} (at a dimension-free rate) when uniformly approximating the solution operator of the associated class of semilinear Elliptic PDEs to these families of FBSDEs. A key insight into how NOs work we uncover is that the convolutional layers of our NO can approximately implement the fixed point iteration used to prove the existence of a unique solution to these semilinear Elliptic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Spectrally Robust Covariance Shrinkage for Hotelling's $T^2$ in High Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate covariance shrinkage for Hotelling's $T^2$ in the regime where the data dimension $p$ and the sample size $n$ grow in a fixed ratio -- without assuming that the population covariance matrix is spiked or well-conditioned. When $p/n\to\phi \in (0,1)$, we propose a practical finite-sample shrinker that, for any maximum-entropy signal prior and any fixed significance level, (a) asymptotically maximizes power under Gaussian data, and (b) asymptotically saturates the Hanson--Wright lower bound on power in the more general sub-Gaussian case. Our approach is to formulate and solve a variational problem characterizing the optimal limiting shrinker, and to show that our finite-sample method consistently approximates this limit by extending recent local random matrix laws. Empirical studies on simulated and real-world data, including the Crawdad UMich/RSS data set, demonstrate up to a $50\%$ gain in power over leading linear and nonlinear competitors at a significance level of $10^{-4}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we define \begin{align*} \mathrm{conv}_k(A) := \left\{ \lambda_1 s_1 + \cdots + \lambda_k s_k : \lambda_i \in [0,1], \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i = 1 , s_i \in A \right\} \end{align*} to be the set of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that can be written as a $k$-fold convex combination of vectors in $A$. Let $\gamma_n$ denote the standard Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We show that for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, there exists a subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with Gaussian measure $\gamma_n(A) \geq 1- \varepsilon$ such that for all $k = O_\varepsilon(\sqrt{\log \log(n)})$, $\mathrm{conv}_k(A)$ contains no convex set $K$ of Gaussian measure $\gamma_n(K) \geq \varepsilon$. This provides a negative resolution to a stronger version of a conjecture of Talagrand. Our approach utilises concentration properties of random copulas and the application of optimal transport techniques to the empirical coordinate measures of vectors in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Hua-Chen New Theory of Economic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Between 1957-1985, Chinese mathematician Loo-Keng Hua pioneered economic optimization theory through three key contributions: establishing economic stability's fundamental theorem, proving the uniqueness of equilibrium solutions in economic systems, and developing a consumption-integrated model 50 days before his death. Since 1988, Mu-Fa Chen has been working on Hua's theory. He introduced stochastics, namely Markov chains, to economic optimization theory. He updated and developed Hua's model and came up with a new model (Chen's model) which has become the starting point of a new economic optimization theory. Chen's theory can be applied to economic stability test, bankruptcy prediction, product ranking and classification, economic prediction and adjustment, economic structure optimization. Chen's theory can also provide efficient algorithms that are programmable and intelligent. {Stochastics} is the cornerstone of Chen's theory. There is no overlap between Chen's theory, and the existing mathematical economy theory and the economics developments that were awarded Nobel Prizes in Economics between 1969 and 2024. The distinguished features of Chen's theory from the existing theories are quantitative, calculable, predictable, optimizable, programmable and can be intelligent. This survey provides a theoretical overview of the newly published monograph \cite{5rw24}. Specifically, the invariant of the economic structure matrix, also known as the Chen's invariant, was first published in this survey.</description>

Abstract: Generative modeling of non-negative, discrete data, such as symbolic music, remains challenging due to two persistent limitations in existing methods. Firstly, many approaches rely on modeling continuous embeddings, which is suboptimal for inherently discrete data distributions. Secondly, most models optimize variational bounds rather than exact data likelihood, resulting in inaccurate likelihood estimates and degraded sampling quality. While recent diffusion-based models have addressed these issues separately, we tackle them jointly. In this work, we introduce the Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model (ItDPDM), inspired by photon arrival process, which combines exact likelihood estimation with fully discrete-state modeling. Central to our approach is an information-theoretic Poisson Reconstruction Loss (PRL) that has a provable exact relationship with the true data likelihood. ItDPDM achieves improved likelihood and sampling performance over prior discrete and continuous diffusion models on a variety of synthetic discrete datasets. Furthermore, on real-world datasets such as symbolic music and images, ItDPDM attains superior likelihood estimates and competitive generation quality-demonstrating a proof of concept for distribution-robust discrete generative modeling.</description>

Abstract: We show that bootstrap methods based on the positivity of probability measures provide a systematic framework for studying both synchronous and asynchronous nonequilibrium stochastic processes on infinite lattices. First, we formulate linear programming problems that use positivity and invariance property of invariant measures to derive rigorous bounds on their expectation values. Second, for time evolution in asynchronous processes, we exploit the master equation along with positivity and initial conditions to construct linear and semidefinite programming problems that yield bounds on expectation values at both short and late times. We illustrate both approaches using two canonical examples: the contact process in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions, and the Domany-Kinzel model in both synchronous and asynchronous forms in 1+1 dimensions. Our bounds on invariant measures yield rigorous lower bounds on critical rates, while those on time evolutions provide two-sided bounds on the half-life of the infection density and the temporal correlation length in the subcritical phase.</description>
