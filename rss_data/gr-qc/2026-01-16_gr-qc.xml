      <title>Multibanded Reduced Order Quadrature Techniques for Gravitational Wave Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced-order quadrature (ROQ) is commonly used to speed up parameter estimation in gravitational wave astronomy; however, the construction of ROQ bases can be computationally costly, particularly for longer duration signals. We propose a modified construction strategy based on PyROQ that accelerates this process by performing the basis search using multiband waveforms, without compromising the desired likelihood speed and accuracy. We use this altered method to construct a set of ROQs in the sub-solar mass range using the \texttt{IMRPhenomXAS\_NRTidalV3} waveform. We find a 20\% to 30\% decrease in basis size and a $\sim 10$ times decrease in basis construction time. We verify the altered method preserves the likelihood accuracy and mantains consitent parameter estimation results.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optical Inspired Models for Unitary Black Hole Evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we describe optically inspired models for unitary black hole (BH) evaporation. The goal of these models are (i) to be operationally simple, (ii) approximately preserve the thermal nature of the emitted Hawking Radiation (HR), and (iii) attempt to reproduce the Page Curve that purports that information flows forth from the BH when it has evaporated to approximately half its initial mass. We concentrate on modeling the BH as a single mode squeezed state successively interacting, by means of beam splitters and squeezers, with vacuum modes near the horizon, giving rise to entangled pairs representing the external Hawking radiation and its partner particle inside the horizon. Since all states and operations are Gaussian throughout, we use a symplectic formalism to track the evolution of the composite system through the evolving means and variances of their quadrature operators. This allows us to easily compute correlations and entanglement between the BH and the HR, as well as calculate correlations between the BH at early and late times.</description>

      <title>Non-Monotonic Enhancement of the Magnetic Penrose Process in Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Spacetime and its Implication for Electron Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (KBR) spacetime, an exact rotating electrovacuum solution describing a black hole (BH) immersed in an intrinsic, uniform electromagnetic field. We analyze the behavior of charged particles in this geometry and find that the spacetime structure itself responds non-monotonically to the background magnetic field $B$. Specifically, both the event horizon and the static limit surface first expand as $B$ increases, reach a maximum size at an intermediate field strength, and then contract toward the extremal limit. Although the ergoregion itself shrinks monotonically with $B$, this structural feature gives rise to a pronounced non-monotonic dependence of the energy extraction efficiency on the magnetic field $B$, i.e., the efficiency initially rises, attains a maximum value, and subsequently falls as the extremal condition is approached. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic trends usually associated with magnetic enhancements in the Kerr geometry. We further explore an astrophysical application of the MPP by estimating the maximum energy of electrons escaping from the ergoregion of the KBR BH. Modeling neutron beta decay occurring near the event horizon, we derive an analytical expression for the energy gained by electrons accelerated by the magnetic field. Applying our results to the supermassive BH at the Galactic center, $\mathrm{SgrA}^*$, we find that electrons can be accelerated up to energies of $\sim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{eV}$ for realistic values of the spin and magnetic field. Although these energies exceed the observed upper range of cosmic-ray electrons, radiative losses such as synchrotron emission and inverse-Compton scattering can efficiently reduce them to the observed $\mathrm{TeV}$ scale.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension and Dark Energy in Teleparallel Gauss-Bonnet Gravity: New Constraints from DESI BAO, Pantheon$^+$ and Hubble Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the cosmological dynamics of a teleparallel Gauss-Bonnet gravity model defined by the torsion scalar $T$ and the torsion-based Gauss-Bonnet invariant $T_{\mathcal{G}}$, deriving modified Friedmann equations for a flat FLRW Universe and corresponding linear scalar perturbation equations. Using a numerical approach, we solve these equations for pressureless matter, predicting the redshift evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, incorporating late-time observations from Cosmic Chronometers, Pantheon$^+$ with SH0ES, and DESI BAO (Data Release 1 and Data Release 2), constrains the model parameters, revealing that $f(T, T_{\mathcal{G}})$ mimics dark energy in the absence of a cosmological constant, presenting a viable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Stability is confirmed via scalar perturbation analysis of Hubble and matter density fluctuations, positioning $f(T, T_{\mathcal{G}})$ gravity as a robust framework to address cosmic acceleration challenges. The model yields a present-day effective equation of state $\omega_{\mathrm{eff}}(z=0) \approx -0.664$ to \(-0.693\), consistent with observations, and partially alleviates the Hubble tension with $H_0$ estimates of 69 to 71.5\kms. These findings highlight the potential of $f(T, T_{\mathcal{G}})$ gravity to resolve fundamental cosmological puzzles while aligning with late-time observational data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing beyond the eikonal approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waves propagating through a gravitational potential exhibit wave-optics effects when their wavelength is not significantly smaller than the lensing scales. We study the propagation of a scalar wave, governed by the Klein-Gordon equation in curved spacetime, to focus on effects on amplitude and phase, while leaving aside the issue of wave polarization which affects electromagnetic and gravitational waves. Using the Newman-Penrose formalism, we obtain the first corrections beyond the geometric optics in the expansion in the inverse frequency. In vacuum, that is for Weyl tensor lensing, there is no wave effect at first order in $G$ and wave effects start at order $G^2$. Conversely, if the wave travels through a non-vanishing matter density, the first corrections start at order $G$. We check these analytic results by solving numerically the equations dictating the evolution of the corrections either in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole or through a transparent star.</description>

      <title>Effects of spontaneous Lorentz Symmetry breaking on Letelier-AdS charged black boles within Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the geodesic motion of massless particles -- specifically photons -- in the spacetime of a charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) surrounded by a cloud of strings (CoS) within the framework of Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity. We analyze the effective potential that governs photon trajectories, explore the properties and location of the photon sphere (PS), and examine the effective radial force acting on photons. The resulting BH shadow is also studied, highlighting the roles of both the CoS parameter $\alpha$ and the KR field parameter $\ell$ in shaping its geometry. We constrain these parameters using observational data from M87* and Sgr A* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the motion of neutral test particles in the same gravitational background. By examining the impact of the CoS and KR field, we show how these additional fields modify the dynamics relative to standard charged BH scenarios. Finally, we study the fundamental frequencies associated with quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of test particles, demonstrating how these frequencies are affected by the presence of the CoS and KR field. Our results reveal the rich structure of AdS-BH spacetimes influenced by string clouds and antisymmetric tensor fields, with potential observational consequences in gravitational wave and BH imaging astronomy.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Quantum Matter by Gravity with Differential Scattering Cross Section at Tree Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The definition of weak equivalence principle of quantum matter is an open problem at present. In order to reflect the probability of quantum system in the quantum version of weak equivalence principle, we proposed a quantum weak equivalence principle based on differential scattering cross section at tree level, that is, the differential scattering cross section does not depend on the mass and properties of the scattered particles when the target particles take the large mass limit. This version of the quantum equivalence principle we proposed will be broken by the spin properties of quantum matter. In the non-relativistic case, the difference of differential scattering cross sections of scattered particles with different spin properties scattered by target particles is mainly reflected in the order of $ \mathcal O (p _ {\mathrm{cm}} ^2) $. In the relativistic case , we studied the asymptotic behavior of differential scattering cross sections at small angles. When the target particles are scalar particles, the difference of light particles with different spin properties is mainly reflected in the $ \mathcal O (1/\theta^2) $ order. When the target particles are Dirac particles, the difference of light particles with different spin properties is mainly reflected in the $ \mathcal O (1/\theta^4) $ order. The polarization of differential scattering cross section when scattered particles are Dirac particles is investigated. The result of the degree of polarization depends on the polarization direction of the incident particles.</description>

      <title>Analyzing intermittent stochastic gravitational wave background I:Effect of detector response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing number of gravitational-wave detections, particularly from binary black hole mergers, there is increasing anticipation that an astrophysical background, formed by an ensemble of faint, high-redshift events, will be observed in the near future by the ground-based detector network. This background is anticipated to exhibit non-Gaussian statistical properties. To develop a robust method for detecting such a non-Gaussian gravitational-wave background, we revisit optimal detection strategies based on the Gaussian-mixture likelihood model. In this work, we demonstrate that properly accounting for the detector antenna pattern is essential. Current approaches typically rely on the overlap reduction function averaged over the sky. Through simulations, we show that using such an averaged response introduces significant biases in parameter estimation. In addition, we propose a computationally feasible method that incorporates second-order corrections as an approximation of the full integral over the source distribution. Our results indicate that this approach effectively eliminates these biases. We also show that our method remains robust even when considering anisotropic backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Charged Simpson-Visser AdS Black Holes: Geodesic Structure and Thermodynamic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we apply the Simpson-Visser (SV) regularization scheme to Anti-de Sitter (AdS) charged black holes and investigate the resulting spacetime geometry in detail, with emphasis on both geodesic structure and thermodynamic behavior. In particular, we analyze the motion of massless particle, focusing on key features such as the photon sphere, black hole shadow, photon trajectory and the dynamics of charged particles, including the characteristics of the circular and type of orbits. Furthermore, we compare the theoretical predictions of the charged SV-AdS black hole with recent observations reported by the Event Horizon telescope (EHT) for M87* and Sgr~A*. Beyond the geodesic analysis, we explore the thermodynamics of the regularized charged SV-AdS black hole by deriving essential quantities such as the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity. Through a systematic examination of these thermodynamic variables, we demonstrate how the regularization parameter inherent in the SV regularization influences particle dynamics, stability conditions, and the overall thermal properties of the modified black hole solution. This comprehensive study highlights the interplay between regularization effects and the physical observables associated with charged AdS black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how our Universe can emerge from a symmetry breaking of a multicomponent $W_3$ algebra, where the components in addition form a Jordan algebra. We discuss how symmetry breaking related to the Jordan algebras $H_3(C)$ and $H_3(O)$ over the complex and octonion numbers can lead to an extended four-dimensional spacetime, where the expansion of the Universe is governed by a modified Friedmann equation. We finally discuss how this modified Friedmann equation might explain a number of puzzling cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of oscillating and differentially rotating neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remnants of binary neutron star mergers are expected to be massive, rapidly rotating stars whose oscillations produce gravitational waves in the kilohertz band. The degree of differential rotation and the rotation profiles strongly influence their structure, stability and oscillation spectrum, and must therefore be taken into account when modeling their dynamics. We extend the pseudospectral code ROXAS (Relativistic Oscillations of non-aXisymmetric neutron stArS) to enable the dynamical evolution of oscillating, differentially rotating neutron stars. Using the updated code, we aim to study the star's oscillation frequencies. We extend the previous formalism, based on primitive variables and the conformal flatness approximation, to differential rotation. Within this framework, we run a series of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric simulations of perturbed, differentially rotating neutron stars with different rotation rates, and extract their oscillation frequencies. Axisymmetric modes, as well as those under the Cowling approximation, show excellent agreement with published results. We show that the secondary fundamental mode in the Cowling approximation is an artifact that does not appear in dynamical spacetimes. In addition, we provide, for the first time, frequency values for non-axisymmetric modes in differentially rotating configurations evolved in conformal flatness. This extension broadens the range of physical scenarios that can be studied with ROXAS, and represents a step toward more realistic modeling of post-merger remnants and their gravitational-wave emission.</description>

      <title>Rapid post-merger signal of circularly polarized gravitational wave from magnetic black hole superradiance: novel approach to detect magnetic monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytic framework demonstrating that a spinning black hole endowed with a net magnetic charge exhibits a dramatically amplified superradiant instability against charged scalar fields, enhanced by several orders of magnitude compared with the neutral Kerr case. The amplification arises from a monopole induced reduction of the centrifugal barrier. This shift deepens the gravitational bound-state potential well and produces a parametrically larger instability growth rate. This resulting rapid growth yields a macroscopic boson cloud that acts as a coherent source of near monochromatic continuous gravitational waves (GWs). We find an enhanced GW power. Monopole harmonic selection rules restrict the emission from the north (south) clouds corresponding to opposite helicities. Their superposition generates an (approximately) circularly polarized continuous GWs at a fixed sky location within even parity general relativity, distinct from the generic elliptical polarization of the Kerr case. In light of these new findings, we propose a potential smoking-gun search strategy for magnetic monopole and ultralight boson: the rapid post-merger follow-up GW signals from binary-black-hole merger remnants through ground-based and space-based GW experiments. In contrast to the Kerr case, where the signal turn-on can be delayed to decades-centuries, a magnetic remnant can form a cloud and emit a stronger, circularly polarized continuous GWs within weeks to months. Taking the magnetic supermassive remnants as an example, we demonstrate that the rapid follow-up GW signal in the mHz band appears just in few weeks after binary black hole mergers. Moreover, future polarization (ellipticity) measurements can distinguish the magnetic scenario from Kerr while providing a parity-even mechanism for circularly polarized GWs in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Late time cosmology in $f(Q,L_{m})$ Gravity with Constraints from DESI DR2 BAO Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate late-time cosmology in the context of modified $f(Q,L_m)$ gravity, considering a non-linear model$ f(Q,L_m) = \alpha Q + \beta L_m^n + \lambda$ where, $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\lambda$, and $n$ are some free parameters. The modified Friedmann equations are derived for a barotropic cosmic fluid, and an analytical solution for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ is obtained. Using the latest DESI DR2 BAO data, previous BAO compilations (P-BAO), and cosmic chronometer (CC) datasets, we constrain the model parameters through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. Our results show that the model successfully describes the observed late-time cosmic acceleration with slightly tighter constraints from the inclusion of DESI dataset. The present-day Hubble constant is determined as $H_0 \simeq 69.5\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, while the deceleration parameter confirms accelerated expansion with $q_0 \simeq -0.57$. The transition redshift, where the universe switches from deceleration to acceleration, occurs in the range $z_{\rm tr} \sim 0.56 - 0.77$. Similarly, a smooth and physically consistent transition from a matter-dominated decelerated period at high redshifts to an accelerated phase at late times is revealed by the evolution of $\omega_{eff}(z)$. While statefinder diagnostic shows the model favours a Chaplygin gas like nature for DESI and DESI+CC, whereas the model favours as quintessence dominated evolution for P-BAO+CC in the late time regime. Conclusively, all these results along with the study of the energy conditions and stability analysis showcases the given $f(Q,L_m)$ model offers a viable alternative to GR-based cosmology</description>

      <title>DC response of an interferometer topology with an L-shaped cavity: a tabletop study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new interferometer topology for kilohertz gravitational-wave detection was recently proposed in [Zhang et al. Phys. Rev. X 13, 021019 (2023)]. The design is based on an L-shaped optical cavity pumped through a Sagnac-like vortex. We report a tabletop experiment that characterizes the interferometer's optical response near DC. When the laser frequency is locked to the resonance of the L-shaped cavity, we observe that the cavity input coupler becomes effectively transparent, yielding a simple Michelson-like response. Moreover, the Sagnac vortex separates into upper and lower paths, which behave as two independent pumping paths driving the cavity. These observations are in agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results provide an intuitive physical picture of this interferometer topology and offer insight into its lock acquisition strategy.</description>

      <title>The Topological Equivalence Principle: On Decoupling TFTs from Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological field theories (TFTs) play an important role in characterizing the deep infrared (IR) of many quantum systems with a mass gap, as well as the global symmetries of quantum field theories (QFTs) decoupled from gravity. In gravitational asymptotically AdS spacetimes, TFT sectors which are putatively decoupled from local metric data are nevertheless non-perturbatively sensitive to Newton's constant via a sum over topologically distinct saddle point configurations. Tracking the fate of this non-decoupling in the boundary dual, we argue that in spite of appearances, this dependence on Newton's constant extends to local metric fluctuations. Said differently, TFTs are in the Swampland. In tandem with earlier results on the absence of global symmetries in theories with subregion-subregion duality, this also establishes that topological operators of boundary systems with a gravity dual are always non-topological in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Superball of Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I solve the equations of the low-energy limit of string theory to obtain a solution corresponding to a microcanonical ensemble of highly-excited superstrings. This ``Superball of Strings'' is a static, spherically symmetric ``fuzzball'' of BPS strings with a size set by a random walk scaling. The solution can be embedded in string theory in a significant part of parameter space. While the solution does not constitute a Lorentzian interpretation for a Euclidean, horizonless solution by Chen, Maldacena, and Witten, a few connections are noted. A singular extremal black hole and the Superball of Strings exist as Supergravity solutions with the same asymptotic boundary conditions; however, I argue that the latter describes generic BPS microstates.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Description of Critical Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions occur through the nucleation of critical bubbles of the stable phase within the metastable phase. Using holography, we present a fully microscopic description of these bubbles in a strongly coupled, four-dimensional gauge theory at finite temperature. In the gravitational dual, these bubbles correspond to static, inhomogeneous and unstable black-brane solutions with a localized deformation on the horizon. We construct these solutions across the entire metastable branch and compute the surface tension and the nucleation rate. We then compare these microscopic results with those obtained from a two-derivative effective action for the order parameter in two different scenarios. When the effective action is derived from the microscopic theory via holography, we find remarkable agreement. However, when the effective action is constrained only by the equation of state and dimensional analysis, significant discrepancies emerge. These discrepancies can be resolved if an additional constraint related to the surface tension is imposed.</description>

      <title>The Entire Four-Graviton EFT from the Duality Between Color and Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) double-copy construction reveals a fundamental structural connection between gauge and gravity theories. At its core, the BCJ double copy is directly due to a duality between the algebraic relations of a color root and those of a kinematic root. We generalize this principle beyond the conventional Lie algebra structure of tree-level Yang-Mills theory. By demanding color-kinematics duality for the complete basis of four-point color structures -- including those involving the symmetric $d^{abc}$ constants -- we define the universal double copy. We systematically classify the bases of all such parity-even generalized gauge-theory numerators and, independently, the space of all parity-even four-graviton higher-derivative operators. We demonstrate that our universal double-copy construction precisely spans the entire tower of parity-even four-graviton amplitudes in any dimension, except for the Lovelock $R^3$ contribution in $D &gt;6$ which we can express in terms of a particularly simple universal triple-copy involving gauge theories coupled to scalars. Explicit machine-readable expressions for the complete basis of gauge-theory numerators and fundamental gravitational building blocks are provided in the ancillary files. This establishes that all possible four-point gravitational interactions can be factorized into products of gauge-theory building blocks governed by this universal notion of color-kinematics duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in multi-stage axion monodromy inflation an interruption near the end of the penultimate stage can lead to a spike in the gravitational wave background. These gravitational waves are in the frequency range and with an amplitude accessible to proposed terrestrial detectors such as the Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, and future Levitated Sensor Detector experiments.</description>

      <title>Monitoring of Continuous-Wave Hardware Injections in LIGO Interferometers during the O4 Observing Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although there have now been hundreds of transient gravitational-wave detections of merging compact stars by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detector network, no continuous-wave (CW) signals have yet been discovered. To ensure that such signals, expected to be exceedingly weak, can be detected in the ongoing O4 observing run by coherent integration over years, simulated waveforms ('hardware injections') are injected directly into the LIGO data by continuously modulating the positions of the interferometer mirrors so as to mimic nearly sinusoidal signals from fast-spinning galactic neutron stars. A set of 18 such simulated CW sources are injected with signal frequencies spanning much of the LIGO detection band and with varying sky locations. By verifying the successful recovery of the simulated signals, including preservation of absolute phase over as many as 10^{11} signal cycles, we validate our understanding of detector response and end-to-end search pipelines, including data cleaning. Daily and weekly monitoring of the signal reconstruction is meant to catch any unexpected sudden changes in interferometer response, to verify that signal-to-noise ratio increases as expected and to verify that simulated source parameters are recovered correctly. We describe three methods of monitoring: 1) a highly templated matched filter to extract signal amplitude and phase precisely; 2) a frequentist Fstatistic evaluation that marginalizes over amplitude, phase and orientation of the star; and 3) a Bayesian reconstruction of the source parameters together with noise characterization. Results from each method are shown, with emphasis on the new templated method, which yields precise measurement of the critical phase offset parameter and therefore validates understanding of absolute timing delays in the detector response and data stream.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Path Integrals and Jackiw-Teitelboim wormholes with imaginary scalars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lorentzian path integral was recently used to argue that standard Euclidean axion wormholes do not dominate computations of connected AdS/CFT partition functions. We now apply similar methods to study the seemingly-analogous Jackiw-Teitelboim wormholes constructed by Garcia-Garcia and Godet using Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with an imaginary-valued minimally-coupled massless scalar field. However, this time we find that these wormholes do dominate our path integral for the relevant connected partition function. This supports the suggestion by Garcia-Garcia and Godet that contributions from such wormholes parallel the physics of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at complex couplings. The result also illustrates the sensitivity of wormhole contributions to details of the relevant physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist conformally invariant, higher-derivative, variational analogs of the Yang-Mills condition for connections on vector bundles over a conformal manifold of even dimension greater than or equal to six. We give a compact formula for these analogs and prove that they are a strict weakening of the Yang-Mills condition with respect to an Einstein metric. We also show that the conformal Yang-Mills condition for the tractor connection of an even dimensional conformal manifold is equivalent to vanishing of its Fefferman-Graham obstruction tensor. This result uses that the tractor connection on a Poincar\'e-Einstein manifold is itself Yang-Mills.</description>

      <title>M\"obius-Type Structures in Non-Orientable Singular Semi-Riemannian Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our objective is to illuminate the global structure of non-orientable manifolds with signature-changing metrics. Using explicit constructions based on the topology of the M\"{o}bius strip, we produce examples of crosscap manifolds where the gluing junction serves as the locus of signature change. In another set of examples, we convert the M\"{o}bius strip into a singular signature-type changing manifold. For these resulting manifolds, we test whether the metric can be expressed as $\tilde{g}=g+fV^{\flat}\otimes V^{\flat}$, with $g$ a Lorentzian metric and $f$ a smooth interpolation function between the Lorentzian and Riemannian regions, separated by the signature change hypersurface $\mathcal{H}$. Our analysis reveals that the radical of the metric can transition from transverse to tangent at $\mathcal{H}$, pseudo-space orientability is obstructed by the Euler characteristic, and pseudo-time orientability may still hold. These examples illustrate subtle obstructions to applying standard transformation prescriptions for signature change and highlight novel phenomena in compact, non-orientable semi-Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Warm Hybrid Axion Inflation in $\alpha$-Attractor Models Constrained by ACT and Future Plan experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of warm hybrid inflation within the framework of $\alpha$-attractor models, where an axionic inflaton is coupled to a waterfall field in the presence of thermal dissipation. The model is analyzed for both linear ($\Upsilon \propto T$) and cubic ($\Upsilon \propto T^{3}$) dissipation regimes. Confronting the theoretical predictions with the latest observational data from Planck+BICEP/Keck, P-ACT-LB-BK18 and SPT, and , we find that in the weak dissipative regime ($Q_{*} \lesssim 10^{-5}$), the scalar spectral index $n_{s} \simeq 0.965$ lies at the boundary of the combined P-ACT-LB-BK18 constraints, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ remains within observable ranges. For stronger dissipation ($Q_{*} \gtrsim 10^{-5}$), the model predicts values of $n_{s}$ well within the $1$--$2\sigma$ confidence region of all datasets, with tensor modes remaining fully observable in both dissipation scenarios. These results indicate that forthcoming CMB polarization experiments may be capable of detecting primordial gravitational waves, thereby providing a robust observational test of warm hybrid inflation across different dissipative regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the question of counting the degrees of freedom in theoretical models, with an emphasis on theories of fields and gravity. Among the possible approaches, the Hamiltonian formulation remains one of the most systematic and robust tools. However, it can easily become long and technically involved. In this work, we present a broadly applicable recipe to find the degrees of freedom directly, based on the Lagrangian formulation. We compare it to the standard approaches, highlight the challenges that may arise in the latter, and demonstrate that the proposed method leads to transparent insights about the dynamical nature of theory in a quick, simple, and straight-forward way.</description>

      <title>Late-time acceleration without a vacuum term in ${f(R,L_m)}$ gravity: scaling deSitter dynamics and parameter constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate late-time cosmic acceleration in $f(R,L_m)$ gravity driven by nonlinear matter contributions, focusing on the class $f(R,L_m)=R/2+c_1 L_m+c_n L_m^{n}+c_0$ with the explicit choice $L_m=\rho_m$ and an uncoupled radiation sector. We analyze two realizations: (i) Case A: $f(R,L_m)=R/2+\beta \rho_m^{n}+\gamma$, where $\gamma$ acts as a vacuum term, and (ii) Case B: $f(R,L_m)=R/2+\beta \rho_m+\gamma \rho_m^{n}$, where the nonlinear sector can mimic dark energy without an explicit cosmological constant. For each case, we construct a bounded autonomous system, classify all critical points and their stability, and compute cosmographic diagnostics. The phase-space analysis shows that Case A reproduces the standard radiation$\to$matter$\to$de~Sitter sequence only for $n\gtrsim 4/5$, with acceleration essentially enforced by the vacuum term. In contrast, Case~B admits a qualitatively distinct and phenomenologically appealing branch: for $0&lt;n&lt;1/2$ the system possesses a physical \emph{scaling} de~Sitter future attractor inside the bounded simplex, yielding radiation$\to$matter$\to$acceleration with $q=-1$ and $\omega_{\rm eff}=-1$ and without introducing $c_0$. We confront both models with background data (CC, Union3, DESI BAO, plus a BBN prior on $\Omega_b h^2$) using nested sampling and perform model comparison via Bayesian evidence and AIC/BIC. The full data combination constrains $n=1.08\pm0.05$ in Case A and $n=0.05\pm0.10$ in Case B (68\% CL), the latter lying within the accelerating window while remaining statistically consistent with $\Lambda$CDM kinematics at the background level. We also record minimal consistency conditions for stability (tensor no-ghost and luminal propagation) and motivate a dedicated perturbation-level analysis as the next step to test growth and lensing observables.</description>

      <title>A binary black hole metric approximation from inspiral to merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a semi-analytic binary black hole (BBH) metric approximation that models the entire evolution of the system from inspiral to merger. The metric is constructed as a boosted Kerr-Schild superposition following post-Newtonian (PN) trajectories at the fourth PN order in the inspiral phase. During merger, we interpolate the binary metric in time to a single black hole remnant with properties obtained from numerical relativity {(NR)} fitting formulas. The new metric can model binary black holes with arbitrary spin direction, mass ratio, and eccentricity at any stage of their evolution in a fast and computationally efficient way. We analyze the properties of our new metric and compare it with a full numerical relativity evolution. We show that Hamiltonian constraints are well-behaved even at merger and that the mass and spin measured self-consistently on the black hole horizon deviate in average only $\sim 10-5 \%$ compared to the full numerical evolution. We perform General Relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations for two cases: merging black holes in a uniform gas, and inspiralling black holes accreting from a magnetized circumbinary disk. We demonstrate that, in both cases, the properties of the gas, such as the accretion rate, are remarkably similar between the two approaches, with small average differences. We show that the approximate metric has several computational advantages over numerical relativity evolution. The numerical implementation of the metric is now open-source and optimized for numerical work.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in spherical symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the codimension-one nonlinear asymptotic stability of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family of black holes in the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-neutral scalar field model, up to and including the event horizon. More precisely, we show that there exists a teleologically defined, codimension-one "submanifold" $\mathfrak M_\mathrm{stab}$ of the moduli space of spherically symmetric characteristic data for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system lying close to the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family, such that any data in $\mathfrak M_\mathrm{stab}$ evolve into a solution with the following properties as time goes to infinity: (i) the metric decays to a member of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family uniformly up to the event horizon, (ii) the scalar field decays to zero pointwise and in an appropriate energy norm, (iii) the first translation-invariant ingoing null derivative of the scalar field is approximately constant on the event horizon $\mathcal H^+$, (iv) for "generic" data, the second translation-invariant ingoing null derivative of the scalar field grows linearly along the event horizon. Due to the coupling of the scalar field to the geometry via the Einstein equations, suitable components of the Ricci tensor exhibit non-decay and growth phenomena along the event horizon. Points (i) and (ii) above reflect the "stability" of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family and points (iii) and (iv) verify the presence of the celebrated "Aretakis instability" for the linear wave equation on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in the full nonlinear Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field model.</description>

      <title>Probing Spin-2 Ultralight Dark Matter with Space-based Gravitational Wave Detectors in the mHz Regime</title>

Abstract: Spin-2 ultralight dark matter (ULDM) is a viable dark matter candidate and it can be constrained using gravitational wave (GW) observations. In this paper, we investigate the detectability of spin-2 ULDM by space-based GW interferometers. By considering a direct coupling between spin-2 ULDM and ordinary matter, we derive the corresponding response functions and sensitivity curves for various time-delay interferometry channels and calculate the optimal sensitivity curves for future millihertz GW detectors. Our results demonstrate that the space-based detectors can place stringent constraints on the coupling constant of spin-2 ULDM, reaching $\alpha \sim 10^{-10}$ around a mass of $m \sim 10^{-17} \rm eV$, surpassing current limits from ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. Thus, the space-based GW detectors can serve as powerful tools not only for detecting GWs but also for probing fundamental properties of ultralight dark matter.</description>

      <title>Charged Scalar Field at Future Null Infinity via Nonlinear Hyperboloidal Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes and power-law late-time decay tails of a charged scalar field in a charged black hole background have been studied, but never in the fully non-linear regime, as far as we know. In this paper, we study the dependence of these properties on the charges of scalar field and black hole. For the quasinormal modes, a fit of the spherical fundamental mode is shown for the purely uncharged case and compared to the charged one. We also see for the first time the transition from gravitational decay to pure electromagnetic decay, and show disagreement with the oscillation frequency between real and imaginary parts of the scalar field prescribed in the literature. Full non-linear evolutions of hyperboloidal slices in spherical symmetry were used to obtain our results, allowing for the extraction of signals at future null infinity.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Kerr black hole: Tsallis-Cirto composition law and entropy quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00748v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The processes of splitting and merging of black holes obey the composition law generated by the Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. The same composition law expresses the full entropy of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole via the entropies of its outer and inner horizons. He we apply this composition law to the entropy of the Kerr black hole. As distinct from Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, where the full entropy depends only on mass $M$ and does not depend on its charge $Q$, the entropy of Kerr black hole is the sum of contributions from its mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$, i.e. $S(M,J)=S(M,0) + 4\pi \sqrt{J(J+1)}$. Here $S(M,0)$ is the entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole. This demonstrates that when the Kerr black hole with $J\gg 1$ absorbs or emits a massless particle with spin $s_z=\pm 1/2$, its entropy changes by $|\Delta S| = 2\pi$. We also considered the quantization of entropy suggested by the toy model, in which the black hole thermodynamics is represented by the ensemble of the Planck-scale black holes -- Planckons. The Tsallis-Cirto composition law is also extended to the entropy of Kerr-Newman black hole.</description>

Abstract: We study scalar (not necessarily conformal) quantum fields on self-similar spacetimes. It is shown that in states respecting the self-similarity the expectation value of the stress tensor gives rise to a Lyapunov exponent $\omega_q = 2$, with a leading coefficient which is state-independent and geometric. Three examples for states respecting self-similarity are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study wormhole geometries embedded in an expanding universe within a four-scalar non-linear $\sigma$ model, where the target-space metric is identified with the spacetime Ricci tensor. In this framework, wormholes can remain stable even when conventional energy conditions are violated. However, once cosmological expansion is included, the effective energy density and pressure are modified by the cosmological fluid, enabling the energy conditions to be satisfied. We further present intriguing geometries in which a finite future singularity appears in our universe but not in another universe connected by the wormhole. Near the throat, the hypersurface becomes timelike, allowing trajectories to traverse to the other universe before the singularity and return afterwards. We also construct wormhole solutions motivated by galactic dark-matter halo profiles, where the required non-vanishing pressure arises naturally from the four-scalar non-linear $\sigma$ model.</description>

Abstract: The two-parameter inhomogeneous and time-dependent Pimentel solution of Brans-Dicke theory is analyzed to probe and extend the new thermal view in which General Relativity is the zero-temperature (equilibrium) state of scalar-tensor gravity. As the parameters vary, we uncover phenomenology not found before with other exact solutions, nor contemplated thus far in the general theory. In the process, we also discuss the anomalous limit to General Relativity of the Pimentel geometry and show how the Mars solution of the Einstein equations is its Einstein frame version, elucidating the relation between these geometries.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic models in LQC with GBP polymerisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polymer models are effective in describing quantum gravity effects around the initial singularity, leading to its replacement by bouncing surfaces on which the curvature and densities are finite. Their properties depend on the space-time symmetry and on the particular polymerisation scheme adopted. In this article we investigate anisotropic models under the Gambini-Ben\'itez-Pullin polymerisation, recently used to quantise spherically symmetric black-holes, whose interiors are isometric to Kantowski-Sachs (KS) space-times. Demanding that the minimum area defined by the bouncing surface matches the Loop Quantum Gravity area gap, we can find its radius alongside the curvature and effective density and pressures at the bounce. The density is always positive, while the pressures are negative enough to avoid the singularity. Due to the positive spatial curvature, the solution is oscillatory, reaching a maximum radius where a re-collapse occurs. Therefore, a positive cosmological constant is included in order to have an eternal expansion to a late de Sitter phase. We have also considered a Bianchi III metric, showing that the bounce is still present, but the space-time is asymptotically flat in this case, with no re-collapse. In this hyperbolic space, the minimal area constraint can also be imposed on compact $2$-surfaces. Nevertheless, in contrast to the KS case, it is enough for avoiding the singularity, independently of polymerisation procedures.</description>

      <title>Applying the Gibbons-Werner method to bound orbits of massive particles in stationary spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gibbons-Werner (GW) method provides a geometric framework for calculating the deflection angle of particles in curved spacetimes, and numerous extensions based on the original version have been developed in recent years to expand its applicability. Most existing studies, however, are restricted to unbound orbits. The finite-distance deflection angle, which assumes both the source and observer to be located at finite distances, motivates us to investigate the bending of bound orbits. In this work, we broaden the GW method to bound orbits of massive particles in stationary axisymmetric (SAS) spacetimes, following our previous extension in static spherically symmetric (SSS) backgrounds [Huang et al., Phys. Rev. D 107, 104046 (2023)]. By employing our generalized GW method for SAS spacetimes [Huang et al., J. Cosmol. Astropart. Phys. 01(2024)013], (a) We obtain a formula for the deflection angle of bound massive particles in SAS spacetimes by dividing bound orbits that azimuthally overlap with themselves into multiple non-overlapping segments. This division enables the application of the GW method -- originally developed for unbound orbits -- to each segment in a consistent manner. (b) We overcome the limitation associated with the loss of positive definiteness of the Jacobi-Maupertuis Randers-Finsler (JMRF) metric, which occurs because bound massive particles have energies below unity. To show the practical implementation of our approach, we carry out the calculation in Kerr spacetime and obtain the deflection angle between two arbitrary points along the bound orbit of massive particles.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger Symmetry in Spherically-symmetric Static Mini-superspaces with Matter Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger symmetry emerged in a ``fluid limit" from a full superspace to several mini-superspace models. We consider two spherically-symmetric static mini-superspace models with matter fields and verify the robustness of this emergent symmetry at the classical level: (i) Maxwell field with cosmological constant and (ii) $n$ massless scalar fields. We develop a method based on canonical transformations and show that: for model (i), 3D Schr\"odinger symmetry emerges, and the solution is the (anti-) de Sitter Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, and for model (ii), $(2+n)$D Schr\"odinger symmetry appears, and the solution is a generalized Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime and its ``interior", a Kantowski-Sachs type closed universe. In the matter decoupling limit, both cases lead to 2D Schr\"odinger symmetry in different lapse functions and mini-superspace coordinates, which implies the covariance of Schr\"odinger symmetry. Finally, we propose a physical interpretation of the symmetry under Hamiltonian constraints $H$ and explain it with examples: Symmetry generators commuting with $H$ map a solution to another one, while those non-commuting with $H$ generate a new theory with the Schr\"odinger symmetry and the transformed configuration is a solution to the new theory. These support the robustness of the emergence of Schr\"odinger symmetry and open new possibilities for exploring quantum dynamics of matter and gravity based on the symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We prove a new area theorem in general relativity showing that, after a Gao-Jafferis-Wall deformation is switched off, the area of a wormhole throat cross-section cannot increase under infalling matter obeying the null energy condition. As a consequence, the minimal throat area sets a sharp upper bound on information transfer. Using the max-flow/min-cut formulation of bit threads, we show that the number of independent quantum degrees of freedom that can be transmitted through a semiclassical traversable wormhole is bounded by the throat area. We further illustrate the bound with a holographic tensor-network toy model built from two glued HaPPY codes.</description>

Abstract: We present a fully analytical method for calculating the key parameters of a Kerr-like gravitational shadow, including its horizontal and vertical diameters, $D_X$ and $D_Y$, the coordinates of its center $X_{C}$, the average radius $\bar{R}$, the deviation from sphericity $\delta C$, and the mean deviation from the Kerr shadow $\delta K$. Developed within the framework of perturbation theory, this approach yields all characteristic parameters as simple polynomial expressions with an accuracy of $\sim a^5$, where $a$ is the Kerr spin parameter. This eliminates the need for repeated numerical integration of cumbersome parametric equations. Furthermore, our derived formulas account for the effects of a plasma medium - a feature of particular relevance given the prospect of multi-frequency astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Motions of spinning particles and chaos bound in Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous research showed that the chaos bound proposed in \cite{MSS} can be violated under specific conditions within the scalar fields surrounding black holes. In this paper, we explore motions of spinning particles orbiting a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and examine whether this bound is violated in the spinor field of this black hole. For the neutral particle, when its spin magnitude surpasses a specific threshold, the value of the exponent exceeds the surface gravity, resulting in a violation of the bound. Given a fixed total angular momentum of the particle, when its spin direction is anti-aligned with the angular momentum direction, the exponent value is greater than that when the two directions are aligned. For the charged particle, taking into account the influence of the electromagnetic force, we find that for relatively large angular momenta, although the electromagnetic force does not change the trend of the exponent's variation with respect to spin and angular momentum, and only modifies its values, it still leads to the violation. Therefore, the chaos bound violations are observed in the spinor field.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates the optical properties of a static, spherically symmetric, electrically charged black hole in f(R) gravity coupled to Euler-Heisenberg(EH) nonlinear electrodynamics(NLED). By analyzing photon trajectories in this background spacetime, we show how the model parameters affect light propagation, leading to wider ranges of lensed trajectories and photon rings. We identify regions of parameter space that admit physically consistent black hole shadows, characterized by the existence of a photon sphere located outside the event horizon and a shadow formed beyond it. These viable regions expand with increasing electric charge and increasing fR0, illustrating the interplay between gravitational and electromagnetic effects. By constraining the model using Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87*, we find that de Sitter black hole solutions remain compatible with the observational data, whereas anti-de Sitter solutions are disfavored for low electric charge and fR0 &gt; -1. Finally, an analysis of the energy emission rate shows that higher electric charge enhances black hole evaporation, while stronger nonlinear electrodynamics effects and larger values of fR0 suppress it.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified quantum field theory of dark energy and inflation: unstable de Sitter vacuum and running vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inflation is a necessary cosmic mechanism to cure basic inconsistencies of the standard model of cosmology. These problems are usually `fixed' by postulating the existence of a scalar field (called the ``inflaton''). However, other less ad hoc options are possible. In the running vacuum model (RVM) framework, the vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate $H$ and its time derivatives: $\rho_{\rm vac}=\rho_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},\dots)$. In this context, the VED is dynamical (there is no rigid cosmological constant $\Lambda$). In the FLRW epoch, $\rho_{\rm vac}$ evolves very slowly with expansion, as befits the observed $\Lambda\simeq$const. behavior. In contrast, in the very early universe the vacuum fluctuations induce higher powers $H^N$ capable of unleashing fast inflation in a short period in which $H\simeq$ const. We call this mechanism `RVM-inflation'. It does not require an inflaton field since inflation is brought about by pure quantum field theory (QFT) effects on the dynamical background. It is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant. In this work, we study a closely related scenario: the decay of the exact de Sitter vacuum into FLRW spacetime in its radiation epoch and the subsequent impact on the current universe, and compare with the RVM. We find that in both cases inflation is driven by $H^4$ powers together with subleading contributions of order $H^2$ that ease a graceful-exit transition into the radiation-dominated epoch, where the FLRW regime starts and ultimately develops a mildly evolving VED in the late universe: $\delta\rho_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(m_{\rm Pl} ^2 H^2)$. The net outcome is an unified QFT approach to inflation and dark energy (conceived as dynamical vacuum energy) with potentially measurable phenomenological consequences in the present universe which can help cure the cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Signatures of Nonstandard Neutrino Properties in Collapsing Stellar Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel multi-messenger approach for probing nonstandard neutrino properties through the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from collapsing stellar cores and associated supernova explosions. We show that neutrino flavor conversion inside the proto-neutron star (PNS), motivated by physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), can significantly boost PNS convection. This effect leads to large-amplitude GW emission over a wide frequency range during an otherwise relatively quiescent GW phase shortly after core bounce. Such a signal provides a promising new avenue for exploring nonstandard neutrino phenomena and other BSM physics impacting PNS convection.</description>

      <title>Encrypted Qubits can be Cloned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that encrypted cloning of unknown quantum states is possible. Any number of encrypted clones of a qubit can be created through a unitary transformation, and each of the encrypted clones can be decrypted through a unitary transformation. The decryption of an encrypted clone consumes the decryption key, i.e., only one decryption is possible, in agreement with the no-cloning theorem. Encrypted cloning represents a new paradigm that provides a form of redundancy, parallelism or scalability where direct duplication is forbidden by the no-cloning theorem. For example, a possible application of encrypted cloning is to enable encrypted quantum multi-cloud storage.</description>

      <title>Formation of Asymmetrical Two-Brane Structure and its Possible Manifestation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the class of extra-dimensional models with two branes and show that each field of the Standard Model must be localized on both neighboring branes, whose asymmetry is of great importance. The discussion is conducted in the framework of a previously developed model. Here we show that the Higgs vacuum average is brane-dependent. As the result, fermion masses on the two branes are also different. The second brane (brane-2) lacks observers, eliminating the need for fine-tuning; consequently the particle masses remains of the order of the initial energy scale of the universe formation. Such superheavy charged leptons may serve as a small component of dark matter. Additionally, we show that inter-brane interactions mediated by photons enable massive fermions in brane-2 to act as sources of ultra-high-energy particles. The gauge fields are uniformly distributed in the bulk, ensuring charge universality.</description>

      <title>Isometries of spacetimes without observer horizons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the isometry groups of (non-compact) Lorentzian manifolds with well-behaved causal structure, aka causal spacetimes satisfying the ``no observer horizons'' condition. Our main result is that the group of time orientation-preserving isometries acts properly on the spacetime. As corollaries, we obtain the existence of an invariant Cauchy temporal function, and a splitting of the isometry group into a compact subgroup and a subgroup roughly corresponding to time translations. The latter can only be the trivial group, $\mathbb{Z}$, or $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>JT de Sitter Gravity as a Model of Coleman-de Luccia Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We interpret the Euclidean solution of JT de Sitter gravity as the Coleman-de Luccia instanton for the decay of the low-entropy horizon of its static patch solution into either a Big Crunch or an infinite-entropy Lorentzian de Sitter cosmology. As in previous work by one of the authors, the Big Crunch is interpreted as bounding the entropy of the static state. The principle of detailed balance then guarantees it will transition back to a higher entropy causal diamond in the expanding cosmology. We then construct a family of explicit quantum mechanical models and appropriate metastable states, with transition probabilities well approximated by the semi-classical calculations in JT de Sitter gravity.</description>

      <title>Topology of the Superconducting Heart of Neutron Stars: Effects of Microphysics and Gravitational-Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general-relativistic study of the distribution of proton superconductivity in strongly magnetized neutron stars (NSs), using the XNS code to solve the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations. We investigate equilibrium configurations with both toroidal and poloidal magnetic field geometries and incorporate complex many-body effects through microscopically derived proton pairing gaps. The models employ equations of state (EoS) obtained from microscopic many-body theory - including realistic two- and three-body nuclear interactions - as well as from relativistic mean-field approaches. We compare superconducting topologies across our collection of EoS and explore the influences of magnetic field geometry in stellar models parameterized by central density. Our models confirm the absence of $S$-wave superconductivity in the inner core and, importantly, reveal that non-superconducting regions exhibit complex three-dimensional geometries: doughnut-shaped for toroidal fields and prolate-shaped for poloidal fields -- spatial structures that are inherently absent in one-dimensional analyses. We also compute magnetic deformations and ellipticities for several millisecond pulsars (MSPs), estimating their continuous gravitational wave strain. While these MSPs remain undetectable by current detectors, next-generation instruments such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer may detect their signals, opening an observational window into internal superconductivity and internal magnetic field of NSs, as well as the fundamental microphysics of dense matter.</description>

      <title>Detection of Earth's free oscillations utilizing TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The measurement of Earth's free oscillations plays an important role in studying the Earth's large-scale structure. Space technology development presents a potential method to observe these normal modes by measuring inter-satellite distances. However, the disturbance from the Earth's low-degree gravity field makes it challenging for low Earth orbit gravity measurement satellites such as Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and TianQin-2 to extract signals from Earth's free oscillations directly. Here, we propose that by taking advantage of the high Earth orbit, the TianQin satellites can effectively avoid this disturbance, enabling direct measurement of Earth's free oscillations. We derive an analytical waveform to describe the response of Earth's free oscillations in TianQin. Based on this waveform, we use Bayesian analysis to extract the normal modes from numerical simulation data and perform parameter estimation. Our findings reveal that for a magnitude 7.9, Wenchuan-like earthquake, the resulting free oscillations will generate a signal that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 73 in TianQin, and approximately 9 different modes can be distinguished. This result shows TianQin can open a new window to examine the Earth's free oscillations and study the Earth's interior and earthquakes independently from ground-based gravity measurement.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb Z_2$-Stable Dark Matter via Broken $\text{SU}(5)$ Gauge Bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19462v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I construct and analyze a dark matter sector that is neutral under the unbroken Standard Model gauge group and couples only to the broken $\text{SU}(5)$ gauge directions, the leptoquark vectors $X,Y$. An exact $\mathbb Z_2$ renders the dark matter stable. I give a gauge-covariant definition of projectors onto the unbroken Standard Model and broken ($X,Y$) subspaces, demonstrate that the covariant derivative of dark matter selects only $X,Y$, and integrate out $X,Y$ at tree level to obtain the leading effective operators. I also derive the loop-induced $\chi^2\,G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu}$ coupling to gluons, prove color neutrality, and show consistency with cold dark matter phenomenology. Cosmological production proceeds via UV freeze-in or even more suppressed channels in.</description>

      <title>Abundance of cosmic voids in EFT of dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic voids in the large-scale structure are among the useful probes for testing gravity on cosmological scales. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of voids in the Horndeski theory using the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy. Modeling the void formation with the dynamics of spherical mass shells, we study how modifications of gravity encoded into the EFT of dark energy change the linearly extrapolated critical density contrast that is relevant for the criterion for void formation, with particular focus on the time-dependent parameter characterizing the effect of kinetic braiding. It is found that the change in the critical density contrast is one order of magnitude smaller than the dimensionless EFT parameter because of a slight imbalance between two compensating effects. We then compute the void abundance using the Sheth--van de Weygaert void size function and demonstrate that it exhibits scale-dependent modifications. It is shown that the modifications to the void size function on small scales are almost entirely determined by the modified linear matter power spectrum, while the modifications on large scales are dominated by the contributions from the linear matter spectrum and the critical density contrast.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the crossing symmetry of the ensemble of large-$c$ 2D CFTs defined through 3D gravity. A central observation is that statistical moments of OPE coefficients are not independent; rather, lower and higher moments are strongly correlated. Using Virasoro TQFT, we clarify how these correlations arise and how they guarantee consistency across OPE channels. Our analysis introduces the new notion of pseudo-hyperbolic manifolds, which are a certain class of non-hyperbolic manifolds whose partition functions are nevertheless related to those of hyperbolic ones. These manifolds serve as bridges that help manifest the crossing symmetry of the CFT ensemble.</description>

      <title>Correlators are simpler than wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recent works have revealed a simplicity in equal-time correlators that is absent in their wavefunction counterparts. In this letter, we show that this arises from the simple fact that the correlator is obtained by integrating Feynman propagators over the full spacetime, as opposed to the half-space for the wavefunction. Several striking new properties of correlators for any graph are made obvious from this picture. Certain patterns of poles that appear in the wavefunction do not appear in the correlator. The correlator also enjoys several remarkable factorization properties in various limits. Most strikingly, the correlator admits a systematic Laurent expansion in the neighborhood of every pole, with the first subleading term vanishing for every pole. There is an especially simple understanding of the expansion around the total energy pole up to second order, given by a differential operator acting on the amplitude. Finally, we show how these results extend beyond single graphs to the full correlator in Tr $\phi^3$ theory.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Interactions in Celestial CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Loop corrections in QED and gravity have recently been conjectured to give rise to an infinite tower of logarithmic soft theorems governing the universal low-energy behavior of photons and gravitons. We explore the implications of this tower for celestial CFT and for the algebra of conformally soft operators. The symmetry-governed part of the tower of logarithmic soft factors is shown to exponentiate, which demonstrates that these loop effects do not represent independent multi-particle interactions, but instead are rooted in the long-range exchange of gauge bosons between pairs of hard operator insertions. We define conformally soft loop operators, and compute their operator product expansions on the celestial sphere. The associated Ward identities exhibit characteristic non-local behaviors, which reflect the pair-wise interactions between hard operator insertions mediated by gauge bosons. We comment on the implications of these results for the soft operator algebra at loop order.</description>

      <title>A Non-Renormalization Theorem for Local Functionals in Ghost-Free Vector Field Theories Coupled to Dynamical Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a non-renormalization theorem for a class of ghost-free local functionals describing massive vector field theories coupled to dynamical geometry. Under the assumptions of locality, Lorentz invariance, and validity of the effective field theory expansion below a fixed cutoff, we show that quantum corrections do not generate local operators that renormalize the classical derivative self-interactions responsible for the constraint structure of the theory. The proof combines an operator-level analysis of the space of allowed local counterterms with a systematic decoupling-limit argument, which isolates the leading contributions to the effective action at each order in the derivative expansion. As a consequence, all radiatively induced local functionals necessarily involve additional derivatives per field and are suppressed by the intrinsic strong-coupling scales of the theory. In particular, the classical interactions defining ghost-free vector field theories are stable under renormalization, and any additional degrees of freedom arising from quantum corrections appear only above the effective field theory cutoff. This result extends known non-renormalization properties of flat-space vector theories to the case of dynamical geometry and provides a structural explanation for their perturbative stability to all loop orders.</description>

      <title>Upper limits on microhertz gravitational waves from supermassive black-hole binaries using PSR J1909-3744 data from the second IPTA data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for gravitational waves (GWs) from individual sources using high-cadence observations of PSR J1909\(-\)3744 obtained during an intensive observing campaign with the International Pulsar Timing Array second data release (IPTA-DR2) between July 2010 and November 2012. The observations, conducted at three different radio frequencies with the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope (NRT) and Parkes Telescope (PKS) and five frequencies with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), enabled precise corrections for dispersion measure effects and scattering variations. After these corrections, the timing residuals showed an unmodeled periodic noise component with an amplitude of 340 ns. Our analysis yields upper limits on the GW strain from individual sources, constraining it to be below \(1.9 \times 10^{-14}\) at 71 nHz and \(2.3 \times 10^{-13}\) at 1 \textmu Hz for average sky locations, while for optimal source locations the limits improve to \(6.2 \times 10^{-15}\) and \(8.9 \times 10^{-14}\) at the same frequencies, respectively. Our new limits are about a factor of 1.52 more stringent than those of Perera et al. based on an earlier EPTA data.</description>
