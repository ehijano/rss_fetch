      <title>Markov chains, CAT(0) cube complexes, and enumeration: monotone paths in a strip mix slowly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that two natural Markov chains on the set of monotone paths in a strip mix slowly. To do so, we make novel use of the theory of non-positively curved (CAT(0)) cubical complexes to detect small bottlenecks in many graphs of combinatorial interest. Along the way, we give a formula for the number c_m(n) of monotone paths of length n in a strip of height m. In particular we compute the exponential growth constant of c_m(n) for arbitrary m, generalizing results of Williams for m=2, 3.</description>

      <title>$E_A$-cordial labeling of graphs and its implications for $A$-antimagic labeling of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $A$ is a finite Abelian group, then a labeling $f \colon E (G) \rightarrow A$ of the edges of some graph $G$ induces a vertex labeling on $G$; the vertex $u$ receives the label $\sum_{v\in N(u)}f (v)$, where $N(u)$ is an open neighborhood of the vertex $u$. A graph $G$ is $E_A$-cordial if there is an edge-labeling such that (1) the edge label classes differ in size by at most one and (2) the induced vertex label classes differ in size by at most one. Such a labeling is called $E_A$-cordial. In the literature, so far only $E_A$-cordial labeling in cyclic groups has been studied.
  The corresponding problem was studied by Kaplan, Lev and Roditty. Namely, they introduced $A^*$-antimagic labeling as a generalization of antimagic labeling \cite{ref_KapLevRod}. Simply saying, for a tree of order $|A|$ the $A^*$-antimagic labeling is such $E_A$-cordial labeling that the label $0$ is prohibited on the edges.
  In this paper, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for paths to be $E_A$-cordial for any cyclic $A$. We also show that the conjecture for $A^*$-antimagic labeling of trees posted in \cite{ref_KapLevRod} is not true.</description>

      <title>Positive co-degree thresholds for spanning structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \textit{minimum positive co-degree} of a non-empty $r$-graph $H$, denoted $\delta_{r-1}^+(H)$, is the largest integer $k$ such that if a set $S \subset V(H)$ of size $r-1$ is contained in at least one $r$-edge of $H$, then $S$ is contained in at least $k$ $r$-edges of $H$. Motivated by several recent papers which study minimum positive co-degree as a reasonable notion of minimum degree in $r$-graphs, we consider bounds of $\delta_{r-1}^+(H)$ which will guarantee the existence of various spanning subgraphs in $H$. We precisely determine the minimum positive co-degree threshold for Berge Hamiltonian cycles in $r$-graphs, and asymptotically determine the minimum positive co-degree threshold for loose Hamiltonian cycles in $3$-graphs. For all $r$, we also determine up to an additive constant the minimum positive co-degree threshold for perfect matchings.</description>

      <title>Invariants of Bipartite Kneser B type-\MakeLowercase{k} graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{B}_n = \{ \pm x_1, \pm x_2, \pm x_3, \cdots, \pm x_{n-1}, x_n \}$ where $n&gt;1$ is fixed, $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^+$, $i = 1, 2, 3, \cdots, n$ and $x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; x_3 &lt; \cdots &lt; x_n$. Let $\phi(\mathscr{B}_n)$ be the set of all non-empty subsets $S = \{u_1, u_2,\cdots, u_t\}$ of $\mathscr{B}_n$ such that $|u_1|&lt;|u_2|&lt;\cdots &lt;|u_{t-1}|&lt;u_t $ where $u_t\in \mathbb{R}^+$. Let $\mathscr{B}_n^+ = \{ x_1, x_2, x_3, \cdots, x_{n-1}, x_n \}$. For a fixed $k$, let $V_1$ be the set of $k$-element subsets of $\mathscr{B}_n^+$, $1 \leq k &lt;n$. $V_2= \phi(\mathscr{B}_n)-V_1$. For any $A \in V_2$, let $A^\dagger = \{\lvert x \rvert: x \in A\}$. Define a bipartite graph with parts $V_1$ and $V_2$ and having adjacency as $X \in V_1$ is adjacent to $Y\in V_2$ if and only if $X \subset Y^\dagger$ or $Y^\dagger \subset X$. A graph of this type is called a bipartite Kneser B type-$k$ graph and denoted by $H_B(n,k)$. In this paper, we calculated various graph invariants of $H_B(n,k)$.</description>

      <title>Trees and near-linear stable sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When $H$ is a forest, the Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture implies that every graph $G$ with no induced subgraph isomorphic to $H$ and with bounded clique number has a stable set of linear size. We cannot prove that, but we prove that every such graph $G$ has a stable set of size $|G|^{1-o(1)}$. If $H$ is not a forest, there need not be such a stable set.
  Second, we prove that when $H$ is a ``multibroom'', there {\em is} a stable set of linear size. As a consequence, we deduce that all multibrooms satisfy a ``fractional colouring'' version of the Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture.
  Finally, we discuss extensions of our results to the multicolour setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every complete graph $K_t$, all graphs $G$ with no induced subgraph isomorphic to a subdivision of $K_t$ have a stable subset of size at least $|G|/{\rm polylog}|G|$. This is close to best possible, because for $t\ge 6$, not all such graphs $G$ have a stable set of linear size, even if $G$ is triangle-free.</description>

      <title>A degenerate version of Brion's formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{p} \subset V$ be a polytope and $\xi \in V_{\mathbb{C}}^*$. We obtain an expression for $I(\mathfrak{p}; \alpha) := \int_{\mathfrak{p}} e^{\langle \alpha, x \rangle} dx$ as a sum of meromorphic functions in $\alpha \in V^*_{\mathbb{C}}$ parametrized by the faces $\mathfrak{f}$ of $\mathfrak{p}$ on which $\langle \xi, x \rangle$ is constant. Each term only depends on the local geometry of $\mathfrak{p}$ near $\mathfrak{f}$ (and on $\xi$) and is holomorphic at $\alpha = \xi$. When $\langle \xi, \cdot \rangle$ is only constant on the vertices of $\mathfrak{p}$ our formula reduces to Brion's formula.
  Suppose $\mathfrak{p}$ is a rational polytope with respect to a lattice $\Lambda$. We obtain an expression for $S(\mathfrak{p}; \alpha) := \sum_{\lambda \in \mathfrak{p} \cap \Lambda} e^{\langle \alpha, \lambda \rangle}$ as a sum of meromorphic functions parametrized by the faces $\mathfrak{f}$ on which $e^{\langle \xi, x \rangle} = 1$ on a finite index sublattice of $\text{lin}(\mathfrak{f}) \cap \Lambda$. Each term only depends on the local geometry of $\mathfrak{p}$ near $\mathfrak{f}$ (and on $\xi$ and $\Lambda$) and is holomorphic at $\alpha = \xi$. When $e^{\langle \xi, \cdot \rangle} \neq 1$ at any non-zero lattice point on a line through the origin parallel to an edge of $\mathfrak{p}$, our formula reduces to Brion's formula, and when $\xi = 0$, it reduces to the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial.
  Our formulas are particularly useful for understanding how $I(\mathfrak{p}(h); \xi)$ and $S(\mathfrak{p}(h); \xi)$ vary in a family of polytopes $\mathfrak{p}(h)$ with the same normal fan. When considering dilates of a fixed polytope, our formulas may be viewed as polytopal analogues of Laplace's method and the method of stationary phase. Such expressions naturally show up in analysis on symmetric spaces and affine buildings.</description>

      <title>A Riordan array family for some integrable lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of Riordan arrays whose square symmetrizations lead to the Robbins numbers as well as numbers associated to the $20$ vertex model. We provide closed-form expressions for the elements of these arrays, and also give a canonical Catalan factorization for them. We describe a related family of Riordan arrays whose symmetrizations also lead to the same integer sequences.</description>

      <title>Counting Flows of $b$-compatible Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kochol introduced the assigning polynomial $F(G,\alpha;k)$ to count nowhere-zero $(A,b)$-flows of a graph $G$, where $A$ is a finite Abelian group and $\alpha$ is a $\{0,1\}$-assigning from a family $\Lambda(G)$ of certain nonempty vertex subsets of $G$ to $\{0,1\}$. We introduce the concepts of $b$-compatible graph and $b$-compatible broken bond to give an explicit formula for the assigning polynomials and to examine their coefficients. More specifically, for a function $b:V(G)\to A$, let $\alpha_{G,b}$ be a $\{0,1\}$-assigning of $G$ such that for each $X\in\Lambda(G)$, $\alpha_{G,b}(X)=0$ if and only if $\sum_{v\in X}b(v)=0$. We show that for any $\{0,1\}$-assigning $\alpha$ of $G$, if there exists a function $b:V(G)\to A$ such that $G$ is $b$-compatible and $\alpha=\alpha_{G,b}$, then the assigning polynomial $F(G,\alpha;k)$ has the $b$-compatible spanning subgraph expansion \[ F(G,\alpha;k)=\sum_{\substack{S\subseteq E(G),\\G-S\mbox{ is $b$-compatible}}}(-1)^{|S|}k^{m(G-S)}, \] and is the following form $F(G,\alpha;k)=\sum_{i=0}^{m(G)}(-1)^ia_i(G,\alpha)k^{m(G)-i}$, where each $a_i(G,\alpha)$ is the number of subsets $S$ of $E(G)$ having $i$ edges such that $G-S$ is $b$-compatible and $S$ contains no $b$-compatible broken bonds with respect to a total order on $E(G)$. Applying the counting interpretation, we also obtain unified comparison relations for the signless coefficients of assigning polynomials. Namely, for any $\{0,1\}$-assignings $\alpha,\alpha'$ of $G$, if there exist functions $b:V(G)\to A$ and $b':V(G)\to A'$ such that $G$ is both $b$-compatible and $b'$-compatible, $\alpha=\alpha_{G,b}$, $\alpha'=\alpha_{G,b'}$ and $\alpha(X)\le\alpha'(X)$ for all $X\in\Lambda(G)$, then \[ a_i(G,\alpha)\le a_i(G,\alpha') \quad \mbox{ for }\quad i=0,1,\ldots, m(G). \]</description>

      <title>Bounds on distinct and repeated dot product trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study questions inspired by Erd\H os' celebrated distance problems with dot products in lieu of distances, and for more than a single pair of points. In particular, we study point configurations present in large finite point sets in the plane that are described by weighted trees. We give new lower bounds on the number of distinct sets of dot products serving as weights for a given type of tree in any large finite point set. We also as demonstrate the existence of many repetitions of some special sets of dot products occurring in a given type of tree in different constructions, narrowing gap between the best known upper and lower bounds on these configurations.</description>

      <title>On point and block primitive designs invariant under permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method for constructing point primitive block transitive $t$-designs invariant under finite groups. Furthermore, we demonstrate that every point and block primitive $G$-invariant design can be generated using this method.
  Additionally, we establish the theoretical possibility of identifying all block transitive $G$-invariant designs. However, in practice, the feasibility of enumerating all designs for larger groups may be limited by the computational complexity involved.</description>

Abstract: Let G be an acyclic digraph, and let a, b, c, d be vertices, where a, b are sources, c, d are sinks, and every other vertex has in-degree and out-degree at least two. In 1985, Thomassen showed that there do not exist disjoint directed paths from a to c and from b to d, if and only if G can be drawn in a closed disc with a, b, c, d drawn in the boundary in order. We give a shorter proof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present five different formulas for both discrete and fractional iterations of an invertible power series $f$ utilizing a novel and unifying approach from umbral calculus. Established formulas are extended, and their proofs simplified, while new formulas are introduced. In particular, through the use of $q$-calculus identities, we eliminate the requirement for $f'(0)$ to equal $1$ and, consequently, the corresponding new expressions for the iterative logarithm are derived.</description>

      <title>Constructing cospectral graphs via regular rational orthogonal matrix with level two and three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two graphs $G$ and $H$ are \emph{cospectral} if the adjacency matrices share the same spectrum. Constructing cospectral non-isomorphic graphs has been studied extensively for many years and various constructions are known in the literature, e.g. the famous GM-switching method. In this paper, we shall construct cospectral graphs via regular rational orthogonal matrix $Q$ with level two and three. We provide two straightforward algorithms to characterize with adjacency matrix $A$ of graph $G$ such that $Q^TAQ$ is again a (0,1)-matrix, and introduce two new switching methods to construct families of cospectral graphs which generalized the GM-switching to some extent.</description>

      <title>Generalized Tur\'an problem for a path and a clique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a family of graphs. The generalized Tur\'an number $ex(n, K_r, \mathcal{H})$ is the maximum number of copies of the clique $K_r$ in any $n$-vertex $\mathcal{H}$-free graph. In this paper, we determine the value of $ex(n, K_r, \{P_k, K_m \} )$ for sufficiently large $n$ with an exceptional case, and characterize all corresponding extremal graphs, which generalizes and strengthens the results of Katona and Xiao [EJC, 2024] on $ex(n, K_2, \{P_k, K_m \} )$. For the exceptional case, we obtain a tight upper bound for $ex(n, K_r, \{P_k, K_m \} )$ that confirms a conjecture on $ex(n, K_2, \{P_k, K_m \} )$ posed by Katona and Xiao.</description>

      <title>A construction for regular-graph designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A regular-graph design is a block design for which a pair $\{a,b\}$ of distinct points occurs in $\lambda+1$ or $\lambda$ blocks depending on whether $\{a,b\}$ is or is not an edge of a given $\delta$-regular graph. Our paper describes a specific construction for regular-graph designs with $\lambda = 1$ and block size $\delta + 1$. We show that for $\delta \in \{2,3\}$, certain necessary conditions for the existence of such a design with $n$ points are sufficient, with two exceptions in each case and two possible exceptions when $\delta = 3$. We also construct designs of orders 105 and 117 for connected 4-regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Perfect coalition in graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \noindent A perfect dominating set in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a subset $S \subseteq V$ such that each vertex in $V \setminus S$ has exactly one neighbor in $S$. A perfect coalition in $G$ consists of two disjoint sets of vertices $V_i$ and $V_j$ such that i) neither $V_i$ nor $V_j$ is a dominating set, ii) each vertex in $V(G) \setminus V_i$ has at most one neighbor in $V_i$ and each vertex in $V(G) \setminus V_j$ has at most one neighbor in $V_j$, and iii) $V_i \cup V_j$ is a perfect dominating set. A perfect coalition partition (abbreviated $prc$-partition) in a graph $G$ is a vertex partition $\pi= \lbrace V_1,V_2,\dots ,V_k \rbrace$ such that for each set $V_i$ of $\pi$ either $V_i$ is a singleton dominating set, or there exists a set $V_j \in \pi$ that forms a perfect coalition with $V_i$. In this paper, we initiate the study of perfect coalition partitions in graphs. We obtain a bound on the number of perfect coalitions involving each member of a perfect coalition partition, in terms of maximum degree. The perfect coalition of some special graphs are investigated. The graph $G$ with $\delta(G)=1$, the triangle-free graphs $G$ with prefect coalition number of order of $G$ and the trees $T$ with prefect coalition number in $\{n,n-1,n-2\}$ where $n=|V(T)|$ are characterized.</description>

      <title>Backbone coloring for graphs with degree 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\lambda$-backbone coloring of the graph $G$ with backbone $H$ is a graph-coloring problem in which we are given a graph $G$ and a subgraph $H$, and we want to assign colors to vertices in such a way that the endpoints of every edge from $G$ have different colors, and the endpoints of every edge from $H$ are assigned colors which differ by at least $\lambda$.
  In this paper we pursue research on backbone coloring of bounded-degree graphs with well-known classes of backbones. Our result is an almost complete classification of problems in the form $BBC_{\lambda}(G, H) \le \lambda + k$ for graphs with maximum degree $4$ and backbones from the following classes: paths, trees, matchings, and galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the maximum size of a nonhamiltonian-connected graph with prescribed order and minimum degree. We also characterize the extremal graphs that attain this maximum size. This work generalizes a previous result obtained by Ore [ J. Math. Pures Appl. 42 (1963) 21-27] and further extends a theorem proved by Ho, Lin, Tan, Hsu, and Hsu [Appl. Math. Lett. 23 (2010) 26-29]. As a corollary of our main result, we determine the maximum size of a $k$-connected nonhamiltonian-connected graph with a given order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1960, Nash-Williams proved his strong orientation theorem that every finite graph has an orientation in which the number of directed paths between any two vertices is at least half the number of undirected paths between them (rounded down). Nash-Williams conjectured that it is possible to find such orientations for infinite graphs as well. We provide a partial answer by proving that all rayless graphs have such an orientation.</description>

      <title>Critical Thresholds for Maximum Cardinality Matching on General Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant work has been done on computing the ``average'' optimal solution value for various $\mathsf{NP}$-complete problems using the Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model to establish \emph{critical thresholds}. Critical thresholds define narrow bounds for the optimal solution of a problem instance such that the probability that the solution value lies outside these bounds vanishes as the instance size approaches infinity. In this paper, we extend the Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model to general hypergraphs on $n$ vertices and $M$ hyperedges. We consider the problem of determining critical thresholds for the largest cardinality matching, and we show that for $M=o(1.155^n)$ the size of the maximum cardinality matching is almost surely 1. On the other hand, if $M=\Theta(2^n)$ then the size of the maximum cardinality matching is $\Omega(n^{\frac12-\gamma})$ for an arbitrary $\gamma &gt;0$. Lastly, we address the gap where $\Omega(1.155^n)=M=o(2^n)$ empirically through computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Almost Commutative Terwilliger Algebras of Group Association Schemes I: Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terwilliger algebras are a subalgebra of a matrix algebra that are constructed from association schemes over finite sets. In 2010, Rie Tanaka defined what it means for a Terwilliger algebra to be almost commutative. In that paper she gave five equivalent conditions for a Terwilliger algebra to be almost commutative. In this paper, we provide a classification of which groups result in an almost commutative Terwilliger algebra when looking at the group association scheme (the Schur ring generated by the conjugacy classes of the group). In particular, we show that all such groups are either abelian, or Camina groups. Following this classification, we then compute the dimension and non-primary primitive idempotents for each Terwilliger algebra of this form for the first three types of groups whose group association scheme gives an almost commutative Terwilliger algebra. The final case will be considered in a second paper.</description>

Abstract: This paper is a continuation of Almost Commutative Terwilliger Algebras of Group Association Schemes I: Classification [1]. In that paper, we found all groups G for which the Terwilliger algebra of the group association scheme, denoted T (G), is almost commutative. We also found the primitive idempotents for T (G) for three of the four types of such groups. In this paper, we determine the primitive idempotents for the fourth type.</description>

      <title>Artin Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct an algebraic invariant attached to Galois representations over number fields. This invariant, which we call an Artin symmetric function, lives in a certain ring we introduce called the ring of arithmetic symmetric functions. This ring is built from a family of symmetric functions rings indexed by prime ideals of the base field. We prove many necessary basic results for the ring of arithmetic symmetric functions as well as introduce the analogues of some standard number-theoretic objects in this setting. We prove that the Artin symmetric functions satisfy the same algebraic properties that the Artin L-functions do with respect to induction, inflation, and direct summation of representations. The expansion coefficients of these symmetric functions in different natural bases are shown to be character values of representations of a compact group related to the original Galois group. In the most interesting case, the expansion coefficients into a specialized Hall-Littlewood basis come from new representations built from the original Galois representation using polynomial functors corresponding to modified Hall-Littlewood polynomials. Using a special case of the Satake isomorphism in type GL, as formulated by Macdonald, we show that the Artin symmetric functions yield families of functions in the (finite) global spherical Hecke algebras in type GL which exhibit natural stability properties. We compute the Mellin transforms of these functions and relate them to infinite products of shifted Artin L-functions. We then prove some analytic properties of these Dirichlet series and give an explicit expansion of these series using the Hall-Littlewood polynomial functors.</description>

      <title>Efficient approximation schemes for scheduling on a stochastic number of machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study three two-stage optimization problems with a similar structure and different objectives. In the first stage of each problem, the goal is to assign input jobs of positive sizes to unsplittable bags. After this assignment is decided, the realization of the number of identical machines that will be available is revealed. Then, in the second stage, the bags are assigned to machines. The probability vector of the number of machines in the second stage is known to the algorithm as part of the input before making the decisions of the first stage. Thus, the vector of machine completion times is a random variable. The goal of the first problem is to minimize the expected value of the makespan of the second stage schedule, while the goal of the second problem is to maximize the expected value of the minimum completion time of the machines in the second stage solution. The goal of the third problem is to minimize the \ell_p norm for a fixed p&gt;1, where the norm is applied on machines' completion times vectors. Each one of the first two problems admits a PTAS as Buchem et al. showed recently. Here we significantly improve all their results by designing an EPTAS for each one of these problems. We also design an EPTAS for \ell_p norm minimization for any p&gt;1.</description>

      <title>Polynomial functions on a class of finite non-commutative rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a finite non-commutative ring with $1\ne 0$. By a polynomial function on $R$, we mean a function $F\colon R\longrightarrow R$ induced by a polynomial $f=\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}a_ix^i\in R[x]$ via right substitution of the variable $x$, i.e.
  $F(a)=f(a)= \sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}a_ia^i$ for every $a\in R$. In this paper, we study the polynomial functions of the free $R$-algebra with a central basis $\{1,\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_k\}$ ($k\ge 1$) such that $\beta_i\beta_j=0$ for every $1\le i,j\le k$, $R[\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_k]$. %, the ring of dual numbers over $R$ in $k$ variables.
  Our investigation revolves around assigning a polynomial $\lambda_f(y,z)$ over $R$ in non-commutative variables $y$ and $z$ to each polynomial $f$ in $R[x]$; and describing the polynomial functions on $R[\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_k]$ through the polynomial functions induced on $R$ by polynomials in $R[x]$ and by their assigned polynomials in the in non-commutative variables $y$ and $z$. %and analyzing the resulting polynomial functions on $R[\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_k]$.
  By extending results from the commutative case to the non-commutative scenario, we demonstrate that several properties and theorems in the commutative case can be generalized to the non-commutative setting with appropriate adjustments.</description>

      <title>The central limit theorem for entries of random matrices with specific rank over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be the finite field of order $q$, and $\mathcal{A}$ a non-empty proper subset of $\mathbb{F}_q$. Let $\mathbf{M}$ be a random $m \times n$ matrix of rank $r$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ taken with uniform distribution. It was proved recently by Sanna that as $m,n \to \infty$ and $r,q,\mathcal{A}$ are fixed, the number of entries of $\mathbf{M}$ in $\mathcal{A}$ approaches a normal distribution. The question was raised as to whether or not one can still obtain a central limit theorem of some sort when $r$ goes to infinity in a way controlled by $m$ and $n$. In this paper we answer this question affirmatively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a transitive permutation group on $\Omega$. The $G$-invariant partitions form a sublattice of the lattice of all partitions of $\Omega$, having the further property that all its elements are uniform (that is, have all parts of the same size). If, in addition, all the equivalence relations defining the partitions commute, then the relations form an \emph{orthogonal block structure}, a concept from statistics; in this case the lattice is modular. If it is distributive, then we have a \emph{poset block structure}, whose automorphism group is a \emph{generalised wreath product}. We examine permutation groups with these properties, which we call the \emph{OB property} and \emph{PB property} respectively, and in particular investigate when direct and wreath products of groups with these properties also have these properties.
  A famous theorem on permutation groups asserts that a transitive imprimitive group $G$ is embeddable in the wreath product of two factors obtained from the group (the group induced on a block by its setwise stabiliser, and the group induced on the set of blocks by~$G$). We extend this theorem to groups with the PB property, embeddng them into generalised wreath products. We show that the map from posets to generalised wreath products preserves intersections and inclusions.
  We have included background and historical material on these concepts.</description>

      <title>The Ramsey number for 4-uniform tight cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $k$-uniform tight cycle is a $k$-graph with a cyclic ordering of its vertices such that its edges are precisely the sets of $k$ consecutive vertices in that ordering. A $k$-uniform tight path is a $k$-graph obtained by deleting a vertex from a $k$-uniform tight cycle. We prove that the Ramsey number for the $4$-uniform tight cycle on $4n$ vertices is $(5 +o(1))n$. This is asymptotically tight. This result also implies that the Ramsey number for the $4$-uniform tight path on $n$ vertices is $(5/4 + o(1))n$.</description>

      <title>Set partitions, tableaux, and subspace profiles under regular diagonal matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.00479v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a family of univariate polynomials indexed by integer partitions. At prime powers, they count the number of subspaces in a finite vector space that transform under a regular diagonal matrix in a specified manner. This enumeration formula is a combinatorial solution to a problem introduced by Bender, Coley, Robbins and Rumsey. At $1$, they count set partitions with specified block sizes. At $0$, they count standard tableaux of specified shape. At $-1$, they count standard shifted tableaux of a specified shape. These polynomials are generated by a new statistic on set partitions (called the interlacing number) as well as a polynomial statistic on standard tableaux. They allow us to express $q$-Stirling numbers of the second kind as sums over standard tableaux and as sums over set partitions.
  For partitions whose parts are at most two, these polynomials are the non-zero entries of the Catalan triangle associated to the $q$-Hermite orthogonal polynomial sequence. In particular, when all parts are equal to two, they coincide with the polynomials defined by Touchard that enumerate chord diagrams by the number of crossings.</description>

      <title>Hive-type polytopes for quiver multiplicities and the membership problem for quiver moment cones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Q$ be a bipartite quiver with vertex set $Q_0$ such that the number of arrows between any source vertex and any sink vertex is constant. Let $\beta=(\beta(x))_{x \in Q_0}$ be a dimension vector of $Q$ with positive integer coordinates.
  Let $rep(Q, \beta)$ be the representation space of $\beta$-dimensional representations of $Q$ and $GL(\beta)$ the base change group acting on $rep(Q, \beta)$ be simultaneous conjugation. Let $K^{\beta}_{\underline{\lambda}}$ be the multiplicity of the irreducible representation of $GL(\beta)$ of highest weight $\underline{\lambda}$ in the ring of polynomial functions on $rep(Q, \beta)$.
  We show that $K^{\beta}_{\underline{\lambda}}$ can be expressed as the number of lattice points of a polytope obtained by gluing together two Knutson-Tao hive polytopes. Furthermore, this polytopal description together with Derksen-Weyman's Saturation Theorem for quiver semi-invariants allows us to use Tardos' algorithm to solve the membership problem for the moment cone associated to $(Q,\beta)$ in strongly polynomial time.</description>

      <title>The minimum number of maximal independent sets in twin-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of determining the maximum number of maximal independent sets in certain graph classes dates back to a paper of Miller and Muller and a question of Erd\H{o}s and Moser from the 1960s. The minimum was always considered to be less interesting due to simple examples such as stars. In this paper we show that the problem becomes interesting when restricted to twin-free graphs, where no two vertices have the same open neighbourhood. We consider the question for arbitrary graphs, bipartite graphs and trees. The minimum number of maximal independent sets turns out to be logarithmic in the number of vertices for arbitrary graphs, linear for bipartite graphs and exponential for trees. In the latter case, the minimum and the extremal graphs have been determined earlier by Taletski\u{\i} and Malyshev, but we present a shorter proof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a remarkable fact that for many statistics on finite sets of combinatorial objects, the roots of the corresponding generating function are each either a complex root of unity or zero. These and related polynomials have been studied for many years by a variety of authors from the fields of combinatorics, representation theory, probability, number theory, and commutative algebra. We call such polynomials \textbf{cyclotomic generating functions} (CGFs). With Konvalinka, we have studied the support and asymptotic distribution of the coefficients of several families of CGFs arising from tableau and forest combinatorics. In this paper, we survey general CGFs from algebraic, analytic, and asymptotic perspectives. We review some of the many known examples of CGFs in combinatorial representation theory; describe their coefficients, moments, cumulants, and characteristic functions; and give a variety of necessary and sufficient conditions for their existence arising from probability, commutative algebra, and invariant theory. As a sample result, we show that CGFs are ``generically'' asymptotically normal, generalizing a result of Diaconis on $q$-binomial coefficients using work of Hwang--Zacharovas. We include several open problems concerning CGFs.</description>

Abstract: The lattice of noncrossing partitions is well-known for its wide variety of combinatorial appearances and properties. For example, the lattice is rank-symmetric and enumerated by the Catalan numbers. In this article, we introduce a large family of new noncrossing partition lattices with both of these properties, each parametrized by a configuration of n points in the plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00850v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe minimal string attractors (of size two) of pseudopalindromic prefixes of standard complementary-symmetric Rote sequences. Such a class of Rote sequences forms a subclass of binary generalized pseudostandard sequences, i.e., of sequences obtained when iterating palindromic and antipalindromic closures. When iterating only palindromic closure, palindromic prefixes of standard Sturmian sequences are obtained and their string attractors are of size two. However, already when iterating only antipalindromic closure, antipalindromic prefixes of binary pseudostandard sequences are obtained and we prove that the minimal string attractors are of size three in this case. We conjecture that the pseudopalindromic prefixes of any binary generalized pseudostandard sequence have a minimal string attractor of size at most four.</description>

      <title>Cost-sharing in Parking Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12265v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the total displacement statistic of parking functions from the perspective of cooperative game theory. We introduce parking games, which are coalitional cost-sharing games in characteristic function form derived from the total displacement statistic. We show that parking games are supermodular cost-sharing games, indicating that cooperation is difficult (i.e., their core is empty). Next, we study their Shapley value, which formalizes a notion of "fair" cost-sharing and amounts to charging each car for its expected marginal displacement under a random arrival order. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the Shapley value of parking games, in contrast with known hardness results on computing the Shapley value of arbitrary games. The algorithm leverages the permutation-invariance of total displacement, combinatorial enumeration, and dynamic programming. We conclude with open questions around an alternative solution concept for supermodular cost-sharing games and connections to other areas in combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Flexible list coloring of graphs with maximum average degree less than $3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the flexible list coloring problem, we consider a graph $G$ and a color list assignment $L$ on $G$, as well as a subset $U \subseteq V(G)$ for which each $u \in U$ has a preferred color $p(u) \in L(u)$. Our goal is to find a proper $L$-coloring $\phi$ of $G$ such that $\phi(u) = p(u)$ for at least $\epsilon|U|$ vertices $u \in U$. We say that $G$ is $\epsilon$-flexibly $k$-choosable if for every $k$-size list assignment $L$ on $G$ and every subset of vertices with coloring preferences, $G$ has a proper $L$-coloring that satisfies an $\epsilon$ proportion of these coloring preferences. Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Norin, and Postle [Journal of Graph Theory, 2019] asked whether every $d$-degenerate graph is $\epsilon$-flexibly $(d+1)$-choosable for some constant $\epsilon = \epsilon(d) &gt; 0$.
  In this paper, we prove that there exists a constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$ such that every graph with maximum average degree less than $3$ is $\epsilon$-flexibly $3$-choosable, which gives a large class of $2$-degenerate graphs which are $\epsilon$-flexibly $(d+1)$-choosable. In particular, our results imply a theorem of Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Masa\v{r}\'ik, Mus\'ilek, and Pangr\'ac [Journal of Graph Theory, 2020] stating that every planar graph of girth $6$ is $\epsilon$-flexibly $3$-choosable for some constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$. To prove our result, we generalize the existing reducible subgraph framework traditionally used for flexible list coloring to allow reducible subgraphs of arbitrarily large order.</description>

      <title>Interval and $\ell$-interval Rational Parking Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14055v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interval parking functions are a generalization of parking functions in which cars have an interval preference for their parking. We generalize this definition to parking functions with $n$ cars and $m\geq n$ parking spots, which we call interval rational parking functions and provide a formula for their enumeration. By specifying an integer parameter $\ell\geq 0$, we then consider the subset of interval rational parking functions in which each car parks at most $\ell$ spots away from their initial preference. We call these $\ell$-interval rational parking functions and provide recursive formulas to enumerate this set for all positive integers $m\geq n$ and $\ell$. We also establish formulas for the number of nondecreasing $\ell$-interval rational parking functions via the outcome map on rational parking functions. We also consider the intersection between $\ell$-interval parking functions and Fubini rankings and show the enumeration of these sets is given by generalized Fibonacci numbers. We conclude by specializing $\ell=1$, and establish that the set of $1$-interval rational parking functions with $n$ cars and $m$ spots are in bijection with the set of barred preferential arrangements of $[n]$ with $m-n$ bars. This readily implies enumerative formulas. Further, in the case where $\ell=1$, we recover the results of Hadaway and Harris that unit interval parking functions are in bijection with the set of Fubini rankings, which are enumerated by the Fubini numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00333v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the literature, lines of the projective space $\mathrm{PG}(3,q)$ are partitioned into classes, each of which is a union of line orbits under the stabilizer group of the twisted cubic. The least studied class is named $\mathcal{O}_6$. This class contains lines external to the twisted cubic which are not its chords or axes and do not lie in any of its osculating planes. For even and odd $q$, we propose a new family of orbits of $\mathcal{O}_6$ and investigate in detail their stabilizer groups and the corresponding submatrices of the point-line and plane-line incidence matrices. To obtain these submatrices, we explored the number of solutions of cubic and quartic equations connected with intersections of lines (including the tangents to the twisted cubic), points, and planes in $\mathrm{PG}(3,q)$.</description>

      <title>An algorithm for estimating the crossing number of dense graphs, and continuous analogs of the crossing and rectilinear crossing numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a deterministic $n^{2+o(1)}$-time algorithm that approximates the crossing number of any graph $G$ of order $n$ up to an additive error of $o(n^4)$. We also provide a randomized polynomial time algorithm that constructs a drawing of $G$ with $\text{cr}(G)+o(n^4)$ crossings. These results imply a $1+o(1)$ approximation algorithm for the crossing number of dense graphs. Our work builds on a technique used Fox, Pach and S\'uk~\cite{approximatingrect}, who obtained similar results for the rectilinear crossing number.
  The results in~\cite{approximatingrect} and in this paper imply that the (normalized) crossing and rectilinear crossing numbers are estimable parameters. Motivated by this, we introduce two graphon parameters, the \textit{crossing density} and the \textit{rectilinear crossing density}, and then we prove that, in a precise sense, these are the correct continuous analogs of the crossing and rectilinear crossing numbers of graphs.</description>

Abstract: We propose a combinatorial formula for the coproduct in a Hopf algebra of decorated multi-indices that recently appeared in the literature, which can be briefly described as the graded dual of the enveloping algebra of the free Novikov algebra generated by the set of decorations. Similarly to what happens for the Hopf algebra of rooted forests, the formula can be written in terms of admissible cuts. We also prove a combinatorial formula for the extraction-contraction coproduct for undecorated multi-indices, in terms of a suitable notion of covering subforest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliability assessment of interconnection networks is critical to the design and maintenance of multiprocessor systems. The $(n, k)$-enhanced hypercube $Q_{n,k}$, as a variation of the hypercube $Q_{n}$, was proposed by Tzeng and Wei in 1991. As an extension of traditional edge-connectivity, $h$-extra edge-connectivity of a connected graph $G,$ $\lambda_h(G),$ is an essential parameter for evaluating the reliability of interconnection networks. This article intends to study the $h$-extra edge-connectivity of the $(n,2)$-enhanced hypercube $Q_{n,2}$. Supposing that the link malfunction of an interconnection network $Q_{n,2}$ does not isolate any subnetwork with no more than $h-1$ processors, the minimum number of these possible faulty links concentrate on a constant $2^{n-1}$ for each integer $\lceil\frac{11\times2^{n-1}}{48}\rceil \leq h \leq 2^{n-1}$ and $n\geq 9$. That is, for about $77.083$ percent values of $h\leq2^{n-1},$ the corresponding $h$-extra edge-connectivity of $Q_{n,2}$, $\lambda_h(Q_{n,2})$, presents a concentration phenomenon. Moreover, the above lower and upper bounds of $h$ are both tight.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between invariance conjectures for parabolic Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the combinatorial invariance conjecture for parabolic Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, formulated by Mario Marietti, is equivalent to its restriction to maximal quotients. This equivalence lies at the other extreme in respect to the equivalence, recently proved by Barkley and Gaetz, with the invariance conjecture for Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, which turns out to be equivalent to the conjecture for maximal quotients.</description>

Abstract: We construct an infinite family of triples (G,S1, S2) each consisting of a group G and a pair (S1, S2) of distinct subsets of G with the following properties. i The two Cayley graphs Cay(G, S1) and Cay(G,S2) are non-isomorphic. ii The distributions of the simple random walks on Cay(G,S1) and Cay(G,S2) are the same if one takes an appropriate correspondence between the two vertex sets at each step. iii The spectral set of Cay(G, Si) is decomposed into a disjoint union of two subsets A and B_i of the equal size which satisfies B1 = -B2.</description>

      <title>On sets with missing differences in compact abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A much-studied problem posed by Motzkin asks to determine, given a finite set $D$ of integers, the so-called Motzkin density of $D$, i.e., the supremum of upper densities of sets of integers whose difference set avoids $D$. We study the natural analogue of this problem in compact abelian groups. Using ergodic-theoretic tools, this is shown to be equivalent to the following discrete problem: given a lattice $\Lambda\subset \mathbb{Z}^r$, letting $D$ be the image in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$ of the standard basis, determine the Motzkin density of $D$ in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$. We study in particular the periodicity question: is there a periodic $D$-avoiding set of maximal density in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$? The Greenfeld--Tao counterexample to the periodic tiling conjecture implies that the answer can be negative. On the other hand, we prove that the answer is positive in several cases, including the case rank$(\Lambda)=1$ (in which we give a formula for the Motzkin density), the case rank$(\Lambda)=r-1$, and hence also the case $r\leq 3$. It follows that, for up to three missing differences, the Motzkin density in a compact abelian group is always a rational number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analogously to de Bruijn sequences, orientable sequences have application in automatic position-location applications and, until recently, studies of these sequences focused on the binary case. In recent work by Alhakim et al., a range of methods of construction were described for orientable sequences over arbitrary finite alphabets; some of these methods involve using negative orientable sequences as a building block. In this paper we describe three techniques for generating such negative orientable sequences, as well as upper bounds on their period. We then go on to show how these negative orientable sequences can be used to generate orientable sequences with period close to the maximum possible for every non-binary alphabet size and for every tuple length. In doing so we use two closely related approaches described by Alhakim et al.</description>

      <title>Injective colorings of Sierpi\'nski-like graphs and Kneser graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two relationships between the injective chromatic number and, respectively, chromatic number and chromatic index, are proved. They are applied to determine the injective chromatic number of Sierpi\'nski graphs and to give a short proof that Sierpi\'nski graphs are Class $1$. Sierpi\'nski-like graphs are also considered, including generalized Sierpi\'nski graphs over cycles and rooted products. It is proved that the injective chromatic number of a rooted product of two graphs lies in a set of six possible values. Sierpi\'nski graphs and Kneser graphs $K(n,r)$ are considered with respect of being perfect injectively colorable, where a graph is perfect injectively colorable if it has an injective coloring in which every color class forms an open packing of largest cardinality. In particular, all Sierpi\'nski graphs and Kneser graphs $K(n, r)$ with $n \ge 3r-1$ are perfect injectively colorable graph, while $K(7,3)$ is not.</description>

      <title>Enumerative and planar combinatorics of trivariate monomial resolutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.09963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The canonical sylvan resolution is a resolution of an arbitrary monomial ideal over a polynomial ring that is minimal and has an explicit combinatorial formula for the differential. The differential is a weighted sum over lattice paths of weights of chain-link fences, which are sequences of faces that are linked to each other via higher-dimensional analogues of spanning trees. Along a lattice path in the three-variable case, these weights can be condensed to a single weight contributing to the combinatorial formula for the differential that bypasses any computation of chain-link fences. The main results in this paper express the sylvan matrix entries for monomial ideals in three variables as a sum over lattice paths of simpler weights that depend only on the number of specific Koszul simplicial complexes that lie along the corresponding lattice path. Certain entries have numerators equal to the number of lattice paths in $\mathbb{N}^2$ that follow specific restrictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.02850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we characterize all distributional limits of the random quadratic form $T_n =\sum_{1\le u&lt; v\le n} a_{u, v} X_u X_v$, where $((a_{u, v}))_{1\le u,v\le n}$ is a $\{0, 1\}$-valued symmetric matrix with zeros on the diagonal and $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ are i.i.d.~ mean $0$ variance $1$ random variables with common distribution function $F$. In particular, we show that any distributional limit of $S_n:=T_n/\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}[T_n]}$ can be expressed as the sum of three independent components: a Gaussian, a (possibly) infinite weighted sum of independent centered chi-squares, and a Gaussian mixture with a random variance. As a consequence, we prove a fourth moment theorem for the asymptotic normality of $S_n$, which applies even when $F$ does not have finite fourth moment. More formally, we show that $S_n$ converges to $N(0, 1)$ if and only if the fourth moment of $S_n$ (appropriately truncated when $F$ does not have finite fourth moment) converges to 3 (the fourth moment of the standard normal distribution).</description>

      <title>Sharp inequalities for discrete and continuous multi-tiling, using the Bombieri-Siegel approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08606v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finite subset $F$ of integer points in $\mathbb Z^d$, it is of interest to seek conditions on $F$ that allow it to multi-tile $\mathbb Z^d$ by translations. To this end, we give a discretized version of the Bombieri-Siegel formula, which represents a finite sum of discrete covariograms in terms of Fourier transforms. As a consequence, we arrive at a new equivalent condition for multi-tiling $\mathbb Z^d$ by translating $F$ with a fixed integer sublattice.
  In the continuous case, we study lattice sums of the cross covariogram for any two bounded sets $A, B\subset \mathbb R^d$, and we prove a refined continuous version of the classical Bombieri-Siegel formula from the geometry of numbers. To achieve this goal, we use a variant of the Poisson Summation formula, adapted for continuous functions of compact support.
  As an application of this refined Bombieri-Siegel formula, a new characterization of multi-tilings of Euclidean space by translations of a compact set by using a lattice is given. One consequence is a novel spectral formula for the volume of any bounded measurable set. Another consequence is a novel spectral formula for the product of the volumes of any two bounded measurable sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00670v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $P_1, \ldots, P_m \in K[y]$ be polynomials with distinct degrees, no constant terms and coefficients in a general locally compact topological field $K$. We give a quantitative count of the number of polynomial progressions $x, x+P_1(y), \ldots, x + P_m(y)$ lying in a set $S\subseteq K$ of positive density. The proof relies on a general $L^{\infty}$ inverse theorem which is of independent interest. This inverse theorem implies a Sobolev improving estimate for multilinear polynomial averaging operators which in turn implies our quantitative estimate for polynomial progressions. This general Sobolev inequality has the potential to be applied in a number of problems in real, complex and $p$-adic analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15719v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every toric monoid appears in a space of maps from tropical curves to an orthant. It follows that spaces of logarithmic maps to Artin fans exhibit arbitrary toric singularities: a virtual universality theorem for logarithmic maps to pairs. The target rank depends on the chosen singularity: we show that the cone over the 7-gon never appears in a space of maps to a rank 1 target. We obtain similar results for tropical maps to affine space.</description>

      <title>A greedy heuristic for graph burning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the optimization version of the graph burning problem seeks for a sequence of vertices, $(u_1,u_2,...,u_p) \in V(G)^p$, with minimum $p$ and such that every $v \in V(G)$ has distance at most $p-i$ to some vertex $u_i$. The length $p$ of the optimal solution is known as the burning number and is denoted by $b(G)$, an invariant that helps quantify the graph's vulnerability to contagion. This paper explores the advantages and limitations of an $\mathcal{O}(mn + pn^2)$ deterministic greedy heuristic for this problem, where $n$ is the graph's order, $m$ is the graph's size, and $p$ is a guess on $b(G)$. This heuristic is based on the relationship between the graph burning problem and the clustered maximum coverage problem, and despite having limitations on paths and cycles, it found most of the optimal and best-known solutions of benchmark and synthetic graphs with up to 102400 vertices. Beyond practical advantages, our work unveils some of the fundamental aspects of graph burning: its relationship with a generalization of a classical coverage problem and compact integer programs. With this knowledge, better algorithms might be designed in the future.</description>

      <title>On the correctness of Maximum Parsimony for data with few substitutions in the NNI neighborhood of phylogenetic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01282v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating phylogenetic trees, which depict the relationships between different species, from aligned sequence data (such as DNA, RNA, or proteins) is one of the main aims of evolutionary biology. However, tree reconstruction criteria like maximum parsimony do not necessarily lead to unique trees and in some cases even fail to recognize the \enquote{correct} tree (i.e., the tree on which the data was generated). On the other hand, a recent study has shown that for an alignment containing precisely those binary characters (sites) which require up to two substitutions on a given tree, this tree will be the unique maximum parsimony tree.
  It is the aim of the present paper to generalize this recent result in the following sense: We show that for a tree $T$ with $n$ leaves, as long as $k&lt;\frac{n}{8}+\frac{11}{9}-\frac{1}{18}\sqrt{9\cdot \left(\frac{n}{4}\right)^2+16}$ (or, equivalently, $n&gt;9 k-11+\sqrt{9k^2-22 k+17} $, which in particular holds for all $n\geq 12k$), the maximum parsimony tree for the alignment containing all binary characters which require (up to or precisely) $k$ substitutions on $T$ will be unique in the NNI neighborhood of $T$ and it will coincide with $T$, too. In other words, within the NNI neighborhood of $T$, $T$ is the unique most parsimonious tree for the said alignment. This partially answers a recently published conjecture affirmatively. Additionally, we show that for $n\geq 8$ and for $k$ being in the order of $\frac{n}{2}$, there is always a pair of phylogenetic trees $T$ and $T'$ which are NNI neighbors, but for which the alignment of characters requiring precisely $k$ substitutions each on $T$ in total requires fewer substitutions on $T'$.</description>

      <title>Universal Plans: One Action Sequence to Solve Them All!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of a universal plan, which when executed, is guaranteed to solve all planning problems in a category, regardless of the obstacles, initial state, and goal set. Such plans are specified as a deterministic sequence of actions that are blindly applied without any sensor feedback. Thus, they can be considered as pure exploration in a reinforcement learning context, and we show that with basic memory requirements, they even yield optimal plans. Building upon results in number theory and theory of automata, we provide universal plans both for discrete and continuous (motion) planning and prove their (semi)completeness. The concepts are applied and illustrated through simulation studies, and several directions for future research are sketched.</description>

      <title>Toric degenerations and Newton-Okounkov bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent times, a wide variety of combinatorics has been introduced in order to solve problems from algebraic geometry. Newton-Okounkov bodies and tropical geometry are two such combinatorial theories. As shown by Kaveh and Manon, there is a certain correspondence between these two. Building on this correspondence, and exploiting the link of both theories to toric degenerations, Harada and Escobar obtained their wall-crossing result for prime cones. This result states that moving between two adjacent prime maximal cones in a tropical variety corresponds to a mutation between the associated Newton-Okounkov bodies of these cones. In this thesis, we provide a method for applying the wall-crossing result to non-prime cones. Our approach uses a procedure developed by Bossinger, Lamboglia, Mincheva and Mohammadi in order to compute an embedding which changes a tropical variety in such a way that a non-prime cone becomes prime. Assuming that adjacent cones stay adjacent, the wall-crossing result can then be applied in this new embedding. Building on computations by Clarke, Mohammadi and Zaffalon, we show that for Gr(3,6), this approach works. We compute the new embedding and its tropicalization in this case, and study the relation between cones in the new embedding and the original embedding.</description>
