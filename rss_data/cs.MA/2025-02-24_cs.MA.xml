      <title>Voter Model Meets Rumour Spreading: A Study of Consensus Protocols on Graphs with Agnostic Nodes [Extended Version]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Problems of consensus in multi-agent systems are often viewed as a series of independent, simultaneous local decisions made between a limited set of options, all aimed at reaching a global agreement. Key challenges in these protocols include estimating the likelihood of various outcomes and finding bounds for how long it may take to achieve consensus, if it occurs at all.
  To date, little attention has been given to the case where some agents have no initial opinion. In this paper, we introduce a variant of the consensus problem which includes what we call `agnostic' nodes and frame it as a combination of two known and well-studied processes: voter model and rumour spreading. We show (1) a martingale that describes the probability of consensus for a given colour, (2) bounds on the number of steps for the process to end using results from rumour spreading and voter models, (3) closed formulas for the probability of consensus in a few special cases, and (4) that the computational complexity of estimating the probability with a Markov chain Monte Carlo process is $O(n^2 \log n)$ for general graphs and $O(n\log n)$ for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, which makes it an efficient method for estimating probabilities of consensus. Furthermore, we present experimental results suggesting that the number of runs needed for a given standard error decreases when the number of nodes increases.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Architecture in Distributed Environment Control Systems: vision, challenges, and opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for energy-efficient solutions in large-scale infrastructure, particularly data centers, requires advanced control strategies to optimize environmental management systems. We propose a multi-agent architecture for distributed control of air-cooled chiller systems in data centers. Our vision employs autonomous agents to monitor and regulate local operational parameters and optimize system-wide efficiency. We demonstrate how this approach improves the responsiveness, operational robustness, and energy efficiency of the system, contributing to the broader goal of sustainable infrastructure management.</description>

      <title>Applicability of the Minimal Dominating Set for Influence Maximisation in Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimal dominating set (MDS) is a well-established concept in network controllability and has been successfully applied in various domains, including sensor placement, network resilience, and epidemic containment. In this study, we adapt the local-improvement MDS routine and explore its potential for enhancing seed selection for influence maximisation in multilayer networks (MLN). We employ the Linear Threshold Model (LTM), which offers an intuitive representation of influence spread or opinion dynamics by accounting for peer influence accumulation. To ensure interpretability, we utilise rank-refining seed selection methods, with the results further filtered with MDS. Our findings reveal that incorporating MDS into the seed selection process improves spread only within a specific range of situations. Notably, the improvement is observed for larger seed set budgets, lower activation thresholds, and when an "AND" strategy is used to aggregate influence across network layers. This scenario reflects situations where an individual does not require the majority of their acquaintances to hold a target opinion, but must be influenced across all social circles.</description>

      <title>PP-MARL: Efficient Privacy-Preserving Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Cooperative Intelligence in Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative intelligence (CI) is expected to become an integral element in next-generation networks because it can aggregate the capabilities and intelligence of multiple devices. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a popular approach for achieving CI in communication problems by enabling effective collaboration among agents to address sequential problems. However, ensuring privacy protection for MARL is a challenging task because of the presence of heterogeneous agents that learn interdependently via sharing information. Implementing privacy protection techniques such as data encryption and federated learning to MARL introduces the notable overheads (e.g., computation and bandwidth). To overcome these challenges, we propose PP-MARL, an efficient privacy-preserving learning scheme for MARL. PP-MARL leverages homomorphic encryption (HE) and differential privacy (DP) to protect privacy, while introducing split learning to decrease overheads via reducing the volume of shared messages, and then improve efficiency. We apply and evaluate PP-MARL in two communication-related use cases. Simulation results reveal that PP-MARL can achieve efficient and reliable collaboration with 1.1-6 times better privacy protection and lower overheads (e.g., 84-91% reduction in bandwidth) than state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Coordination across Diverse Applications: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent coordination studies the underlying mechanism enabling the trending spread of diverse multi-agent systems (MAS) and has received increasing attention, driven by the expansion of emerging applications and rapid AI advances. This survey outlines the current state of coordination research across applications through a unified understanding that answers four fundamental coordination questions: (1) what is coordination; (2) why coordination; (3) who to coordinate with; and (4) how to coordinate. Our purpose is to explore existing ideas and expertise in coordination and their connections across diverse applications, while identifying and highlighting emerging and promising research directions. First, general coordination problems that are essential to varied applications are identified and analyzed. Second, a number of MAS applications are surveyed, ranging from widely studied domains, e.g., search and rescue, warehouse automation and logistics, and transportation systems, to emerging fields including humanoid and anthropomorphic robots, satellite systems, and large language models (LLMs). Finally, open challenges about the scalability, heterogeneity, and learning mechanisms of MAS are analyzed and discussed. In particular, we identify the hybridization of hierarchical and decentralized coordination, human-MAS coordination, and LLM-based MAS as promising future directions.</description>
