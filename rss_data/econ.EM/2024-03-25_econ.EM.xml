      <title>Fast TTC Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a fast Markov Matrix-based methodology for computing Top Trading Cycles (TTC) that delivers O(1) computational speed, that is speed independent of the number of agents and objects in the system. The proposed methodology is well suited for complex large-dimensional problems like housing choice. The methodology retains all the properties of TTC, namely, Pareto-efficiency, individual rationality and strategy-proofness.</description>

      <title>Modelling with Discretized Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with econometric models in which the dependent variable, some explanatory variables, or both are observed as censored interval data. This discretization often happens due to confidentiality of sensitive variables like income. Models using these variables cannot point identify regression parameters as the conditional moments are unknown, which led the literature to use interval estimates. Here, we propose a discretization method through which the regression parameters can be point identified while preserving data confidentiality. We demonstrate the asymptotic properties of the OLS estimator for the parameters in multivariate linear regressions for cross-sectional data. The theoretical findings are supported by Monte Carlo experiments and illustrated with an application to the Australian gender wage gap.</description>

      <title>Tests for almost stochastic dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a 2-dimensional stochastic dominance (2DSD) index to characterize both strict and almost stochastic dominance. Based on this index, we derive an estimator for the minimum violation ratio (MVR), also known as the critical parameter, of the almost stochastic ordering condition between two variables. We determine the asymptotic properties of the empirical 2DSD index and MVR for the most frequently used stochastic orders. We also provide conditions under which the bootstrap estimators of these quantities are strongly consistent. As an application, we develop consistent bootstrap testing procedures for almost stochastic dominance. The performance of the tests is checked via simulations and the analysis of real data.</description>

      <title>Causal Models for Longitudinal and Panel Data: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This survey discusses the recent causal panel data literature. This recent literature has focused on credibly estimating causal effects of binary interventions in settings with longitudinal data, with an emphasis on practical advice for empirical researchers. It pays particular attention to heterogeneity in the causal effects, often in situations where few units are treated and with particular structures on the assignment pattern. The literature has extended earlier work on difference-in-differences or two-way-fixed-effect estimators. It has more generally incorporated factor models or interactive fixed effects. It has also developed novel methods using synthetic control approaches.</description>
