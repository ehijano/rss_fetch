      <description>arXiv:2406.16881v1 Announce Type: new

      <title>Category Theory: Symmetry Group of Comma-propagation Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general, all constructions of algebraic topology are functorial; the notions of category, functor and natural transformation originated here. The arrow categories are more simple forms of the \emph{comma} categories and were introduced by Lawvere in the context of the interdefinability of the universal concepts of category theory. The basic idea is the elevation of arrows of one category $\textbf{C}$ to objects in another. Given a category (as a "geometric object") $\textbf{C}$ we can consider its properties (the universal categorial commutative diagrams) preserved under actions of a comma-propagation operation $\{\}$ in the infinite hierarchy of its arrow-categories (n-dimensional levels, such that for any $n\geq 1$, $\textbf{C}_{n+1} = {\textbf{C}_n}$, with $\textbf{C}_1 =\textbf{C}$) and on the functors (and their natural transformations) between such n-dimensional levels, which is a phenomena of a general categorial symmetry under a categorial-symmetry group $CS(\mathbb{Z})$ of all comma-propagation transformations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Edge Hyper-Zagreb Index of Graphs: Applications and Predictions of Thermodynamic Properties for Organic Linear Acenes Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper discusses the edge hyper-Zagreb index of a graph, which is calculated by replacing vertex degrees with edge degrees. The degree of an edge is determined by adding up the degrees of the end vertices of the edge and subtracting 2. We examine the edge hyper-Zagreb index of the Cartesian product and join of graphs, and also calculate it for organic linear Acenes molecules with the formula (C4n+2H2n+4). We establish a correlation between topological indices based on the number of rings and predict thermodynamic properties of Acenes family, such as electron affinity, bond, heat of formation and gap energy, using the Topological Indices Method (T IM).</description>

      <title>Some Classes of series involving the Riemann zeta function, Fibonacci numbers and the Lucas numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this manuscript is to offer explicit expressions for diverse categories of infinite series incorporating the Fibonacci (Lucas) sequence and the Riemann zeta function. In demonstrating our findings, we will utilize conventional methodologies and integrate the Binet formulas pertinent to these sequences with generating functions that encompass the Riemann zeta function alongside established evaluations of certain series.</description>

      <title>A Primer on Chainmails: Structures for Point-free Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In point-free topology, one abstracts the poset of open subsets of a topological space, by replacing it with a frame (a complete lattice, where meet distributes over arbitrary join). In this paper we propose a similar abstraction of the posets of connected subsets in various space-like structures. The analogue of a frame is called a chainmail, which is defined as a poset admitting joins of its mails, i.e., subsets having a lower bound. The main result of the paper is an equivalence between a subcategory of the category of complete join-semilattices and the category of chainmails.</description>

      <title>Extended Equivalence of Fuzzy Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preferential equality is an equivalence relation on fuzzy subsets of finite sets and is a generalization of classical equality of subsets. In this paper we introduce a tightened version of the preferential equality on fuzzy subsets and derive some important combinatorial formulae for the number of such tight fuzzy subsets of an n-element set where n is a natural number. We also offer some asymptotic results</description>

      <title>A New Method For Solving Fractional And Classical Differential Equations Based On a New Generalized Fractional Power Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to introduce an algorithm for solving fractional and classical differential equations based on a new generalized fractional power series. The algorithm relies on expanding the solution of an FDE or an ODE as a generalized power series, shedding light on the choice of the exponent for the monomials. Furthermore, it accommodates situations where terms in the equation are multiplied by $t^{\alpha}$for example. The key contribution is how the exponents for these terms are chosen, which is different from traditional methods.</description>
