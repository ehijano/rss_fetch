      <title>Unstable algebraic K-theory: homological stability and other observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate stability properties of the reductive Borel-Serre categories; these were introduced as a model for unstable algebraic K-theory in previous work. We see that they exhibit better homological stability properties than the general linear groups. We also show that they provide an explicit model for Yuan's partial algebraic K-theory.</description>

      <title>An analogue of the Milnor conjecture for the de Rham-Witt complex in characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the modulo $2$ de Rham-Witt complex of a field of characteristic $2$, in terms of the powers of the augmentation ideal of the $\mathbb{Z}/2$-geometric fixed points of real topological restriction homology TRR. This is analogous to the conjecture of Milnor, proved by Kato for fields of characteristic $2$, which describes the modulo $2$ Milnor K-theory in terms of the powers of the augmentation ideal of the Witt group of symmetric forms. Our proof provides a somewhat explicit description of these objects, as well as a calculation of the homotopy groups of the geometric fixed points of TRR and of real topological cyclic homology, for all fields.</description>

      <title>Birational Equivalences and Generalized Weyl Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.14801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate suitably localized Hochschild homologies of various quantum groups and Podle\'s spheres after realizing them as generalized Weyl algebras (GWAs). We use the fact that every GWA is birationally equivalent to a smash product with a 1-torus. We also address and solve the birational equivalence problem and the birational smoothness problem for GWAs.</description>

      <title>Homological Lie brackets on moduli spaces and pushforward operations in twisted K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.10990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of pushforward operations for principal $G$-bundles equipped with a certain type of orientation.
  In the case $G=BU(1)$ and orientations in twisted K-theory we construct two pushforward operations, the projective Euler operation, whose existence was conjectured by Joyce, and the projective rank operation. We classify all stable pushforward operations in this context and show that they are all generated by the projective Euler and rank operation.
  As an application, we construct a graded Lie algebra structure on the homology of a commutative H-space with a compatible $BU(1)$-action and orientation. These play an important role in the context of wall-crossing formulas in enumerative geometry.</description>

      <title>A resolution theorem for extriangulated categories with applications to the index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10576v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quillen's Resolution Theorem in algebraic $K$-theory provides a powerful computational tool for calculating $K$-groups of exact categories. At the level of $K_0$, this result goes back to Grothendieck. In this article, we first establish an extriangulated version of Grothendieck's Resolution Theorem.
  Second, we use this Extriangulated Resolution Theorem to gain new insight into the index theory of triangulated categories. Indeed, we propose an index with respect to an extension-closed subcategory $\mathscr{N}$ of a triangulated category $\mathscr{C}$ and we prove an additivity formula with error term. Our index recovers the index with respect to a contravariantly finite, rigid subcategory $\mathscr{X}$ defined by J{\o}rgensen and the second author, as well as an isomorphism between $K_0^{\mathsf{sp}}(\mathscr{X})$ and the Grothendieck group of a relative extriangulated structure $\mathscr{C}_{R}^{\mathscr{X}}$ on $\mathscr{C}$ when $\mathscr{X}$ is $n$-cluster tilting. In addition, we generalize and enhance some results of Fedele. Our perspective allows us to remove certain restrictions and simplify some arguments.
  Third, as another application of our Extriangulated Resolution Theorem, we show that if $\mathscr{X}$ is $n$-cluster tilting in an abelian category, then the index introduced by Reid gives an isomorphism $K_0(\mathscr{C}_R^{\mathscr{X}}) \cong K_0^{\mathsf{sp}}(\mathscr{X})$.</description>
