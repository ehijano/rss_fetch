      <title>Transmitter Side Beyond-Diagonal RIS for mmWave Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work initiates the study of a beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS)-aided transmitter architecture for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band. Deploying BD-RIS at the transmitter side not only alleviates the need for extensive fully digital radio frequency (RF) chains but also enhances both communication and sensing performance. These benefits are facilitated by the additional design flexibility introduced by the fully-connected scattering matrix of BD-RIS. To achieve the aforementioned benefits, in this work, we propose an efficient two-stage algorithm to design the digital beamforming of the transmitter and the scattering matrix of the BD-RIS with the aim of jointly maximizing the sum rate for multiple communication users and minimizing the largest eigenvalue of the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) matrix for multiple sensing targets. Numerical results show that the transmitter-side BD-RIS-aided mmWave ISAC outperforms the conventional diagonal-RIS-aided ones in both communication and sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Meta Distribution of Passive Electromagnetic Field Exposure in Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the meta distribution of electromagnetic field exposure (EMFE) experienced by a passive user in a cellular network implementing dynamic beamforming. The meta distribution serves as a valuable tool for extracting fine-grained insights into statistics of individual passive user EMFE across the network. A comprehensive stochastic geometry framework is established for this analysis. Given the pivotal role of accurately modeling the main and side lobes of antennas in this context, a multi-cosine gain model is introduced. The meta distribution is closely approximated by a beta distribution derived from its first- and second-order moments, which is demonstrated to be mathematically tractable. The impact of the number of antennas in the ULA on the meta distribution is explored, shedding light on its sensitivity to this parameter.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Potential of Local CSI in Cell-Free Networks with Channel Aging and Fronthaul Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally believed that downlink cell-free networks perform best under centralized implementations where the local channel state information (CSI) acquired by the access-points (AP) is forwarded to one or more central processing units (CPU) for the computation of the joint precoders based on global CSI. However, mostly due to limited fronthaul capabilities, this procedure incurs some delay that may lead to partially outdated precoding decisions and hence performance degradation. In some scenarios, this may even lead to worse performance than distributed implementations where the precoders are locally computed by the APs based on partial yet timely local CSI. To address this issue, this study considers the problem of robust precoding design merging the benefits of timely local CSI and delayed global CSI. As main result, we provide a novel distributed precoding design based on the recently proposed team minimum mean-square error method. As a byproduct, we also obtain novel insights related to the AP-CPU functional split problem. Our main conclusion, corroborated by simulations, is that the opportunity of performing some local precoding computations at the APs should not be neglected, even in centralized implementations.</description>

      <title>Coding for Composite DNA to Correct Substitutions, Strand Losses, and Deletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composite DNA is a recent method to increase the base alphabet size in DNA-based data storage.This paper models synthesizing and sequencing of composite DNA and introduces coding techniques to correct substitutions, losses of entire strands, and symbol deletion errors. Non-asymptotic upper bounds on the size of codes with $t$ occurrences of these error types are derived. Explicit constructions are presented which can achieve the bounds.</description>

      <title>Limits on Inferring T-cell Specificity from Partial Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in molecular biology is to decipher the mapping of protein sequence to function. To perform this mapping requires the identification of sequence features most informative about function. Here, we quantify the amount of information (in bits) that T-cell receptor (TCR) sequence features provide about antigen specificity. We identify informative features by their degree of conservation among antigen-specific receptors relative to null expectations. We find that TCR specificity synergistically depends on the hypervariable regions of both receptor chains, with a degree of synergy that strongly depends on the ligand. Using a coincidence-based approach to measuring information enables us to directly bound the accuracy with which TCR specificity can be predicted from partial matches to reference sequences. We anticipate that our statistical framework will be of use for developing machine learning models for TCR specificity prediction and for optimizing TCRs for cell therapies. The proposed coincidence-based information measures might find further applications in bounding the performance of pairwise classifiers in other fields.</description>

      <title>A rate-distortion framework for MCMC algorithms: geometry and factorization of multivariate Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework rooted in a rate distortion problem for Markov chains, and show how a suite of commonly used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are specific instances within it, where the target stationary distribution is controlled by the distortion function. Our approach offers a unified variational view on the optimality of algorithms such as Metropolis-Hastings, Glauber dynamics, the swapping algorithm and Feynman-Kac path models. Along the way, we analyze factorizability and geometry of multivariate Markov chains. Specifically, we demonstrate that induced chains on factors of a product space can be regarded as information projections with respect to a particular divergence. This perspective yields Han--Shearer type inequalities for Markov chains as well as applications in the context of large deviations and mixing time comparison.</description>

      <title>Semantic Security with Unreliable Entanglement Assistance: Interception and Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic security is considered with unreliable entanglement assistance, due to one of two reasons: Interception or loss. We consider two corresponding models. In the first model, Eve may intercept the entanglement resource. In the second model, Eve is passive, and the resource may dissipate to the environment beyond her reach. We derive achievable rates for both models, subject to a maximal error criterion and semantic security. As an example, we consider the amplitude damping channel. Under interception, time division is not necessarily possible, and the boundary of our achievable region is disconnected. In the passive model, our rate region outperforms time division.</description>

      <title>UL-DL duality for cell-free massive MIMO with per-AP power and information constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06520v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a novel uplink-downlink duality principle for optimal joint precoding design under per-transmitter power and information constraints in fading channels. The information constraints model limited sharing of channel state information and data bearing signals across the transmitters. The main application is to cell-free networks, where each access point (AP) must typically satisfy an individual power constraint and form its transmit signal using limited cooperation capabilities. Our duality principle applies to ergodic achievable rates given by the popular hardening bound, and it can be interpreted as a nontrivial generalization of a previous result by Yu and Lan for deterministic channels. This generalization allows us to study involved information constraints going beyond the simple case of cluster-wise centralized precoding covered by previous techniques. Specifically, we show that the optimal joint precoders are, in general, given by an extension of the recently developed team minimum mean-square error method. As a particular yet practical example, we then solve the problem of optimal local precoding design in user-centric cell-free massive MIMO networks subject to per-AP power constraints.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Dense Cell-Free Massive MIMO for 6G: Technical Overview and Open Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-dense cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-MMIMO) has emerged as a promising technology expected to meet the future ubiquitous connectivity requirements and ever-growing data traffic demands in 6G. This article provides a contemporary overview of ultra-dense CF-MMIMO networks, and addresses important unresolved questions on their future deployment. We first present a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art research on CF-MMIMO and ultra-dense networks. Then, we discuss the key challenges of CF-MMIMO under ultra-dense scenarios such as low-complexity architecture and processing, low-complexity/scalable resource allocation, fronthaul limitation, massive access, synchronization, and channel acquisition. Finally, we answer key open questions, considering different design comparisons and discussing suitable methods dealing with the key challenges of ultra-dense CF-MMIMO. The discussion aims to provide a valuable roadmap for interesting future research directions in this area, facilitating the development of CF-MMIMO MIMO for 6G.</description>

      <title>New Partial Orders of Polar Codes for BMSC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we define partial orders (POs) of polar codes based on the Bhattacharyya parameter and the bit-error probability, respectively. These POs are applicable to arbitrary binary memoryless symmetric channel (BMSC). Leveraging the extremal inequalities of polarization transformation, we derive new POs for BMSC based on the corresponding POs observed in the Binary Erasure Channel (BEC). %Additionally, we discover more special POs in the Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). We provide examples that demonstrate the inability of existing POs to deduce these novel POs. Furthermore, we establish upper bounds for the expansion parameter $\beta$ if the polar codes constructed by $\beta$-expansion method obey these POs.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Smoothed Gradient Descent Ascent for Federated Minimax Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, federated minimax optimization has attracted growing interest due to its extensive applications in various machine learning tasks. While Smoothed Alternative Gradient Descent Ascent (Smoothed-AGDA) has proved its success in centralized nonconvex minimax optimization, how and whether smoothing technique could be helpful in federated setting remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm termed Federated Stochastic Smoothed Gradient Descent Ascent (FESS-GDA), which utilizes the smoothing technique for federated minimax optimization. We prove that FESS-GDA can be uniformly used to solve several classes of federated minimax problems and prove new or better analytical convergence results for these settings. We showcase the practical efficiency of FESS-GDA in practical federated learning tasks of training generative adversarial networks (GANs) and fair classification.</description>
