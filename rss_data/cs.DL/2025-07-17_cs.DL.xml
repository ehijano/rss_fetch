      <title>The Evolving Role of Large Language Models in Scientific Innovation: Evaluator, Collaborator, and Scientist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific innovation is undergoing a paradigm shift driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs). As science faces mounting challenges including information overload, disciplinary silos, and diminishing returns on conventional research methods, LLMs are emerging as powerful agents capable not only of enhancing scientific workflows but also of participating in and potentially leading the innovation process. Existing surveys mainly focus on different perspectives, phrases, and tasks in scientific research and discovery, while they have limitations in understanding the transformative potential and role differentiation of LLM. This survey proposes a comprehensive framework to categorize the evolving roles of LLMs in scientific innovation across three hierarchical levels: Evaluator, Collaborator, and Scientist. We distinguish between LLMs' contributions to structured scientific research processes and open-ended scientific discovery, thereby offering a unified taxonomy that clarifies capability boundaries, evaluation criteria, and human-AI interaction patterns at each level. Through an extensive analysis of current methodologies, benchmarks, systems, and evaluation metrics, this survey delivers an in-depth and systematic synthesis on LLM-driven scientific innovation. We present LLMs not only as tools for automating existing processes, but also as catalysts capable of reshaping the epistemological foundations of science itself. This survey offers conceptual clarity, practical guidance, and theoretical foundations for future research, while also highlighting open challenges and ethical considerations in the pursuit of increasingly autonomous AI-driven science.

      <title>Freshness, Persistence and Success of Scientific Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12255v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Team science dominates scientific knowledge production, but what makes academic teams successful? Using temporal data on 25.2 million publications and 31.8 million authors, we propose a novel network-driven approach to identify and study the success of persistent teams. Challenging the idea that persistence alone drives success, we find that team freshness - new collaborations built on prior experience - is key to success. High impact research tends to emerge early in a team's lifespan. Analyzing complex team overlap, we find that teams open to new collaborative ties consistently produce better science. Specifically, team re-combinations that introduce new freshness impulses sustain success, while persistence impulses from experienced teams are linked to earlier impact. Together, freshness and persistence shape team success across collaboration stages.</description>

      <title>A Multistakeholder Approach to Value-Driven Co-Design of Recommender System Evaluation Metrics in Digital Archives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first multistakeholder approach for translating diverse stakeholder values into an evaluation metric setup for Recommender Systems (RecSys) in digital archives. While commercial platforms mainly rely on engagement metrics, cultural heritage domains require frameworks that balance competing priorities among archivists, platform owners, researchers, and other stakeholders. To address this challenge, we conducted high-profile focus groups (5 groups x 5 persons) with upstream, provider, system, consumer, and downstream stakeholders, identifying value priorities across critical dimensions: visibility/representation, expertise adaptation, and transparency/trust. Our analysis shows that stakeholder concerns naturally align with four sequential research funnel stages: discovery, interaction, integration, and impact. The resulting evaluation setup addresses domain-specific challenges including collection representation imbalances, non-linear research patterns, and tensions between specialized expertise and broader accessibility. We propose directions for tailored metrics in each stage of this research journey, such as research path quality for discovery, contextual appropriateness for interaction, metadata-weighted relevance for integration, and cross-stakeholder value alignment for impact assessment. Our contributions extend beyond digital archives to the broader RecSys community, offering transferable evaluation approaches for domains where value emerges through sustained engagement rather than immediate consumption.</description>

      <title>Automated Novelty Evaluation of Academic Paper: A Collaborative Approach Integrating Human and Large Language Model Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novelty is a crucial criterion in the peer review process for evaluating academic papers. Traditionally, it's judged by experts or measure by unique reference combinations. Both methods have limitations: experts have limited knowledge, and the effectiveness of the combination method is uncertain. Moreover, it's unclear if unique citations truly measure novelty. The large language model (LLM) possesses a wealth of knowledge, while human experts possess judgment abilities that the LLM does not possess. Therefore, our research integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to address the limitations of novelty assessment. One of the most common types of novelty in academic papers is the introduction of new methods. In this paper, we propose leveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language models (PLMs, e.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers. Specifically, we extract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper from peer review reports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of the academic paper, which are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have designed a text-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better integrate human and LLM knowledge. We compared the method we proposed with a large number of baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance.</description>
