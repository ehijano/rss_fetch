      <title>Enhanced beam-beam modeling to include longitudinal variation during weak-strong simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam-beam interactions pose substantial challenges in the design and operation of circular colliders, significantly affecting their performance. In particular, the weak-strong simulation approach is pivotal for investigating single-particle dynamics during the collider design phase. This paper evaluates the limitations of existing models in weak-strong simulations, noting that while they accurately account for energy changes due to slingshot effects, they fail to incorporate longitudinal coordinate changes ($z$-variation). To address this gap, we introduce two novel transformations that enhance Hirata's original framework by including both $z$-variation and slingshot effect-induced energy changes. Through rigorous mathematical analysis and extensive weak-strong simulation studies, we validate the efficacy of these enhancements in achieving a more precise simulation of beam-beam interactions. Our results reveal that although $z$-variation constitutes a higher-order effect and does not substantially affect the emittance growth rate within the specific design parameters of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), the refined model offers improved accuracy, particularly in scenarios involving the interaction between beam-beam effects and other random diffusion processes, as well as in simulations incorporating realistic lattice models.</description>

      <title>Surface and sub-surface modifications of copper electrodes exposed to high-field conditioning at cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to investigate the dependence of conditioning and field-holding on temperature, three pairs of copper electrodes underwent high voltage conditioning with direct current (DC) pulses while kept at a single temperature, unique for each set (300~K, 30~K and 10~K), until saturation field for each set was found. The sets conditioned at cold showed a significant increase in the field holding capability, reaching fields up to 147 MV/m after tens of millions of pulses and very few breakdowns (BDs). We interpret this as an indication of the conditioning effect being due to high field pulsing rather than exposure to BDs. The effect of the warm and cold conditioning was investigated with high-resolution microscopy, characterizing the BD spots on the anode and cathode according to their morphology and with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyzing the changes in the sub-surface regions. Atypical BD spot features were found on the cryogenically conditioned cathode surfaces, with very shallow craters of a star-like shape. The number of atypical spots increased with decreased temperatures, reaching 26 and 53 percent of the total number of spots at 30~K and 10~K, respectively. A hypothesis explaining the formation of these features is also presented. The very different morphology of the anode and cathode BD spots is presented in detail that suggesting an unknown shielding mechanism that prevents the center of the anode spot from melting. These results provide important experimental input for the development of quantitative theories and models for BD initiation and inter-electrode plasma formation.</description>

      <title>Positron Acceleration in Plasma Wakefields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma acceleration has emerged as a promising technology for future particle accelerators, particularly linear colliders. Significant progress has been made in recent decades toward high-efficiency and high-quality acceleration of electrons in plasmas. However, this progress does not generalize to acceleration of positrons, as plasmas are inherently charge asymmetric. Here, we present a comprehensive review of historical and current efforts to accelerate positrons using plasma wakefields. Proposed schemes that aim to increase the energy efficiency and beam quality are summarised and quantitatively compared. A dimensionless metric that scales with the luminosity-per-beam power is introduced, indicating that positron-acceleration schemes are currently below the ultimate requirement for colliders. The primary issue is electron motion; the high mobility of plasma electrons compared to plasma ions, which leads to non-uniform accelerating and focusing fields that degrade the beam quality of the positron bunch, particularly for high efficiency acceleration. Finally, we discuss possible mitigation strategies and directions for future research.</description>
