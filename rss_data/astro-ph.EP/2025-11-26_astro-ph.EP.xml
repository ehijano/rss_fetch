      <title>Evolutionary Processes in the Centaur Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centaurs populate relatively short-lived and rapidly evolving orbits in the giant-planet region and are believed to be one of the solar system's most complex and diverse populations. Most Centaurs are linked to origins in the dynamically excited component of the trans-Neptunian region, and are often considered an intermediate phase in the evolution of Jupiter-family comets (JFCs). Additionally, the Centaur region hosts objects from varied source populations and having different dynamical histories. In this chapter, we focus on the physical processes responsible for the evolution of this heterogeneous population in the giant-planet region. The chapter begins with a brief review on the origin and early evolution that determine Centaurs' properties prior to entering the giant-planet region. Next, we discuss the thermal, collisional, and tidal processes believed to drive the changes Centaurs undergo. We provide a comprehensive review of the evidence for evolutionary changes derived from studies of the activity, physical properties, and surface characteristics of Centaurs and related populations, such as trans-Neptunian objects, JFCs, and Trojans. This chapter reveals a multitude of gaps in the current understanding of the evolution mechanisms acting in the giant-planet region. In light of these open questions, we conclude with an outlook on future telescope and spacecraft observations, detailing how they are expected to elucidate Centaur evolution processes.</description>

      <title>Chemical and Isotopic Homogeneity Between the L Dwarf CD-35 2722 B and its Early M Host Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CD-35 2722 B is an L dwarf companion to the nearby, $\sim 50-200$ Myr old M1 dwarf CD-35 2722 A. We present a detailed analysis of both objects using high-resolution ($R \sim 35,000$) $K$ band spectroscopy from the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) combined with archival photometry. With a mass of $30^{+5}_{-4} M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ (planet-to-host mass ratio 0.05) and projected separation of $67\pm4$ AU from its host, CD-35 2722 B likely formed via gravitational instability. We explore whether the chemical composition of the system tells a similar story. Accounting for systematic uncertainties, we find $\mathrm{[M/H]}=-0.16^{+0.03}_{-0.02} \mathrm{(stat)} \pm 0.25 \mathrm{(sys)}$ dex and $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}=132^{+20}_{-14}$ for the host, and $\mathrm{[M/H]}=0.27^{+0.07}_{-0.06} (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.12 (\mathrm{sys})$ dex, $^{12}\mathrm{CO}/^{13}\mathrm{CO}=159^{+33}_{-24} \mathrm{(stat)}^{+40}_{-33} \mathrm{(sys)}$, and $\mathrm{C/O} = 0.55 \pm 0.01 (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.04 (\mathrm{sys})$ for the companion. The chemical compositions for the brown dwarf and host star agree within the $1.5\sigma$ level, supporting a scenario where CD-35 2722 B formed via gravitational instability. We do not find evidence for clouds on CD-35 2722 B despite it being a photometrically red mid-L dwarf and thus expected to be quite cloudy. We retrieve a temperature structure which is more isothermal than models and investigate its impact on our measurements, finding that constraining the temperature structure to self-consistent models does not significantly impact our retrieved chemical properties. Our observations highlight the need for data from complementary wavelength ranges to verify the presence of aerosols in likely cloudy L dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Planetary Habitability Under the Light of a Rapidly Changing Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary atmospheric energy budgets primarily depend on stellar incident flux. However, stellar variability can have major consequences for the evolution of planetary climates. In this work, we evaluate how stellar variability influences the equilibrium temperature and water retention of planets within the Habitable Zone (HZ). We present a sample of 9 stars that are known to host at least one planet within the HZ and that were identified to have a variability amplitude exceeding 100 ppm based on photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We investigate the effect that the variability of these stars have on the insolation flux of their HZ planets and the resulting changes in the induced planetary equilibrium temperature. Our results show that for the stars in our sample, the stellar variability has an insignificant effect on the equilibrium temperature of HZ planets. However, we also emphasize that these stars are not representative of more extreme variable stars, since exoplanets are more difficult to detect and characterize in the presence of extreme variability. We also investigate the equilibrium temperature and long-term evolution of a hypothetical Earth-like planet placed at the inner edge of the HZ around a highly variable star. We found that the water loss rates are comparable between both variable and quiet host stars for Earth-like planets in the inner HZ. Overall, these results broaden our knowledge on the impact of stellar variability on planetary habitability.</description>

      <title>Sequential Fragmentation of C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) After Its Near-Sun Passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) reached perihelion at 0.33~au on 2025 October 8. Daily monitoring by the LCO Outbursting Objects Key Project revealed a major activity increase between November 2 and 4, accompanied by rapid changes in coma morphology. Serendipitous HST/STIS acquisition images obtained on November 8-10 captured the comet only days after this event and resolved five fragments, providing an early high-resolution view of a nucleus in the process of disruption. Fragment motions and morphologies indicate a hierarchical fragmentation sequence, including a slow secondary split of fragment II. Back-extrapolation shows that both the primary and secondary breakups preceded their associated photometric outbursts by roughly one to three days. This consistent lag, together with the appearance of thin, short-lived arclets around fragment A in the first HST epoch, suggests that freshly exposed interior material warms rapidly but requires time before dust can be released efficiently. These combined ground- and space-based observations provide rare, time-resolved constraints on the thermal and structural evolution of a fragmented comet near perihelion and highlight the scientific value of capturing a nucleus within days of disruption.</description>

      <title>Observations of [O I] emission in Comets C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy) and C/2007 N3 (Lulin): Possible Influence of Solar Activity on Oxygen Line Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observing [O I] emission to calculate an "oxygen line ratio" has been proposed as a potential proxy for direct CO$_2$ measurement in comets. However, the photochemistry governing [O I] release into the coma is not well understood, and using theoretical release rates often yields different results than using empirical release rates determined in conjunction with direct space-based measurements of CO$_2$. We hypothesize that the accuracy of the release rates could depend on the level of solar activity at the time the comet is observed, which will be influenced by the solar cycle. We present observations and analysis of [O I] emission in one comet observed near solar maximum, C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy), and one near solar minimum, C/2007 N3 (Lulin). Our [O I] measurements were obtained using two high spectral resolution optical spectrographs: the Tull Coud\`e spectrometer at McDonald Observatory and the ARCES spectrometer at Apache Point Observatory. We use empirical and theoretical models for [O I] emission from the literature to derive multiple sets of inferred CO$_2$ abundances for these comets and compare to contemporaneous space-based measurements of CO$_2$. We find that the empirical model, which was developed based on comet observations obtained near solar maximum, reproduces the directly measured CO$_2$ abundances better for Lovejoy. Neither model accurately reproduces the direct measurement for Lulin. We discuss the implications of our findings for the accuracy and dependencies of the oxygen line ratio method for inferring CO$_2$ abundances in cometary comae.</description>

      <title>Seasonal asymmetry in vertical distribution of meteor decay time at two conjugate polar latitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The meteor occurrence height and decay time height are strongly dependent on local atmospheric conditions in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT)-region. In this study, we comparatively examine the seasonal behaviour of vertical distribution of meteor occurrence height and decay time height at two identical radars of conjugate polar latitudes, Esrange (68$^\circ$N) and Rothera (68$^\circ$S). In order to understand the nature of meteor trail variations, the received signal power is categorised into two groups as weak and strong echoes, and their seasonal mean vertical profiles are constructed. It has been noticed that the meteor occurrence height shown a seasonal symmetry, however, decay time vertical profiles shows an asymmetric pattern at conjugate polar latitudes, particularly for strong echoes. Seasonally, there is about 1 km difference in occurrence height and decay time height of weak and strong echoes. From the decay time vertical profiles, it has been noticed that the decay time turning altitude (i.e., inflection point) varies seasonally in the altitudes range of 80-86 km for weak and strong echoes. The maximum turning altitude of about 85 km is observed in Northern winter at Esrange (68$^\circ$N) and in Southern summer at Rothera (68$^\circ$S), similarly minimum turning altitude of about 80 km is observed in Northern winter at Esrange (68$^\circ$N) and in Southern summer at Rothera (68$^\circ$S). The probable reasons for such behaviour of meteor trails at opposite polar latitudes are discussed.</description>

      <title>Tidal Heating of the Lunar Magma Ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The timing of the lunar magma ocean (LMO) solidification is governed by its thermal evolution. A key geochronological observation is that all analyzed products of LMO solidification have ages (or age peaks) near 4.35 +/- 0.05 billion years ago (Ga), suggesting rapid solidification of the last ~40% of the LMO at that time. The ages raise two questions: (1) how was the final solidification of the LMO delayed for over 100 Myr (million years) from the Moon's formation, and (2) after such a delay, how did it solidify so quickly? These two aspects of the ages are inconsistent with models of early-fast solidification or slow-prolonged solidification, controlled by radiogenic heat production and convective cooling (even if slowed by a conductive lithosphere). We propose that both aspects can not only be explained by tidal heating of the LMO but are in fact robust and expected thermal evolution features of a magma ocean cooling while being tidally heated and, in the Moon's case, receding from the Earth. The delay in solidification is due to the LMO being trapped at a stable equilibrium between the enhanced tidal heating rate and the decreasing cooling rate. The rapid solidification at ~4.35 Ga occurs when the Moon retreats to the point where an unstable equilibrium is reached, where tidal heating is drastically reduced, rapidly cooling the Moon. Moreover, an unanticipated outcome of our modeling is that the farside of the Moon is predicted to be 20-60 deg C cooler than the nearside for ~10-100 Myr during the final solidification stage. This is consistent with previous studies indicating asymmetric crystallization of the LMO from the farside to the nearside, which leads to an older and less evolved farside crust than the nearside, consistent with the observed higher Mg# of farside anorthositic crust and the nearside concentration of H2O, KREEP, and high Fe-Ti components.</description>

      <title>TOI-7510: A solar-analog system of three transiting giant planets near a Laplace resonance chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the confirmation and initial characterization of a compact and dynamically rich multiple giant planet system orbiting the solar analog TOI-7510. The system was recently identified as a candidate two-planet system in a machine-learning search of the TESS light curves. Using TESS data and photometric follow-up observations with ASTEP, CHEOPS, and EulerCam, we show that one transit was initially misattributed and that the system consists of three transiting giant planets with orbital periods of 11.5, 22.6, and 48.9 days. The planets have radii of 0.65, 0.96, and 0.94 R_J, making them the largest known trio of transiting planets. The system architecture lies near a 4:2:1 mean motion resonant chain, inducing large transit timing variations for all three planets. Photodynamical modeling gives mass estimates of 0.057, 0.41, and 0.60 M_J and favors low eccentricities and mutual inclinations. TOI-7510 is an interesting system for investigating the dynamical interactions and formation histories of compact systems of giant planets.</description>

      <title>Exomoon search with VLTI/GRAVITY around the substellar companion HD 206893 B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct astrometric detection of exomoons remains unexplored. This study presents the first application of high-precision astrometry to search for exomoons around substellar companions. We investigate whether the orbital motion of the companion HD 206893 B exhibits astrometric residuals consistent with the gravitational influence of an exomoon or binary planet. Using the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument, we monitored the astrometric positions of HD 206893 B and c across both short (days to months) and long (yearly) timescales. This enabled us to isolate potential residual wobbles in the motion of component B attributable to an orbiting moon. Our analysis reveals tentative astrometric residuals in the HD 206893 B orbit. If interpreted as an exomoon signature, these residuals correspond to a candidate (HD 206893 B I) with an orbital period of approximately 0.76 years and a mass of $\sim$0.4 Jupiter masses. However, the origin of these residuals remains ambiguous and could be due to systematics. Complementing the astrometry, our analysis of GRAVITY $R=4000$ spectroscopy for HD 206893 B confirms a clear detection of water, but no CO is found using cross-correlation. We also find that AF Lep b, and $\beta$ Pic b are the best short-term candidates to look for moons with GRAVITY+. Our observations demonstrate the transformative potential of high-precision astrometry in the search for exomoons, and proves the feasibility of the technique to detect moons with masses lower than Jupiter and potentially down to less than Neptune in optimistic cases. Crucially, further high-precision astrometric observations with VLTI/GRAVITY are essential to verify the reality and nature of this signal and attempt this technique on a variety of planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Precise mass and radius determination for two new and one known Neptune-sized planets around G Dwarf hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the KESPRINT collaboration, we present the discovery and characterization of three exoplanets in the sub-Neptune to super-Neptune regime, spanning key regions of the exo-Neptunian landscape. TOI-1472c and TOI-1648b are newly discovered sub-Neptunes, while TOI-1472b is a previously known super-Neptune for which we provide an improved mass measurement. These planets have orbital periods of 6--15 days and radii of 2.5--4.1 R$_\oplus$, probing regions where planet formation and atmospheric evolution remain poorly understood. We combine TESS transit photometry with ground-based radial velocities to determine precise masses, radii, and orbital properties. TOI-1472b has a mass of $18.0^{+0.84}_{-0.85}$ M$_\oplus$ and a radius of $4.06 \pm 0.10$ R$_\oplus$, TOI-1472c has a mass of $21.1^{+0.96}_{-0.99}$ M$_\oplus$ and a radius of $3.33 \pm 0.08$ R$_\oplus$, and TOI-1648b has a mass of $7.4^{+1.1}_{-1.3}$ M$_\oplus$ and a radius of $2.54^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$ R$_\oplus$. The planets exhibit a range of eccentricities (0.041--0.178), indicating diverse evolutionary histories. TOI-1648b, with a high Transmission Spectroscopy Metric (TSM $\sim$59), is a promising target for atmospheric characterization. Together, these three planets provide precise constraints on the structure, composition, and dynamical evolution of small to intermediate-sized exoplanets, enriching our understanding of the exo-Neptunian landscape.</description>

      <title>Projections of Earth's Technosphere: Strategies for Observing Technosignatures on Terrestrial Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for technosignatures -- remotely detectable evidence of extraterrestrial technology -- draws upon examples from the recent history of Earth as well as projections of Earth's technosphere. Facilities like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will significantly advance the feasibility of characterizing the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, while other future mission concepts could extend this search to mid-infrared wavelengths. We draw upon a recently developed set of ten self-consistent scenarios for future Earth technospheres as analogs for extraterrestrial technospheres, which we use to outline a stepwise technosignature search strategy beginning with HWO and followed by other missions. We find that HWO could reveal elevated abundances of a CO$_2$ + NO$_2$ pair on planets with combustion and other large-scale industry, which could be observable in up to in eight of the ten scenarios. Follow-up radio observations could reveal narrow-band directed transmissions, which occurs in two of the scenarios. Further study by direct detection at mid-infrared wavelengths with the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) could reveal spectral features from industry, such as the combination of CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 in four scenarios and CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 + CF$_4$ in one scenario; two of these also include the N$_2$O + CH$_4$ + NH$_3$ triple from large-scale agriculture. Other mission concepts such as a Solar Gravitational Lens mission could reveal large-scale surface features in two scenarios that otherwise show no detectable technosignatures, while an interplanetary fly-by or probe mission would be the most conclusive way to reveal the presence of technology on terrestrial exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Considerations on the process of target selection for the Comet Interceptor mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comet Interceptor is an ESA science mission with payload contributions from ESA Member States and with an international participation by JAXA. It is the first mission that is being designed, built, and potentially launched before its target is known. This approach will enable the spacecraft to perform the first mission to a Long Period Comet from the Oort Cloud, as these comets have fleeting visits to the inner Solar System lasting only months to years from first discovery, too short for the usual process of mission development to be followed. In this paper we describe a number of factors that need to be considered in selecting a target for the mission, including scientific, orbital, spacecraft and instrument constraints, and discussion of different prioritisation strategies. We find that, in the case where we have a choice of targets, our decisions will mostly be driven by orbital information, which we will have relatively early on, with information on the activity level of the comet an important but secondary consideration. As cometary activity levels are notoriously hard to predict based on early observations alone, this prioritisation / decision approach based more on orbits gives us confidence that a good comet that is compatible with the spacecraft constraints will be selectable with sufficient warning time to allow the mission to intercept it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test on Saturn's rings whether the Hurst exponent is a "robust" observable, in the sense that it returns consistent values for different observations of the same object. We calculate the exponent of the series corresponding to the optical depth as a function of the radius, as obtained from the grayscale value of Cassini pictures, as well as from stellar occultation data from Voyager missions.</description>

      <title>Measuring Cometary Nuclei Behind Bright Comae: PSF Delta Decomposition with Bicubic Resampling and an Application to Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS C/2025 N1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring cometary nuclei is notoriously difficult because they are usually unresolved and embedded within bright comae, which hampers direct size measurements even with space telescopes. We present a practical, instrumental method that, stabilises the inner core through bicubic resampling, performs forward point-spread function PSF+convolution, and separates the unresolved nucleus from the inner-coma profile via an explicit Dirac Delta function added to a Rho^-1 surface brightness law. The method yields the nucleus flux by fitting an azimuthal averaged profile with two amplitudes only PSF core and convolved coma, with transparent residual diagnostics. As a case study, we apply the workflow to the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS alias C/2025 N1, incorporating Hubble Space Telescope constraints on the nucleus size. We find that radius solutions consistent with 0.16 &lt;= Rn &lt;= 2.8 km for Pv = 0.04 are naturally recovered, in line with the most recent HST upper limits. The approach is well-suited for survey pipelines Rubin LSST and targeted follow up.</description>

      <title>Sequential Convex Programming for Multimode Spacecraft Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacecraft equipped with multiple propulsion modes or systems can offer enhanced performance and mission flexibility compared with traditional configurations. Despite these benefits, the trajectory optimization of spacecraft utilizing such configurations remains a complex challenge. This paper presents a sequential convex programming (SCP) approach for the optimal design of multi-mode and multi-propulsion spacecraft trajectories. The method extends the dynamical linearization within SCP using sparse automatic differentiation, enabling efficient inclusion of multiple propulsion modes or systems without complex manual reformulation while maintaining comparable computational efficiency. New constraint formulations are introduced to ensure selection of a single propulsion mode at each time step and limit the total number of modes used. The approach is demonstrated for (i) a low-thrust Earth-67P rendezvous using the SPT-140 thruster with 20 discrete modes, and (ii) an Earth-Mars transfer employing both a low-thrust engine and a solar sail. Results confirm that the proposed method can efficiently compute optimal trajectories for these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Constraining properties of dust formed in Wolf-Rayet binary WR 112 using mid-infrared and millimeter observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binaries that host a carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WC) star and an OB-type companion can be copious dust producers. Yet the properties of dust, particularly the grain size distribution, in these systems remain uncertain. We present Band 6 observations of WR 112 by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope (ALMA), which are the first millimeter observations of a WC binary system capable of resolving its dust emission. By combining ALMA observations with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images, we were able to analyze the spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) of WR 112. We found that the SEDs are consistent with emissions from hydrogen-poor amorphous carbon grains. Notably, our results also suggest that the majority of grains in the system have radii below one micrometer, and the extended dust structures are dominated by nanometer-sized grains. Among four parameterizations of the grain radius distribution that we tested, a bimodal distribution, with abundant nanometer-sized grains and a secondary population of 0.1-micron grains, best reproduces the observed SED. This bimodal distribution helps to reconcile the previously conflicting grain size estimates reported for WR 112 and for other WC systems. We hypothesize that dust destruction mechanisms such as radiative torque disruption and radiative-driven sublimation are responsible for driving the system to the bimodal grain size distribution.</description>

      <title>Investigating impacts of dust events on atmospheric surface temperature in Southwest Asia using AERONET data, satellite recordings, and atmospheric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust layers have already been reported to have negative impacts on the radiation budget of the atmosphere. But the questions are: How does the atmospheric surface temperature change during a dust outbreak, and what is its temporal correlation with variations of the dust outbreak strength? We investigated these at selected AERONET sites, including Bahrain, IASBS, Karachi, KAUST Campus, Kuwait University, Lahore, Mezaira, Solar Village, in Southwest Asia, and Dushanbe in Central Asia, using available data from 1998 to 2024. The aerosol optical depth at 870 nm and the temperature recorded at each site are taken as measures of dust outbreak strength and atmospheric surface temperature, respectively. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model and the aerosol optical depths recorded by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) on board the Aqua and Terra satellites are used to specify the sources of the dust outbreaks. Our investigations show that in most cases, the temperature decreases during a dust outbreak, but in a considerable number of cases, the temperature rises. Temperature changes are mostly less than 5 {\deg}C. We found that a dust outbreak may affect the temperature even up to two days after its highest intensity time. This effect is more profound at sites far from large dust sources, such as IASBS in northwest Iran. For sites that are located on either a dust source or very close to it, the temperature and dust optical depth vary almost synchronously.</description>

      <title>Diversity of low-mass planet atmospheres in the C-H-O-N-S-Cl system with interior dissolution, nonideality, and condensation: Application to TRAPPIST-1e and sub-Neptunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantitative understanding of the nature and composition of low-mass rocky (exo)planet atmospheres during their evolution is needed to interpret observations. The magma ocean stage of terrestrial- and sub-Neptune planets permits mass exchange between their interiors and atmospheres, during which the mass and speciation of the atmosphere is dictated by the planet's volatile budget, chemical equilibria, and gas/fluid solubility in molten rock. As the atmosphere cools, it is modified by gas-phase reactions and condensation. We combine these processes into an open-source Python package built using JAX called Atmodeller, and perform calculations for planet sizes and conditions analogous to TRAPPIST-1e and K2-18b. For TRAPPIST-1e-like planets, our simulations indicate that CO-dominated atmospheres are prevalent during the magma ocean stage, which, upon isochemical cooling, predominantly evolve into CO2-rich atmospheres of a few hundred bar at 280 K. Around 40% of our simulations predict the coexistence of liquid water, graphite, alpha-sulfur, and ammonium chloride, which are key ingredients for surface habitability. For sub-Neptune gas dwarfs, pressures are sufficiently high (a few GPa) that gas fugacities deviate from ideality, thereby drastically enhancing solubilities. This buffers the total atmospheric pressure to lower values than for the ideal case. These effects conspire to produce CH4-rich sub-Neptune atmospheres for total pressures exceeding around 3.5 GPa, provided H/C is approximately 100x solar and fO2 moderately reducing (3 log10 units below the iron-wustite buffer). Otherwise, molecular hydrogen remains the predominant species at lower total pressures and/or higher H/C. For all planets at high temperature, solubility enriches C/H in the atmosphere relative to the initial composition.</description>

      <title>Colors of Life in the Clouds: Biopigments of atmospheric microorganisms as a new signature to detect life on planets like Earth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When Carl Sagan and Ed Salpeter envisioned potential Sinkers, Floaters, and Hunters living in Jupiter's clouds in 1976 (C. Sagan &amp; E. E. Salpeter 1976), the nature of life in Earth's atmosphere remained widely unknown. Decades later, research has revealed a remarkable variety of microorganisms in our atmosphere. However, the spectral features of airborne microbes as biomarkers for detecting atmospheric life remained a mystery. Here, we present the first reflectance spectra of biopigments of atmospheric microorganisms based on laboratory cultivars of seven microbial strains isolated from Earth's atmosphere. We show their distinct UV-resistant biosignatures and their impacts on models of diverse planetary scenarios, using Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) parameters. The reflectance of these biopigments from aerial bacteria creates the means to detect them on other Earth-like planets. It provides a paradigm shift that moves the search for life beyond the surface of a planet to ecosystems in atmospheres and clouds.</description>

      <title>High-inclination Centaur reservoirs beyond Neptune</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Abridged) Numerical simulations of the past evolution of high-inclination Centaurs showed they originated from orbits beyond Neptune that were perpendicular to the Solar System's invariable plane in a region called the polar corridor. Recently, a study of Centaur injection in the three-body problem showed that Neptune-crossing TNOs in the polar corridor in the range [40:160] au have dynamical times that exceed the Solar System's age suggesting the presence of long-lived Centaur-producing reservoirs. We demonstrate the existence of such reservoirs in the Solar System by simulating the TNOs' time-forward evolution in the presence of the giant planets, the Galactic tide and passing stars using the IAS15 integrator of the REBOUND and REBOUNDx packages. We also assess the efficiency of Centaur injection as a function of the initial inclination and determine if high-inclination Centaurs may be produced by low inclination reservoirs. We find that TNO reservoirs in the semi-major axis range [50:140] au are long-lived and their populations peak at the Tisserand parameters T=0.5 and T=-1.5. Saturn is found to induce secondary structures in the polar corridor by holding the perihelia of a fraction of high-inclination reservoir material. We find that the Centaur inclination at minimum semi-major axis depends linearly on the Tisserand parameter regardless of the initial semi-major axis. Its amplitude shows that low inclination reservoirs such as the early protoplanetary disk are unlikely to produce high-inclination Centaurs in contrast to reservoirs in the polar corridor. We identified the likely location of the closest reservoirs to Neptune populated by TNOs captured in the early Solar System that produce high-inclination Centaurs. The Legacy Survey of Space and Time will be able to constrain the reservoirs' extent and population size</description>

      <title>The Distribution of Earth-Impacting Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we calculate the expected orbital elements, radiants, and velocities of Earth-impacting interstellar objects. We generate a synthetic population of $\sim10^{10}$ interstellar objects with M-star kinematics in order to obtain $\sim10^4$ Earth-impactors. The relative flux of impactors arriving from the direction of the solar apex and the galactic plane is enhanced by a factor of $\sim2$ relative to the mean. The fastest impactors also arrive from these directions, although Earth-impactors are generally slower than objects in the overall population. This is because the Earth-impacting subset contains a higher fraction of low-eccentricity hyperbolic objects which are more strongly affected by gravitational focusing. Earth-impacting interstellar objects are more likely to have retrograde orbits close to the ecliptic plane. A selection effect makes the distribution of inclination of Earth-impacting interstellar objects uniform/sinusoidal at low/high perihelion distances. In turn, low perihelion impactors have higher impact probability towards the ecliptic plane. The overall impactor population therefore exhibits an intermediate inclination distribution between uniform and sinusoidal. The highest velocity impacts are most likely to occur in the spring when the Earth is moving towards the solar apex. However, impacts in general are more likely to occur during the winter when the Earth is located in the direction of the antapex. Interstellar objects are more likely to impact the Earth at low latitudes close to the equator, with a slight preference for the Northern hemisphere due to the location of the apex. These distributions are independent of the assumed interstellar object number density, albedos, and size-frequency distribution and are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Shaping the Mantle: The Role of the Superheated Core After Giant Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Moon-forming giant impact significantly influenced the initial thermal state of Earth's mantle by generating a global magma ocean, marking the onset of mantle evolution. Recent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations indicate that such a collision would produce a superheated core, whose cooling would strongly influence subsequent mantle dynamics. Here, we present systematic SPH simulations of diverse giant-impact scenarios and show that the superheated core formed after the impact can trigger secondary mantle melting, thereby governing the final state of the magma ocean. To further quantify this effect, we employ a parameterized mantle-melting model to evaluate the influence of secondary melting on the lower mantle. Our results suggest three possible outcomes: complete mantle melting, the formation of a basal melt layer, or the initiation of an early superplume. Combined with recent two-phase magma-ocean solidification models, we infer that all three scenarios would result in basal melt layers of varying thickness, partially retaining the thermal energy of the superheated core. In the canonical Moon-forming scenario, the superheated core would rapidly transfer heat to Earth's lower mantle, causing secondary mantle melting within approximately 277--5983 years and generating either a basal melt layer or a fully molten mantle. Both outcomes would effectively erase primordial heterogeneities in the lower mantle and impose distinct pathways for its subsequent thermal evolution.</description>

Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is only the second confirmed cometary object known to enter the Solar System from interstellar space. Cosmogonic considerations suggest that this body may possess relatively high tensile strength and a substantial metal fraction. We present photometric observations along its inbound trajectory toward perihelion, together with a spectroscopic comparison to pristine carbonaceous chondrites from the NASA Antarctic collection. The spectral similarities indicate that 3I/ATLAS may be a primitive carbonaceous object, likely enriched in native metal and undergoing significant aqueous alteration during its approach to the Sun, experiencing cryovolcanism as we could expect for a pristine Trans-Neptunian Object. We propose that the combination of elevated metal abundance and abundant water ice can account for the unusual coma morphology and chemical products reported to date. To do so, corrosion of fine-grained metal grains can originate energetic Fischer-Tropsch reactions, generating specific chemical products into the coma that are not so common in other comets because most of them formed in the outer solar system and didn't inherited so much metal. Interstellar objects such as 3I/ATLAS provide rare opportunities to investigate physical and chemical processes in distant minor bodies of our own Solar System, including trans-Neptunian objects and Oort Cloud comets.</description>
