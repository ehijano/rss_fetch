      <title>$\mathtt{Entity}$ -- Hardware-agnostic Particle-in-Cell Code for Plasma Astrophysics. II: General Relativistic Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole environments often host plasmas that are fully collisionless or contain intrinsically collisionless regions, including relativistic jets and coronae where particle energization is ubiquitous. Capturing the physics of these systems requires numerical methods capable of modeling relativistic, magnetized, collisionless plasmas in strong gravitational fields. In this work, we introduce the general-relativistic module for the Entity -- the first open-source, coordinate-agnostic performance-portable particle-in-cell code. The code enables fast axisymmetric simulations of collisionless plasmas around black holes on any modern high-performance computing architecture (both GPUs and CPUs).</description>

      <title>Entity -- Hardware-agnostic Particle-in-Cell Code for Plasma Astrophysics. I: Curvilinear Special Relativistic Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entity is a new-generation, fully open-source particle-in-cell (PIC) code developed to overcome key limitations in astrophysical plasma modeling, particularly the extreme separation of scales and the performance challenges associated with evolving, GPU-centric computing infrastructures. It achieves hardware-agnostic performance portability across various GPU and CPU architectures using the Kokkos library. Crucially, Entity maintains a high standard for usability, clarity, and customizability, offering a robust and easy-to-use framework for developing new algorithms and grid geometries, which allows extensive control without requiring edits to the core source code. This paper details the core general-coordinate special-relativistic module. Entity is the first PIC code designed to solve the Vlasov-Maxwell system in general coordinates, enabling a coordinate-agnostic framework that provides the foundational structure for straightforward extension to arbitrary coordinate geometries. The core methodology achieves numerical stability by solving particle equations of motion in the global orthonormal Cartesian basis, despite using generalized coordinates like Cartesian, axisymmetric spherical, and quasi-spherical grids. Charge conservation is ensured via a specialized current deposition technique using conformal currents. The code exhibits robust scalability and performance portability on major GPU platforms (AMD MI250X, NVIDIA A100, and Intel Max Series), with the 3D particle pusher and the current deposition operating efficiently at about 2 nanoseconds per particle per timestep. Functionality is validated through a comprehensive suite of standard Cartesian plasma tests and the accurate modeling of relativistic magnetospheres in curvilinear axisymmetric geometries.</description>

      <title>The Optical Evolution of the Tycho Supernova Remnant over Three Decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a series of images of the Tycho supernova remnant at eight epochs extending over thirty years: 1986-2016. In addition to our H{\alpha} images, we have obtained matched continuum images which we subtract to reveal faint emission, including a far more extensive network of optical knots and filaments than reported previously. The deepest images also show an extremely faint, fairly diffuse arc of emission surrounding much of the circumference of Tycho to the southeast and south, coinciding with the rim of the radio/X-ray shell. We have measured proper motions for 46 filaments, including many fainter ones near the Tycho outer rim. Our measurements are generally consistent with previous ones by Kamper and vandenBergh (1978), but ours have far greater precision. Most optical filaments at the shell rim have expansion indices reasonably consistent with the Sedov value (0.40), while the interior filaments have somewhat smaller values, as expected. From the combination of proper motions of filaments at the shell rim and shock velocity at the same positions, one should be able to calculate the distance to Tycho by simple geometry. Determination of the shock velocity from broad Balmer-line profiles is subject to model uncertainties, but the availability of dozens of such filaments with a range of conditions offers the possibility to substantially improve the distance determination for Tycho.</description>

      <title>Broadband X-ray observations of the periodic optical source ZTF J185139.81+171430.3 and its identification as a massive intermediate polar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present X-ray observations of the periodic optical source ZTF J185139.81+171430.3 (hereafter ZTF J1851) by the XMM, NICER and NuSTAR telescopes. The source was initially speculated to be a white dwarf (WD) pulsar system due to its short period ($P\sim12$ min) and highly-modulated optical lightcurves. Our observations revealed a variable X-ray counterpart extending up to 40 keV with an X-ray luminosity of $L_X \sim 3\times10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (0.3--40 keV). Utilizing timing data from XMM and NICER, we detected a periodic signal at $P_{\rm spin}=12.2640(7)\pm0.0583$ min with $&gt;6\sigma$ significance. The pulsed profile displays $\sim 25\%$ and $\sim10\%$ modulation in the 0.3--2 and 2--10 keV bands, respectively. Broadband X-ray spectra are best characterized by an absorbed optically-thin thermal plasma model with $kT \approx 25$ keV and a Fe K-$\alpha$ fluorescent line at 6.4 keV. The bright and hard X-ray emission rules out the possibility of a WD pulsar or ultra-compact X-ray binary. The high plasma temperature and Fe emission lines suggest that ZTF J1851 is an intermediate polar spinning at 12.264 min. We employed an X-ray spectral model composed of the accretion column emission and X-ray reflection to fit the broadband X-ray spectra. Assuming spin equilibrium between the WD and the inner accretion disk, we derived a WD mass range of $M_{\rm WD}=(1.07\rm{-}1.32)M_{\odot}$ exceeding the mean WD mass of IPs ($\langle M_{\rm WD} \rangle = 0.8 M_\odot)$. Our findings illustrate that follow-up broadband X-ray observations could provide unique diagnostics to elucidate the nature of periodic optical sources anticipated to be detected in the upcoming Rubin all-sky optical surveys.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $\gamma$-Ray Orbital Modulation in the Redback Millisecond Pulsar PSR J2039-5617</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR J2039-5617 is a redback millisecond pulsar binary system consisting of a compact star with a mass of 1.1-1.6 $M_\odot$ and a low-mass companion of 0.15-0.22 $M_\odot$. For this binary, we performed a timing analysis using 16 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope, covering the period from 2008 August to 2024 October. Our analysis detected an orbital modulation with a period of 0.2279781 days at a significance level of $\sim4\sigma$, which is in good agreement with previous findings. However, unlike previous reports, we identified a transition in the orbital modulation around 2021 August, after which the orbital signal disappeared. We speculate that the system may be undergoing a transition from a rotation-powered to an accretion-powered state at this epoch. Additionally, we conducted the phase-resolved and spectral analyses, and in the phase-resolved results, we observed an anti-correlation between its $\gamma$-ray and X-ray emissions, which consistent with the predictions of high-energy radiation models for such systems. We provide some predictive discussions based on the results of $\gamma$-ray data analysis, and future Fermi-LAT observations will determine whether these predictions hold true.</description>

      <title>Verifying the failing supernova constraint on dark photons with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies on the dark photon (DP) production in collapsing stars argue that the cooling effect induced by DPs can hinder supernova explosions and lead to a ``failing supernova" constraint on the photon-DP mixing parameter $\epsilon$. In order to verify the idea, we perform two-dimensional neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations coupled with the DP production with the mass of 0.3 MeV. We find that the shock revival does not happen until the end of the simulations when $\epsilon\gtrsim3\times10^{-9}$. The photon-DP mixing parameter above this value can be excluded by the failing supernova argument. Interestingly, our constraint is close to the one reported by the previous studies which adopted the post-processing framework. This result motivates one to investigate a wider parameter range of DPs with self-consistent simulations and evaluate uncertainties in the constraint.</description>

      <title>Cosmogenic Origin of KM3-230213A: Delayed Gamma-Ray Emission from A Cosmic-Ray Transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The highest-energy cosmic neutrino detected by the ARCA detector of KM3NeT has reignited the quest to pinpoint the sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs; $E\gtrsim 0.1$ EeV). By uncovering the associated multimessenger signals, we investigate the origin of the 220 PeV $\nu_\mu$ event KM3-230213A from a transient source that accelerated cosmic rays to $\sim 10$ EeV. UHECR protons that escape the source interact with the cosmic background radiation, producing a PeV-EeV cosmogenic neutrino spectrum. The secondary $e^\pm$ and $\gamma$-rays initiate an electromagnetic cascade, resulting in a cosmogenic $\gamma$-ray spectrum that peaks at a delayed time due to deflection of charged particles in the extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF). Our results shed light on the nature of the UHECR source for the $\nu_\mu$ event and provide crucial insights into the detection of multi-TeV $\gamma$-rays of cosmogenic origin from similar past cosmological transients. Using the $\gamma$-ray sensitivity of currently operating and next-generation imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, the flux and time-delay distribution can constrain the source distance. We further show that the detection of such a $\gamma$-ray signal above the background depends on the EGMF strength. Together with the non-detection of coincident spatial or temporal photon counterparts at the current epoch, this detection is the first compelling candidate for a sub-EeV cosmogenic neutrino.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian statistical analysis of 897 pulsar flux density spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive re-evaluation of pulsar radio spectra using the largest curated dataset of calibrated flux densities to date, comprising 897 pulsars, and employing a robust Bayesian framework for model comparison alongside frequentist methods. Contrary to the established consensus that pulsar spectra are predominantly simple power laws, our analysis reveals that complex spectral shapes with curvature or breaks are in fact the norm. The broken power law emerges as the most common spectral shape, accounting for 60\% of pulsars, while the simple power law describes only 13.5\%, with 68.8\% of pulsars decisively favoring curved or broken models. We further identify 74 confident gigahertz-peaked spectrum pulsars, and demonstrate that millisecond pulsars frequently exhibit spectral curvature. A key finding is that the previously reported dominance of the simple power law was largely a statistical artifact of the frequentist method used in earlier work. These findings substantially revise the prevailing view of pulsar spectra and establish a critical, model-classified foundation for future theoretical work.</description>

      <title>GRB 240715A: Revealing Novel Intrinsic Mechanism by Different Individual Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Space-based multiband astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM), detected its first short gamma-ray burst, GRB 240715A, in-flight, which was jointly observed by Fermi. Based on observational data of SVOM/GRM and Fermi/GBM, we perform a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis for individual pulse in the prompt emission of this burst, and novel characteristics are revealed. Firstly, opposite evolutions of spectral lag are found in the first and third pulse of this burst. Second, the large negative lag of the first pulse is an outlier in short GRB sample, especially when the pulse duration is considered. Spectral analysis shows that the negative lag of the first pulse is caused by the evolution of spectrum index, and is irrelevant to Epeak, which is inconsistent with the previous study. The intrinsic mechanism is probably attributed to electron cooling in the decaying magnetic field, which leads to the continuous hardening of the spectrum index and results in negative lag. Furthermore, spectral analysis also shows that the third pulse is more likely to be described by a quasi-thermal spectrum, indicating the existence of photospheric emission. It is difficult to explain how the synchrotron radiation appears before photospheric emission in a single GRB and some assumptions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Spin Estimation with Time-variable Image of M87 During the Flaring State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By investigating the time-variable 230 GHz images using ray-tracing general relativistic radiative transfer calculation, we propose a novel method for estimating the spin parameter of the supermassive black hole at the M87 center by utilizing the sudden and short-term increase in emissivity in the innermost region of the accretion disk. It is found that the flux of the photon ring increases simultaneously as the flux of the direct ring, which brightens first, decreases, and then gradually diminishes, when the increase in emissivity persists for $15 t_{\rm g}$ with $t_{\rm g}$ being the light crossing time of the gravitational radius. The direct ring is formed by photons emitted from the vicinity of the innermost region of the disk and traveling directly to the observer without orbiting around the black hole, while the photon ring is formed by photons passing near the spherical photon orbit. The time-averaged width of the dark region between the direct ring and the photon ring (dark crescent) becomes thinner when the spin parameter is higher and the increase in the emissivity of the accretion disk is greater. The time variation of two rings also causes the intensity-weighted center to oscillate both in the direction of the black hole's angular momentum vector projected onto the screen ($Y$-direction) and in the perpendicular direction ($X$-direction). The amplitude of oscillatory time variation in the $X$-direction becomes large when the spin parameter is higher, and that in the $Y$-direction becomes large when the increase in the emissivity of the disk is large. The spin parameter can be estimated by combining the time-averaged dark crescent width and the ratio of the amplitudes in the $X$- and $Y$-directions. This method is applicable when the duration of the increase in emissivity of the accretion disk ranges at least from approximately 10-20 $t_{\rm g}$.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the potential of KM3NeT in detecting core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae mark the end of life of massive stars. However, despite their importance in astrophysics, their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Neutrinos that emerge from the dense core of the star offer a promising way to study supernova dynamics. A strategy is presented to improve the potential of the KM3NeT neutrino telescope to detect core-collapse supernovae in our Galaxy or the Large Magellanic Cloud by further exploiting the properties of its optical modules equipped with multiple photomultipliers. A supernova burst is expected to produce a sudden hit rate increase in the KM3NeT detectors. New observables have been defined for individual optical modules that exploit the geometry and time distribution of the detected hits, enabling a better discrimination between signal and background signatures. In addition, a thorough investigation of the related systematic uncertainties is presented for the first time. When implemented, this new methodology allowed KM3NeT to probe 46% more Galactic core-collapse supernova candidates than with the previous trigger strategy, reaching the dense Galactic bulge. It is now expected that, once completed, KM3NeT will achieve full Galactic sensitivity to core-collapse supernovae.</description>

      <title>r-Process nucleosynthesis from hyperaccreting neutron stars in common envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nuclear reactions and feedback in hyperaccreting neutron star environments, considering accretion rates in the range 0.3 - $3\times10^4$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, typical of short-period compact object binaries in common envelopes. Our mode ls account for weak reactions, neutrino energy loss, nuclear energy release, pair production, degenerate equations of state, and general relativistic hydrodynamics. Depending on accretion rates, these systems can develop both proton and neutron-rich atmospheres with strong convective instabilities linking the neutrino sphere to the outgoing accretion shock inside the radia tion trapping zone. Convection drives nucleons through multiple heating and cooling cycles, with photodisintegration dominat ing during the heating phase and heavy element synthesis during the cooling phase, ejecting material with abundances that dep end on the accretion rate and depth of the final decompression trajectory. The turbulent nature of convective currents is con ducive to creating a wide range of nuclear products through a variety of effects, including NSE freezeout and $r$, $p$ and $\ gamma$ processes. We also observe a novel multi-step process in reheated trajectories, consisting of proton-capture and photo-dissociation reactions operating on $r$-process seeds, producing overall neutron-deficient isotopes. A significant amount of infalling gas experiences high entropy and short (millisecond) freezeout timescales capable of making $r$-process elements w ith high over-abundances through a disequilibrium effect between neutrons and $\alpha$-particles that does not require an excess of neutrons.</description>

      <title>Insights into jet-NLR energetics in PMN J0948+0022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of the optical spectra of PMN J0948+0022 showed significant variations in the spectral lines that, when combined with the Fermi $\gamma$-ray light curve and radio observations reported by other authors, were interpreted as the result of interactions between the relativistic jet and the narrow-line region (NLR). In this work, we present order-of-magnitude calculations of the energetics associated with this proposed jet-NLR interaction. We demonstrate that the observed outflows are capable of absorbing a fraction of the jet energy and converting it into kinetic energy. This mechanism provides a natural explanation for the optical spectral variability recorded with the X-shooter and Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instruments. Our results support the scenario in which feedback from the relativistic jet can dynamically influence the circumnuclear gas, offering new insights into the coupling between jets and the NLR in $\gamma$-ray-emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts from White Dwarf Binary Mergers: Isolated and Triple-Induced Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in both young and old stellar populations suggests multiple formation pathways, beyond just young magnetars from core-collapse supernovae. A promising delayed channel involves the formation of FRB-emitting neutron stars through merger- or accretion-induced collapse of a massive white dwarf (WD). By simulating a realistic stellar population with both binaries and triples, we identify pathways to WD collapse that could produce FRB candidates. We find that (i) triple dynamics open new merger channels inaccessible to isolated binaries, significantly enhancing the overall merger rate; (ii) triple-induced mergers broaden the delay-time distribution, producing long-delay ($\gtrsim1$-8~Gyr) events largely independent of metallicity, alongside a shorter-delay population ($\lesssim100$~Myr) of rapid mergers; (iii) these long delays naturally yield FRBs in older environments such as quiescent host galaxies and galactic halos; (iv) when convolved with the cosmic star-formation history, binary channels track the star-formation rate ($z_{\rm peak} \sim 2$), while triple channels peak later ($z_{\rm peak} \sim 1$), giving a combined local source rate of $R_0 \approx 2\times10^4~{\rm Gpc^{-3}~yr^{-1}}$, consistent with observations; and (v) applying the same framework to Type~Ia supernovae, we find that triples extend the delay-time tail and roughly double the Ia efficiency relative to binaries, yielding rates and redshift evolution in good agreement with observations. If FRBs originate from the collapse of WDs, our results establish triples, alongside binaries, as a crucial and previously overlooked formation pathway whose predicted rates, host demographics, and redshift evolution offer clear tests for upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Trace Anomaly of Dense Matter inside Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trace anomaly $\Delta$ is an important quantity that measures the broken conformal symmetry in neutron star matter. In this work, we present quasi-universal relations that connect the stellar profile of $\Delta$ to the compactness, moment of inertia, and tidal deformability of neutron stars. We apply the quasi-universal relations to determine the trace anomaly profiles for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 based on their mass-radius measurements. We also analyze PSR J0737-3039A according to its moment of inertia inferred from Bayesian modeling of nuclear equation of state. A recent multimessenger constraint on the tidal deformability is also studied, resulting in an estimate value of the trace anomaly $\Delta_c = 0.1770^{+0.0365}_{-0.0432}$ at the center of a $1.4M_\odot$ canonical neutron star. It is expected that more precise observations from both electromagnetic and gravitational-wave channels in the future will provide tighter constraints on the behavior of $\Delta$ inside neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bayesian estimation of population-level torque law parameters from $68$ young radio pulsars observed with the Murriyang telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abridged. The measured braking index, $n=\nu \ddot{\nu}/\dot{\nu}^2$, of a rotation-powered pulsar with spin frequency $\nu$ and braking torque $K \nu^{n_{\rm pl}}$, features secular and stochastic anomalies arising from $\dot{K} \neq 0$ and random torque noise respectively. Previous studies quantified the variance $\langle n^{2} \rangle = (n_{\rm pl}+\dot{K}_{\rm dim})^{2}+\sigma_{\rm dim}^{2}$, where the secular anomaly, $\dot{K}_{\rm dim}$, is inversely proportional to the characteristic time-scale $\tau_{K}$ over which $K$ varies; the stochastic anomaly, $\sigma_{\rm dim}^{2} = \sigma_{\ddot{\nu}}^{2}\nu^{2}\gamma_{\ddot{\nu}}^{-2}\dot{\nu}^{-4}T_{\rm obs}^{-1}$, is a function of the timing noise amplitude $\sigma_{\ddot{\nu}}$, a damping time-scale $\gamma_{\ddot{\nu}}^{-1}$ and the total observing time $T_{\rm obs}$; and the average is taken over an ensemble of random realizations of the noise process. Here, we use a hierarchical Bayesian scheme, based on the formula for $\langle n^{2} \rangle$, to infer the population-level distribution of $n_{\rm pl}+\dot{K}_{\rm dim}$ for a sample of $68$ young radio pulsars, observed for $\gtrsim 10~{\rm years}$ with Murriyang, the 64-m Parkes radio telescope. Upon assuming that the $n_{\rm pl}+\dot{K}_{\rm dim}$ values are drawn from a population-level Gaussian, $N(\mu_{\rm pl}, \sigma_{\rm pl})$, the Bayesian scheme returns the mean $\mu_{\rm pl} = 9.95^{+5.58}_{-5.26}$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{\rm pl}=10.89^{+5.14}_{-3.69}$. At a per-pulsar level it returns posterior medians satisfying $-13.86 \leq n_{\rm pl}+\dot{K}_{\rm dim} \leq 30.38$. The secular anomaly dominates the stochastic anomaly, with posterior medians satisfying $|n_{\rm pl} + \dot{K}_{\rm dim}| \geq \sigma_{\rm dim}$ in 10 out of 68 objects.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Milli-Charged Particles with a running electromagnetic coupling constant at IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is assumed that heavy dark matter $\phi$ with O(TeV) mass captured by the Earth may decay to relativistic light milli-charged particles (MCPs). These MCPs could be measured by the IceCube neutrino telescope. The massless hidden photon model was taken for MCPs to interact with nuclei with a running electromagnetic coupling constant, so that the numbers and fluxes of expected MCPs may be evaluated at IceCube. Meanwhile, the numbers of expected neutrino background events were also evaluated at IceCube. Based on the assumption that no events are observed at IceCube in 10 years, the corresponding upper limits on MCP fluxes were calculated at 90\% C. L.. These results indicated that the MCPs from the Earth's core could be directly detected at O(1TeV) energies at IceCube when $5.65\times10^{-5}\lesssim\epsilon^2\lesssim1.295\times10^{-3}$. And a new region of 4 GeV &lt; $m_{MCP}$ &lt; 100 GeV and $5.51\times10^{-2}$ &lt; $\epsilon$ &lt; 0.612 is ruled out in the $m_{MCP}$-$\epsilon$ plane with 10 years of IceCube data.</description>

      <title>The variability of blazars throughout the electromagnetic spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With their jet pointing towards us, blazars are ideal tools to study the physics and structure of extragalactic jets. Their powerful jets are cosmic particle accelerators and are alleged to be one of the production sites of the high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube Observatory. Doppler beaming of the jet nonthermal radiation increases blazar brightness, blue-shifts their emission, and shortens their variability time scales, which are observed to range from years down to minutes. This review will focus on blazar flux, spectral, and polarization variability across the electromagnetic spectrum. Interpretation of blazar variability calls into question both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Shock waves, magnetic reconnection, and turbulence can accelerate particles inside the jet, while jet precession, rotation, and twisting can produce variations in Doppler beaming. Microvariability puts strong constraints on the size of the emitting regions, suggesting a multizone emitting jet. Twisting jets have been proposed to explain the long-term multiwavelength variability. They are supported by radio observations of bent or helical jets, and by results of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of plasma jets. Detection of (quasi)periodic behaviour has been ascribed to orbital motion in black hole binary systems, jet precession, kink instabilities developing inside the jet, or perturbations in the accretion disc. Gravitational microlensing has been suggested to explain blazar behaviour in some cases. Polarization provides information on the structure and behaviour of the magnetic field in the emission zones. Both the degree and angle of polarization can show strong and fast variability, which is sometimes correlated with flux. The interpretation of flux, spectral, and polarization variability within a consistent picture challenges current models of blazar variability.</description>

      <title>Lost and Found - A gallery of overlooked optical nuclear transients from the ZTF archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) correspond to the destruction of a star by the tidal forces around a black hole, leading to outbursts which can last from months to years. These transients are rare, and increasing the current sample is paramount to understand them. As part of the Fink alert broker, we have developed an early detection system for TDEs for the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data. In this paper, we report on the optical transients we found either during the development of this tool, or when applying the classifier to the existing archive. We use this sample to anticipate what improvements to the TDE detection systems will need to be implemented for future surveys. For all the transients, we present optical and infrared archival photometry from ZTF, WISE, and Catalina, and assess the previous nuclear activity of the host. We fit the ZTF lightcurves with both a phenomenological and a physically-motivated model. We report on a total of 19 optical nuclear transients, out of which nine are in passive galaxies, eight in active galaxies, and two for which the activity of the host is uncertain. Two transients are newly discovered repeated TDE candidates, and we compare them to the current sample of repeated optical nuclear transients. One transient is exceptionally long-lived (over 5 years), in an until-now passive galaxy. Three of the TDE-like flares in active galaxies have absolute g-band magnitudes brighter than -24, making them new Extreme Nuclear Transient (ENT) candidates. One seemingly repeated object was revealed to be two independent supernovae in the same galaxy. This sample shows both the potential of our detection system for future discovery, and the relevance of archival searches to reveal overlooked transients. It also raises several points of concern and avenues of improvement for current and future classifiers.</description>

      <title>What do gravitational-wave observations tell us about Luminous Red Novae?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) have been argued to be related to the ejection of common envelopes (CEs) in binary star systems. Ejection of CEs leads to tightened stellar orbits capable of forming compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. As these mergers are seen by gravitational-wave (GW) detectors such as LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA (LVK), we ask what the merger rates of compact binaries in LVK tell us about the fraction of LRNe that lead to the formation of compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. Using the observed volumetric rates of LRNe from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and of compact binary mergers from LVK observations, we derive limits on the fraction of LRNe that produce compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. Assuming the LRNe rate closely follows the star formation rate at any redshift, we use the delay time distribution models for compact binaries to compute the compact binary merger rate. A comparison of this merger rate with the latest volumetric rates of compact binary mergers from the fourth GW transient catalog (GWTC-4) at the present epoch of LVK allows us to constrain the above fraction. We find that only a fraction as small as $\sim 10^{-3}$ (median) of the LRNe correspond to the GW-observed binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. This potentially implies that the majority of the LRNe population will not lead to mergers of compact objects, but other end products, such as stellar mergers.</description>

      <title>Kinematics show consistency between stellar mass and supermassive black hole parent population jet speeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets from stellar-mass and supermassive black holes provide the unique opportunity to study similar processes in two very different mass regimes. Historically, the apparent speeds of black hole x-ray binary (BHXRBs) jets have been observed to be lower than jet speeds from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and specifically blazars. In this work, we show that selection effects could be the primary cause of the observed population differences. For the first time, it is possible to perform a statistical analysis of the underlying BHXRB jet Lorentz factor distribution. We use both the Anderson-Darling test and apply nested sampling to this problem. With Bayes factors, we confirm that the Lorentz factor distribution of BHXRBs is best described with a power law, the same model that has been applied to AGN jets. For a Lorentz factor distribution following $\rm N(\Gamma) \propto \Gamma^b$ we find a value for the exponent of $b=-2.64_{-0.55}^{+0.46}$. This exponent is consistent with values found in AGN population studies, within $1\sigma$ for \textit{Swift}-BAT and \textit{Fermi}-LAT selected AGN. The best-fit exponent for the radio selected MOJAVE sample is just above our $2 \sigma$ limit. This is a remarkable agreement given the different scales at which the jets are observed. The observed slower apparent speeds in BHXRBs are largely due to the much larger inclinations in this sample. Furthermore, nested sampling confirms that $\Gamma_{\rm max}$ is completely unconstrained using this method. Therefore, based on kinematics alone, BHXRB jets are broadly consistent with being just as relativistic as those from supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Limits on GeV-scale WIMP Annihilation in Dwarf Spheroidals with IceCube DeepCore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter is approximately five times more abundant than baryonic matter in the universe, but its physical nature continues to elude physicists. One potential candidate for dark matter is a weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP), which is predicted by various extensions to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. After becoming gravitationally bound in cosmic structures, WIMPs can self-annihilate and produce SM particles including neutrinos, which are observable by detectors like IceCube. We present a search for neutrinos from low-mass $(\leq 300 \, \mathrm{GeV})$ WIMP annihilation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies with over seven years of IceCube livetime. We find no statistically significant evidence of neutrinos produced by WIMP annihilation, and therefore set upper limits on the velocity-averaged annihilation cross section $\left&lt;\sigma v\right&gt;$. Our strongest upper limits at the 90\% confidence level are $\mathcal{O}\!\left(10^{-22} \, \mathrm{{cm}^{3} \, s^{-1}}\right)$ for WIMP annihilation directly into neutrino-antineutrino pairs. For our least sensitive channel, the corresponding limits are $\mathcal{O}\!\left(10^{-20} \, \mathrm{{cm}^{3} \, s^{-1}}\right)$, which is an improvement of over two orders of magnitude over previous IceCube limits from dwarf galaxies at the upper end of our mass range.</description>

      <title>Guesswork in the gap: the impact of uncertainty in the compact binary population on source classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the compact objects within the supposed "lower mass gap" remains uncertain. Observations of GW190814 and GW230529 highlight the challenges gravitational waves face in distinguishing neutron stars from black holes. Interpreting these systems is especially difficult because classifications depend simultaneously on measurement noise, compact binary population models, and equation of state (EOS) constraints on the maximum neutron star mass. We analyze 66 confident events from GWTC-3 to quantify how the probability of a component being a neutron star, P(NS), varies across the population. The effects are substantial, the dominant drivers of classification are the pairing preferences of neutron stars with other compact objects, and the neutron star spin distributions. The data reveals that P(NS) varies between 1% - 67% for GW230529's primary and between 51% - 100% for GW190425's primary. By contrast, P(NS) for GW190814's secondary varies by &lt;10%, demonstrating robustness from its high signal-to-noise ratio and small mass ratio. Analysis using EOS information tends to affect P(NS) through the inferred maximum neutron star mass rather than the maximum spin. As it stands, P(NS) remains sensitive to numerous population parameters, limiting its reliability and potentially leading to ambiguous classifications of future GW events.</description>

      <title>Probing the Formation Environment of Strongly Lensed Black Hole Mergers: Implications for the AGN-disk Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of multiple images from a strongly lensed gravitational wave (GW) source provides the observer with a stereoscopic view of the source. This allows for a measure of its relative proper motion by comparing the induced GW Doppler shifts between the different images. In addition, if the GW source is in a dynamical environment it will be subject to an acceleration, which will show up as a time dependent Doppler shift in each individual image. In this work we quantify for the first time how a joint detection of these effects can be used to constrain the underlying dynamics and environment of the lensed GW source. We consider a range of different astrophysical environments, from massive clusters to stellar triples, and find that binary black hole (BBH) mergers in Active Galactic Nuclei disks (AGN-disks) are particularly likely to have orbital parameters that can be constrained through our considered lensing setup. Applying these methods to the upcoming catalog of cosmologically strongly lensed GW sources will open up new possibilities for probing their origin and underlying formation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray Time Delay and Magnification Ratio in the Gravitationally-Lensed Blazar PKS 1830-211</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the characterization of macrolensing properties of the gravitationally lensed system PKS 1830-211, utilizing data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. While at gamma-rays we can not spatially resolve the lensed images, a macrolensing-induced time pattern is expected in the blazar's lightcurve, resulting from the delay between variable gamma-ray components originating from its two brightest lensed images. Compared to our previous study, here we employ high-quality lightcurves coupled with prolonged outburst activity, and improved time-series techniques. Analyzing six independent data segments, we identified a delay of 20.26 +/- 0.62 days (statistical and stochastic uncertainty), with a chance detection probability at the 2.5 x $10^{-5}$ level (post-trial). We also present a novel approach to the magnification ratio estimate based on a comparison with simulated data. Our work suggests that the gamma-ray flux ratio between the two main lens components is $\mu_{\gamma} \lesssim$ 1.8. We do not observe convincing evidence of microlensing effects, as previously claimed. The measured gamma-ray time delay is in 2-sigma tension with radio-based estimates, suggesting either distinct emission sites, underestimated radio uncertainties, or gamma-ray production in a region opaque to radio. Our study highlights the potential of well sampled lightcurves and advanced time-series techniques to distinguish true lensing-induced delays from stochastic variability. When combined with improved radio constraints and refined lens models, PKS 1830-211 and similar sources constitute promising systems for time-delay cosmography, offering new insights into both jet structure and cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Exploring the universal $\bar{\mathcal{I}}-\mathcal{C}$ relations for relativistic stars in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11296v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of neutron stars within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity by incorporating rotational effects through a slowly rotating metric. We derive the modified TOV equations and calculate the angular velocity profiles and moments of inertia (MOI) for linear, quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic $f(Q)$ models. Our results show that deviations in the MOI are more pronounced than those in the stellar mass profiles, suggesting that rotational observables are highly sensitive to geometric corrections. We also calculate a quasi-universal relation between the dimensionless MOI and compactness ($\bar{I}$-$C$). The linear and quadratic models are generally consistent with observational data from PSR J0737-3039A, although the deviations are small and difficult to distinguish from General Relativity due to inherent EoS variability. On other hand, the logarithmic and exponential models show larger deviations (over 20 %), exceeding the EoS-induced uncertainty reported by Suleiman &amp; Read (2024), highlighting the relation's sensitivity to the $f(Q)$ gravity model. These results indicate that $f(Q)$ gravity could potentially be tested in the strong-field regime and point to a direction for future studies, such as investigating EoS-insensitive quasi-universal relations, like the $\bar{I}(\Lambda)$ relations, within the $f(Q)$ framework. Such relations may provide a clearer pathway for exploring possible signatures in strong-field gravity when combined with more precise future observations.</description>

      <title>Post-Supernova Accretion of Light Elements onto a New-Born Neutron Star and NS 1987A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model early accretion of light elements, He, C, and O, onto a new-born neutron star using the public stellar evolution code MESA, simulating what may happen during the first few years of its life. We find that, under the appropriate conditions, significant amounts of these elements can be accreted up to densities of 10^9 g/cc without triggering a nuclear explosion that would convert them into heavy elements. These results help to understand observations that favor light elements in the atmospheres of young cooling neutron stars, as the one found in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, and also add support to the recent indications for the presence of a neutron star, NS 1987A, in the remnant of SN 1987A.</description>

Abstract: Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) achieves the highest angular resolution in astronomy. VLBI measures corrupted Fourier components, known as visibilities. Reconstructing on-sky images from these visibilities is a challenging inverse problem, particularly for sparse arrays such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), where incomplete sampling and severe calibration errors introduce significant uncertainty in the image. To help guide convergence and control the uncertainty in image reconstructions, regularization on the space of images is utilized, such as enforcing smoothness or similarity to a fiducial image. Coupled with this regularization is the introduction of a new set of parameters that modulate its strength. We present a hierarchical Bayesian imaging approach (Hierarchical Interferometric Bayesian Imaging, HIBI) that enables the quantification of uncertainty for al parameters. Incorporating instrumental effects within HIBI is straightforward, allowing for simultaneous imaging and calibration of data. To showcase HIBI's effectiveness and flexibility, we build a simple imaging model based on Markov random fields and demonstrate how different physical components can be included, e.g., black hole shadow size, and their uncertainties can be inferred. For example, while the original EHT publications were unable to constrain the ring width of M87*, HIBI measures a width of $9.3\pm 1.3\,\mu{\rm as}$. We apply HIBI to image and calibrate EHT synthetic data, real EHT observations of M87*, and multifrequency observations of \oj287. Across these tests, HIBI accurately recovers a wide variety of image structures and quantifies their uncertainties. HIBI is publicly available in the Comrade.jl VLBI software repository.</description>

      <title>WavePID: Studies of DOM-level waveform timing for track vs. cascade discrimination in IceCube at 5-100 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer Cherenkov detector embedded in the Antarctic ice at the South Pole. Its densely instrumented sub-array and dedicated low-energy analyses provide sensitivity to neutrinos in the 5-100 GeV range, enabling precision studies of neutrino oscillations and searches for new physics. This work focuses specifically on this low-energy regime, where sparse hit patterns limit the performance of topology-based reconstruction and classification methods. We introduce Waveform-based Particle Identification (WavePID), a statistically rigorous and interpretable likelihood-ratio discriminator for track-cascade separation, built from Monte Carlo templates in timing-aware, physics-motivated observables and validated through dedicated simulations. Applied to both Monte Carlo and 11.1 years of IceCube data, WavePID suggests improved cascade purity by about 5 percentage points at a fixed 20% down-selection rate relative to the current leading cascade selection, while maintaining Data-MC agreement within detector systematics. The approach is compact and robust to sparse observations, demonstrating the value of waveform-level timing for low-energy reconstruction.</description>

      <title>The Northern High Time Resolution Universe pulsar survey -- II. Single-pulse search set-up and simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) survey is an all-sky survey looking for pulsars and other radio transients. A new single-pulse (SP) search pipeline is presented, tailored to the northern part of the HTRU survey collected with the 100m Effelsberg Radio Telescope. In a selection of this data, synthetic SPs are injected with frequency-time structures resembling those of the detected Fast Radio Burst (FRB) population and processed by the pipeline to characterize its performance. Therefore, several new software toolkits have been developed (FRBfaker and RFIbye) to enable the injection of SPs with complex frequency-time structures and cope with the Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) in the survey's data. The operation of these toolkits is described alongside the overall functionality of the SP pipeline. Qualification of the pipeline confirmed that it is ready to process all the HTRU-North data. Additionally, the survey's sensitivity to SPs, the impact of RFI thereon, the performance of the deep-learning classifier FETCH, and some insights that may be used to improve the pipeline's performance in the future are determined. Within the small data sample analysed, 21 known pulsars and a RRAT are detected. In addition, eight faint SP trains that might originate from yet undiscovered neutron stars and 141 isolated SP candidates were discovered.</description>

      <title>Deep X-ray observation of NGC 3221: everything everywhere all at once</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of 475 ks (438 ks unpublished &amp; 37 ks archival) XMM-Newton/EPIC-pn observation of a nearby, highly inclined, star-forming, luminous infrared galaxy NGC 3221 through spatial, temporal, and spectral information. We confirm the presence of a low-luminosity (presumably Compton-thick) AGN. The 0.4$-$12 keV luminosity and the hardness ratio of the six ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULX) previously identified in Chandra data exhibit diverse variability on day-scale. The collective emission from unresolved sources exhibits a different day-scale variability. We have also discovered two new predominantly soft ($&lt;1$ keV) sources. One of these has an enigmatic spectral shape featuring a soft component, which we interpret as a superbubble in NGC 3221, and a variable hard component from a compact object, which is unresolved from the superbubble. We do not confidently detect any X-ray emission from SN 1961L. The hot gas in the ISM (out to $\pm$6 kpc from the disk plane) and the extraplanar region (6$-$12 kpc) both require two thermal phases at $\sim 0.15$ keV and $\sim 0.55$ keV. The $\sim 0.55$ keV component is fainter in the ISM than the $\sim 0.15$ keV component, but the emission from the latter falls off more steeply with disk height than the former. This makes the extraplanar region hotter and less dense than the ISM. The proximity of NGC 3221 and the occurrence of the underluminous AGN offer a unique observing opportunity to study the hot diffuse medium in conjunction with nuclear and disk-wide point sources.</description>

      <title>Constraint on massive vector field with extreme-mass-ratio inspirals around a slowly rotating black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of a massive vector (Proca) field on the energy fluxes from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) around a slowly rotating Kerr black hole. The secondary compact object, carrying a Proca hair, emits additional dipolar radiation that alters total energy flux relative to general relativity (GR). These modifications induce a secular drift in the orbital evolution of circular geodesic orbits, leading to measurable dephasing in the resulting EMRIs waveforms. By evaluating waveform mismatches between the Einstein-Proca framework and its GR counterpart, we show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can distinguish the signatures of a light Proca field when black hole rotation is included. Furthermore, using a Fisher information matrix analysis, we forecast LISA's capability to place stringent constraints on the Proca mass with EMRIs signal from slowly rotating Kerr black holes. For representative EMRIs configurations, we find that LISA can detect or constrain Proca masses down to $\mu_v\sim 10^{-20}$eV, with typical fractional uncertainties at the level of tens percent, depending on the black-hole spin.</description>

      <title>How Primordial Black Holes Change BBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) provide a powerful probe of early-universe physics, linking inflationary fluctuations to observable cosmological phenomena. In this work, we use a bottom-up approach to study how PBHs with masses in the range $10^{8} \leq M \leq 10^{13}\,\mathrm{g}$ modify Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) through Hawking radiation. We incorporate PBH evaporation into a reaction-network code to evaluate its impact on light-element abundances. Our analysis shows that PBH evaporation acts as an entropy injection mechanism, increasing the comoving entropy density. To reproduce the observed comoving entropy density per baryon $(s/n_{\mathrm{b}})$ from the CMB, BBN simulations must therefore begin with a smaller initial entropy than in the standard scenario without PBHs. The results also reveal a threshold near $M \approx 10^{10}\,\mathrm{g}$ that separates two distinct regimes of BBN behavior. As an example, for $M \geq 10^{10}\,\mathrm{g}$, the $^4{\mathrm{He}}$ mass fraction $Y_{\mathrm{P}}$ increases monotonically with $\beta$, driven by the enhanced Hubble expansion from PBH energy density. In contrast, for $M \leq 10^{10}\,\mathrm{g}$, $Y_{\mathrm{P}}$ exhibits non-monotonic behavior shaped by the timing of PBH evaporation and its influence on nuclear reaction rates. These findings highlight the sensitivity of BBN to PBH evaporation and establish a framework for understanding how PBH populations influence the thermal history of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Disc breaking and parametric instability in warped accretion discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first local simulations of disc breaking/tearing in a warped accretion disc. Warps can arise due to a misalignment between the disc and the rotation axis of the central object, or a misalignment with the orbital plane of a binary (or planetary) companion. Warped discs can break into rings, as found in observations of circumbinary protoplanetary discs and global simulations of tilted discs around spinning black holes. In this work we isolate the mechanism of disc breaking in high-resolution, quasi-2D, local (shearing box), hydrodynamic simulations of a Keplerian disc. We consider the evolution of a free (unforced) warp in the wavelike ($\alpha &lt; H/r$) regime. At large warp amplitudes ($\psi_{\text{max}} \gtrsim 1$) the disc breaks into four rings on timescales of around 20 orbits which are separated by gaps of around $\sim 10H_0$. The warp exhibits a rich tapestry of small-scale dynamics, including horizontal sloshing motions, vertical oscillations or bouncing, warp steepening, and shocks. The shocks act as a source of enhanced dissipation which facilitates gap opening and thus disc breaking. At smaller warp amplitudes $\psi_{\text{max}} \lesssim 1$, for which we also develop a quasi-linear theory, the disc does not break, but instead exhibits hydrodynamic parametric instability. We also investigate the effect of viscosity: at small warp amplitudes the parametric instability is damped and the warp propagates as a pure bending wave, while at large warp amplitudes the emerging gaps are partially filled by viscous diffusion.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fast Radio Transient Detection with Mask R-CNN Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, fast radio transient searches are conducted on dedispersed time series using thresholding techniques based on the statistical properties of the data. However, peaks in dedispersed time series do not directly provide information on the nature of the source. In the DM-time domain, the S/N variation of real, dispersed astrophysical signals forms a characteristic bow tie shape, whereas radio frequency interference (RFI) can take multiple different forms. We have developed a method that bypasses the thresholding step of traditional single-pulse searches in favour of a direct DM-time domain image analysis. The backbone of our pipeline is a Mask R-CNN, a deep learning model designed for object detection, enabling it to identify the bow tie signature and distinguish real sources from RFI. Previous deep learning models often include a snippet of the DM-time domain in their input. We have trained the model on simulated bursts injected on top of real MeerKAT noise observations. We tested the model on MeerKAT follow-up observations of the repeater FRB20240114A and we were able to recover all bursts with a signal-to-noise above the traditional threshold, while detecting two bursts that were fainter. Our new approach considerably reduces the number of candidates above a nominal threshold while being capable of running in real time for typical surveys. We also propose a modified version of the traditional dedispersion plan optimised for this method.</description>

      <title>Black hole binaries in shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity experience a slower merger phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, stationary black holes have a non-vanishing scalar charge. During the inspiral, the phase evolution is modified by several effects, primarily an additional scalar dipole radiation, which enters at -1PN order. This effect accelerates the inspiral when compared to general relativity, when including corrections up to 2PN. Using fully non-linear numerical simulations of quasi-circular, comparable mass binaries, we find that in the late stages the orbital dynamics are altered so that the overall effect is instead a decelerated merger phase for the modified gravity case. We attribute this to a change in the conservative dynamics, and show that at the late inspiral stage more energy must be emitted in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to induce a given change in frequency. In longer signals, this should lead to a distinctive switch between a faster and slower frequency evolution relative to general relativity as the binary approaches merger. This work suggests we should revisit existing constraints on the theory that are obtained assuming PN approximations apply up to merger, or based on order by order approximations that neglect backreaction effects on the metric, and shows the importance of including non-linear effects that modify the gravitational sector in the strong field regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new methodology to explore the morphology of the High Frequency Feature (HFF), i.e., the dominant, rising-frequency GW emission from a proto-neutron star in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). We used a residual neural network (ResNet50) to perform multi-class classification of image samples constructed from time-frequency Morlet wavelet scalograms. We defined a three-class problem by categorizing the HFF slope as Steep, Moderate, or Low, according to physically informed ranges. The ResNet50 model was optimized with phenomenological waveforms injected into real noise from the LIGO-Virgo O3b observing run and then tested with numerically simulated CCSN waveforms embedded in the same real noise. At galactic distances of 1 kpc and 5 kpc with H1 and L1 data and 1 kpc with V1 data, we obtained highly accurate results (test accuracies from 0.8933 to 0.9867), which show the feasibility of our methodology. For further distances, we observed declines in test accuracy until 0.8000 with H1 and L1 data at 10 kpc and until 0.5933 with V1 data at 10 kpc, which we attribute to limitations in the input datasets. Our methodology is sufficiently general to enable early-stage characterization of the HFF in real interferometric data.</description>

Abstract: The interest in blazars as candidate neutrino emitters grew after the 3$\sigma$ evidence for a contemporaneous joint photon and neutrino emission from the flaring blazar TXS 0506+056 in 2017. Blazars, a class of extragalactic sources with relativistic jets pointing toward Earth, present a broadband emission interpretable via leptonic and hadronic processes, the latter relevant for proton acceleration and neutrino production. Several emission models have been developed to explain this multi-messenger observation, but the details of the neutrino production and the nature of TXS 0506+056 are not yet fully understood. In this work we investigate the properties of sources similar to TXS 0506+056. We select a sample of blazars from the Fermi 4LAC-DR2 catalog by constraining a number of key parameters in ranges centered on TXS 0506+056 values. We estimate their disk accretion efficiency and model their spectral energy distribution (SED) in terms of lepto-hadronic emission, gaining information respectively on the potential similarity of their environment with that of TXS 0506+056 and on their neutrino flux and detectability prospects at TeV energies. Our study shows the candidates' high energy emission to be dominated by leptonic processes. Part of them also show a high accretion rate, characteristic of FSRQs. For these sources, the very high energy (VHE) and neutrino fluxes appear undetectable by current and future instruments in an average emission state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17206v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter heating in planets has been proposed as a potential probe for dark matter detection. Assuming near-equilibrium conditions, we find that the energy input from dark matter raises planetary temperatures and accelerates rotation. The distribution of energy between heating and rotational acceleration depends on both planetary properties and external inputs, suggesting that previous studies may have overestimated the heating contribution. At high dark matter densities, planetary rotation stabilizes earlier and becomes primarily governed by dark matter effects.</description>

      <title>The Compton-Getting origin of the large-scale anisotropy of Galactic cosmic rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the anisotropy in cosmic-ray arrival directions can provide insight into local acceleration sites and propagation conditions. We developed a unified framework to interpret both the observed energy spectra and the large-scale anisotropy. In this work, we explore the influence of the Sun's motion relative to the local plasma frame - the Compton-Getting (CG) effect - on the anisotropy. We find that incorporating the CG effect could slightly reduce the dipole amplitude and shift the phase away from the direction of the local regular magnetic field at tens of TeV. At lower energies, where the anisotropy from the cosmic-ray density gradient is weak, the Sun's relative motion becomes more prominent. Below $\sim 200$ GeV, the dipole amplitude increases again, approaching the value expected from the CG effect. Additionally, a phase flip is observed at a few hundred GeV, aligning with the CG direction. Future anisotropy measurements from $100$ GeV to TeV energies could serve as a critical test of this effect.</description>

Gamma-ray maps within the region of interest ($|l| \le 60^\circ$, $10^\circ \le |b| \le 60^\circ$) are modeled using point sources, the GALPROP models of cosmic-ray interactions, isotropic background, and templates of Loop I and the Fermi bubbles, and then the presence of a halo-like component is further examined. A statistically significant halo-like excess is found with a spectral peak around 20 GeV, while its flux is consistent with zero below 2 GeV and above 200 GeV. Examination of the fit residual maps indicates that a spherically symmetric halo component fits the map data well. The radial profile agrees with annihilation by the smooth NFW density profile, and may be slightly shallower than this, especially in the central region. Various systematic uncertainties are investigated, but the 20 GeV peak remains significant. In particular, the halo excess with a similar spectrum is detected even relative to the LAT standard background model, which contains non-template patches adjusted to match the observed map. The halo excess spectrum can be fitted by annihilation with a particle mass $m_\chi \sim$ 0.5-0.8 TeV and cross section $\langle \sigma \upsilon \rangle \sim$ (5-8)$\times 10^{-25} \ \rm cm^3 \, s^{-1}$ for the $b\bar{b}$ channel. This cross section is larger than the upper limits from dwarf galaxies and the canonical thermal relic value, but considering various uncertainties, especially the density profile of the MW halo, the dark matter interpretation of the 20 GeV ``Fermi halo'' remains feasible. The prospects for verification through future observations are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>MUSE IFU observations of galaxies hosting of Tidal Disruption Events</title>

Abstract: We present an analysis of twenty tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies observed with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph on ESO VLT. We investigate the presence of extended emission line regions (EELRs) and study stellar populations mostly at sub-kpc scale around the host nuclei. EELRs are detected in 5/20 hosts, including two unreported systems. All EELRs are found at z&lt;0.045, suggesting a distance bias and faint EELRs may be missed at higher redshift. EELRs only appear in post-merger systems and all such hosts at z&lt;0.045 show them. Thus, we conclude that TDEs and galaxy mergers have a strong relation, and &gt;45% of post-merger hosts in the sample exhibit EELRs. Furthermore, we constrained the distributions of stellar masses near the central black holes (BHs), using the spectral synthesis code Starlight and BPASS stellar evolution models. The youngest nuclear populations have typical ages of 1 Gyr and stellar masses below 2.5MSun. The populations that can produce observable TDEs around non-rotating BHs are dominated by subsolar-mass stars. 3/4 TDEs requiring larger stellar masses exhibit multi-peaked light curves, possibly implying relation to repeated partial disruptions of high-mass stars. The found distributions are in tension with the masses of the stars derived using light curve models. Mass segregation of the disrupted stars can enhance the rate of TDEs from supersolar-mass stars but our study implies that low-mass TDEs should still be abundant and even dominate the distribution, unless there is a mechanism that prohibits low-mass TDEs or their detection.</description>

Abstract: Galaxy mergers are among the most energetic astrophysical phenomena, driving intense star formation and potentially fueling cosmic ray acceleration, which can produce high energy $\gamma$-ray emission through hadronic processes. We present a targeted search for $\gamma$-ray emission from five prominent galaxy merger systems, NGC~3256, NGC~660, UGC~813/816, UGC~12914/12915, and VV~114 using 16.9 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 1--300~GeV energy range. Employing a binned maximum likelihood analysis, we model the emission with power-law spectra and derive spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to constrain $\gamma$-ray fluxes and spectral indices. Marginal detections are found for NGC~3256 (TS = 15.4, $\sim$3.51$\sigma$) and NGC~660 (TS = 8.16, $\sim$2.39$\sigma$), with photon fluxes of $(7.21 \pm 3.17) \times 10^{-11}$ and $(8.28 \pm 3.56) \times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively, suggesting merger driven star formation contributes to $\gamma$-ray emission. The remaining systems yield non-detections (TS $&lt; 5$). This is the first targeted study of $\gamma$-ray emission from these aforementioned galaxy merger systems.</description>

      <title>Machine learning classification of black holes in the mass--spin diagram</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14316v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the mass--spin diagram for classifying black holes and studying their formation pathways providing an analogue to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion through cosmic time or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the mass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly overlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the mass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Cosmic Ray Transport in strong MHD Turbulence due to Magnetic Mirroring and Resonant Curvature Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of cosmic rays through turbulent astrophysical plasmas still constitutes an open problem. Building on recent progress, we study the combined effect of magnetic mirroring and resonant curvature scattering on parallel and perpendicular transport. We conduct test-particle simulations in snapshots of an anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics simulation with $\delta B/B_0\sim 1$ and record magnetic moment variation and field line curvature around pitch-angle reversals. We find for strongly magnetized particles that (i) pitch-angle reversals may occur either in coherent regions of the field with small variation of the magnetic moment via magnetic mirroring or in chaotic regions of the field with strong variation of the magnetic moment via resonant curvature scattering; (ii) parallel transport can be modeled as a L\'evy walk with a truncated power-law distribution based on pitch-angle reversal times; and (iii) perpendicular transport is enhanced by resonant curvature scattering in synergy with chaotic field line separation and diminished by magnetic mirroring due to confinement in locally ordered field line bundles. While magnetic mirroring constitutes the bulk of reversal events, resonant curvature scattering additionally acts on trajectories that fall in the loss cones of typical mirroring structures and thus provides the cut-off for the reversal time distribution. Our results, which highlight the role of the magnetic field line geometry in cosmic-ray transport processes, are consistent with energy-independent diffusion coefficients. We conclude by considering how energy-dependent observations could arise from an intermittently inhomogeneous interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Particle acceleration at radiative supernova remnant shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous astrophysical shock waves evolve in an environment where the radiative cooling behind the shock affects the hydrodynamical structure downstream, thereby influencing the potential for particle acceleration via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA).
  We study the possibility for DSA to energize particles from the thermal pool and from pre-existing cosmic rays at radiative shocks, focusing on the case of supernova remnants (SNRs). We rely on a semi-analytical description of particle acceleration at collisionless shocks in the test-particle limit, estimating the total proton and electron content from SNRs throughout the radiative phase. Our results indicate that DSA can lead to significant particle acceleration during the first few tens of kyrs of the radiative phase. Although the associated multi-wavelength emission from SNRs in the radiative phase may not be detectable with current observatories in most cases, the radiative phase is found to lead to substantial deviations from the canonical p$^{-4}$ of the test-particle limit. The hardening/steepening is due to an interplay between a growing contribution of the reaccelerated term as the SNR volume expands and the effects of adiabatic and radiative losses on trapped particles as particles are confined for a longer time. The slope of the cumulative proton and electron spectra over the SNR lifetime thus depends on the environment in which the SNR shock propagates, and on the duration of the radiative phase during which DSA can take place. Overall, DSA in the radiative phase can lead to a total electron spectrum steeper than the proton spectrum, both at SNRs from thermonuclear and core-collapse SNe. Finally, we comment on the case of young radiative SNRs (in the first month to a few years after the explosion) for which the denser environments (with mass-loss rates of $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-1} - 1$ M$_{\odot}$/yr) tend to inhibit DSA.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Very High Energy Gamma-Ray Absorption in Cosmic Propagation under the Combined Effects of Axion-Like Particles and Lorentz Violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very high energy (VHE) gamma rays with energies above 100 GeV are expected to experience strong attenuation during cosmic propagation due to pair production with the extragalactic background light (EBL). However, recent observations-particularly the detection of GRB 221009A with photons up to 18 TeV by LHAASO and a 300 TeV photon by Carpet-3,pose a significant challenge to conventional EBL absorption models. These extraordinarily high-energy photons suggest the presence of new physics influencing photon propagation over cosmological distances. The gamma-ray spectrum in the tens-to-hundreds of TeV range provides a powerful probe of possible Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) or photon-axion-like particle (ALP) mixing in cosmic magnetic fields. Yet, when treated independently, neither LIV nor ALPs can fully explain the observed transparency of the Universe to VHE gamma rays. In this work, we propose a unified framework that combines both effects-ALPs and LIV-to account for the unexpectedly high survival probability of VHE photons. We analyze the multi-wavelength spectrum of GRB 221009A under this hybrid model and demonstrate that the combined influence of ALPs, characterized by a coupling constant $g_{a\gamma} = 1.685 \times 10^{-10},\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ and mass ($m_a = 9.545 \times 10^{-8},\mathrm{eV}$) alongside second-order LIV characterized by an energy scale $E_{\rm LIV,2} = (1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56}) \times 10^{-7} E_{\rm Pl}$ adopted from the literature, significantly enhances the photon survival probability across the 10-300 TeV range. This synergistic ALP-LIV model provides a coherent explanation for the observed extreme-energy transparency of the Universe and the delayed arrival of ultra-high-energy photons, offering valuable insights into physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>The Type Ia Supernova 2021hem: A 2003fg-like Event in an Apparently Hostless Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report observations of Type Ia SN 2021hem, located in an apparently hostless environment. With a peak absolute B-band magnitude of -19.96 mag, and a lack of secondary maximum in near-infrared and i-band light curves make it resemble 2003fg-like events. The slowly evolving light curves, and the earliest spectrum showing CII absorption lines, further support this classification. Fireball model fit to early light curves yields a time of first light of -16.43 days relative to B-band maximum. The first detection occurs 1.51 days before the onset of the fireball-like flux rise. This early emission, and $(g - r)_0$ color, is inconsistent with circumstellar or companion interaction. Instead, shallow $^{56}$Ni mixing or an asymmetric $^{56}$Ni distribution offers a plausible explanation. SN2021hem is the fifth known 2003fg-like SN with early-time excess flux emission. The estimated mass of radioactive $^{56}$Ni in SN2021hem is $1.00\pm0.09 M_\odot$. Deep GTC imaging obtained 2.5 yr after the explosion (with $m_{lim,r}=24.4$ mag and $\mu_{lim,r} = 26.3\rm~mag~arsec^{-2}$), reveals no coincident host, thereby ruling out most faint dwarf and UDGs. Alternatively, assuming the nearest plausible AGN host galaxy, at a distance of 104 kpc, implies a hyper-velocity progenitor ejected at $\sim$2200 km/s by AGN interaction. A faint diffuse feature ~6 kpc from the SN site has also been detected in the image, with its surface brightness of a UDGs. However, it is unclear whether it is a galaxy and is associated with SN2021hem. Considering its large normalized directional light distance ($d_{DLR}\sim3-4$) from SN, and its unusual elongation, it is a candidate of low probability to be the host galaxy of SN2021hem. These results identify SN2021hem as one of the strongest candidates for a hostless SN Ia, underscoring the diversity of luminous, slowly evolving, 2003fg-like explosions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs have the potential to evolve into a variety of explosive transients. These systems could also explain hypervelocity runaway stars such as US 708. We use the detailed binary evolution code MESA to evolve hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars interacting in binaries. We explore their evolution towards double detonation supernovae, helium novae, or double white dwarfs. Our grid of 3120 models maps from initial conditions such as orbital period and masses of hot subdwarf and white dwarf to these outcomes. The minimum amount of helium required to ignite the helium shell that leads to a double detonation supernova in our grid is $\approx 0.05 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, likely too large to produce spectra similar to normal type Ia supernovae, but compatible with inferred helium shell masses from some observed peculiar type I supernovae. We also provide the helium shell masses for our double white dwarf systems, with a maximum He shell mass of $\approx 0.18\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. In our double detonation systems, the orbital velocity of the surviving donor star ranges from $\approx 450 \, \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ to $\approx 1000 \, \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Among the surviving donors, we also estimate the runaway velocities of proto-white dwarfs, which have higher runaway velocities than hot subdwarf stars of the same mass. Our grid will provide a first-order estimate of the potential outcomes for the observation of binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs from future missions like Gaia, LSST, and LISA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations in ultralight dark matter produce significant metric perturbations, which may be detected by monitoring the arrival times of light from millisecond pulsars. While searches using this technique are already underway, they do not consistently account for the statistical properties of the dark matter field. The statistics of this field depend on the velocity dispersion of dark matter and, consequently, its coherence length. In the mass range relevant for pulsar timing arrays, the coherence length is comparable to separations between pulsars, making it crucial to incorporate its effects into the analysis. This work presents a consistent statistical method for gravitational direct detection of ultralight dark matter. Our key result is the derivation of the two-point function of the metric fluctuations, which we apply to pulsar timing and discuss its implementation in future searches.</description>

      <title>Accounting for the Known Unknowns: A Parametric Framework to Incorporate Systematic Waveform Errors in Gravitational-Wave Parameter Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The PE for GW merger events relies on a waveform model calibrated using numerical simulations. Within the Bayesian framework, this waveform model represents the GW signal produced during the merger and is crucial for estimating the likelihood function. However, these waveform models may possess systematic errors that can differ across the parameter space. Addressing these errors in the current data analysis pipeline is an active area of research. We introduce parametrizations for the uncertainties in the amplitude and phase of the reference waveform model. When the error budget in the amplitude and phase of the waveform model, as a function of frequency, is known, it can be used as a prior distribution in the Bayesian framework. We also show that conservative priors can be used to quantify uncertainties in waveform modeling without any knowledge of waveform uncertainty error budgets. Through zero-noise injections and PE recoveries, we demonstrate that even 1%-2% of errors in relative phase to the actual waveform model, for a GW150914-like signal and advanced LIGO detector sensitivity, can introduce biases in the recovered parameters. These biases can be corrected when we account for waveform uncertainties within the PE framework. By analyzing a series of simulated signals from mergers with precessing orbits and recovering them using a non-spinning waveform model, we demonstrate that we can reduce the ratio of systematic errors to statistical errors. This approach allows us to address scenarios where specific physical effects are missing in waveform modeling. The code that implements our parametrization for performing PE is available as a Python package "pycbc_wferrors_plugin", compatible with the PyCBC open source GW analysis library.</description>

      <title>Over-Luminous Type Ia Supernovae and Standard Candle Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe\,Ia) serve as crucial cosmological distance indicators because of their empirical consistency in peak luminosity and characteristic light curve decline rates. These properties facilitate them to be standardized candles for the determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) within late-time universe cosmology. Nevertheless, a statistically significant difference persists between $H_0$ values derived from early and late-time measurements, a phenomenon known as the Hubble tension. Furthermore, recent observations have identified a subset of over-luminous SNe\,Ia, characterized by peak luminosities exceeding the nominal range and faster decline rates. These discoveries raise questions regarding the reliability of SNe\,Ia as standard candles for measuring cosmological distances. In this article, we present the Bayesian analysis of 15 over-luminous SNe\,Ia and show that they yield a lower $H_0$ estimate due to the increase in their absolute magnitude. This investigation potentially represents a step toward addressing the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Frequency contamination from new fundamental fields in black hole ringdowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the modelling of black hole ringdown beyond General Relativity (GR), emphasizing the limitations of approaches that rely solely on shifted quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies. Starting from modified Teukolsky equations in such scenarios, we classify the distinct types of deviations that can arise -- those shifting QNM frequencies, and those introducing additional frequencies associated with extra fields. We then construct the most general ansatz for metric perturbations in this context and discuss its implications for QNM modelling and theory-agnostic tests of GR using gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Radial and Non-Radial Oscillations of Protoneutron Stars with Hyperonic Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores radial and non-radial oscillations of protoneutron stars (PNSs) as they evolve from hot, neutrino-rich configurations through deleptonization to cold, catalyzed states. The equation of state (EoS) is modeled using a density-dependent relativistic mean-field framework, with stellar evolution characterized by changes in entropy and lepton fraction. Both nucleonic and hyperonic compositions are considered. Non-radial $f$- and $p_1$-mode oscillations are computed using both the Cowling approximation and the full General Relativistic framework. Trapped neutrinos initially increase the error in the Cowling approximation for $f$-modes, which decreases during deleptonization and rises again in the cold phase. In contrast, $p_1$-mode errors peak during intermediate stages due to evolving pressure and density gradients. The emergence of hyperons modestly raises oscillation frequencies in both modes. Existing universal relations for $f$-mode frequency and damping time lack model independence for PNSs, motivating a more robust relation. In particular, our proposed universal relation involving the moment of inertia and $\tilde{\eta}$ shows strong agreement across all evolutionary phases, offering a temperature-sensitive, model-independent scaling for asteroseismology. Radial oscillations of a $1.4\,M_\odot$ PNS are also studied for different EoSs. Our results show that displacement ($\xi$) and pressure perturbation ($\eta$) profiles are highly sensitive to thermal state, composition, and compactness. Hyperonic stars show higher frequencies, altered node structures, and stronger pressure perturbations due to EoS softening. Differences in frequency separation $\Delta \nu_n$ and fundamental frequency $\nu_0$ between nucleonic and hyperonic models provide clear observational diagnostics for probing the interiors of PNSs and constraining the EoS of dense matter.</description>

      <title>New models of nonsingular black hole dark matter from limiting curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider phenomenological models for nonsingular black holes that satisfy the limiting curvature condition (i.e., that have curvatures that are always sub-Planckian in size) while having a more general dependence on the black hole mass than the most studied examples. These models allow black holes to exist while having regulators that are larger than the horizon scale; it has been shown previously that this can lead to observable consequences in an astrophysical setting, for allowed choices for the regulator scale. Noting that substantial horizon-scale modifications of the metric will affect black hole thermodynamics and Hawking radiation, we study these metrics in the context of primordial black hole dark matter. Considering examples with de\,Sitter and Minkowski cores, respectively, we study the effect of the regulator in these metrics on the allowed black hole mass ranges (or ``bands"), the black hole temperature, specific heat and lifetime, and the bounds on the primordial black hole fraction of the total dark matter density from the observed extragalactic gamma ray background.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic stability of superflows in General Relativity and Newtonian gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Landau's criterion for superfluidity is a special case of a broader principle: A moving fluid cannot be stopped by frictional forces if its state of motion is a local minimum of the grand potential. We employ this general thermodynamic criterion to derive a set of inequalities that any superfluid mixture (with an arbitrary number of order parameters) must satisfy for a certain state of motion to be long-lived and unimpeded by friction. These macroscopic constraints complement Landau's original criterion, in that they hold at all temperatures, and remain valid even for gapless superfluids. Unfortunately, they are only necessary conditions for the existence of a frictionless hydrodynamic motion, since they presuppose the validity of a fluid description. However, they do provide sufficient conditions for stability against stochastic hydrodynamic fluctuations. We first formulate our analysis within the framework of General Relativity, and then we take the Newtonian limit.</description>

      <title>Transition to Petschek Reconnection in Subrelativistic Pair Plasmas: Implications for Particle Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While relativistic magnetic reconnection in pair plasmas has emerged in recent years as a candidate for the origin of radiation from extreme astrophysical environments, the corresponding subrelativistic pair plasma regime has remained less explored, leaving open the question of how relativistic physics affects reconnection. In this paper, we investigate the differences between these regimes by contrasting 2D particle-in-cell simulations of reconnection in pair plasmas with relativistic magnetization ($\sigma \gg 1$) and subrelativistic magnetization ($\sigma &lt; 1$). By utilizing unprecedentedly large domain sizes and outflow boundary conditions, we demonstrate that lowering the magnetization results in a change in the reconnection geometry from a plasmoid chain to a Petschek geometry, where laminar exhausts bounded by slow-mode shocks emanate from a single diffusion region. We attribute this change to the reduced plasmoid production rate in the low-$\sigma$ case: when the secondary tearing rate is sufficiently low, plasmoids are too few in number to prevent the system from relaxing into a stable Petschek configuration. This geometric change also affects particle energization: we show that while high-$\sigma$ plasmoid chains generate power-law energy spectra, low-$\sigma$ Petschek exhausts merely heat incoming plasma and yield negligible nonthermal acceleration. These results have implications for predicting the global current sheet geometry and the resulting energy spectrum in a variety of systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of reactor antineutrinos on the neutrino floor in low-mass WIMP-like dark matter searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of conventional direct dark matter searches for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) is ultimately limited by coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), which produces nuclear recoils indistinguishable from WIMP signals and defines the so-called neutrino floor. While the effects of solar neutrinos, geoneutrinos, diffuse supernova neutrinos, and atmospheric neutrinos have been extensively studied in this context, the contribution from reactor antineutrinos has received comparatively little attention. We present the first systematic evaluation of how reactor antineutrino fluxes, modeled as a function of reactor-detector distance, modify the neutrino floor for low-mass WIMP searches using SuperCDMS-like high-voltage germanium detectors. Both discovery-limit and opacity-based formulations of the neutrino floor are examined under consistent assumptions. We find that proximity to gigawatt-scale reactors within 10 km can raise the neutrino floor by up to a few orders of magnitude, significantly reducing the sensitivity to sub-10 GeV/c^2 dark matter. Beyond 100 km, the reactor contribution becomes negligible. These conclusions hold for both definitions of the neutrino floor and remain stable under reasonable variations in detector quenching, site-dependent geoneutrino flux, and reactor antineutrino flux uncertainties, emphasizing reactor proximity as a critical factor in site selection for future low-threshold dark matter experiments.</description>
