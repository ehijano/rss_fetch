      <title>Equivalent circuit modeling of electron-hole recombination in semiconductor and mixed ionic-electronic conductor based devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The understanding and optimization of solar energy conversion and light emitting devices can greatly benefit from equivalent circuit models describing their response. However, a general model of electron-hole recombination in semiconductors is currently missing. This study presents equivalent circuit models of radiative and non-radiative electron-hole recombination based on their linearized analytical treatment. These are integrated in a circuit model of complete devices that is equivalent to the linearized drift-diffusion equations in one dimension. The analysis shows that, for most situations involving semiconductors without mobile ions, approximated models that do not account for local electrostatics are sufficient to describe non-radiative recombination. The influence of local electrostatics becomes essential in mixed conducting devices, and it should be included explicitly in equivalent circuit models. Recombination resistors used for traditional semiconductors are indeed a special case of the general model, for which transistors implement a more accurate representation. For mixed conducting devices, such as hybrid metal-halide perovskite solar cells, appropriate simplifications of the complete model provide analytical solutions describing the bulk and interfacial polarization effects that influence local electrostatics, recombination currents and overall impedance. The resulting analysis is relevant for a wide range of materials and devices used for solar energy conversion as well as other optoelectronic and photo-electrochemical applications.</description>

      <title>Scanning Acoustic Microscopy for Quantifying Two-phase Transfer in Operando Alkaline Water Electrolyzer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improved understandings of two-phase transport in electrochemical gas-evolving systems are increasingly demanded, while high-performance imaging techniques using simplified instrumentations are not readily available. This work presents volumetric scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) imaging for quantifying the dynamics of gas bubbles and electrolyte in porous Nickel electrodes with different wettability and structures during alkaline water electrolysis (AWE). We realize high-resolution 3D imaging at 10's um level using high frequency spherically focused ultrasound. The high resolution allowed us to clearly visualize the spatial distributions of produced bubbles in the porous electrodes over time. Moreover, we are able to quantify the residual gas volume in an electrode and its coverage due to bubble evolution, which dominate its transport overpotential. Taking these advantages, we elucidate the impacts of electrodes' wettability and structures on their electrolysis performance, on a regular laboratory base. The obtained knowledge provides us important optimization guidelines of AWE designs and operating schemes.</description>

      <title>Review on physical impedance models in perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significant advancements in perovskite solar cell (PSC) research and development have reignited optimism for the practicality of solar energy. A deeper comprehension of the fundamental mechanisms is essential for enhancing the current solar technology. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) characterization, in conjunction with other analytical methods, stands out as the primary approach for gaining insights into the internal workings of solar cells. The continuous analysis and refinement of electrochemical spectroscopy data for PSCs have unveiled intricate operational details. Despite the ongoing improvements, the absence of a centralized repository for this information poses challenges for tracking progress effectively. This review paper aims to consolidate the physical phenomena behind the development of PSC research, aiming to establish a comprehensive knowledge base on impedance plots, equivalent circuits, and related processes.</description>

      <title>Memristive response and neuromorphic functionality of polycrystalline ferroelectric Ca:HfO$_{2}$-based devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristors are considered key building blocks for the development of neuromorphic computing hardware. For ferroelectric memristors with a capacitor-like structure, the polarization direction modulates the height of the Schottky barriers -- present at ferroelectric/metal interfaces -- that control the device resistance. Here, we unveil the coexistence of multiple memristive mechanisms in Pt/Ca:HfO$_2$/Pt devices fabricated on silicon by a simple and effective low-toxicity chemical solution method. Depending on the fabrication conditions, either dielectric or ferroelectric devices are obtained, each one presenting a distinct memristive response. The devices are forming-free and can sustain ferroelectric switching and memristive behavior simultaneously. Aided by numerical simulations, we describe this behavior as a competition of different mechanisms, including the effect of the ferroelectric polarization on Schottky interfaces and oxygen vacancy electromigration. Finally, we propose a simple learning algorithm for time-series recognition, designed to take advantage of the resistance relaxations present in the case of the ferroelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Cosmic rays for imaging cultural heritage objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cultural heritage conservation, it is increasingly common to rely on non-destructive imaging methods based on the absorption or scattering of photons ($X$ or $\gamma$ rays) or neutrons. However, physical and practical issues limit these techniques: their penetration depth may be insufficient for large and dense objects, they require transporting the objects of interest to dedicated laboratories, artificial radiation is hazardous and may induce activation in the material under study. Muons are elementary particles abundantly and freely produced in cosmic-ray interactions in the atmosphere. Their absorption and scattering in matter are characteristically dependent on the density and elemental composition of the material that they traverse, which offers the possibility of exploiting them for sub-surface remote imaging. This novel technique, nicknamed "muography", has been applied in use cases ranging from geophysics to archaeology to nuclear safety, but it has been so far under-explored for a vast category of cultural heritage objects that are relatively large (from decimeters to human size) and dense (stone, metals). The development of portable muon detectors makes muography particularly competitive in cases where the items to be analysed are not transportable, or set up in a confined environment. This document reviews the relevant literature, presents some exemplary use cases, and critically assesses the strengths and weaknesses of muography in this context.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-enabled non-orthogonal four-output polarization splitter for non-redundant full-Stokes imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging polarimetry plays an essential role in various fields since it imparts rich information that cannot be obtained through mere intensity and spectral measurements. To retrieve full Stokes parameters, at least four sensor pixels are required, each of which projects incident light to a different polarization state in the Stokes space. Conventional full-Stokes division-of-focal-plane (DoFP) cameras realize this function by integrating angled polarizers and retarders on top of image sensors. Due to the inevitable absorption at the polarizers, however, the maximum efficiency of these schemes is limited to 50% in theory. Instead of polarizers, three sets of lossless polarization beam splitters can be used to achieve higher-efficiency polarimetry, however, at the cost of reduced spatial resolution due to the need for six redundant sensor pixels. In this paper, we reveal, for the first time to our knowledge, that low-loss four-output polarization splitting (without filtering) is possible using a single-layer dielectric metasurface. Although these four states are not orthogonal to each other, our metasurface enables simultaneous sorting and focusing onto four sensor pixels with an efficiency exceeding 50\%, which is not feasible by a simple combination of space-optic components. The designed metasurface composed of silicon nanoposts is fabricated to experimentally demonstrate complete retrieval of full Stokes parameters at the near-infrared wavelength range from 1500 to 1600 nm with $-$2.28-dB efficiency. Finally, simple imaging polarimetry is demonstrated using a 3$\times$4 superpixel array.</description>

      <title>Hyper-doping of Silicon for Plasmonics in the Telecommunication Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate hyper-doping, a promising approach to introduce a high concentration of impurities into silicon beyond its solid solubility limit, for its potential applications in near-infrared plasmonics. We systematically explore the incorporation of dopants into silicon using ion implantation and pulsed laser melting annealing processes. Reflectance spectra analysis shows an achievable plasma wavelength of around 1.5 $\mu$m for dopant concentrations exceeding 4 at.%. Complex refractive index data for the doped silicon samples are extracted, revealing their potential for near-infrared plasmonic applications. Moreover, we propose a fabrication process that allows for the creation of hyper-doped silicon nanoparticles without the need for additional masking steps. Our research paves the way for designing CMOS-compatible plasmonic nanostructures operating in the telecommunication wavelength range. The study's findings offer significant insights into the utilization of hyper-doped silicon for advanced photonic and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Single-antenna super-resolution positioning with nonseparable toroidal pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental principle of satellite or node-based positioning involves triangulating the receiver's coordinates through the intersection of spatial distances. Recent advancements in hybrid wireless networks have yielded high-precision positioning at decimetre-level (wavelength-level) (Nature 611, 473-478 (2022)), approaching the resolution limits in free space. Here, we present a three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution positioning paradigm in free space by utilizing a novel kind of topologically structured pulses, toroidal electromagnetic pulses (Nat. Photonics 16(7), 523-528 (2022); Sci. Adv. 10(2), eadl1803 (2024)). Excited by the recent compact generator of toroidal pulses and their sophisticated topological and nonseparable structures, we demonstrate that the space-time nonseparability and skyrmion topology inherent in toroidal pulses can be harnessed to achieve freespace microwave 3D positioning with super-resolution accuracy, reaching the centimeter level, using a single emitting antenna. This work opens up new avenues for exploring the potential applications of topological electromagnetic pulses including but not limited to positioning, imaging, and sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>A matter of performance &amp; criticality: a review of rare-earth-based magnetocaloric intermetallic compounds for hydrogen liquefaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low efficiency of conventional liquefaction technologies based on the Joule-Thomson expansion makes liquid hydrogen currently not attractive enough for large-scale energy-related technologies that are important for the transition to a carbon-neutral society. Magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction has great potential to achieve higher efficiency and is therefore a crucial enabler for affordable liquid hydrogen. Cost-effective magnetocaloric materials with large magnetic entropy and adiabatic temperature changes in the temperature range of 77 $\sim$ 20 K under commercially practicable magnetic fields are the foundation for the success of magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction. Heavy rare-earth-based magnetocaloric intermetallic compounds generally show excellent magnetocaloric performances, but the heavy rare-earth elements (Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm) are highly critical in resources. Yttrium and light rare-earth elements (La, Ce, Pr, and Nd) are relatively abundant, but their alloys generally show less excellent magnetocaloric properties. A dilemma appears: higher performance or lower criticality? In this review, we study how cryogenic temperature influences magnetocaloric performance by first reviewing heavy rare-earth-based intermetallic compounds. Next, we look at light rare-earth-based, "mixed" rare-earth-based, and Gd-based intermetallic compounds with the nature of the phase transition order taken into consideration, and summarize ways to resolve the dilemma.</description>
