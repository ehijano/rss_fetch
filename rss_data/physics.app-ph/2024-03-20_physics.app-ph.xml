      <title>Interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in synthetic ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The antisymmetric interlayer exchange interaction, i.e., interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (IL-DMI) has attracted significant interest since this long-range chiral spin interaction provides a new dimension for controlling spin textures and dynamics. However, the role of IL-DMI in the field induced and spin-orbit torque (SOT) induced switching of synthetic ferrimagnets (SFi) has not been uncovered. Here, we exploit interlayer chiral exchange bias fields in SFi to address both the sign and magnitude of the IL-DMI. Depending on the degree of imbalance between the two magnetic moments of the SFi, the amount of asymmetry, addressed via loop shifts of the hysteresis loops under an in-plane field reveals a unidirectional and chiral nature of the IL-DMI. The devices are then tested with SOT switching experiments and the process is examined via both transient state and steady state detection. In addition to field-free SOT switching, we find that the combination of IL-DMI and SOT give rise to multi-resistance states, which provides a possible direction for the future design of neuromorphic computing devices based on SOT. This work is a step towards characterizing and understanding the IL-DMI for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Water Aging Effects on Graphene Nanoplatelets and Multi-walled Carbon Nanotube Reinforced Epoxy Glass Fiber Nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanocomposites reinforced with hybrid fillers of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) were developed, aimed at improving electrical and morphological properties of the hybrid nanocomposites while reducing the cost of the final product. GNPs and MWCNTs nanofillers have shown improved electrical and morphological properties with most polymers. In this work, the effect of short-term water aging for 1440 h on MCWNTs and GNPs reinforced epoxy glass fiber nanocomposites was studied. Epoxy nanocomposites were prepared with varying combinations of MCWNTs and GNPs (2:1, 2:2, and 2:3wt. %) as conducting fillers and their electrical conductivity was evaluated after short-term water aging. It was shown that the addition of MCWNTs and GNPs enhanced the electrical conductivity of composites: A low percolation threshold was achieved with 2 wt. % MCWNTs and 3 wt. % GNPs. The addition of MCWNTs enhanced the electrical conductivity and dielectric constant, confirming the synergistic effect of CNTs as multifunctional filler. Microstructural investigations and morphology of nanocomposites were investigated using Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The novelty of this work arises from the combination of two conducting fillers with different geometry and aspect ratios as well as different dispersion characteristics. The results obtained from the electrical measurements after water aging on hybrid nanocomposites indicates slight increases in electrical conductivity.</description>

      <title>Modeling RIS from Electromagnetic Principles to Communication Systems--Part I: Synthesis and Characterization of a Scalable Anomalous Reflector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to build connections between the electromagnetic and communication aspects of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) by proposing a methodology to combine outputs from electromagnetic RIS design into an RIS-tailored system-level simulator and a ray tracer. In this first part of the contribution, a periodic anomalous reflector is designed using an algebraic array antenna scattering synthesis technique that enables electromagnetically accurate modeling of scattering surfaces with both static and reconfigurable scattering characteristics. The multi-mode periodic structure, capable of scattering into several anomalous angles through manipulation of reactive loads, is then cropped into finite-sized arrays, and the quantization effects of the load reactances on the array scattering are analyzed. An experimental anomalous reflector is demonstrated with a comparison between simulated and measured scattering performance. In the second part, the simulated receiving and transmitting scattering patterns of the anomalous reflector are utilized to build an electromagnetically consistent path loss model of an RIS into a system-level simulator. Large-scale fading is analyzed in simple scenarios of RIS-assisted wireless networks to verify the communication model, and an indoor scenario measurement using the manufactured anomalous reflector sample to support the simulation analysis. After verifying the connections between electromagnetic and communication aspects through simulations and measurements, the proposed communication model can be used for a broad range of RIS designs to perform large-scale system-level and ray-tracing simulations in realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Role of Helium Bubbles and Voids on the Property of Nanocrystalline Tungsten</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript embarks on an inquiry into the influence of helium implantation on nanocrystalline tungsten, a contender for plasma-facing components (PFCs) in nuclear fusion reactors. The study underscores the inevitability of helium retention in tungsten due to the anticipated high flux of helium atoms from D-T fusion reactions in future reactors such as ITER and DEMO. This retention, potentially culminating in surface blistering and grain boundary embrittlement, propels an investigation into the helium's preferential substitutional configuration over interstitial within tungsten's lattice, leading to cavity and bubble formation. Atomistic tensile testing simulations, exploiting a helium-specific interatomic potential, dissect the ramifications of helium concentration and voids on tungsten's mechanical properties across grain sizes of 10nm and 15nm. The presence of helium at grain boundaries instigates detachment, influencing structural behaviors under strain. Notably, the study reveals a dichotomy in helium's effect: benign at concentrations up to the critical point, beyond which significant embrittlement and elastic softening occur, corroborating with theoretical predictions on helium-induced grain boundary embrittlement. This nuanced exploration delineates the intricate dance between helium implantation levels, grain size, and the ensuing mechanical property alterations in nanocrystalline tungsten, casting light on its viability and endurance as a PFC material under the rigorous conditions forecasted in fusion reactors.</description>

      <title>Multi-State, Ultra-thin, BEOL-Compatible AlScN Ferroelectric Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth in data generation necessitates efficient data processing technologies to address the von Neumann bottleneck in conventional computer architecture. Memory-driven computing, which integrates non-volatile memory (NVM) devices in a 3D stack, is gaining attention, with CMOS back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible ferroelectric (FE) diodes being ideal due to their two-terminal design and inherently selector-free nature, facilitating high-density crossbar arrays. Here, we demonstrate BEOL-compatible, high-performance FE-diodes scaled to 5, 10, and 20 nm FE Al0.72Sc0.28N/Al0.64Sc0.36N films. Through interlayer (IL) engineering, we show substantial improvements in the ON/OFF ratios (&gt;166 times) and rectification ratios (&gt;176 times) in these scaled devices. The superlative characteristics also enables 5-bit multi-state operation with a stable retention. We also experimentally and theoretically demonstrate the counterintuitive result that the inclusion of an IL can lead to a decrease in the ferroelectric switching voltage of the device. An in-depth analysis into the device transport mechanisms is performed, and our compact model aligns seamlessly with the experimental results. Our results suggest the possibility of using scaled AlxSc1-xN FE-diodes for high performance, low-power, embedded NVM.</description>

      <title>Practical ultra-low frequency noise laser system for quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The laser's frequency noise is crucial to the sensitivity of quantum sensors. Two commonly used methods to suppress the laser's frequency noise are locking the laser to an atomic transition by the lock-in technique or to an ultra-low thermal expansion (ULE) glass cavity by the PDH technique. The former cannot suppress rapidly changing frequency noise and hardly meets the needs; the latter has powerful performance but a heightened cost. The lack of high-performance and low-cost laser noise suppression methods dramatically limits the practical application of quantum sensors. This work demonstrates that, in many quantum sensing applications such as the Rydberg atomic superheterodyne receiver, by cascade locking the laser to both the atomic transition and a low-cost (LC) cavity, the same performance as locking to the ULE cavity can be achieved. This work is significant in promoting the practical application of quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Growth of metal catalyst nanoparticles in hydrocarbon-rich atmosphere of arc discharge for synthesis of carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A direct current (DC) arc discharge is a widely used method for industrial-scale production of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). A high-selectivity synthesis of SWCNT requires ultra-fine, typically a few nanometers in diameter, catalyst particles, which is challenging to achieve in harsh arc environments involving high temperatures, ablation of electrode materials, convection, and instabilities. Here, we explore how the size of metal catalyst nanoparticles is affected by a hydrocarbon-rich atmosphere of the DC arc. In this arc, iron nanoparticles are produced by the evaporation of an anode, made from low-carbon steel. Methane admixture into argon gas serves as a carbon source. Electron microscopy and elemental analysis suggest that hydrocarbons decompose on iron clusters forming a carbon shell, which limits further iron particle growth. Experimental observations are explained using an aerosol growth model. The results demonstrate the potential to manipulate the catalyst particle size in hydrocarbon arc environments.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport Properties of Epitaxial Films and Hall Bar Devices of the Correlated Layered Ruthenate Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09255v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films grown by pulsed laser deposition, we report a combined structural and magnetotransport study of thin films and Hall bar devices patterned side-by-side on the same film. Structural properties of these films are investigated using X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and confirm that these films are epitaxially oriented and nearly phase pure. For magnetic fields applied along the $c-$axis, a positive magnetoresistance of 10\% is measured for unpatterned Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films, whereas for patterned Hall bar devices of channel widths of $10$ and $5\, \mu$m, magnetoresistance values of 40\% and 140\% are found, respectively. These films show switching behaviors from positive to negative magnetoresistance that are controlled by the direction of the applied magnetic field. The present results provide a promising route for achieving stable epitaxial synthesis of intermediate members of correlated layered strontium ruthenates, and for the exploration of device physics in thin films of these compounds.</description>

      <title>Highly stable photoluminescence in vacuum-processed halide perovskite core-shell 1D nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid organometal halide perovskites (HP) present exceptional optoelectronic properties, but their poor long-term stability is a major bottleneck for their commercialization. Herein, we present a solvent-free approach to growing single-crystal organic nanowires (ONW), nanoporous metal oxide scaffolds, and HP to form a core@multishell architecture. The synthetic procedure is carried out under mild vacuum conditions employing thermal evaporation for the metal-free phthalocyanine (H2Pc) nanowires, which will be the core, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) for the TiO2 shell, and co-evaporation of lead iodide (PbI2) and methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I / MAI) for the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3 / MAPI) perovskite shell. We present a detailed characterization of the nanostructures by (S)-TEM and XRD, revealing a different crystallization of the hybrid perovskite depending on the template: while the growth on H2Pc nanowires induces the typical tetragonal structure of the MAPI perovskite, a low-dimensional phase (LDP) was observed on the one-dimensional TiO2 nanotubes. Such a combination yields an unprecedentedly stable photoluminescence emission over 20 hours and over 300 hours after encapsulation in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) under different atmospheres including N2, air, and high moisture levels. In addition, the unique one-dimensional morphology of the system, together with the high refractive index HP, allows for a strong waveguiding effect along the nanowire length.</description>

      <title>Observation of Topological Corner State Arrays in Photonic Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the studies of topological corner states (TCSs) are extended from crystals to quasicrystals, which are referred to as higher-order topological quasicrystalline insulators (HOTQIs). However, the TCSs of complete quasi-periodic structure in photonic systems have yet to be demonstrated. Moreover, there is only one TCS in each corner region in higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs). Increasing the number of TCS is expected to increase application potential of TCSs. In this work, HOTQIs in photonic systems are experimentally observed. It is found that HOTQIs possess TCS arrays, and each TCS array contains several TCSs. Furthermore, the universal theoretical framework of the multimer analysis method is improved, and the difference in the average charge density is proposed as a real-space topological index. These results will open up new ideas for investigating highly integrated, multi-region localized TCSs and are expected to provide new ways to explore topological phenomena and the applications of photonic quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Active learning for effective Hamiltonian of super-large-scale atomic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first-principles-based effective Hamiltonian is widely used to predict and simulate the properties of ferroelectrics and relaxor ferroelectrics. However, the parametrization method of the effective Hamiltonian is complicated and hardly can resolve the systems with complex interactions and/or complex components. Here, we developed an on-the-fly active machine learning approach to parametrize the effective Hamiltonian based on Bayesian linear regression. The parametrization is completed in molecular dynamics simulations, with the energy, forces and stress predicted at each step along with their uncertainties. First-principles calculations are executed when the uncertainties are large to retrain the parameters. This approach provides a universal and automatic way to compute the effective Hamiltonian parameters for any considered systems including complex systems which previous methods can not handle. The form of the effective Hamiltonian is also revised to include some complex terms. BaTiO3, CsPbI3 and SrTiO3/PbTiO3 surface are taken as examples to show the accurateness of this approach comparing with conventional first-principles parametrization method.</description>

      <title>Andreev reflection mediated $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum noise has been extensively utilized to investigate various aspects of quantum transport, such as current-current correlations and wave-particle duality. A recent focus in this field is on $\Delta_T$ quantum noise, which arises because of a finite temperature difference at vanishing charge current. This paper explores the characterization of $\Delta_T$ noise auto-correlation alongside the shot noise and thermal-noise contributions in a 1D metal/insulator/superconductor junction. We consider a finite temperature gradient with zero applied bias for reservoirs at comparable temperatures. Andreev reflection enhances the $\Delta_T$ noise in a metal-insulator-superconductor junction in contrast to a metal-insulator-metal junction in the transparent limit. Unlike quantum noise for which shot-noise dominates thermal-noise at large bias voltages and finite barrier strength, $\Delta_T$ thermal-noise is always higher than $\Delta_T$ shot-noise. Thus, a general bound that is independent of barrier strength is established. This investigation sheds light on the distinct behavior of $\Delta_T$ noise, alongside the ratio of shot-noise to thermal-noise contributions, offering valuable insights into the intricate interplay between finite temperature gradient, barrier strength, and Andreev reflection.</description>
