      <title>Data-driven performance optimization of gamma spectrometers with many channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In gamma spectrometers with variable spectroscopic performance across many channels (e.g., many pixels or voxels), a tradeoff exists between including data from successively worse-performing readout channels and increasing efficiency. Brute-force calculation of the optimal set of included channels is exponentially infeasible as the number of channels grows, and approximate methods are required. In this work, we present a data-driven framework for attempting to find near-optimal sets of included detector channels. The framework leverages non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to learn the behavior of gamma spectra across the detector, and clusters similarly-performing detector channels together. Performance comparisons are then made between spectra with channel clusters removed, which is more feasible than brute force. The framework is general and can be applied to arbitrary, user-defined performance metrics depending on the application. We apply this framework to optimizing gamma spectra measured by H3D M400 CdZnTe spectrometers, which exhibit variable performance across their crystal volumes. In particular, we show several examples optimizing various performance metrics for uranium and plutonium gamma spectra in nondestructive assay for nuclear safeguards, and explore trends in performance vs.\ parameters such as clustering algorithm type. We also compare the NMF+clustering pipeline to several non-machine-learning algorithms, including several greedy algorithms. Overall, we find that the NMF+clustering pipeline tends to find the best-performing set of detector voxels, significantly improving over the un-optimized spectra, but that a greedy accumulation of spectra segmented by detector depth can in some cases give similar performance improvements in much less computation time.</description>

      <title>A Simple Method for More Precise Pulse-Height Fitting in Sparsely Sampled Data Using Pulse-Shape-Archetype Information, Especially Suited to Ultra-Short-Laser Pulsetrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel pulse-reconstruction method well suited to sparsely sampled repetitive data, such as commonly arise from trains of ultrashort laser-pulses. Typically waveforms in such traces are fully instrument-limited by the detecting systems, for instance, the combination of detector and oscilloscope, and only the energy of each waveform is sought. The method applies whenever shape of the waveform is the same for every pulse and can be well-characterized, with only amplitude and relative peak-timing changing. Under such conditions this information, known in advance, can be used as a basis - an archetype - for very accurate pulse fitting. Our characterizations show that the method very accurately extracts pulse heights and relative pulse timing, even when sampling routinely misses the pulse peak, and entirely misses the rising or falling edge. We show this method to be adaptable in different detection systems, showing significant improvement in accuracy of measurement, in this class of problem.</description>

      <title>Control Co-Design Under Uncertainty for Offshore Wind Farms: Optimizing Grid Integration, Energy Storage, and Market Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offshore wind farms (OWFs) are set to significantly contribute to global decarbonization efforts. Developers often use a sequential approach to optimize design variables and market participation for grid-integrated offshore wind farms. However, this method can lead to sub-optimal system performance, and uncertainties associated with renewable resources are often overlooked in decision-making. This paper proposes a control co-design approach, optimizing design and control decisions for integrating OWFs into the power grid while considering energy market and primary frequency market participation. Additionally, we introduce optimal sizing solutions for energy storage systems deployed onshore to enhance revenue for OWF developers over time. This framework addresses uncertainties related to wind resources and energy prices. We analyze five U.S. west-coast offshore wind farm locations and potential interconnection points, as identified by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). Results show that optimized control co-design solutions can increase market revenue by 3.2\% and provide flexibility in managing wind resource uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Unifying Simulation and Inference with Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There have been many applications of deep neural networks to detector calibrations and a growing number of studies that propose deep generative models as automated fast detector simulators. We show that these two tasks can be unified by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) from conditional generative models for energy regression. Unlike direct regression techniques, the MLE approach is prior-independent and non-Gaussian resolutions can be determined from the shape of the likelihood near the maximum. Using an ATLAS-like calorimeter simulation, we demonstrate this concept in the context of calorimeter energy calibration.</description>
