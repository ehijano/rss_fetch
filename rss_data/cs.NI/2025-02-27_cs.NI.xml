      <title>Wireless sensor networks data synchronization using node MCU memory for precision agriculture applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks have risen as a highly promising technology suitable for precision agriculture implementations, enabling efficient monitoring and control of agricultural processes. In precision agriculture, accurate and synchronized data collection is crucial for effective analysis and decision making. Using principles of information theory, we can define conditions and parameters that influence the efficient transmission and processing of information. Existing technologies have limitations in maintaining consistent time references, handling node failures, and unreliable communication links, leading to inaccurate data readings. Reliable data storage is demanding now-a-days for storing data on local monitoring station as well as in online live server. Sometime internet is not working properly due to congestion and there is frequent packet loss. Current solutions often synchronize records based on database timestamps, leading to record duplication and waste storage. Both databases synchronize each other after internet restoration. By providing synchronization among nodes and data, accuracy and storage will be saved in IoT based WSNs for precision agriculture applications. A prototype Node-MCU internal memory is used as a resource for achieving data synchronization. This proposed work generates record ID from Node MCU EEPROM which helps in records synchronization if there is any packet loss at the local server or at the online server to maintain synchronization accuracy despite unreliable communication links. Experiment shows that for a particular duration Node MCU generated 2364 packets and packet loss at local server was 08 and at online server was 174 packets. Results shows that after synchronization 99.87% packets were synchronized. Using previous technique of timestamp, the redundancy was 70% which reduced to 0% using our proposed technique.</description>

      <title>O-RIS-ing: Evaluating RIS-Assisted NextG Open RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) pose as a transformative technology to revolutionize the cellular architecture of Next Generation (NextG) Radio Access Networks (RANs). Previous studies have demonstrated the capabilities of RISs in optimizing wireless propagation, achieving high spectral efficiency, and improving resource utilization. At the same time, the transition to softwarized, disaggregated, and virtualized architectures, such as those being standardized by the O-RAN ALLIANCE, enables the vision of a reconfigurable Open RAN. In this work, we aim to integrate these technologies by studying how different resource allocation policies enhance the performance of RIS-assisted Open RANs. We perform a comparative analysis among various network configurations and show how proper network optimization can enhance the performance across the Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC) network slices, achieving up to ~34% throughput improvement. Furthermore, leveraging the capabilities of OpenRAN Gym, we deploy an xApp on Colosseum, the world's largest wireless system emulator with hardware-in-the-loop, to control the Base Station (BS)'s scheduling policy. Experimental results demonstrate that RIS-assisted topologies achieve high resource efficiency and low latency, regardless of the BS's scheduling policy.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent DRL-Based Framework for Optimal Resource Allocation and Twin Migration in the Multi-Tier Vehicular Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although multi-tier vehicular Metaverse promises to transform vehicles into essential nodes -- within an interconnected digital ecosystem -- using efficient resource allocation and seamless vehicular twin (VT) migration, this can hardly be achieved by the existing techniques operating in a highly dynamic vehicular environment, since they can hardly balance multi-objective optimization problems such as latency reduction, resource utilization, and user experience (UX). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel multi-tier resource allocation and VT migration framework that integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), a hierarchical Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism, and Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). The GCN-based model captures both spatial and temporal dependencies within the vehicular network; the Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism fosters cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure; and the MADRL algorithm jointly optimizes resource allocation and VT migration in real time. By modeling this dynamic and multi-tier vehicular Metaverse as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we develop a MADRL-based algorithm dubbed the Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MO-MADDPG), which can effectively balances the various conflicting objectives. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of this algorithm that is demonstrated to enhance scalability, reliability, and efficiency while considerably improving latency, resource utilization, migration cost, and overall UX by 12.8%, 9.7%, 14.2%, and 16.1%, respectively.</description>

Abstract: One of the main challenges associated with the implementation of an Open RAN User-Centric Cell-Free network is the appropriate formulation of serving clusters. This problem can be effectively solved using a proposed algorithm that leverages cooperation between xApp and rApp. Simulation results have shown that the proposed solution allows for a 16% increase in the median of the user throughput distribution compared to the state-of-the-art network-centric architecture</description>

      <title>On Supporting IP Routing in the Next Generation of Mobile Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming generation of mobile telecommunication systems is expected to support new use cases, where the mobile network serves one or more IP subnetworks located behind the User Equipment (UEs). This would create new challenges for the mobile system to efficiently serve such behind-UE subnetworks, as the latter are commonly not visible to the mobile system. In 3GPP, there have been works on Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Deterministic Networking (DetNet), where the 5G System (5GS) is considered as a bridge or a DetNet node. In order to efficiently serve behind-UE IP subnetworks, we foresee the need for a further generalization where the mobile system (5GS and beyond) acts as a set of IP routers with more generic capabilities. In this article, we introduce the concept of Mobile System Router (MS-Router) which aims to provide a reference architectural design to enable the support of IP routing in the next generation of mobile telecommunication systems. The concept models a mobile system as an IP router per User Plane granularity. Each MS-Router implements an IP routing protocol, exchanges routing messages with the external routers and constructs a routing table, enabling the mobile system to dynamically learn the topology of the IP subnetwork behind the UEs and Data Network. The learned topology is translated into User Plane configuration to serve the IP subnetworks in an optimal way. The article also advocates different approaches where routing protocols can be implemented in the mobile system.</description>

      <title>Sequential Entanglement-Swapping assisted by Quantum Protocol over Ethernet Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of quantum communication protocols over Ethernet networks is proposed, showing the potential of combining classical and quantum technologies for efficient, scalable quantum networking. By leveraging the inherent strengths of Ethernet, such as addressing, MAC layer functionality, and scalability; we propose a practical framework to support the rigorous requirements of quantum communication. Some novel protocols given in this study enable reliable end-to-end quantum entanglement over Ethernet, ensuring the adaptability needed for implementing a stable quantum internet. Detailed time-delay analyses confirm that our protocols offer superior performance compared to existing methods, with total time delay kept within the decoherence threshold of qubits. These results suggest that our approach is well-suited for deployment in realistic environments, meeting both the immediate needs of quantum networking and laying the groundwork for future advances in data exchange and quantum computational capabilities.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sensors Selection for Traffic Flow Monitoring: An Overview of Model-Based Techniques leveraging Network Observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of 6G-enabled Internet of Vehicles (IoV) promises to revolutionize mobility and connectivity, integrating vehicles into a mobile Internet of Things (IoT)-oriented wireless sensor network (WSN). Meanwhile, 5G technologies and mobile edge computing further support this vision by facilitating real-time connectivity and empowering massive access to the Internet. Within this context, IoT-oriented WSNs play a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems, offering affordable alternatives for traffic monitoring and management. Efficient sensor selection thus represents a critical concern while deploying WSNs on urban networks. In this paper, we provide an overview of such a notably hard problem. The contribution is twofold: (i) surveying state-of-the-art model-based techniques for efficient sensor selection in traffic flow monitoring, emphasizing challenges of sensor placement, and (ii) advocating for {the development of} data-driven methodologies to enhance sensor deployment efficacy and traffic modeling accuracy. Further considerations underscore the importance of data-driven approaches for adaptive transportation systems aligned with the IoV paradigm.</description>

      <title>Orbit-Aware Split Learning: Optimizing LEO Satellite Networks for Distributed Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel split learning architecture designed to exploit the cyclical movement of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). Although existing research focuses on offloading tasks to the NTN infrastructure, these approaches overlook the dynamic movement patterns of LEO satellites that can be used to efficiently distribute the learning task. In this work, we analyze how LEO satellites, from the perspective of ground terminals, can participate in a time-window-based model training. By splitting the model between a LEO and a ground terminal, the computational burden on the satellite segment is reduced, while each LEO satellite offloads the partially trained model to the next satellite in the constellation. This cyclical training process allows larger and more energy-intensive models to be deployed and trained across multiple LEO satellites, despite their limited energy resources. We formulate an optimization problem that manages radio and processing resources, ensuring the entire data is processed during each satellite pass while minimizing the energy consumption. Our results demonstrate that this approach offers a more scalable and energy-efficient way to train complex models, enhancing the capabilities of LEO satellite constellations in the context of Artificial Intelligence-driven applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 6G Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MMIMO) networks can follow the so-called User-Centric Cell-Free (UCCF) architecture, where a single user is served by multiple Access Points (APs) coordinated by the Central Processing Unit (CPU). In this paper, we propose how O-RAN functionalities, i.e., rApp-xApp pair, can be used for energy-efficient Serving Cluster Formulation (SCF). Simulation studies show up to 37\% gain in Energy Efficiency (EE) of the proposed solution over the state-of-the-art Network-Centric (NC) designs.</description>

      <title>SoK: The Design Paradigm of Safe and Secure Defaults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In security engineering, including software security engineering, there is a well-known design paradigm telling to prefer safe and secure defaults. The paper presents a systematization of knowledge (SoK) of this paradigm by the means of a systematic mapping study and a scoping review of relevant literature. According to the mapping and review, the paradigm has been extensively discussed, used, and developed further since the late 1990s. Partially driven by the insecurity of the Internet of things, the volume of publications has accelerated from the circa mid-2010s onward. The publications reviewed indicate that the paradigm has been adopted in numerous different contexts. It has also been expanded with security design principles not originally considered when the paradigm was initiated in the mid-1970s. Among the newer principles are an "off by default" principle, various overriding and fallback principles, as well as those related to the zero trust model. The review also indicates problems developers and others have faced with the paradigm.</description>
