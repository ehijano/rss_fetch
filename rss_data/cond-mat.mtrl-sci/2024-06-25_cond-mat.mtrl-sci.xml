      <title>High-order and adaptive optical conductivity calculations using Wannier interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an automatic, high-order accurate, and adaptive Brillouin zone integration algorithm for the calculation of the optical conductivity with a non-zero but small broadening factor $\eta$, focusing on the case in which a Hamiltonian in a downfolded model can be evaluated efficiently using Wannier interpolation. The algorithm uses iterated adaptive integration to exploit the localization of the transport distribution near energy and energy-difference iso-surfaces, yielding polylogarithmic computational complexity with respect to $\eta$. To demonstrate the method, we compute the AC optical conductivity of a three-band tight-binding model, and are able to resolve the Drude and interband peaks with broadening in the sub-meV regime to several digits of accuracy. Our algorithm automates convergence testing to a user-specified error tolerance, providing an important tool in black-box first-principles calculations of electrical transport phenomena and other response functions.</description>

      <title>SimXRD-4M: Big Simulated X-ray Diffraction Data Accelerate the Crystalline Symmetry Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic data, particularly diffraction data, contain detailed crystal and microstructure information and thus are crucial for materials discovery. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are greatly effective in identifying crystals. Although machine learning (ML) has significantly advanced the analysis of powder XRD patterns, the progress is hindered by a lack of training data. To address this, we introduce SimXRD, the largest open-source simulated XRD pattern dataset so far, to accelerate the development of crystallographic informatics. SimXRD comprises 4,065,346 simulated powder X-ray diffraction patterns, representing 119,569 distinct crystal structures under 33 simulated conditions that mimic real-world variations. We find that the crystal symmetry inherently follows a long-tailed distribution and evaluate 21 sequence learning models on SimXRD. The results indicate that existing neural networks struggle with low-frequency crystal classifications. The present work highlights the academic significance and the engineering novelty of simulated XRD patterns in this interdisciplinary field.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Top SiO2 Interlayer Thickness on Memory Window of Si Channel FeFET with TiN/SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/SiOx/Si (MIFIS) Gate Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of top SiO2 interlayer thickness on the memory window (MW) of Si channel ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) with TiN/SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/SiOx/Si (MIFIS) gate structure. We find that the MW increases with the increasing thickness of the top SiO2 interlayer, and such an increase exhibits a two-stage linear dependence. The physical origin is the presence of the different interfacial charges trapped at the top SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 interface. Moreover, we investigate the dependence of endurance characteristics on initial MW. We find that the endurance characteristic degrades with increasing the initial MW. By inserting a 3.4 nm SiO2 dielectric interlayer between the gate metal TiN and the ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2, we achieve a MW of 6.3 V and retention over 10 years. Our work is helpful in the device design of FeFET.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Entropy and Free Energy of Solid Lithium using Covariance of Atomic Displacements Enabled by Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational properties of solids are key to determining stability, response and functionality. However, they are challenging to computationally predict at Ab-Initio accuracy, even for elemental systems. Ab-Initio methods for modeling atomic interactions are limited in the system sizes and simulation times that can be achieved. Due to these limitations, Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are gaining popularity and success as a faster, more scalable approach for modeling atomic interactions, potentially at Ab-Initio accuracy. Even with faster potentials, methodologies for predicting entropy, free energy and vibrational properties vary in accuracy, cost and difficulty to implement. Using the Covariance of Atomic Displacements (CAD) to predict entropy, free energy and finite-temperature phonon dispersions is a promising approach but thorough benchmarking has been hampered by the cost of Ab-Initio methods for sampling. In this work, we use a MLIP and the CAD to characterize the convergence of the predicted properties and determine optimal sampling strategies. We focus on solid lithium at zero pressure, showing that the MLIP-CAD approach reproduces experimental entropy, phonon dispersions and the martensitic transition while also comparing to more established methods.</description>

      <title>Exploring large language models for microstructure evolution in materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a significant potential for coding skills to transition fully to natural language in the future. In this context, large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive natural language processing abilities to generate sophisticated computer code for research tasks in various domains. We report the first study on the applicability of LLMs to perform computer experiments on microstructure pattern formation in model materials. In particular, we exploit LLM's ability to generate code for solving various types of phase-field-based partial differential equations (PDEs) that integrate additional physics to model material microstructures. The results indicate that LLMs have a remarkable capacity to generate multi-physics code and can effectively deal with materials microstructure problems up to a certain complexity. However, for complex multi-physics coupled PDEs for which a detailed understanding of the problem is required, LLMs fail to perform the task efficiently, since much more detailed instructions with many iterations of the same query are required to generate the desired output. Nonetheless, at their current stage of development and potential future advancements, LLMs offer a promising outlook for accelerating materials education and research by supporting beginners and experts in their physics-based methodology. We hope this paper will spur further interest to leverage LLMs as a supporting tool in the integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) approach to materials modeling and design.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Models for Accurately Predicting Properties of CsPbCl3 Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite Quantum Dots (PQDs) have a promising future for several applications due to their unique properties. This study investigates the effectiveness of Machine Learning (ML) in predicting the size, absorbance (1S abs) and photoluminescence (PL) properties of $\mathrm{CsPbCl}_3$ PQDs using synthesizing features as the input dataset. the study employed ML models of Support Vector Regression (SVR), Nearest Neighbour Distance (NND), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Decision Tree (DT) and Deep Learning (DL). Although all models performed highly accurate results, SVR and NND demonstrated the best accurate property prediction by achieving excellent performance on the test and training datasets, with high $\mathrm{R}^2$ and low Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric values. Given that ML is becoming more superior, its ability to understand the QDs field could prove invaluable to shape the future of nanomaterials designing.</description>

      <title>Polar phonons and magnetic excitations in the antiferromagnet CoF$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between antiferromagnetic spins and infrared-active phonons in solids is responsible for many intriguing phenomena and is a field of intense research with extensive potential applications in the modern devices based on antiferromagnetic spintronics and phononics. Insulating rutile antiferromagnetic crystal CoF$_2$ is one of the model materials for studying nonlinear magnetophononics due to the strong spin-lattice coupling as a result of the orbitally degenerate ground state of Co$^{2+}$ ions manifested in the plethora of static and induced piezomagnetic effects. Here we report results on the complete infrared spectroscopy study of lattice and magnetic dynamics in CoF$_2$ in a wide temperature range and their careful analysis. We observed that infrared-active phonons demonstrate frequency shifts at the antiferromagnetic ordering. Furthermore, using first-principles calculations, we examined the lattice dynamics and disclosed that these frequency shifts are rather due to the spin-phonon coupling than geometrical lattice effects. Next we found that the low-frequency dielectric permittivity demonstrates distinct changes at the antiferromagnetic ordering due to the spontaneous magnetodielectric effect caused by the behavior of infrared-active phonons. In addition, we have observed magnetic excitations in the infrared spectra and identified their magnetodipole origin. To strengthen our conclusions, we analyze the theoretical phonon-magnon coupling overall phonons at the $\Gamma$ point. We conclude that the largest effect comes from the $A_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ Raman-active modes. As such, our results establish a solid basis for further investigations and more deeper understanding of the coupling of phonons with spins and magnetic excitations in antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>A High-Throughput and Data-Driven Computational Framework for Novel Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional layered materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), possess intrinsic van der Waals gap at the layer interface allowing for remarkable tunability of the optoelectronic features via external intercalation of foreign guests such as atoms, ions, or molecules. Herein, we introduce a high-throughput, data-driven computational framework for the design of novel quantum materials derived from intercalating planar conjugated organic molecules into bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides and dioxides. By combining first-principles methods, material informatics, and machine learning, we characterize the energetic and mechanical stability of this new class of materials and identify the fifty (50) most stable hybrid materials from a vast configurational space comprising $\sim 10^5$ materials, employing intercalation energy as the screening criterion.</description>

      <title>Low-Temperature Synthesis of Stable CaZn$_2$P$_2$ Zintl Phosphide Thin Films as Candidate Top Absorbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of tandem photovoltaics and photoelectrochemical solar cells requires new absorber materials with band gaps in the range of ~1.5-2.3 eV, for use in the top cell paired with a narrower-gap bottom cell. An outstanding challenge is finding materials with suitable optoelectronic and defect properties, good operational stability, and synthesis conditions that preserve underlying device layers. This study demonstrates the Zintl phosphide compound CaZn$_2$P$_2$ as a compelling candidate semiconductor for these applications. We prepare phase pure, 500 nm-thick CaZn$_2$P$_2$ thin films using a scalable reactive sputter deposition process at growth temperatures as low as 100 {\deg}C, which is desirable for device integration. UV-vis spectroscopy shows that CaZn$_2$P$_2$ films exhibit an optical absorptivity of ~10$^4$ cm$^-$$^1$ at ~1.95 eV direct band gap. Room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements show near-band-edge optical emission, and time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements indicate a photoexcited carrier lifetime of ~30 ns. CaZn$_2$P$_2$ is highly stable in both ambient conditions and moisture, as evidenced by PL and TRMC measurements. Experimental data are supported by first-principles calculations, which indicate the absence of low-formation-energy, deep intrinsic defects. Overall, our study should motivate future work integrating this potential top cell absorber material into tandem solar cells.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Materials Properties with Accurate Predictions, Uncertainty Estimates, Domain Guidance, and Persistent Online Accessibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One compelling vision of the future of materials discovery and design involves the use of machine learning (ML) models to predict materials properties and then rapidly find materials tailored for specific applications. However, realizing this vision requires both providing detailed uncertainty quantification (model prediction errors and domain of applicability) and making models readily usable. At present, it is common practice in the community to assess ML model performance only in terms of prediction accuracy (e.g., mean absolute error), while neglecting detailed uncertainty quantification and robust model accessibility and usability. Here, we demonstrate a practical method for realizing both uncertainty and accessibility features with a large set of models. We develop random forest ML models for 33 materials properties spanning an array of data sources (computational and experimental) and property types (electrical, mechanical, thermodynamic, etc.). All models have calibrated ensemble error bars to quantify prediction uncertainty and domain of applicability guidance enabled by kernel-density-estimate-based feature distance measures. All data and models are publicly hosted on the Garden-AI infrastructure, which provides an easy-to-use, persistent interface for model dissemination that permits models to be invoked with only a few lines of Python code. We demonstrate the power of this approach by using our models to conduct a fully ML-based materials discovery exercise to search for new stable, highly active perovskite oxide catalyst materials.</description>

      <title>Analysis of shear localization in viscoplastic solids with pressure-sensitive structural transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization, in the form of adiabatic shear, is analyzed in viscoplastic solids that may undergo structural transformation driven by pressure, shear stress, temperature, and magnetic field. As pertinent to polycrystalline metals, transformations may include solid-solid phase transitions, twinning, and dynamic recrystallization. A finite-strain constitutive framework for isotropic metals is used to solve a boundary value problem involving simple shearing with superposed hydrostatic pressure and constant external magnetic field. Three-dimensional theory is reduced to a formulation simple enough to facilitate approximate analytical solutions yet sophisticated enough to maintain the salient physics. Ranges of constitutive parameters (e.g., strain hardening, strain-rate sensitivity, thermal softening, and strain-driven structure transformation limits influenced by pressure and magnetic field) are obtained for which localization to infinite shear strain is possible. Motivated by experimental and theoretical studies suggesting a non-negligible role of shear on phase transformations in iron (Fe), the model is used to understand influences of pressure and phase transitions on applied strains for which localization should occur in pure Fe and a high-strength steel. Results show, among other trends for these two materials, that shear localization in conjunction with phase transformation is promoted when the transformed phase is softer than the parent phase. Localization that would occur in the isolated parent phase can be mitigated if the strain hardening or thermal softening tendencies of the transformed phase are sufficiently increased or reduced, respectively.</description>

      <title>Stress-tunable abilities of glass forming and mechanical amorphization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical amorphization, a widely observed phenomenon, has been utilized to synthesize novel phases by inducing disorder through external loading, thereby expanding the realm of glass-forming systems. Empirically, it has been plausible that mechanical amorphization ability consistently correlates with glass-forming ability. However, through a comprehensive investigation in binary, ternary, and quaternary systems combining neutron diffraction, calorimetric experimental approaches and molecular dynamics simulation, we demonstrate that this impression is only partly true and we reveal that the mechanical amorphization ability can be inversely correlated with the glass forming ability in certain cases To provide insights into these intriguing findings, we present a stress-dependent nucleation theory that offers a coherent explanation for both experimental and simulation results. Our study identifies the intensity of mechanical work, contributed by external stress, as the key control parameter for mechanical amorphization, rendering the ability to tune this process. This discovery not only unravels the underlying correlation between mechanical amorphization and glass-forming ability but also provides a pathway for the design and discovery of new amorphous phases with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Alternating-Chiral Charge Density Waves and Hybrid Ferrimagnetism in Monolayered NbTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intertwining of different quantum degrees of freedom manifests exotic quantum phenomena in many-body systems, especially in reduced dimensionality. Here we show that monolayered NbTe2 serves as an ideal platform where lattice, charge, and spin degrees of freedom manifest cooperatively, leading to a new and threading order of chirality. By using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we reveal that the root19 * root19 phase of NbTe2 is encoded with both alternating-chiral atomic displacements and charge density waves, characterized by two chiral units of opposite handedness within the reconstructed cell. We show unambiguous evidence for emergent spin polarizations spreading over the primitive cell, with the magnetization orientation synchronized with alternating handedness of chiral order. Our first-principles studies identify the origin of intertwined orders being correlation driven, with the threading order of chirality emerging when the on-site Coulomb repulsion exceeds a critical value. The spin ordering is further shown to be of hybrid ferrimagnetic nature, contributed by the itinerant electrons and localized d-orbitals. Collectively, these findings expand the realm of chiral order in correlated electron systems, and facilitate an appealing platform for chiral spintronic and related applications.</description>

      <title>Irida-Graphene Phonon Thermal via Non-equilibrium Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a new 2D carbon allotrope called Irida-Graphene (Irida-G) was proposed. Irida-G consists of a flat sheet topologically arranged into 3-6-8 carbon rings exhibiting metallic and non-magnetic properties. In this study, we investigated the thermal transport properties of Irida-G using classical reactive molecular dynamics simulations. The findings indicate that Irida-G has an intrinsic thermal conductivity of approximately 215 W/mK at room temperature, significantly lower than that of pristine graphene. This decrease is due to characteristic phonon scattering within Irida-G's porous structure. Additionally, the phonon group velocities and vibrational density of states for Irida-G were analyzed, revealing reduced average phonon group velocities compared to graphene. The thermal conductivity of Irida-G is isotropic and shows significant size effects, transitioning from ballistic to diffusive heat transport regimes as the system length increases. These results suggest that while Irida-G has lower thermal conductivity than graphene, it still holds potential for specific thermal management applications, sharing characteristics with other two-dimensional materials.</description>

Abstract: The Semiempirical Pseudopotential Method (SEPM) has emerged as a valuable tool for accurately determining band structures, especially in the realm of low-dimensional materials. SEPM operates by utilizing atomic pseudopotentials, which are derived from DFT calculations. SEPM calculations offer a unique advantage compared to DFT as they eliminate the requirement for iterative self-consistent solutions in solving the Schr\"odinger equation, leading to a substantial reduction in computational complexity. The incorporation of both non-local and local Semiempirical Pseudopotentials in our current approach yields band structures and wavefunctions with enhanced precision compared to traditional empirical methods. When applied to monolayer TMDCs, adjusting the parameters to align with pertinent values obtained from DFT computations enables us to faithfully replicate the band structure, opening avenues for investigating the optoelectronic properties of TMDCs and exploring their potential applications in nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Many-Body Interactions in CeO2 (111) Oxygen Vacancy Structure: Insights from Machine-Learning and Cluster Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen vacancies (VO's) are of paramount importance in influencing the properties and applications of ceria (CeO2). Yet, comprehending the distribution and nature of the VO's poses a significant challenge due to the vast number of electronic configurations and intricate many-body interactions among VO's and polarons (Ce3+'s). In this study, we employed a combination of LASSO regression in machine learning, in conjunction with a cluster expansion model and first-principles calculations to decouple the interactions among the Ce3+'s and VO's, thereby circumventing the limitations associated with sampling electronic configurations. By separating these interactions, we identified specific electronic configurations characterized by the most favorable VO-Ce3+ attractions and the least Ce3+-Ce3+/VO-VO repulsions, which are crucial in determining the stability of vacancy structures. Through more than 10^8 Metropolis Monte Carlo samplings of Vo's and Ce3+ in the near-surface of CeO2(111), we explored potential configurations within an 8x8 supercell. Our findings revealed that oxygen vacancies tend to aggregate and are most abundant in the third oxygen layer, primarily due to extensive geometric relaxation-an aspect previously overlooked. This behavior is notably dependent on the concentration of Vo. This work introduces a novel theoretical framework for unraveling the complex vacancy structures in metal oxides, with potential applications in redox and catalytic chemistry.</description>

      <title>Magneto-electric decoupling in bismuth ferrite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is still under intensive discussion, how magnetoelectric coupling actually occurs at the atomic scale in multiferroic BiFeO3. Nuclear solid-state techniques monitor local fields at the atomic scale. Using such an approach, we show that, contrary to our own expectation, ferroelectric and magnetic ordering in bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3 or BFO) decouple at the unit-cell level. Time differential perturbed angular correlation (TDPAC) data at temperatures below, close, and above the magnetic N\'eel temperature show that the coupling of the ferroelectric order to magnetization is completely absent at the bismuth site. It is common understanding that the antiferromagnetic order and the cycloidal ordering due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction generate a net zero magnetization of the sample cancelling any magnetoelectric effect at the macroscopic level. Our previous data show that a very large coupling of magnetic moment and electrical distortions arises on the magnetic sub-lattice (Fe-site). The oxygen octahedra around the iron site experience a large tilt due to the onset of magnetic ordering. Nevertheless, the Bi-containing complementary sub-lattice carrying the ferroelectric order is practically unaffected by this large structural change in its direct vicinity. The magnetoelectric coupling thus vanishes already at the unit cell level. These experimental results agree well with an ab-initio density functional theory (DFT) calculation.</description>

      <title>Pressure tuning of HgCdTe epitaxial layers -- the role of the highly disordered buffer layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HgCdTe alloys are unique because by increasing the Cd content x, one modifies the band structure from inverted to normal, which fundamentally modifies the dispersion of bulk and surface or edge (in the case of quantum wells) energy states. Using alloys with x close to the concentration x_c at which the band inversion transition is observed and with additional application of hydrostatic pressure (p), one creates a favorable playground for studying the evolution of Dirac matter and its topological properties. In this work, cryogenic magnetospectroscopy in quantizing magnetic fields (B) at the far-infrared is used to study inter-Landau-level transitions in high-quality HgCdTe MBE-grown epitaxial layers with x ~ x_c as a function of p up to 4.2 kbar. Special attention is paid to elucidate the role of the substrate and buffer layers, which usually modify the pressure coefficients of epitaxial layers. For this purpose, comparative measurements were carried out on as-grown epilayers with a GaAs substrate and on free-standing layers obtained by etching off the substrate. Spectra registered as a function of B (at given p) were analyzed with the help of the Kane model modified to include magnetic field. The pressure coefficient as well as the difference between conduction and valence band deformation potentials of the free-standing layer were determined at 2 K. Surprisingly, the deformation potentials and pressure coefficients of the epitaxial layer and those of the free-standing layer differed by no more than 10 % in the pressure range up to 4.2 kbar. This finding questions the common belief of a dominant influence of the substrate on the pressure coefficients of epitaxial layers...</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimization of 2D and 3D composite structures using machine learning (ML) techniques, focusing on fracture toughness and crack propagation in the Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) test. By exploring the intricate relationship between microstructural arrangements and macroscopic properties of composites, the study demonstrates the potential of ML as a powerful tool to expedite the design optimization process, offering notable advantages over traditional finite element analysis. The research encompasses four distinct cases, examining crack propagation and fracture toughness in both 2D and 3D composite models. Through the application of ML algorithms, the study showcases the capability for rapid and accurate exploration of vast design spaces in composite materials. The findings highlight the efficiency of ML in predicting mechanical behaviors with limited training data, paving the way for broader applications in composite design and optimization. This work contributes to advancing the understanding of ML's role in enhancing the efficiency of composite material design processes.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Enabled Fast Optical Identification and Characterization of 2D Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials are a class of atomically thin materials with assorted electronic and quantum properties. Accurate identification of layer thickness, especially for a single monolayer, is crucial for their characterization. This characterization process, however, is often time-consuming, requiring highly skilled researchers and expensive equipment like atomic force microscopy. This project aims to streamline the identification process by using machine learning to analyze optical images and quickly determine layer thickness. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of three machine learning models -- SegNet, 1D U-Net, and 2D U-Net -- in accurately identifying monolayers in microscopic images. Additionally, we explore labeling and image processing techniques to determine the most effective method for identifying layer thickness in this class of materials.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming the landscape of chemistry and materials science. Recent examples of LLM-accelerated experimental research include virtual assistants for parsing synthesis recipes from the literature, or using the extracted knowledge to guide synthesis and characterization. Despite these advancements, their application is constrained to labs with automated instruments and control software, leaving much of materials science reliant on manual processes. Here, we demonstrate the rapid deployment of a Python-based control module for a Keithley 2400 electrical source measure unit using ChatGPT-4. Through iterative refinement, we achieved effective instrument management with minimal human intervention. Additionally, a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) was created, effectively linking all instrument controls to interactive screen elements. Finally, we integrated this AI-crafted instrument control software with a high-performance stochastic optimization algorithm to facilitate rapid and automated extraction of electronic device parameters related to semiconductor charge transport mechanisms from current-voltage (IV) measurement data. This integration resulted in a comprehensive open-source toolkit for semiconductor device characterization and analysis using IV curve measurements. We demonstrate the application of these tools by acquiring, analyzing, and parameterizing IV data from a Pt/Cr$_2$O$_3$:Mg/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ heterojunction diode, a novel stack for high-power and high-temperature electronic devices. This approach underscores the powerful synergy between LLMs and the development of instruments for scientific inquiry, showcasing a path for further acceleration in materials science.</description>

      <title>Single-Layer Fe-Cu Interphase in Ferritic Steels Stabilized by Magnetic Friedel Oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copper precipitation is a technique extensively deployed in steel strengthening. Being as tiny as a few nanometers in diameter, the Cu precipitates present a real challenge to experimental techniques in determination of their composition. The late Professor Morris Fine called it a mystery when addressing the discrepancy between the fact of low solubility of Fe in bulk Cu and the remarkable content of Fe in Cu precipitates according to atom probe tomography measurement. With a thorough search using rigorous first-principles density functional theory calculations, we are surprised to find that the interface between Cu precipitate and Fe matrix is neither immiscibly sharp, nor commonly miscible over a range of atomic layers, but rather manifests itself as a single-layer mixed Fe-Cu interphase. Our detailed analysis reveals that spin polarization is a key factor in defining such an interphase. The magnetic Friedel oscillations through spin polarization is the driving force to stabilize it. When the single-layer Fe-Cu interphase is counted in, the content of Fe in Cu precipitates would be significant due to their small size. Our finding is a strong demonstration that quantum mechanical effects such as Friedel oscillations can have explicit consequence also in structural materials. The accurate knowledge of the Fe-Cu interface is crucial for the design of advanced high-strength steels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear Hall effect (NHE) can be generated via Berry curvature dipole (BCD) on nonequilibrium Fermi surface in a non-magnetic system without inversion symmetry.To achieve a large BCD, strong local Berry curvatures and their variation with respect to momentum are necessary and hence topological materials with strong inter-band coupling emerge as promising candidates. In this study, we propose a switchable and robust BCD in the newlydiscovered dual quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) $\text{TaIrTe}_4$ by applying out-of-plane electric fields. Switchable BCD could be found along with topological phase transitions or insulator-metal transition in the primitive cell and CDW phases of $\text{TaIrTe}_4$ monolayer. This work presents an instructive strategy for achieving a switchable and robust BCD within dual QSHIs, which should be helpful for designing the NHE-based THz radiations detector.</description>

      <title>Random Forest Prediction of Crystal Structure from Electron Diffraction Patterns Incorporating Multiple Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffraction is the most common method to solve for unknown or partially known crystal structures. However, it remains a challenge to determine the crystal structure of a new material that may have nanoscale size or heterogeneities. Here we train an architecture of hierarchical random forest models capable of predicting the crystal system, space group, and lattice parameters from one or more unknown 2D electron diffraction patterns. Our initial model correctly identifies the crystal system of a simulated electron diffraction pattern from a 20 nm thick specimen of arbitrary orientation 67% of the time. We achieve a topline accuracy of 79% when aggregating predictions from 10 patterns of the same material but different zone axes. The space group and lattice predictions range from 70-90% accuracy and median errors of 0.01-0.5 angstroms, respectively, for cubic, hexagonal, trigonal and tetragonal crystal systems while being less reliable on orthorhombic and monoclinic systems. We apply this architecture to a 4D-STEM scan of gold nanoparticles, where it accurately predicts the crystal structure and lattice constants. These random forest models can be used to significantly accelerate the analysis of electron diffraction patterns, particularly in the case of unknown crystal structures. Additionally, due to the speed of inference, these models could be integrated into live TEM experiments, allowing real-time labeling of a specimen.</description>

Abstract: We present experimental measurements on Young's modulus and Gr\"{u}neisen parameter of multilayer graphene with varying number of layers using in situ bulge tests corroborated by atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Due to the experimental challenges posed by the significant disparity between intra and interlayer mechanical strengths, measuring conclusive elastic parameters are proven difficult. We analyze the results based on a new theoretical model together with first-principles calculations to elucidate the mechanism of thickness dependent incomplete strain transfer across the layers. Our findings indicate that the experimental elastic constants, which differ from intrinsic computed ones, have unavoidable limitations in reflecting ideal mechanical couplings between layers. Consequently, we propose a new mechanical modulus, free from effects of uncontrollable delamination of layers, derived by combining Gr\"{u}neisen parameter with Young's modulus.</description>

      <title>A hybrid FEM-NN optimization method to learn the physics-constrained constitutive relations from full-field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated strong capabilities of representing high-dimensional, complex functional relations, and hence have been widely used to characterize complex constitutive relations for various types of materials, such as polycrystals, polymers, etc. However, to construct a reliable NN-based constitutive model, a considerable amount of data, i.e. stress-strain states along different loading paths is needed, which can be expensive to collect. To address such challenge, we develop a hybrid finite element method (FEM) - NN optimization framework to learn complex hyperelastic constitutive relations from full-field data. The key advantage of this framework is that it can make use of the non-uniform displacement field due to the geometric inhomogeneities for training NN-based constitutive models. Since such data can provide many different stress-strain states in a single test, it can greatly reduce the number of experiments needed for the training of NNs. Besides, we adopt a mechanics-informed neural network (MINN) as our architecture to ensure that our NN-based models satisfy all necessary physical constraints by construction, such as objectivity, material symmetry, polyconvexity, etc. Such architecture is also key to the convergence of our optimization framework. We then use both synthetic and experimental data to test the performance of our proposed framework on various isotropic hyperelastic materials. Results show that our optimization framework can be used to train NN-based constitutive models for hyperelastic materials with high accuracy and efficiency using data generated from simple tests, which can also be easily adapted to characterize complex constitutive models for a broader range of materials.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this work is the development of scientifically based ways of influencing the process of nucleation of crystallization centres to control the cast structure and the properties of blanks at the casting stage. The possibility of controlling crystal nucleation was studied on transparent modelling media using the droplet method. The dependence of the crystallization kinetics of drops with a size of 100{\div}200 {\mu}m on the overheating temperature, the exposure in the overheated state and the degree of supercooling was established. The curves of the crystallization kinetics of drops from their melts as the criteria for evaluating the crystallization process were chosen. The nature of the change in the experimental media crystallization kinetics curves confirms the assumption about the decisive role of impurities in the crystallization processes of any alloys. The confirmation of the hypothesis about the decisive role of impurities in the processes of crystallization from positions of heterogeneous nucleation is the dependence of the number of solidified drops with the same diameter on the degree and duration of their overheating.</description>

      <title>Bipolarized Weyl semimetals and quantum crystal valley Hall effect in two-dimensional altermagnetic materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetism and topology are two major areas of condensed matter physics. The combination of magnetism and topology gives rise to more novel physical effects, which have attracted strongly theoretical and experimental attention. Recently, the concept of altermagnetism has been introduced, characterized by a dual nature: real-space antiferromagnetism and reciprocal-space anisotropic spin polarization. The amalgamation of altermagnetism with topology may lead to the emergence of previously unobserved topological phases and the associated physical effects. In this study, utilizing a four-band lattice model that incorporates altermagnetism and spin group symmetry, we demonstrate that type-I, type-II, and type-III bipolarized Weyl semimetals can exist in altermagnetic systems. Through the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we predict four ideal two-dimensional type-I altermagnetic bipolarized Weyl semimetals Fe$_2$WTe$_4$ and Fe$_2$MoZ$_4$ (Z=S,Se,Te). More significantly, we introduce the quantum crystal valley Hall effect, a phenomenon achievable in three of these materials namely Fe$_2$WTe$_4$, Fe$_2$MoS$_4$, and Fe$_2$MoTe$_4$, when spin-orbit coupling is considered. Furthermore, these materials have the potential to transition from a quantum crystal valley Hall phase to a Chern insulator phase under strain. In contrast, Fe$_2$MoSe$_4$ remains to be a Weyl semimetal under spin-orbit coupling but is distinguished by possessing only a single pair of Weyl points. Additionally, the position, polarization, and number of Weyl points in Fe$_2$WTe$_4$ and Fe$_2$MoZ$_4$ can be manipulated by adjusting the direction of the N\'eel vector. Consequently, Fe$_2$WTe$_4$ and Fe$_2$MoZ$_4$ emerge as promising experimental platforms for investigating the distinctive physical attributes of various altermagnetic topological phases.</description>

Abstract: We present the ab-initio thermoelastic properties of body-centered cubic molybdenum under extreme conditions obtained within the quasi-harmonic approximation including both the vibrational and the electronic thermal excitations contributions to the free energy. The quasi-harmonic temperature dependent elastic constants are calculated and compared with existing experiments and with the quasi-static approximation. We find that the quasi-harmonic approximation allows a much better interpretation of the experimental data confirming the trend found previously in other metals. Using the Voigt-Reuss-Hill average we predict the compressional and shear sound velocities of polycrystalline molybdenum as a function of pressure for several temperatures which might be accessible in experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs) exhibit intriguing optical properties and exceptional performance in (photo)catalysis, optoelectronics, and energy storage. Nevertheless, the intricate phenomena involving light absorption extending to the visible range, long-lived excitons, photo-charging, and photochemical processes observed in PCN derivatives remain poorly understood. Our theoretical investigation elucidates the role of distinct dark and bright exciton species, exciton lifetimes, and exciton stability, correlating these findings with the microstructural attributes of PCNs. Furthermore, we elucidate the origin of trapped excitons within PCNs and deliberate on the role of trapped excitons in catalytic reactivity.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-Embedding Graph Neural Network for Direct Prediction of Optical Spectra from Crystal Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical properties in solids, such as refractive index and absorption, hold vast applications ranging from solar panels to sensors, photodetectors, and transparent displays. However, first-principles computation of optical properties from crystal structures is a complex task due to the high convergence criteria and computational cost. Recent progress in machine learning shows promise in predicting material properties, yet predicting optical properties from crystal structures remains challenging due to the lack of efficient atomic embeddings. Here, we introduce GNNOpt, an equivariance graph-neural-network architecture featuring automatic embedding optimization. This enables high-quality optical predictions with a dataset of only 944 materials. GNNOpt predicts all optical properties based on the Kramers-Kr{\"o}nig relations, including absorption coefficient, complex dielectric function, complex refractive index, and reflectance. We apply the trained model to screen photovoltaic materials based on spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency and search for quantum materials based on quantum weight. First-principles calculations validate the efficacy of the GNNOpt model, demonstrating excellent agreement in predicting the optical spectra of unseen materials. The discovery of new quantum materials with high predicted quantum weight, such as SiOs which hosts exotic quasiparticles, demonstrates GNNOpt's potential in predicting optical properties across a broad range of materials and applications.</description>

      <title>Light-induced percolative topological phase transition in type-II Weyl semimetal WTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an ultrafast terahertz free-carrier dynamic study of a photo-excited WTe2 thin film. In the photo-excited state, we observe a metastable electronic state of anomaly, featuring a negative differential terahertz photoconductivity. Detailed electrodynamics analysis and first-principal calculation attribute it to light-induced topological phase transition, reducing density of states near the Fermi level. Furthermore, the emergence of an unconventional temporal isosbestic point marks a dynamic universality, strongly suggesting a percolative interaction between the two topologically distinct phases.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic Incommensurate Structure Modulation in Ni-Mn-Ga Martensite Exhibiting Highly Mobile Twin Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the crystal structure of magnetic shape memory alloys is crucial for insights into their unique properties, such as the high mobility of twin boundaries and magnetic field functionality. The complex neutron diffraction patterns betweeen 10-300 K indicate an incommensurate and simultaneously anharmonic modulation function (AMF) in Ni50.0Mn27.7Ga22.3 10M martensite. Our identification of the dominant Fourier components in the AMF allowed for a comparison between calculated diffraction patterns and experiments. The AMF explains the appearance of peculiar small-intensity diffraction peaks when nearly commensurate AMF at 300 K turns to incommensurate AMF upon cooling. Further analysis reveals that divergent periodicity between the incommensurate modulation and the lattice leads to the formation of additional nanodomains. Interpreting the modulation displacements within the nanodomains in the terms of the (2-3)2 stacking sequence of basal (110) planes enables to understand that these nanodomains are emerging a/b nanotwins. The nanotwinning interlinked with incommensurate modulation also explains the transition from the tetragonal to the orthorhombic symmetry upon cooling. We identify specific low-temperature orthorhombic structures, like 34O, 24O, 14O, which are significant as their unit cell simultaneously represents an a/b-nanotwin. The ab initio calculations confirm the stability and low and comparable energy of all found nanotwinned structures. Based on the presumed stability of the nanotwinned state and literature comparisons, we propose that the low temperature state of the martensite nominally marked as five-layered modulated, 5M or 10M, is one of the specific a/b-nanotwinned configurations such as 34O, 24O, 14O. The exact choice depends on the composition, but 14O resulting from q = 3/7 is the ultimate limit with a corresponding smallest twin domain size of 3.5 nm.</description>

      <title>Design criteria for zero-strain behavior in iron-based fluorides of tungsten bronze type as cathode materials for alkali ion batteries -- a first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical stresses and strains in the microstructure of cathode materials evolving during charge/discharge cycles can reduce the long-term stability of intercalation-type alkali-metal-ion batteries. In this context, crystalline compounds exhibiting zero-strain (ZS) behavior are of particular interest. Near-ZS sodiation was experimentally measured in the \textit{tetragonal tungsten bronze} (TTB) type compound Na$_x$FeF$\mathrm{_3}$. Using a first-principles method based on density functional theory, we investigate the potential of iron-based fluoride compounds with tungsten bronze (TB) structures as ZS cathode materials. Simulations were conducted to study the intercalation of the alkali metal ions Li$\mathrm{^+}$, Na$\mathrm{^+}$, and K$\mathrm{^+}$ into the TTB and two related TB structures of the cubic perovskite (PTB) and hexagonal (HTB) types. We describe compensating local volume effects that can explain the experimentally measured low volume change of Na$_x$FeF$\mathrm{_3}$. We discuss the structural and chemical prerequisites of the host lattice for ZS insertion mechanism for alkali ions in TB structures and present a qualitative descriptor to predict the local volume change, that provides a way for faster screening and discovery of novel ZS battery materials.</description>

      <title>Lone Pair Induced 1D Character and Weak Cation-anion Interactions: Two Ingredients for Low Thermal Conductivity in Mixed-anion Metal Chalcohalides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-anion compounds, which incorporate multiple types of anions into materials, displays tailored crystal structures and physical/chemical properties, garnering immense interests in various applications such as batteries, catalysis, photovoltaics, and thermoelectrics. However, detailed studies regarding correlations between crystal structure, chemical bonding, and thermal/vibrational properties are rare for these compounds, which limits the exploration of mixed-anion compounds for associated thermal applications. In this work, we investigate the lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties of the metal chalcohalides, CuBiSCl2. A high-purity polycrystalline CuBiSCl2 sample, successfully synthesized via modified solid-state synthetic method, exhibits a low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.9-0.6 W m-1 K-1 from 300 to 573 K. By combining various experimental techniques including 3D electron diffraction with theoretical calculations, we elucidate the origin of low lattice thermal conductivity in CuBiSCl2. The stereo-chemical activity of the 6s2 lone pair of Bi3+ favors an asymmetric environment with neighboring anions involving both short and long bond lengths. This particularity often implies weak bonding, low structure dimensionality, and strong anharmonicity, leading to low lattice thermal conductivity. In addition, the strong two-fold linear S-Cu-S coordination with weak Cu -- Cl interactions induces large anisotropic vibration of Cu or structural disorder, which enables strong phonon-phonon scattering and decreases lattice thermal conductivity. The investigations into lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties of CuBiSCl2 broadens the scope of the existing mixed-anion compounds suitable for the associated thermal applications, offering a new avenue for the search of low thermal conductivity materials in low-cost mixed-anion compounds.</description>

      <title>Experimental and Computational Insights Into the Magnetic Anisotropy and Magnetic Behaviour of Layered Room-Temperature Ferromagnet Cr$_{1.38}$Te$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, critical behaviour, and magnetocaloric effect in the layered room-temperature monoclinic ferromagnet Cr$_{1.38}$Te$_2$. The critical behavior is studied by employing various techniques such as the modified Arrott plot (MAP), the Kouvel-Fisher method (KF), and the critical isothermal analysis (CI) around the Curie temperature ($T_C$) of 316 K. The derived critical exponents are self-consistent and obey the rescaling analysis. The Monte-Carlo simulations reproduce the experimentally obtained critical exponents. However, the derived critical exponents do not suggest any single universality class of the magnetic interactions. On the other hand, the renormalization group (RG) theory suggests 3D-Ising type long-range exchange interactions [$J(r)$], decaying with distance ($r$) as $J (r) = r^{-(d+\sigma)}= r^{-4.73}$. Further, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy density (K$_u$) is found to be temperature dependent. The ground state magnetic easy-axis ($b$-axis) is identified by analyzing the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) using the density functional theory calculations. Maximum entropy change -$\Delta S_{m}^{max}$$\approx$2.51 J/kg-K is found near the $T_C$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laboratory measurements often use several instruments to fully explore the relevant parameter space; such as, an external lock-in amplifier, an electromagnet, an RF generator, etc.. Ordinarily, these instruments have to be individually controlled and their parameters have to be manually recorded. MacroQueue enables effortless measurements throughout these high-dimensional parameter space systems. MacroQueue is a modular software designed for controlling and automating various laboratory equipment in sync without requiring coding ability. Currently, it includes functions to control the 3 major commercial scanning tunneling microscopes, CreaTec, RHK, and Scienta Omicron in combination with any other instruments that are a part of the systems. It can be extended to control any instrument that can be controlled via Python.</description>

      <title>Thermal/epithermal neutron detection via LiO$_{2}$-doped fiber bundles: A computational study through GEANT4 simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15462v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the neutron capture processes in lithium or lithium-doped materials leads to the production of secondary alpha-triton pairs. The counts of these secondary charged particle pairs in the presence of thermal/epithermal neutrons indirectly give access to detecting the primary incident neutrons with the aid of the plastic scintillators by reminding that both these secondary alphas and tritons deposit their entire kinetic energy within a short range. In this study, we modify the polystyrene fiber core of Kuraray Y11-200(M) by doping with 10 wt.$\%$ LiO$_{2}$. We investigate a fiber bundle system hinged on 10 wt.$\%$ LiO$_{2}$-doped Kuraray Y11-200(M) fibers via the GEANT4 simulations by targeting the detection of the incident thermal/epithermal neutrons through the generation of the secondary alpha-triton pairs. First, we estimate an optimal number of fiber arrays by using a monoenergetic beam of thermal neutrons with a kinetic energy of 0.025 eV and we count the number of secondary alpha-triton pairs. Subsequently, we insert a pixelated photo-sensor on both ends of the fiber bundle in order to collect the entrapped optical photons. In addition to the thermal neutrons, we also explore the detection of epithermal neutrons with a kinetic energy of 1 eV by utilizing a combination of the 10 wt.$\%$ LiO$_{2}$-doped Kuraray Y11-200(M) fiber bundles and the neutron absorption layers. We demonstrate that the LiO$_{2}$-doped plastic scintillating fiber bundles are instrumental for the detection of thermal/epithermal neutrons in diverse applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15467v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This tutorial review focuses on the basic theoretical backgrounds, their working principles, and implementation of impedance spectroscopy in both electroceramics and electrochemical research and technological applications. Various contributions to the impedance, admittance, dielectric, and conductivity characteristics of electroceramic materials can be disentangled and independently characterized with the help of impedance spectroscopy as a function of frequency and temperature. In polycrystalline materials, the impedance, charge transport/ conduction mechanism, and the macroscopic dielectric properties i.e., dielectric constant and loss are typically composed of many contributions, including the bulk or grain resistance/capacitance, grain boundary, and sample-electrode interface effect. Similarly, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) endeavors to the charging kinetics, diffusion, and mechanical impact of various electrochemical systems widely used in energy storage (i.e., supercapacitor, battery), corrosion resistance, chemical and bio-sensing, diagnostics, etc. in electrolytes as a function of frequency. The understanding of various contributions in the EIS spectra i.e., kinetic control, mass control, and diffusion control is essential for their practical implications. It is demonstrated that electrochemical and electroceramics impedance spectroscopy is an effective method to explain and simulate such behavior. Deconvolute these contributions to obtain a detailed understanding of the functionality of polycrystalline electroceramic materials. This short review aims to endow the expertise of senior researchers in many fields where both EIS (electrochemical and ceramics) are involved, as well as to provide the necessary background information for junior researchers working in these fields.</description>

      <title>Towards optical neuromodulation using nitrogen-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond photoelectrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond (N-UNCD) is a form of diamond electrode with near-infrared photoresponsivity, making it well suited for physiological applications. N-UNCD's photoresponsivity is strongly influenced by its surface. While it is known that oxygen treatment provides a higher photoresponsivity, a better understanding of its surface processes is needed to tailor the material for optical neuromodulation. This work examines the impact of various oxygen treatment methods, with aim of creating oxygen rich surfaces with different chemical and structural properties. Surface characterisation methods along with electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements and modelling were used to investigate the films. It was found that oxygen furnace annealing resulted in orders of magnitude improvement in the near-infrared photoresponsivity, to 3.75 +/- 0.05 uA/W. This translates to an approximate 200 times increase in the photocurrent compared to the untreated surface. This enhancement in photocurrent is largely due to the changes in the chemical species present at the surface. The photocurrent is estimated to be sufficient for extra-cellular stimulation of brain neurons within the safe optical exposure limit, positioning N-UNCD as an excellent candidate to be used in next-generation photoelectrodes for photobiomodulation.</description>

      <title>Impact of surface treatments on the electron affinity of nitrogen-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, various forms of nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) have emerged as an attractive group of diamond/graphite mixed-phase materials for a range of applications from electron emission sources to electrodes for neural interfacing. To tailor their properties for different uses, NCD surfaces can be terminated with various chemical functionalities, in particular hydrogen and oxygen, which shift the band edge positions and electron affinity values. While the band edge positions of chemically terminated single crystal diamond are well understood, the same is not true for nanocrystalline diamond, which has uncontrolled crystallographic surfaces with a variety of chemical states as well as graphitic grain boundary regions. In this work, the relative band edge positions of as-grown, hydrogen terminated, and oxygen terminated nitrogen-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond (N-UNCD) are determined using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), while the band bending is investigated using photoelectrochemical measurements. In contrast to the widely reported negative electrode affinity of hydrogen terminated single crystal diamond, our work demonstrates that hydrogen terminated N-UNCD exhibits a positive electron affinity owing to the increased surface and bulk defect densities. These findings elucidate the marked differences in electrochemical properties of hydrogen and oxygen terminated N-UNCD, such as the dramatic changes in electrochemical capacitance.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive acoustic graphene plasmons in a graphene-transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructure: strong plasmon-phonon coupling and wavelength sensitivity enhanced by a metal screen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic plasmons in graphene exhibit strong confinement induced by a proximate metal surface and hybridize with phonons of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) when these materials are combined in a van der Waals heterostructure, thus forming screened graphene plasmon-phonon polaritons (SGPPPs), a type of acoustic mode. While SGPPPs are shown to be very sensitive to the dielectric properties of the environment, enhancing the SGPPPs coupling strength in realistic heterostructures is still challenging. Here we employ the quantum electrostatic heterostructure model, which builds upon the density functional theory calculations for monolayers, to show that the use of a metal as a substrate for graphene-TMD heterostructures (i) vigorously enhances the coupling strength between acoustic plasmons and the TMD phonons, and (ii) markedly improves the sensitivity of the plasmon wavelength on the structural details of the host platform in real space, thus allowing one to use the effect of environmental screening on acoustic plasmons to probe the structure and composition of a van der Waals heterostructure down to the monolayer resolution.</description>

Abstract: Nonpolar atoms or molecules with light particle mass and weak particle-particle interaction can form quantum liquids and solids (QLS) at low temperatures. Excess electrons can be naturally bound to the surface of a QLS in a vacuum and exhibit unique quantum electronic behaviors in two and lower dimensions. In this article, we review the historical study and recent progress in this area. The main topics covered in this review include the collective and individual electron transport on liquid helium, solid neon, and solid hydrogen, the theoretical proposal and experimental effort toward single electron qubits on superfluid helium, the recent experimental realization of single electron charge qubits on solid neon and the related theoretical calculation. In the end, we review and envision extended exploration of quantum electronics on heterogeneous QLS.</description>

Abstract: As a burgeoning technique, out-of-focus electron ptychography offers the potential for rapidly imaging atomic-scale large fields of view (FoV) using a single diffraction dataset. However, achieving robust out-of-focus ptychographic reconstruction poses a significant challenge due to the inherent scan instabilities of electron microscopes, compounded by the presence of unknown aberrations in the probe-forming lens. In this study, we substantially enhance the robustness of out-of-focus ptychographic reconstruction by extending our previous calibration method (the Fourier method), which was originally developed for the in-focus scenario. This extended Fourier method surpasses existing calibration techniques by providing more reliable and accurate initialization of scan positions and electron probes. Additionally, we comprehensively explore and recommend optimized experimental parameters for robust out-of-focus ptychography, includingaperture size and defocus, through extensive simulations. Lastly, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between ptychographic reconstructions obtained with focused and defocused electron probes, particularly in the context of low-dose and precise phase imaging, utilizing our calibration method as the basis for evaluation.</description>

      <title>Disclosing the Impact of Local Host-Emitter Interactions on Donor-Acceptor Type TADF Dynamics and the Significance for Emissive Layer Design in OLEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Donor-Acceptor (D-A) type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters which constitute the key functional units in proposed Gen3 Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs), are sensitive to the rigidity and polarity of their local environment. In particular, the torsional freedom of the D-A dihedral angle and the excited state dipole moments of the occurring charge transfer states, condition a distribution of TADF dynamics over the emitter ensemble, concealed in standard optical spectroscopy. Here we apply spectroscopy on the single molecule level to directly access individual emitter properties, and, thus, bypass the downside of ensemble averaging. By photon correlation data and locally resolved spectral information on single D-A type TADF molecules embedded in technological relevant host materials of different polarity and rigidity, we derive host-dependent characteristics and distributions in the TADF dynamics. Those can be related to the conformational freedom and the dielectric environment imposed by the specific local host rigidity and polarity, thereby pointing out new selection criteria for host-emitter combinations in OLEDs.</description>

      <title>Determining the Dielectric Constant of Solid/Liquid Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15964v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dielectric constant ($\varepsilon^{\prime}$) of interfacial water is an important parameter, but its measurement has posed challenges, and no consensus has been reached on a generalized expression. We derived a formula for $\varepsilon^{\prime}$ of a buried interface using the slab model for a half-solvated sphere: $ \varepsilon^{\prime}=\varepsilon_1 \varepsilon_2\left(\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_1+6\right) / 2\left(2 \varepsilon_2+\varepsilon_1\right)$, where $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$ are the dielectric constants of the solid and liquid phases, respectively. We experimentally validated this expression using vibrational sum frequency generation and Fresnel factor calculations for interfaces of alumina with water ($ \mathrm{H_2O} $ and $ \mathrm{D_2O} $) and acetonitrile. This fills an important knowledge gap in the description of the dielectric constant of interfaces.</description>

      <title>Odd Dipole Screening in Radial Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inflation of an inner radial (or spherical) cavity in an amorphous solids confined in a disk (or a sphere), served as a fruitful case model for studying the effects of plastic deformations on the mechanical response. It was shown that when the field associated with Eshelby quadrupolar charges is non-uniform, the displacement field is riddled with dipole charges that screen elasticity, reminiscent of Debye monopoles screening in electrostatics. In this paper we look deeper into the screening phenomenon, taking into account the consequences of irreversibility that are associated with the breaking of Chiral symmetry. We consider the equations for the displacement field with the presence of ``Odd Dipole Screening", solve them analytically and compare with numerical simulations. Suggestions how to test the theory in experiments are provided.</description>

      <title>Identification and classification of clusters of dipolar colloids in an external field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloids can acquire a dipolar interaction in the presence of an external electric field. At high field strength, the particles form strings in the field direction. However at weaker field strength, competition with isotropic interactions is expected. One means to investigate this interplay between dipolar and isotropic interactions is to consider clusters of such particles. We have therefore identified, using the GMIN basinhopping tool, a rich library of lowest energy clusters of a dipolar colloidal system where the dipole orientation is fixed with respect to the z-axis, and the dipole strength is varied for m--membered clusters of 7 &lt;= m &lt;=13. In the regime where the isotropic and dipolar interactions are comparable, we find elongated polytetrahedral, octahedral and spiral clusters as well as a set of non--rigid clusters which emerge close to the transition to strings. We further implement a search algorithm which identifies these minimum energy clusters in bulk systems using the topological cluster classification [J. Chem. Phys. 139 234506 (2013)]. We demonstrate this methodology with computer simulations which shows instances of these clusters as a function of dipole strength.</description>

      <title>Shadow Mask Molecular Beam Epitaxy for In-Plane Gradient Permittivity Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy currently requires the use of bulky, expensive, and/or fragile spectrometers. For gas sensing, environmental monitoring, or other applications in the field, an inexpensive, compact, robust on-chip spectrometer is needed. One way to achieve this goal is through gradient permittivity materials, in which the material permittivity changes as a function of position in the plane. In this paper, we demonstrate the synthesis of infrared gradient permittivity materials using shadow mask molecular beam epitaxy. The permittivity of our material changes as a function of position in the lateral direction, allowing us to confine varying wavelengths of infrared light at varying horizontal locations. We see an electric field enhancement corresponding to a wavenumber gradient of ~650 cm$^{-1}$ to 900 cm$^{-1}$ over an in-plane gradient width of ~13 $\mu$ m on the flat mesa of our sample. In addition, we see a wavenumber gradient of ~900 cm$^{-1}$ to 1250 cm$^{-1}$ over an in-plane gradient width of ~13 $\mu$m on the slope of our sample. These two different wavenumber gradient regions develop on two opposite sides of our material. This demonstration of a scalable method of creating an in-plane gradient permittivity material could be leveraged for the creation of a variety of miniature infrared devices, such as an ultracompact spectrometer.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable giant Nernst effect in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nernst effect, a transverse thermoelectric phenomenon, has attracted significant attention for its potential in energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and spintronics. However, achieving high performance and versatility at low temperatures remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate a large and electrically tunable Nernst effect by combining graphene's electrical properties with indium selenide's semiconducting nature in a field-effect geometry. Our results establish a novel platform for exploring and manipulating this thermoelectric effect, showcasing the first electrical tunability with an on/off ratio of 10^3. Moreover, photocurrent measurements reveal a stronger photo-Nernst signal in the Gr/InSe heterostructure compared to individual components. Remarkably, we observe a record-high Nernst coefficient of 66.4 {\mu}V K^(-1) T^(-1) at ultra-low temperatures and low magnetic fields, paving the way toward applications in quantum information and low-temperature emergent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Nanopatterning of multicomponent van der Waals heterostructures using atomic force microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilayer van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have become an important platform in which to study novel fundamental effects emerging at the nanoscale. Standard nanopatterning techniques relying on electron-beam lithography and reactive ion etching, widely applied to pattern such heterostructures, however, impose some limitations on the edge accuracy and resolution, as revealed through numerous experiments with vdW quantum dots and point contacts. Here we present an alternative approach for electrode-free nanopatterning of thick multilayer vdW heterostructures based on atomic force microscopy (AFM). By applying an AC voltage of a relatively small frequency (1-10 kHz) between the sharp platinum tip and the substrate, we realize high-resolution ($\lesssim 100$ nm) etching of thick multicomponent heterostructures if the latter are deposited onto graphite slabs. Importantly, unlike more conventional electrode-free local anodic oxidation, our method does not require a special environment with excess humidity, can be applied at ambient conditions, and enables the patterning of multilayer heterostructures composed of graphene, graphite, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), NbSe$_{2}$, WSe$_{2}$, and more.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the orbital flux phase in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ from polar Kerr effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Rb, Cs) family of Kagome metals hosts unconventional charge density wave order whose nature is still an open puzzle. Accumulated evidences point to a time-reversal symmetry breaking orbital flux phase that carries loop currents. Such an order may support anomalous Hall effect. However, the polar Kerr effect measurements that probe the a.c. anomalous Hall conductivity seems to have yielded contradictory results. We first argue on symmetry grounds that some previously proposed orbital flux order, most notably the one with Star-of-David distortion, shall not give rise to anomalous Hall or polar Kerr effects. We further take the tri-hexagonal orbital flux phase as an exemplary Kagome flux order that does exhibit anomalous Hall response, and show that the Kerr rotation angle at two relevant experimental optical frequencies generally reaches microradians to sub-milliradians levels. A particularly sharp resonance enhancement is observed at around $\hbar \omega =1$ eV, suggesting exceedingly large Kerr rotation at the corresponding probing frequencies not yet accessed by previous experiments. Our study can help to interpret the Kerr measurements on $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and to eventually resolve the nature of their CDW order.</description>

      <title>Spin order and dynamics in the topological rare-earth germanide semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $RE$Al(Si,Ge) ($RE$ = rare earth) family, known to break both the inversion- and time-reversal symmetries, represents one of the most suitable platforms for investigating the interplay between correlated-electron phenomena and topologically nontrivial bands. Here, we report on systematic magnetic, transport, and muon-spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements on (Nd,Sm)AlGe single crystals, which exhibit antiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions at $T_\mathrm{N} = 6.1$ and 5.9 K, respectively. In addition, NdAlGe undergoes also an incommensurate-to-commensurate ferrimagnetic transition at 4.5 K. Weak transverse-field $\mu$SR measurements confirm the AFM transitions, featuring a $\sim$90 % magnetic volume fraction. In both cases, zero-field (ZF) $\mu$SR measurements reveal a more disordered internal field distribution in NdAlGe than in SmAlGe, reflected in a larger transverse muon-spin relaxation rate $\lambda^\mathrm{T}$ at $T \ll T_\mathrm{N}$. This may be due to the complex magnetic structure of NdAlGe, which undergoes a series of metamagnetic transitions in an external magnetic field, while SmAlGe shows only a robust AFM order. In NdAlGe, the topological Hall effect (THE) appears between the first and the second metamagnetic transitions for $H \parallel c$, while it is absent in SmAlGe. Such THE in NdAlGe is most likely attributed to the field-induced topological spin textures. The longitudinal muon-spin relaxation rate $\lambda^\mathrm{L}(T)$, diverges near the AFM order, followed by a clear drop at $T &lt; T_\mathrm{N}$. In the magnetically ordered state, spin fluctuations are significantly stronger in NdAlGe than in SmAlGe. In general, our longitudinal-field $\mu$SR data indicate vigorous spin fluctuations in NdAlGe, thus providing valuable insights into the origin of THE and of the possible topological spin textures in $RE$Al(Si,Ge) Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In designing material functionality within the intricate realm of transition metal oxides, lattice structure and d-orbital occupancy are two principal determinants of the correlated physical properties, such as superconductivity. However, the modulation of these two factors is inherently limited by the need to balance thermodynamic stability, kinetic mobility, and synthesis precision, particularly for oxidation-demanding phases. We introduce a methodology, namely the gigantic-oxidative atomically layered epitaxy (GOAL-Epitaxy), enhancing oxidation power 3-4 orders of magnitude beyond oxide molecular beam epitaxy (OMBE) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD), while ensuring atomic-layer-by-layer growth of designed complex structures. Consequently, thermodynamic stability is markedly augmented at elevated temperatures, improving growth kinetics. We demonstrate the accurate synthesis of complex nickelates and cuprates, especially an artificially designed structure as a parent of high-temperature superconductivity, in which alternating single and double NiO2 layers possess distinct nominal d-orbital occupancy. The GOAL-Epitaxy enables material discovery within the vastly broadened growth parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is common knowledge that noble metals are excellent conductors but do not exhibit superconductivity. On the other hand, quantum confinement in thin films has been consistently shown to induce a significant enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature in several superconductors. It is therefore an important fundamental question whether ultra-thin film confinement may induce observable superconductivity in non-superconducting metals. We present a generalization, in the Eliashberg framework, of a BCS theory of superconductivity in good metals under thin-film confinement. By numerically solving these new Eliashberg-type equations, we find the dependence of the superconducting critical temperature on the film thickness $L$. This parameter-free theory predicts a maximum increase in the critical temperature for a specific value of the film thickness, which is a function of the number of free carriers in the material. Exploiting this fact, we predict that ultra-thin films of gold, silver and copper of suitable thickness could be superconductors at low but experimentally accessible temperatures. We demonstrate that this is a fine-tuning problem where the thickness must assume a very precise value, close to half a nanometer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural superlubricity is a special frictionless contact in which two crystals are in incommensurate arrangement such that relative in-plane translation is associated with vanishing energy barrier crossing. So far, it has been realized in multilayer graphene and other van der Waals two-dimensional crystals with hexagonal or triangular crystalline symmetries, leading to isotropic frictionless contacts. Directional structural superlubricity, to date unrealized in two-dimensional systems, is possible when the reciprocal lattices of the two crystals coincide in one direction only. Here, we evidence directional structural superlubricity a $\alpha$-bismuthene/graphite van der Waals system, manifested by spontaneous hopping of the islands over hundreds of nanometres at room temperature, resolved by low-energy electron microscopy and supported by registry simulations. Statistical analysis of individual and collective $\alpha$-bismuthene islands populations reveal a heavy-tailed distribution of the hopping lengths and sticking times indicative of L\'evy flight dynamics, largely unobserved in massive condensed-matter systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of geometric frustration on dilational mechanical metamaterial membranes. While shape frustrated elastic plates can only accommodate non-zero Gaussian curvature up to size scales that ultimately vanish with their elastic thickness, we show that frustrated {\it metamembranes} accumulate hyperbolic curvatures up to mesoscopic length scales that are ultimately independent of the size of their microscopic constituents. A continuum elastic theory and discrete numerical model describe the size-dependent shape and internal stresses of axisymmetric, trumpet-like frustrated metamembranes, revealing a non-trivial crossover to a much weaker power-law growth in elastic strain energy with size than in frustrated elastic membranes. We study a consequence of this for the self-limiting assembly thermodynamics of frustrated trumpets, showing a several-fold increase the size range of self-limitation of metamembranes relative to elastic membranes.</description>

      <title>GeoMFormer: A General Architecture for Geometric Molecular Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular modeling, a central topic in quantum mechanics, aims to accurately calculate the properties and simulate the behaviors of molecular systems. The molecular model is governed by physical laws, which impose geometric constraints such as invariance and equivariance to coordinate rotation and translation. While numerous deep learning approaches have been developed to learn molecular representations under these constraints, most of them are built upon heuristic and costly modules. We argue that there is a strong need for a general and flexible framework for learning both invariant and equivariant features. In this work, we introduce a novel Transformer-based molecular model called GeoMFormer to achieve this goal. Using the standard Transformer modules, two separate streams are developed to maintain and learn invariant and equivariant representations. Carefully designed cross-attention modules bridge the two streams, allowing information fusion and enhancing geometric modeling in each stream. As a general and flexible architecture, we show that many previous architectures can be viewed as special instantiations of GeoMFormer. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the power of GeoMFormer. All empirical results show that GeoMFormer achieves strong performance on both invariant and equivariant tasks of different types and scales. Code and models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/c-tl/GeoMFormer.</description>

      <title>Identifying Constitutive Parameters for Complex Hyperelastic Materials using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15640v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying constitutive parameters in engineering and biological materials, particularly those with intricate geometries and mechanical behaviors, remains a longstanding challenge. The recent advent of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offers promising solutions, but current frameworks are often limited to basic constitutive laws and encounter practical constraints when combined with experimental data. In this paper, we introduce a robust PINN-based framework designed to identify material parameters for soft materials, specifically those exhibiting complex constitutive behaviors, under large deformation in plane stress conditions. Distinctively, our model emphasizes training PINNs with multi-modal synthetic experimental datasets consisting of full-field deformation and loading history, ensuring algorithm robustness even with noisy data. Our results reveal that the PINNs framework can accurately identify constitutive parameters of the incompressible Arruda-Boyce model for samples with intricate geometries, maintaining an error below 5%, even with an experimental noise level of 5%. We believe our framework provides a robust modulus identification approach for complex solids, especially for those with geometrical and constitutive complexity.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Thomas-Fermi Potential for Three-Dimensional Condensed Matter Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01600v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We proposed a formally exact, probabilistic method to assess the validity of the Thomas-Fermi potential for three-dimensional condensed matter systems where electron dynamics is constrained to the Fermi surface. Our method, which relies on accurate solutions of the radial Schr\"{o}dinger equation, yields the probability density function for momentum transfer. This allows for the computation of its expectation values, which can be compared with unity to confirm the validity of the Thomas-Fermi approximation. We applied this method to three {\it n}-type direct-gap III-V model semiconductors (GaAs, InAs, InSb) and found that the Thomas-Fermi approximation is certainly valid at high electron densities. In these cases, the probability density function exhibits the same profile, irrespective of the material under scrutiny. Furthermore, we show that this approximation can lead to serious errors in the computation of observables when applied to GaAs at zero temperature for most electron densities under scrutiny.</description>

      <title>Photoemission angular distribution beyond the single wavevector description of photoelectron final states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a simulation procedure for angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), where a photoelectron wave function is set to be an outgoing plane wave in a vacuum associated with the emitted photoelectron wave packet. ARPES measurements on the transition metal dichalcogenide $1T$-$\mathrm{Ti}\mathrm{S}_2$ are performed, and our simulations exhibit good agreement with experiments. Analysis of our calculated final state wave functions quantitatively visualizes that they include various waves due to the boundary condition and the uneven crystal potential. These results show that a more detailed investigation of the photoelectron final states is necessary to fully explain the photon-energy- and light-polarization-dependent ARPES spectra.</description>

      <title>Orbital Kerr effect and terahertz detection via the nonlinear Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the optical response induced by a d.c. current flowing in a nonmagnetic material that lacks inversion symmetry. In this class of materials, the flowing current experiences a nonlinear Hall effect and induces a nonequilibrium orbital magnetization, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. As a result, an orbital-driven Kerr effect arises that can be used to probe not only the orbital magnetization but also the nonlinear Hall effect. In addition, in the long wavelength limit, the nonlinear Hall effect leads to a rectification current that can be used to detect terahertz radiation. We apply the theory to selected model systems, such as WTe$_2$ bilayer and metallic superlattices. The nonequilibrium orbital Kerr efficiencies obtained in these systems are comparable to the largest values reported experimentally in GaAs and MoS$_2$, exceeding the values reported in metals and suggesting a large terahertz current responsivity.</description>

Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of the prominent tight-binding (TB) models for transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) available in the literature. We inspect the construction of these TB models, discuss their parameterization used and conduct a thorough comparison of their effectiveness in capturing important electronic properties. Based on these insights, we propose a novel TB model for TMDs designed for enhanced computational efficiency. Utilizing $MoS_2$ as a representative case, we explain why specific models offer a more accurate description. Our primary aim is to assist researchers in choosing the most appropriate TB model for their calculations on TMDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A charge density wave (CDW) represents an exotic state in which electrons are arranged in a long range ordered pattern in low-dimensional materials. Although our understanding of the fundamental character of CDW has been enriched after extensive studies, its relationship with functional phenomena remains relatively limited. Here, we show an unprecedented demonstration of a tunable charge-spin interconversion (CSI) in graphene/1T-TaS$_2$ van der Waals heterostructures by manipulating the distinct CDW phases in 1T-TaS$_2$. Whereas CSI from spins polarized in all three directions are observed in the heterostructure when the CDW phase does not show commensurability, the output of one of the components disappears and the other two are enhanced when the CDW phase becomes commensurate. The experimental observation is supported by first-principles calculations, which evidence that chiral CDW multidomains are at the origin of the switching of CSI. Our results uncover a new approach for on-demand CSI in low-dimensional systems, paving the way for advanced spin-orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>Spintronic devices and applications using noncollinear anti-chiral antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic materials have a vanishingly small net magnetization, which generates weak dipolar fields and makes them robust against external magnetic perturbation and rapid magnetization dynamics, as dictated by the geometric mean of their exchange and anisotropy energies. However, experimental and theoretical techniques to detect and manipulate the antiferromagnetic order in a fully electrical manner must be developed to enable advanced spintronic devices with antiferromagnets (AFMs) as their active spin-dependent elements. Among the various AFMs, conducting AFMs offer high electrical and thermal conductivities and strong electron-spin-phonon interactions. Noncollinear metallic AFMs with negative chirality, including Mn3Sn, Mn3Ge, and Mn3GaN, offer rich physics that arises from their topology. In this review article, we introduce the crystal structure and the physical phenomena observed in negative chirality AFMs. Experimental and theoretical advances related to current-induced dynamics on the spin structure of Mn3Sn are discussed. We then present a potential AFM spintronic device that can serve as a non-volatile memory, high-frequency signal generator, neuron emulator, and even a probabilistic bit, depending on the design parameters and the input stimuli, i.e., amplitude and pulse width of the injected spin current and the external magnetic field. In this device, spin-orbit torques can be used to manipulate the order parameter, while the device state can be read via tunneling magnetoresistance. We also present analytic models that relate the performance characteristics of the device with its design parameters, thus enabling a rapid technology-device assessment. Effects of Joule heating and thermal noise on the device characteristics are briefly discussed. We close the paper by summarizing the status of research and present our outlook in this rapidly evolving research field.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism in NiSi and antiferromagnetic candidate materials with non-collinear spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a new class of magnetic phenomenon, called altermagnetism, was proposed where the underlying spin configuration resembles antiferromagnetic structure, but the system violates \textbf{PT} (PT: Parity times Time reversal) symmetry due to the alternation of crystalline symmetry across magnetic ions. Although the original idea was proposed for the collinear spin structure, a recent report by Cheong et al. has suggested that antiferromagnetic materials with non-collinear spin structure and local alternation of crystalline arrangement can also manifest altermagnetism. Besides breaking the \textbf{PT} symmetry, altermagnetic compounds are also expected to exhibit anomalous Hall effects of odd orders. Here, we discuss possible candidates in this regard. One example is nickel monosilicide, which was recently shown to exhibit high temperature antiferromagnetism with non-collinear spin structure. It fulfills both criteria of breaking the \textbf{PT} symmetry and manifesting nonlinear anomalous Hall effect. In addition to NiSi, we also discuss other potential antiferromagnetic materials with non-collinear spin configuration for the exploration of altermagnetic states.</description>

      <title>Accelerating materials discovery for polymer solar cells: Data-driven insights enabled by natural language processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simulation of various active learning strategies for the discovery of polymer solar cell donor/acceptor pairs using data extracted from the literature spanning $\sim$20 years by a natural language processing pipeline. While data-driven methods have been well established to discover novel materials faster than Edisonian trial-and-error approaches, their benefits have not been quantified for material discovery problems that can take decades. Our approach demonstrates a potential reduction in discovery time by approximately 75 %, equivalent to a 15 year acceleration in material innovation. Our pipeline enables us to extract data from greater than 3300 papers which is $\sim$5 times larger and therefore more diverse than similar data sets reported by others. We also trained machine learning models to predict the power conversion efficiency and used our model to identify promising donor-acceptor combinations that are as yet unreported. We thus demonstrate a pipeline that goes from published literature to extracted material property data which in turn is used to obtain data-driven insights. Our insights include active learning strategies that can be used to train strong predictive models of material properties or be robust to the initial material system used. This work provides a valuable framework for data-driven research in materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New hard magnetic materials with zero or low rare earth content are in demand due to the high prices of the rare earth metals. Among the candidates for such materials, we consider MnB, FeB and their alloys, because previous experiments suggest that FeB has a relatively high magnetic hardness of about 0.83 at room temperature. Using first-principles calculations, we examine the full range of alloys from CrB, through MnB, FeB, to CoB. Furthrmore, we consider alloys of MnB and FeB with substitutions of 3$d$, 4$d$ and 5$d$ transition metals. For the above ninety compositions, we determine magnetic moment, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and magnetic hardness. For (Fe-Co)B alloys, the calculated values of magnetic hardness exceed five, which is an exceptionally high. While these values are inflated by the virtual crystal approximation used, we still expect actual magnetic hardnesses well above unity. Furthermore, we classify considered MnB alloys substituted with transition metals as magnetically soft or semi-hard and FeB alloys with Sc, Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta or W as magnetically hard (with magnetic hardness exceeding unity).</description>

Abstract: Electron-correlation-driven phonon soft modes have been recently reported in the antiferromagnetic kagome FeGe compound and associated with the observed charge density wave (CDW). In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the CDW origin in the context of the ab initio lattice dynamics study. Performing the group theory analysis of the mentioned soft mode, we found that the stable structure has the Immm symmetry and can be achieved by shifts of Ge atoms. Additionally, we show that the final structure realizes a distorted honeycomb Ge lattice as well as a non-flat kagome-like Fe net. For completeness, we present the electronic properties calculations. From the theoretical STM topography simulation, we indicate that the observed CDW occurs in the deformed honeycomb Ge sublattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study on the magnetic signals of structural surface defects like cracks or indents combined with rough surfaces or subsurface inclusions of soft ferromagnetic metals like body-centered cubic Fe or amorphous CoFeB. We discuss limits of early detection of small surface defects on the basis of calculated magnetic stray fields few tens of nm above the surface. The considered surface imperfections have extensions of a few nm which correspond to low multiples of the magnetic exchange lengths of Fe or CoFeB. The detection of such small inhomogeneities requires that the sensor is about as close to the surface as the size of the inhomogeneity is. Furthermore, the step width of a scanning sensor must be of the same size as well. Both these requirements may be fulfilled for instance by scanning microscopy with diamond nitrogen-vacancy-center quantum sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamics of plasmons in nanoribbons of (hydrogen intercalated) quasi-free-standing single layer graphene is studied by terahertz spectroscopy both in the steady state and upon photoexcitation by an ultrashort near infrared laser pulse. The use of two-dimensional frequency domain analysis of the optical pump - THz probe signals allows us to determine the evolution of carrier temperature and plasmon characteristics with ~100 fs time resolution. Namely, we find that the carrier temperature decreases from more than 5000 K to the lattice temperature within about 7 ps and that during this evolution the carrier mobility remains practically constant. The time-resolved THz conductivity spectra suggest that graphene nanoribbons contain defects which act as low potential barriers causing a weak localization of charges; the potential barriers are overcome upon photoexcitation. Furthermore, the edges of graphene nanoribbons are found to slightly enhance the scattering of carriers. The results are supported by complementary measurements using THz scanning near-field microscopy which confirm a high uniformity of the THz conductivity across the sample and demonstrate high enough sensitivity to resolve even the impact of nanometric terrace steps on SiC substrate under the graphene monolayer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion in a two-phase system is a classical problem discussed in the literature. The general solution of the one-dimensional case to this problem is revisited and a detailed derivation is proposed. The solution is discussed in relationship with ion exchange in silicate glasses. The general solution is compared with the complementary error function solution and they have identified the assumptions under which the general solution reduces to the erfc one. Interface or glass surface issues related to ion exchange are discussed in terms of the ratio between the diffusion coefficients of the diffusing alkali ions in the glass and the ion reservoir phases respectively. Another relevant issue can be identified in the assumption of instantaneous equilibrium at the two-phase interface once the contact is established. Even though this last assumption is somehow unphysical it is the common approach used in the technological application of ion exchange in silicate glass which is justified when the contact time that is immersion time of glass with an ion reservoir is much larger than the time to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium at the surface.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Novel Silicon Allotropes with Optimized Band Gaps to Enhance Solar Cell Efficiency through Evolutionary Algorithms and Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the pursuit of advancing solar energy technologies, this study presents 20 direct and quasi-direct band gap silicon crystalline semiconductors that satisfy the Shockley-Queisser limit, a benchmark for solar cell efficiency. Employing two evolutionary algorithm-based searches, we optimize structures and calculate fitness function using the DFTB method and Gaussian approximation potential. Following the preselection of structures based on energy considerations, we further optimize them using PBEsol DFT. Subsequently, we screen the structures based on their band gap, employing a DFTB method tailored for band gap calculation of silicon crystals. To validate the structural stability, we employ phonon analysis via linear regression algorithm applied to PBEsol DFT data. To ensure accurate band gap determination, we employ HSE and GW methods. Significantly, the structures unveiled in this study are of great importance due to their proven stability from both mechanical and dynamic perspectives. Furthermore, the ductility and low density of certain structures enhance their potential application. Moreover, the study harnesses various machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model for the band gap energy of these silicon structures. Input data for machine learning models are derived from structural MBTR and SOAP descriptors, as well as DFT outputs. Notably, the results reveal that features extracted from DFT outperform the MBTR and SOAP descriptors.</description>

      <title>Tuning the thermal conductivity of silicon nanowires by surface passivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using large scale molecular dynamics simulations, we study the thermal conductivity of bare and surface passivated silicon nanowires (SiNWs). For the cross-sectional widths $w \le 2$ nm, SiNWs become unstable because of the surface amorphosization and also due to the evaporation of a certain fraction of Si atoms. The observed surface (in-)stability is related to a large excess energy $\Delta$ of the surface Si atoms with respect to the bulk Si, resulting from the surface atoms being less coordinated and having dangling bonds.We first propose a practically relevant method that uses $\Delta$ as a guiding tool to passivate these dangling bonds with hydrogen or oxygen, stabilizing the SiNWs. These passivated SiNWs are used to calculate the thermal conductivity coefficient $\kappa$.While the expected trend of $\kappa \propto w$ is observed for all SiNWs, surface passivation provides an added flexibility of tuning $\kappa$ with the surface coverage concentration $c$ of passivated atoms.Indeed, with respect to the bulk $\kappa$, passivation of SiNW reduces $\kappa$ by 75-80\% for $c \to 50\%$ and recovers again by 50\% for the fully passivated samples. Analyzing the phonon band structures via spectral energy density, we discuss separate contributions from the surface and the core to $\kappa$. Our results also reveal that surface passivation increases SiNW stiffness, contributing to the tunability in $\kappa$.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical analysis of dynamic facilitation in glass-forming liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a computational strategy to quantify the temperature evolution of the timescales and lengthscales over which dynamic facilitation affects the relaxation dynamics of glass-forming liquids at low temperatures, that requires no assumption about the nature of the dynamics. In two glass models, we find that dynamic facilitation depends strongly on temperature, leading to a subdiffusive spreading of relaxation events which we characterize using a temperature-dependent dynamic exponent. We also establish that this temperature evolution represents a major contribution to the increase of the structural relaxation time.</description>

      <title>Impact of disorder in Nd-based pyrochlore magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of the antiferromagnetic all-in--all-out state observed in dipolar-octupolar pyrochlores that have neodymium as the magnetic species. Different types of disorder are considered, either affecting the immediate environment of the Nd$^{3+}$ ion, or substituting it with a non-magnetic ion. Starting from the well studied Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ compound, Ti substitution on the Zr site and dilution on the Nd magnetic site with La substitution are investigated. The recently discovered entropy stabilized compound NdMox, which exhibits a high degree of disorder on the non magnetic site is also studied. Using a range of experimental techniques, especially very low-temperature magnetization and neutron scattering, we show that the all-in--all-out state is very robust and withstands substitutional disorder up to large rates. From these measurements, we estimate the Hamiltonian parameters and discuss their evolution in the framework of the phase diagram of dipolar-octupolar pyrochlore magnets.</description>

      <title>Emergent Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless and Kugel-Khomskii physics in the triangular lattice bilayer colbaltate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the experiments on the triangular lattice bilayer colbaltate K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$, we formulate a theory to explore the underlying physics from a couple observation. The model is composed of interacting Co$^{2+}$ dimers on the triangular lattice, where the Co$^{2+}$ ion provides an effective spin-1/2 local moment via the spin-orbit coupling and the crystal field effect. The intra-dimer interaction is dominant and would simply favor the local spin singlet, and the inter-dimer interactions compete with the inter-dimer interaction, leading to rich behaviors. With the easy-axis anisotropy, it is shown that, in the ground state manifold of the intra-dimer Ising interaction, the system realizes an effective transverse field Ising model, where the ground state is either a three-sublattice order or Ising disordered. The finite temperature regime naturally realizes the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless physics. To explore the full excitations, we incorporate the excited state manifold of the intra-dimer Ising interaction and establish the emergent Kugel-Khomskii physics. Thus, the triangular lattice bilayer colbaltate is an excellent platform to explore the interplay between geometrical frustration and anisotropic interactions as well as the emergent effective models and the resulting physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Stabilization and Flat Hydrogen-based Bands of Nitrogen-doped Lutetium Hydride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore electronic and structural properties of Fm$\overline{3}$m Lu-H-N structures with specific N,H ordering as plausible candidates for near-ambient superconductivity possibly originating from their remarkably narrow hydrogen-based bands at the Fermi level. Although LuH$_{2.875}$N$_{0.125}$ exhibits an instability persisting up to 17 GPa, it is anharmonically stable near ambient pressure when accounting for quantum nuclear effects. The presence of flat bands near $E_\text{F}$ is understood to arise from destructive\ quantum interference between N-p and surrounding H-s orbitals, with certain types of defects leaving the flat bands unaffected. The results suggest there is an optimal pressure near ambient where the superconducting $T_{\text{c}}$ is maximized in this structure by anharmonically-stabilized low-frequency and non-adiabatically coupled high-frequency hydrogen modes. Despite the metastability of this structure, its electronic properties and dynamical stability when calculated beyond a classical harmonic approach can explain the reported near-ambient superconductivity in Lu-H-N.</description>

      <title>Tunable Spatiotemporal Orders in Driven Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that driving optical phonons above a threshold fluence induces spatiotemporal orders, where material properties oscillate at an incommensurate wavevector $q_0$ in space and at half the drive frequency in time. The order is robust against temperature on timescales much larger than the lifetime of the excited modes and can be accompanied by a static $2q_0$ modulation. We make predictions for time-resolved diffraction and provide estimates for candidate materials. Our results show the possibility of using THz waves in solids to realize tunable incommensurate order on the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Ultra-thin transistors and circuits for conformable electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adapting electronics to perfectly conform to non-planar and rough surfaces, such as human skin, is a very challenging task which, if solved, could open up new applications in fields of high economic and scientific interest ranging from health to robotics, wearable electronics, human machine interface and Internet of Things. The key to success lies in defining a technology that can lead to the fabrication of ultra-thin devices while exploiting materials that are ultimately thin, with high mechanical flexibility and excellent electrical properties. Here, we report a hybrid approach for the definition of high-performance, ultra-thin and conformable electronic devices and circuits, based on the integration of ultimately thin semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), i.e., MoS2, with organic gate dielectric material, i.e., polyvinyl formal (PVF) combined with the ink-jet printing of conductive PEDOT:PSS ink for electrodes definition. Through this cost-effective, fully bottom-up and solution-based approach, transistors and simple digital and analogue circuits are fabricated by a sequential stacking of ultrathin (nanometer) layers on a few micron thick polyimide substrate, which guarantees the high flexibility mandatory for the targeted applications.</description>
