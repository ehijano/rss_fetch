      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive Stars at Low Metallicity: XI. Pipeline-determined Physical Properties of Magellanic Cloud OB Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proximity &amp; low dust extinction of the Magellanic Clouds provides an ideal environment for metal-poor massive stars to be studied in detail. The HST ULLYSES initiative has provided exquisite ultraviolet spectroscopy of a large sample of OB stars in the Magellanic Clouds, and its legacy value has been enhanced through the acquisition of optical VLT/XShooter spectroscopy (XShootU). We aim to determine the spectral types and physical properties of 122 LMC &amp; 103 SMC OB stars observed via XShootU. Physical parameters are required for these to serve as templates in spectral libraries of metal poor massive stars. We also aim to identify double-lined binaries and OeBe stars for which analysis requires non-standard treatment. We apply a pipeline designed to analyse large spectroscopic samples of hot luminous stars to XShootU spectroscopic datasets, together with grids of synthetic model spectra computed with the non-LTE atmospheric code fastwind at LMC &amp; SMC metallicities. We determine physical and wind properties of 97 LMC &amp; 77 SMC massive stars, ranging from O2 to B9 subtypes, representing the majority of the XShootU OB sample (OeBe &amp; candidate SB2 systems are excluded). Results are broadly in agreement with previous optical spectroscopic studies, with evolutionary masses spanning 12-117 Msun in the LMC &amp; 11-74 Msun in the SMC. We determine a revised Teff-spectral type calibration for Magellanic Cloud stars, identify stars with peculiar radial velocities, and compare wind properties of high luminosity O stars with dense winds, revealing ~0.27 dex higher wind momenta of LMC stars with respect to SMC counterparts. Incorporating the recent empirical metallicity dependence of Z^0.22 for wind velocities, this suggests a mass-loss dependence of Z^0.5 for luminous O stars. Studies incorporating ultraviolet mass-loss diagnostics are required for OB stars with weak winds and/or low luminosities.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project XIV. New clues on the location of the TAMS in the massive star domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars play a very important role in many astrophysical fields. Yet, some fundamental aspects of their evolution remain poorly constrained. In this regard, there is an open debate on the width of the main-sequence (MS) phase. We aim to create an updated Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram that includes a volume-limited and statistically significant sample of massive stars. Our goal is to use this sample to investigate the extension of the MS, including information about projected rotational velocities ($v\sin i$) and the spectroscopic binary status. We combine spectroscopic parameters derived with FASTWIND stellar atmosphere code and Gaia distances to obtain stellar parameters for 876 Galactic luminous O- and B-type stars gathered within the IACOB project. We use the ${\tt iacob-broad}$ tool to derive $v\sin i$ estimates and multi-epoch spectra to identify single/double-line spectroscopic binaries (SB1/SB2). We present an HR diagram for 670 stars located within 2500pc balancing completeness and number. We evaluate the extension of the MS in terms of the drop in the relative number of stars as a function of effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$). We find a consistent boundary at $\approx$22.5kK within the full range of luminosities that we use to delineate the terminal-age main sequence (TAMS). We obtain a smooth decrease of the highest $v\sin i$ with $T_{\rm eff}$ along the MS, likely limited by the critical velocity. We consider this effect combined with a lower expected fraction of stars beyond the MS as the best explanation for the lack of fast-rotating objects in the post-MS region. Our results favor low to mild initial rotation for the full sample and a binary past for the tail of fast-rotating stars. The prominence of SB1/SB2 systems in the MS, and the 25% decrease in the relative fraction of SB1 systems when crossing the TAMS can further delineate its location.</description>

      <title>Simulating the photospheric to coronal plasma using magnetohydrodyanamic characteristics II: reflections on non-reflecting boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our implementation of non-reflecting boundary conditions in the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code LaRe3D. This implementation couples a characteristics-based boundary condition with a Lagrangian remap code, demonstrating the generality and flexibility of such non-reflecting boundary conditions for use with arbitrary grid-based MHD schemes. To test this implementation for perturbations on a background state, we present simulations of a hot sphere in an angled magnetic field. We then examine a series of simulations where we advect a spheromak through a non-reflecting boundary condition at four speeds related to the fast and slow magnetosonic speeds and the Alfven speed. We compare the behavior of these simulations to ground truth simulations run from the same initial condition on an extended grid that keeps the spheromak in the simulation volume at all times. We find that the non-reflecting boundary condition can lead to severe, physical differences developing between a simulation using a non-reflecting boundary and a ground truth simulation using a larger simulation volume. We conclude by discussing the origins of these differences.</description>

      <title>Characterising the multiple protostellar system VLA 1623-2417 with JWST, ALMA and VLA: outflow origins, dust growth and an unsettled disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilising JWST, ALMA and the VLA we present high angular resolution (0.06''- 0.42''), multi-wavelength (4 micron - 3cm) observations of the VLA 1623-2417 protostellar system to characterise the origin, morphology and, properties of the continuum emission. JWST observations at 4.4 micron reveal outflow cavities for VLA 1623 A and, for the first time, VLA 1623 B, as well as scattered light from the upper layers of the VLA 1623 W disk. We model the millimetre-centimetre spectral energy distributions to quantify the relative contributions of dust and ionised gas emission, calculate dust masses, and use spectral index maps to determine where optical depth hinders this analysis. In general, all objects appear to be optically thick down to ~90 GHz, show evidence for significant amounts (10's - 100's M_Earth) of large (&gt;1 mm) dust grains, and are dominated by ionised gas emission for frequencies ~&lt;15 GHz. In addition, we find evidence of unsettled millimetre dust in the inclined disk of VLA 1623 B possibly attributed to instabilities within the circumstellar disk, adding to the growing catalogue of unsettled Class 0/I disks. Our results represent some of the highest resolution observations possible with current instrumentation, particularly in the case of the VLA. However, our interpretation is still limited at low frequencies (~&lt;22 GHz) and thus motivates the need for next-generation interferometers operating at centimetre wavelengths.</description>

      <title>The PICS Project. I. The impact of metallicity and helium abundance on the bright end of the planetary nebula luminosity function</title>

Abstract: Planetary nebulae (PNe) and their luminosity function (PNLF) in galaxies have been used as a cosmic distance indicator for decades, yet a fundamental understanding is still lacking to explain the universality of the PNLF among different galaxies. Models for the PNLF have generally assumed solar metallicities and artificial stellar populations. In this work, we investigate how metallicity and helium abundances affect the PNe and PNLF, and the importance of the initial-to-final mass relation (IFMR), to resolve the tension between PNLF observations and models. We introduce PICS (PNe In Cosmological Simulations), a PN model framework that accounts for metallicity and is applicable to realistic stellar populations from cosmological simulations and observations. The framework combines stellar evolution models with post-AGB tracks and PN models to obtain PNe from a parent stellar population. We find that metallicity plays an important role for the resulting PNe: old metal-rich populations can harbor much brighter PNe than old metal-poor ones. We show that the helium abundance is a vital ingredient at high metallicities and explore the impact on the PNLF of a possible saturation of the helium content at higher metallicities. We present PNLF grids for different stellar ages and metallicities, where the observed PNLF bright end can be reached even for old stellar populations of 10 Gyr at high metallicities. Finally, we find that the PNLFs of old stellar populations are very sensitive to the IFMR, allowing for the production of bright PNe. With PICS, we have laid the groundwork for studying how different models affect the PNe and PNLF. Two central ingredients for this are the metallicity and helium abundance. Future applications of PICS include modeling PNe in a cosmological framework to explain the origin of the universal PNLF bright-end cutoff and use it as a diagnostic tool for galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Dust evolution by chemisputtering during protostellar formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust grains play a crucial role in the modeling of protostellar formation, particularly through their opacity and interaction with the magnetic field. The destruction of dust grains in numerical simulations is currently modeled primarily by temperature dependent functions. However, a dynamical approach could be necessary to accurately model the vaporization of dust grains. We focused on modeling the evolution of dust grains during star formation, specifically on the vaporization of the grains by chemisputtering. We also investigated the evolution of non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic resistivities and the Planck and Rosseland mean opacities influenced by the grain evolution. We modeled the evolution of the dust by considering spherical grains at thermal equilibrium with the gas phase, composed only of one kind of material for each grain. We then took into account the exchange processes that can occur between the grains and the gas phase and that make the grain size evolve. We considered three materials for the grains: carbon, silicate, and aluminum oxide. Given a temporal evolution in temperature and density of the gas phase, we computed the evolution of a dust grain distribution. We observed a significant dependence of the sublimation temperature of the carbon grains on the dynamical evolution of the gas phase. The application of our method to trajectories where the temperature and density of the gas decrease after the sublimation of a portion of the grain distribution highlights the limitations of current vaporization prescriptions in simulations. The dynamical approach leads to more accurate results for the carbon grain quantity when the temperature and density of the gas evolve quickly. The dynamical approach application to collapse and disk evolution is then foreseen with its integration into hydrodynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>NEATH IV: an early onset of complex organic chemistry in molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex organic molecules (COMs) are widely detected in protostellar and protoplanetary systems, where they are thought to have been inherited in large part from earlier evolutionary phases. The chemistry of COMs in these earlier phases, namely starless and prestellar cores, remains poorly understood, as models often struggle to reproduce the observed gas-phase abundances of these species. We simulate the formation of a molecular cloud, and the cores within it, out of the diffuse interstellar medium, and follow the chemical evolution of the cloud material starting from purely-atomic initial conditions. We find that the formation of both gas- and ice-phase COMs precedes the formation of cores as distinct objects, beginning at gas densities of a few $10^3 \,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. Much of this COM-enriched material remains at these relatively modest densities for several Myr, which may provide a reservoir for accretion onto planet-forming discs in later evolutionary stages. We suggest that models of core and disc chemistry should not ignore the complex dynamical evolution which precedes these structures, even when studying supposedly late-forming molecules such as CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN.</description>

      <title>Subtle and Spectacular: Diverse White Dwarf Debris Disks Revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter reports 12 novel spectroscopic detections of warm circumstellar dust orbiting polluted white dwarfs using JWST MIRI. The disks span two orders of magnitude in fractional infrared brightness and more than double the number of white dwarf dust spectra available for mineralogical study. Among the highlights are: i) the two most subtle infrared excesses yet detected, ii) the strongest silicate emission features known for any debris disk orbiting any main-sequence or white dwarf star, iii) one disk with a thermal continuum but no silicate emission, and iv) three sources with likely spectral signatures of silica glass. The near ubiquity of solid-state emission requires small dust grains that are optically thin, and thus must be replenished on year-to-decade timescales by ongoing collisions. The disk exhibiting a featureless continuum can only be fit by dust temperatures in excess of 2000K, implying highly refractory material comprised of large particles, or non-silicate mineral species. If confirmed, the glassy silica orbiting three stars could be indicative of high-temperature processes and subsequent rapid cooling, such as occur in high-velocity impacts or vulcanism. These detections have been enabled by the unprecedented sensitivity of MIRI LRS spectroscopy and highlight the capability and potential for further observations in future cycles.</description>

      <title>Milky Way Classical Cepheids Distances from Calibrated Infrared Period-Luminosity-Metallicity Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) serve as fundamental standard candles for measuring cosmic distances and investigating the structure and evolution of the Milky Way disc. However, accurate distance estimation faces challenges due to severe extinction, particularly toward the Galactic center. Although the $Gaia$ Wesenheit magnitude reduces extinction effects, its reliance on a constant optical extinction law introduces significant uncertainties in regions of heavy obscuration. Infrared Period-Luminosity relations, combined with 3D extinction maps, offer an alternative, but these maps become unreliable beyond approximately 5 kpc. In this work, we calibrate the Period-Luminosity-Metallicity (PLZ) relations for DCEPs across three near-infrared bands ($J, H, K_S$) and four mid-infrared bands ($W1, W2, [3.6]$, and $[4.5]$). This includes the first calibration of the $W1$ and $W2$ bands. To correct for extinction, we employ the infrared multi-passband optimal distance method and the BP-RP method, which complement and validate each other. These homogeneous PLZ relations, combined with reliable extinction corrections, yield the most accurate Galactic DCEP distances to date, covering 3,452 DCEPs with an average relative distance error of 3.1%.</description>

      <title>Asymmetries and Circumstellar Interaction in the Type II SN 2024bch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive multi-epoch photometric and spectroscopic study of SN 2024bch, a nearby (19.9 Mpc) Type II supernova (SN) with prominent early high ionization emission lines. Optical spectra from 2.9 days after the estimated explosion reveal narrow lines of H I, He II, C IV, and N IV that disappear by day 6. High cadence photometry from the ground and TESS show that the SN brightened quickly and reached a peak M$_V \sim$ $-$17.8 mag within a week of explosion, and late-time photometry suggests a $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.050 M$_{\odot}$. High-resolution spectra from day 8 and 43 trace the unshocked circumstellar medium (CSM) and indicate a wind velocity of 30--40 km s$^{-1}$, a value consistent with a red supergiant (RSG) progenitor. Comparisons between models and the early spectra suggest a pre-SN mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}\ M_\odot\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which is too high to be explained by quiescent mass loss from RSGs, but is consistent with some recent measurements of similar SNe. Persistent blueshifted H I and [O I] emission lines seen in the optical and NIR spectra could be produced by asymmetries in the SN ejecta, while the multi-component H$\alpha$ may indicate continued interaction with an asymmetric CSM well into the nebular phase. SN 2024bch provides another clue to the complex environments and mass-loss histories around massive stars.</description>

      <title>Connection between planetary He I $\lambda$10830 \AA\ absorption and extreme-ultraviolet emission of planet-host stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. The detection of the He I 10830 A triplet in exoplanet atmospheres has opened a new window for probing planetary properties, including atmospheric escape. Unlike Lyman alpha, the triplet is less affected by ISM absorption. Sufficient XUV stellar irradiation may trigger the formation of the He I triplet via photoionization and posterior recombination processes in the planet atmospheres. Only a weak trend between stellar XUV and the planetary He I strength has been observed so far. Aims. We aim to confirm this mechanism for producing the He I absorption in exoplanetary atmospheres by examining a sample of planetary systems. Methods. We obtained homogeneous measurements of the planetary He I line EW and consistently computed the stellar XUV ionizing irradiation. We first derived new coronal models for the planet-host stars. We used updated data from the X-exoplanets database, archival X-ray spectra of M-type stars (including AU Mic and Proxima Cen), and new XMM-Newton X-ray data obtained for the CARMENES project. These data were complemented at longer wavelengths with publicly available HST, FUSE, and EUVE spectra. A total of 75 stars are carefully analyzed to obtain a new calibration between X-ray and EUV emission. Results. Two distinct relationships between stellar X-ray emission (5-100 A) and EUV_H (100-920 A) or EUV_He (100-504 A) radiation are obtained to scale the emission from late-type stellar coronae. A total of 48 systems with reported planetary He I 10830 A studies, exhibit a robust relationship between the planetary He I feature and the ionizing XUV_He received by the planet, corrected by stellar and planetary radii, and the planet's gravitational potential. Some outliers could be explained by a different atmospheric composition or the lack of planetary gaseous atmospheres. This relation may be used to predict the He I 10830 A absorption in exoplanet atmospheres.</description>
