      <title>PELVE from a regulatory perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under Solvency II, the Value-at-Risk (VaR) is applied, although there is broad consensus that the Expected Shortfall (ES) constitutes a more appropriate measure. Moving towards ES would necessitate specifying the corresponding ES level. The recently introduced Probability Equivalent Level of VaR and ES (PELVE) determines this by requiring that ES equals the prescribed VaR for a given future payoff, reflecting the situation of an individual insurer. We incorporate the regulator's perspective by proposing PELVE-inspired methods for multiple insurers. We analyze existence and uniqueness of the resulting ES levels, derive expressions for elliptically distributed payoffs and establish limit results for multivariate regularly distributed payoffs. A case study highlights that the choice of method is crucial when payoffs arise from different distribution families. Moreover, we recommend specific methods.</description>

      <title>On a Stationarity Theory for Stochastic Volterra Integral Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provide a comprehensive analysis of the finite and long time behavior of continuous-time non-Markovian dynamical systems, with a focus on the forward Stochastic Volterra Integral Equations(SVIEs).We investigate the properties of solutions to such equations specifically their stationarity, both over a finite horizon and in the long run. In particular, we demonstrate that such an equation does not exhibit a strong stationary regime unless the kernel is constant or in a degenerate settings. However, we show that it is possible to induce a $\textit{fake stationary regime}$ in the sense that all marginal distributions share the same expectation and variance. This effect is achieved by introducing a deterministic stabilizer $\varsigma$ associated with the kernel.We also look at the $L^p$ -confluence (for $p&gt;0$) of such process as time goes to infinity(i.e. we investigate if its marginals when starting from various initial values are confluent in $L^p$ as time goes to infinity) and finally the functional weak long-run assymptotics for some classes of diffusion coefficients. Those results are applied to the case of Exponential-Fractional Stochastic Volterra Integral Equations, with an $\alpha$-gamma fractional integration kernel, where $\alpha\leq 1$ enters the regime of $\textit{rough path}$ whereas $\alpha&gt; 1$ regularizes diffusion paths and invoke $\textit{long-term memory}$, persistence or long range dependence. With this fake stationary Volterra processes, we introduce a family of stabilized volatility models.</description>

      <title>Explicit Recursive Construction of Super-Replication Prices under Proportional Transaction Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a constructive framework for the super-hedging problem of a European contingent claim under proportional transaction costs in discrete time. Our main contribution is an explicit recursive scheme that computes both the super-hedging price and the corresponding optimal strategy without relying on martingale arguments. The method is based on convex duality and a distorted Legendre--Fenchel transform, ensuring both tractability and convexity of the value functions. A numerical implementation on real market data illustrates the practical relevance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Optimal payoff under Bregman-Wasserstein divergence constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study optimal payoff choice for an expected utility maximizer under the constraint that their payoff is not allowed to deviate ``too much'' from a given benchmark. We solve this problem when the deviation is assessed via a Bregman-Wasserstein (BW) divergence, generated by a convex function $\phi$. Unlike the Wasserstein distance (i.e., when $\phi(x)=x^2$) the inherent asymmetry of the BW divergence makes it possible to penalize positive deviations different than negative ones. As a main contribution, we provide the optimal payoff in this setting. Numerical examples illustrate that the choice of $\phi$ allow to better align the payoff choice with the objectives of investors.</description>

      <title>Rough Heston model as the scaling limit of bivariate cumulative heavy-tailed INAR processes: Weak-error bounds and option pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper links nearly unstable, heavy-tailed \emph{bivariate cumulative} INAR($\infty$) processes to the rough Heston model via a discrete scaling limit, extending scaling-limit techniques beyond Hawkes processes and providing a microstructural mechanism for rough volatility and leverage effect. Computationally, we simulate the \emph{approximating INAR($\infty$)} sequence rather than discretizing the Volterra SDE, and implement the long-memory convolution with a \emph{divide-and-conquer FFT} (CDQ) that reuses past transforms, yielding an efficient Monte Carlo engine for \emph{European options} and \emph{path-dependent options} (Asian, lookback, barrier). We further derive finite-horizon \emph{weak-error bounds} for option pricing under our microstructural approximation. Numerical experiments show tight confidence intervals with improved efficiency; as $\alpha \to 1$, results align with the classical Heston benchmark, where $\alpha$ is the roughness specification. Using the simulator, we also study the \emph{implied-volatility surface}: the roughness specification ($\alpha&lt;1$) reproduces key empirical features -- most notably the steep short-maturity ATM skew with power-law decay -- whereas the classical model produces a much flatter skew.</description>
