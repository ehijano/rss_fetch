      <title>Battery State of Health Estimation and Incremental Capacity Analysis for Charging with General Current Profiles Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and differential voltage analysis (DVA) conventionally require constant-current conditions for battery degradation monitoring, which restricts their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper presents a unified approach to enable ICA/DVA-based degradation monitoring under general charging current profiles, which has not been addressed previously in the literature. First, a novel concept of virtual incremental capacity (IC) and different voltage (DV) is proposed. Second, two related convolutional neural networks (CNNs), called U-Net and Conv-Net, are proposed to construct virtual IC/DV curves and estimate the state of health (SOH) from general charging profiles across any state-of-charge (SOC) ranges that satisfy some constraints. Finally, two CNNs, called Mobile U-Net and Mobile-Net, are proposed to replace the U-Net and Conv-Net, respectively, for onboard implementations. They significantly reduce the computation and memory requirements, while retaining performance in virtual IC/DV curve construction and SOH estimation. Tested on an extensive experimental dataset of battery modules with various fast-charging protocols and SOC ranges, the proposed U-Net and Mobile U-Net construct accurate virtual IC/DV curves which enable the extraction of valuable degradation features. The proposed Conv-Net and Mobile-Net provide module-level SOH estimates with root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 0.5%.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Performance and Impact of PV Technologies on Storage in Hybrid Renewable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional monofacial photovoltaic (mPV) systems are commonly adopted and well-documented because of their lower upfront costs in comparison to bifacial photovoltaic (bPV) systems. This study investigates how PV technologies impact energy storage in grid-scale hybrid renewable systems, focusing on optimizing and assessing the performance of mPV and bPV technologies integrated with pumped storage hydropower. Using Ludington City, Michigan as a case study and analyzing realworld data such as solar irradiance, ambient temperature, and utility-scale load profiles, the research highlights the operational and economic benefits of bPV systems. The results reveal that bPV systems can pump approximately 10.38% more water annually to the upper reservoir while achieving a lower levelized cost of energy ($0.0578/kWh for bPV vs. $0.0672/kWh for mPV). This study underscores the outstanding potential of bPV systems in enhancing energy storage and management strategies, contributing to a more sustainable and resilient renewable energy future.</description>

      <title>Dynamics on Lie groups with applications to attitude estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of filtering - propagation of probability densities through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and association of measurement data using Bayesian inference - of objects whose state space forms a Lie group is considered. Particular emphasis is given to concentrated Gaussians (CGs) as a parametric family of probability distributions to capture the uncertainty associated with an estimated group element. The so-called group-affine property of the vector field governing the state time evolution is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for the linearity of the dynamics expressed in terms of exponential coordinates, in turn implying the family of CGs is invariant under such evolution. A physically-motivated SDE on the group is then reformulated as an SDE on the associated Lie algebra via exponential coordinates. The vector space structure of the Lie algebra together with the notion of a CG enables the leveraging of techniques from conventional Gaussian-based Kalman filtering in an approach called the tangent space filter (TSF). We provide example calculations for several Lie groups that arise in the problem of estimating position, velocity, and orientation of a rigid body from a noisy, potentially biased inertial measurement unit (IMU). For the specific problem of attitude estimation, it is shown through numerical experiments that TSF-based approaches are more accurate and robust than another widely used attitude filtering technique.</description>

      <title>Transient Stability Analysis and Fault Clearing Angle Estimation of VSG Based on Domain of Attraction Estimated by Trajectory Reversing Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The virtual synchronous generator (VSG), with the analogous nonlinear power-angle relationship to the synchronous generator (SG), has attracted much attention as a promising solution for converter-based power systems. In this paper, a large signal model of the grid-connected VSG is first established. The trajectory reversing method (TRM) is then introduced to estimate the domain of attraction (DOA) of VSG. Subsequently, the transient instability mechanism is revealed in detail based on the estimated DOA boundary. The impacts of system parameters on the DOA range are further investigated. It is found that loss of synchronization (LOS) occurs if the system trajectory lies outside the post-fault DOA range. In scenarios where no equilibrium points exist after a grid fault, system stability can be reestablished only when the fault clearing angle (FCA) does not exceed the critical clearing angle (CCA). Finally, the CCA derived from the DOA and that from the conventional equal area criteria (EAC) are compared. The results show that CCA obtained by our solution has a higher accuracy. Time-domain simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed transient stability analysis method of grid-connected VSG.</description>

      <title>From Data to Sliding Mode Control of Uncertain Large-Scale Networks with Unknown Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale interconnected networks, composed of multiple low-dimensional subsystems, serve as a crucial framework for modeling a wide range of real-world applications. Despite offering computational scalability, the inherent interdependence among subsystems poses significant challenges to the effective control of such networks. This complexity is further exacerbated in the presence of external perturbations and when the dynamics of individual subsystems, and accordingly the overall network, are unknown-scenarios frequently encountered in modern practical applications. In this paper, we develop a compositional data-driven approach to ensure the global asymptotic stability (GAS) of large-scale nonlinear networks with unknown mathematical models, subjected to external perturbations. To achieve this, we first gather two sets of data from each unknown nominal subsystem without perturbation, which we refer to as two input-state trajectories. The collected data from each subsystem is then utilized to design an input-to-state stable (ISS) Lyapunov function and its corresponding controller for each nominal subsystem, rendering them ISS. To cancel the effect of external perturbations on the dynamic of each subsystem, and accordingly the whole network, we then design a local integral sliding mode (ISM) controller for each subsystem using the collected data. Under a small-gain compositional condition, we employ data-driven ISS Lyapunov functions designed for subsystems and construct a control Lyapunov function for the network, rendering the assurance of GAS property over the nominal network. We then extend this compositional result to network perturbed models, demonstrating that the synthesized ISM controllers ensure the GAS property even in the presence of perturbations.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Privacy Preserving Power Flow Analysis in Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-free power flow calculation, driven by the rise of smart meter (SM) data and the lack of network topology, often relies on artificial intelligence neural networks (ANNs). However, training ANNs require vast amounts of SM data, posing privacy risks for households in distribution networks. To ensure customers' privacy during the SM data gathering and online sharing, we introduce a privacy preserving PF calculation framework, composed of two local strategies: a local randomisation strategy (LRS) and a local zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)-based data collection strategy. First, the LRS is used to achieve irreversible transformation and robust privacy protection for active and reactive power data, thereby ensuring that personal data remains confidential. Subsequently, the ZKP-based data collecting strategy is adopted to securely gather the training dataset for the ANN, enabling SMs to interact with the distribution system operator without revealing the actual voltage magnitude. Moreover, to mitigate the accuracy loss induced by the seasonal variations in load profiles, an incremental learning strategy is incorporated into the online application. The results across three datasets with varying measurement errors demonstrate that the proposed framework efficiently collects one month of SM data within one hour. Furthermore, it robustly maintains mean errors of 0.005 p.u. and 0.014 p.u. under multiple measurement errors and seasonal variations in load profiles, respectively.</description>

      <title>Convergence Guarantees of Model-free Policy Gradient Methods for LQR with Stochastic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods are the backbone of many reinforcement learning algorithms due to their good performance in policy optimization problems. As a gradient-based approach, PG methods typically rely on knowledge of the system dynamics. However, this information is not always available, and in such cases, trajectory data can be utilized to approximate first-order information. When the data are noisy, gradient estimates become inaccurate and a formal investigation that encompasses uncertainty estimation and the analysis of its propagation through the algorithm is currently missing. To address this, our work focuses on the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem for systems subject to additive stochastic noise. After briefly summarizing the state of the art for cases with a known model, we focus on scenarios where the system dynamics are unknown, and approximate gradient information is obtained using zeroth-order optimization techniques. We analyze the theoretical properties by computing the error in the estimated gradient and examining how this error affects the convergence of PG algorithms. Additionally, we provide global convergence guarantees for various versions of PG methods, including those employing adaptive step sizes and variance reduction techniques, which help increase the convergence rate and reduce sample complexity. One contribution of this work is the study of the robustness of model-free PG methods, aiming to identify their limitations in the presence of noise and propose improvements to enhance their applicability. Numerical simulations show that these theoretical analyses provide valuable guidance in tuning the algorithm parameters, thereby making these methods more reliable in practically relevant scenarios.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Mean Field Equilibrium Computation in Large-Population LQG Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel data-driven approach for approximating the $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in continuous-time linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) games, where multiple agents interact with each other through their dynamics and infinite horizon discounted costs. The core of our method involves solving two algebraic Riccati equations (AREs) and an ordinary differential equation (ODE) using state and input samples collected from agents, eliminating the need for a priori knowledge of their dynamical models. The standard ARE is addressed through an integral reinforcement learning (IRL) technique, while the nonsymmetric ARE and the ODE are resolved by identifying the drift coefficients of the agents' dynamics under general conditions. Moreover, by imposing specific conditions on models, we extend the IRL-based approach to approximately solve the nonsymmetric ARE. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Model Identification of Unbalanced Induction Motor Dynamics and Forces using SINDYc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper identifies the stator currents, torque and unbalanced magnetic pull (UMP) of an unbalanced induction motor by the System Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics with Control (SINDYc) method from time-series data of measurable quantities. The SINDYc model has been trained on data coming from a nonlinear magnetic equivalent circuit model for three rotor eccentricity configurations. When evaluating the SINDYc model for static eccentricity, torques and UMPs with excellent accuracies, i.e., 8.8 mNm and 4.87 N of mean absolute error, respectively, are found. When compared with a reference torque equation, this amounts to a 65% error reduction. For dynamic eccentricity, the estimation is more difficult. The SINDYc model is fast enough to be embedded in a control procedure.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Energy Flow Analysis of Integrated Electricity and Gas Systems: A Semi-Analytical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the safe and reliable operation of integrated electricity and gas systems (IEGS) requires dynamic energy flow (DEF) simulation tools that achieve high accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the inherent strong nonlinearity of gas dynamics and its bidirectional coupling with power grids impose significant challenges on conventional numerical algorithms, particularly in computational efficiency and accuracy. Considering this, we propose a novel non-iterative semi-analytical algorithm based on differential transformation (DT) for DEF simulation of IEGS. First, we introduce a semi-discrete difference method to convert the partial differential algebraic equations of the DEF model into ordinary differential algebraic equations to resort to the DT. Particularly, by employing spatial central difference and numerical boundary extrapolation, we effectively avoid the singularity issue of the DT coefficient matrix. Second, we propose a DT-based semi-analytical solution method, which can yield the solution of the DEF model by recursion. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Robust Mean Field Social Control: A Unified Reinforcement Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies linear quadratic Gaussian robust mean field social control problems in the presence of multiplicative noise. We aim to compute asymptotic decentralized strategies without requiring full prior knowledge of agents' dynamics. The primary challenges lie in solving an indefinite stochastic algebraic Riccati equation for feedback gains, and an indefinite algebraic Riccati equation for feedforward gains. To overcome these challenges, we first propose a unified dual-loop iterative framework that simultaneously handles both indefinite Riccati-type equations, and provide rigorous convergence proofs for both outer-loop and inner-loop iterations. Second, recognizing that biases may arise in iterative processes due to estimation and modeling errors, we analyze the robustness of the proposed algorithm by using the small-disturbance input-to-state stability technique. This ensures convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution, even in the existence of disturbances. Finally, to address the limitation of requiring precise knowledge of agents' dynamics, we employ the integral reinforcement learning technique to develop a data-driven method within the dual-loop iterative framework. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Comparative Performance Analysis of Numerical Discretization Methods for Electrochemical Models of Lithium-ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates numerical discretization methods for lithium-ion battery models, including Finite Difference Method (FDM), spectral methods, Pad\'e approximation, and parabolic approximation. The evaluation criteria are accuracy, execution time, and memory usage to guide the selection of numerical discretization methods for electrochemical models. Under constant current conditions, FDM explicit Euler and Runge-Kutta methods show significant errors. The FDM implicit Euler method improves accuracy with more nodes. The spectral method achieves the best accuracy and convergence with 5 nodes. Both FDM implicit Euler and spectral methods show reduced errors with higher currents. Pad\'e approximation has larger errors, increasing with higher currents, while the parabolic method's error is higher than the converged spectral and FDM implicit Euler methods. Execution time comparison shows the parabolic method as the fastest, followed by Pad\'e approximation. The spectral method outperforms FDM methods, with FDM implicit Euler being the slowest. Memory usage is minimal for parabolic and Pad\'e methods, moderate for FDM methods, and highest for the spectral method. These findings offer insights for selecting appropriate numerical discretization methods in lithium-ion battery models.</description>

      <title>Energy-carbon comprehensive efficiency evaluation of hydrogen metallurgy system considering low-temperature waste heat recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the lack of energy-carbon efficiency evaluation and the underutilization of low-temperature waste heat in traditional direct reduction iron (DRI) production, this paper proposes a novel zero-carbon hydrogen metallurgy system that integrates the recovery and utilization of low-temperature and high-temperature waste heat, internal energy, and cold energy during hydrogen production, storage, reaction and circulation. Firstly, the detailed mathematical models are developed to describe energy and exergy characteristics of the operational components in the proposed zero-carbon hydrogen metallurgy system. Additionally, energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, and energy-carbon efficiency indices are introduced from a full life-cycle perspective of energy flow, avoiding the overlaps in energy inputs and outputs. Subsequently, the efficiency metrics of the proposed zero-carbon hydrogen metallurgy system are then compared with those of traditional DRI production systems with H$_2$/CO ratios of 6:4 and 8:2. The comparative results demonstrate the superiority and advancement of the proposed zero-carbon hydrogen metallurgy system. Finally, sensitivity analysis reveals that the overall electricity energy generated by incorporating the ORC and expander equipments exceeds the heat energy recovered from the furnace top gas, highlighting the energy potential of waste energy utilization.</description>

      <title>Electric power system security: the case for an integrated cyber-physical risk management framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the security of the electric power transmission grid facing the threat of malicious cyber-physical attackers. We posit that there is no such thing as perfectly effective cyber-security. Rather, any cyber-security measure comes with the possibility that a highly skilled attacker could (eventually find a way to) bypass it. On these grounds, we formulate a tri-level decision making problem seeking to co-optimize preventive physical and cyber-security measures under uncertainty on the ability of an exogenous cyber-physical attacker to overcome the latter. Preventive physical security measures refer to the \emph{ex-ante} procurement of reserve capacity, which translates into ramping restrictions in real-time. Cyber-security measures refer to updating the firewall rules so as to impede an intruder from taking over the cyber infrastructure of the grid and disconnecting power generators and transmission branches. We adopt standard assumptions to formalize the inner optimization problems corresponding to the cyber-physical attacker and power grid operator and focus on uncertainty management at the uppermost level of the problem. Our findings establish that physical- and cyber-security measures are non-exchangeable complements in keeping the power grid operation secure.</description>

      <title>Modeling Driver Behavior in Speed Advisory Systems: Koopman-based Approach with Online Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate driver behavior modeling is essential for improving the interaction and cooperation of the human driver with the driver assistance system. This paper presents a novel approach for modeling the response of human drivers to visual cues provided by a speed advisory system using a Koopman-based method with online updates. The proposed method utilizes the Koopman operator to transform the nonlinear dynamics of driver-speed advisory system interactions into a linear framework, allowing for efficient real-time prediction. An online update mechanism based on Recursive Least Squares (RLS) is integrated into the Koopman-based model to ensure continuous adaptation to changes in driver behavior over time. The model is validated using data collected from a human-in-the-loop driving simulator, capturing diverse driver-specific trajectories. The results demonstrate that the offline learned Koopman-based model can closely predict driver behavior and its accuracy is further enhanced through an online update mechanism with the RLS method.</description>

      <title>Improving Simulation-Based Origin-Destination Demand Calibration Using Sample Segment Counts Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to demand estimation that utilizes partial observations of segment-level track counts. Building on established simulation-based demand estimation methods, we present a modified formulation that integrates sample track counts as a regularization term. This approach effectively addresses the underdetermination challenge in demand estimation, moving beyond the conventional reliance on a prior OD matrix. The proposed formulation aims to preserve the distribution of the observed track counts while optimizing the demand to align with observed path-level travel times. We tested this approach on Seattle's highway network with various congestion levels. Our findings reveal significant enhancements in the solution quality, particularly in accurately recovering ground truth demand patterns at both the OD and segment levels.</description>

      <title>Assessing Autonomous Inspection Regimes: Active Versus Passive Satellite Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of satellite inspection, where one or more satellites (inspectors) are tasked with imaging or inspecting a resident space object (RSO) due to potential malfunctions or anomalies. Inspection strategies are often reduced to a discretized action space with predefined waypoints, facilitating tractability in both classical optimization and machine learning based approaches. However, this discretization can lead to suboptimal guidance in certain scenarios. This study presents a comparative simulation to explore the tradeoffs of passive versus active strategies in multi-agent missions. Key factors considered include RSO dynamic mode, state uncertainty, unmodeled entrance criteria, and inspector motion types. The evaluation is conducted with a focus on fuel utilization and surface coverage. Building on a Monte-Carlo based evaluator of passive strategies and a reinforcement learning framework for training active inspection policies, this study investigates conditions under which passive strategies, such as Natural Motion Circumnavigation (NMC), may perform comparably to active strategies like Reinforcement Learning based waypoint transfers.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Fluid Antenna System for Wireless Communications: Design, Modeling, Algorithm, Fabrication, and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the concept, design, channel modeling, beamforming algorithm, prototype fabrication, and experimental measurement of an electromagnetically reconfigurable fluid antenna system (ER-FAS), in which each FAS array element features electromagnetic (EM) reconfigurability. Unlike most existing FAS works that investigate spatial reconfigurability, the proposed ER-FAS enables direct control over the EM characteristics of each element, allowing for dynamic radiation pattern reconfigurability. Specifically, a novel ER-FAS architecture leveraging software-controlled fluidics is proposed, and corresponding wireless channel models are established. A low-complexity greedy beamforming algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the analog phase shift and the radiation state of each array element. The accuracy of the ER-FAS channel model and the effectiveness of the beamforming algorithm are validated through (i) full-wave EM simulations and (ii) numerical spectral efficiency evaluations. Simulation results confirm that the proposed ER-FAS significantly enhances spectral efficiency compared to conventional antenna arrays. To further validate this design, we fabricate hardware prototypes for both the ER-FAS element and array, using Galinstan liquid metal alloy, fluid silver paste, and software-controlled fluidic channels. The simulation results are experimentally verified through prototype measurements conducted in an anechoic chamber. Additionally, indoor communication trials are conducted via a pair of software-defined radios which demonstrate superior received power and bit error rate performance of the ER-FAS prototype. This work presents the first demonstration of a liquid-based ER-FAS in array configuration for enhancing communication systems.</description>

      <title>Risk-aware Integrated Task and Motion Planning for Versatile Snake Robots under Localization Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Snake robots enable mobility through extreme terrains and confined environments in terrestrial and space applications. However, robust perception and localization for snake robots remain an open challenge due to the proximity of the sensor payload to the ground coupled with a limited field of view. To address this issue, we propose Blind-motion with Intermittently Scheduled Scans (BLISS) which combines proprioception-only mobility with intermittent scans to be resilient against both localization failures and collision risks. BLISS is formulated as an integrated Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) problem that leads to a Chance-Constrained Hybrid Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (CC-HPOMDP), known to be computationally intractable due to the curse of history. Our novelty lies in reformulating CC-HPOMDP as a tractable, convex Mixed Integer Linear Program. This allows us to solve BLISS-TAMP significantly faster and jointly derive optimal task-motion plans. Simulations and hardware experiments on the EELS snake robot show our method achieves over an order of magnitude computational improvement compared to state-of-the-art POMDP planners and $&gt;$ 50\% better navigation time optimality versus classical two-stage planners.</description>

      <title>A differential game approach to intrinsic encirclement control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the encirclement control problem involving two groups using a non-cooperative differential game approach. The active group seeks to chase and encircle the passive group, while the passive group responds by fleeing cooperatively and simultaneously encircling the active group. Instead of prescribing an expected radius or a predefined path for encirclement, we focus on the whole formation manifold of the desired relative configuration, two concentric circles, by allowing permutation, rotation, and translation of players. The desired relative configurations arise as the steady state resulting from Nash equilibrium strategies and are achieved in an intrinsic way by designing the interaction graphs and weight function of each edge. Furthermore, the asymptotic convergence to the desired manifold is guaranteed. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate encirclement and counter-encirclement scenarios, verifying the effectiveness of our strategies.</description>

      <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning via Inverse Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent successes of Inverse Optimization (IO) across various application domains, we propose a novel offline Reinforcement Learning (ORL) algorithm for continuous state and action spaces, leveraging the convex loss function called ``sub-optimality loss" from the IO literature. To mitigate the distribution shift commonly observed in ORL problems, we further employ a robust and non-causal Model Predictive Control (MPC) expert steering a nominal model of the dynamics using in-hindsight information stemming from the model mismatch. Unlike the existing literature, our robust MPC expert enjoys an exact and tractable convex reformulation. In the second part of this study, we show that the IO hypothesis class, trained by the proposed convex loss function, enjoys ample expressiveness and achieves competitive performance comparing with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the low-data regime of the MuJoCo benchmark while utilizing three orders of magnitude fewer parameters, thereby requiring significantly fewer computational resources. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we provide an open-source package implementing the proposed algorithms and the experiments.</description>

      <title>Night-Voyager: Consistent and Efficient Nocturnal Vision-Aided State Estimation in Object Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and robust state estimation at nighttime is essential for autonomous robotic navigation to achieve nocturnal or round-the-clock tasks. An intuitive question arises: Can low-cost standard cameras be exploited for nocturnal state estimation? Regrettably, most existing visual methods may fail under adverse illumination conditions, even with active lighting or image enhancement. A pivotal insight, however, is that streetlights in most urban scenarios act as stable and salient prior visual cues at night, reminiscent of stars in deep space aiding spacecraft voyage in interstellar navigation. Inspired by this, we propose Night-Voyager, an object-level nocturnal vision-aided state estimation framework that leverages prior object maps and keypoints for versatile localization. We also find that the primary limitation of conventional visual methods under poor lighting conditions stems from the reliance on pixel-level metrics. In contrast, metric-agnostic, non-pixel-level object detection serves as a bridge between pixel-level and object-level spaces, enabling effective propagation and utilization of object map information within the system. Night-Voyager begins with a fast initialization to solve the global localization problem. By employing an effective two-stage cross-modal data association, the system delivers globally consistent state updates using map-based observations. To address the challenge of significant uncertainties in visual observations at night, a novel matrix Lie group formulation and a feature-decoupled multi-state invariant filter are introduced, ensuring consistent and efficient estimation. Through comprehensive experiments in both simulation and diverse real-world scenarios (spanning approximately 12.3 km), Night-Voyager showcases its efficacy, robustness, and efficiency, filling a critical gap in nocturnal vision-aided state estimation.</description>

      <title>Pricing for Routing and Flow-Control in Payment Channel Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A payment channel network is a blockchain-based overlay mechanism that allows parties to transact more efficiently than directly using the blockchain. These networks are composed of payment channels that carry transactions between pairs of users. Due to its design, a payment channel cannot sustain a net flow of money in either direction indefinitely. Therefore, a payment channel network cannot serve transaction requests arbitrarily over a long period of time. We introduce \emph{DEBT control}, a joint routing and flow-control protocol that guides a payment channel network towards an optimal operating state for any steady-state demand. In this protocol, each channel sets a price for routing transactions through it. Transacting users make flow-control and routing decisions by responding to these prices. A channel updates its price based on the net flow of money through it. The protocol is developed by formulating a network utility maximization problem and solving its dual through gradient descent. We provide convergence guarantees for the protocol and also illustrate its behavior through simulations.</description>

      <title>ACCORD: Application Context-aware Cross-layer Optimization and Resource Design for 5G/NextG Machine-centric Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in AI and edge computing have accelerated the development of machine-centric applications (MCAs), such as smart surveillance systems. In these applications, video cameras and sensors offload inference tasks like license plate recognition and vehicle tracking to remote servers due to local computing and energy constraints. However, legacy network solutions, designed primarily for human-centric applications, struggle to reliably support these MCAs, which demand heterogeneous and fluctuating QoS (due to diverse application inference tasks), further challenged by dynamic wireless network conditions and limited spectrum resources. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Application Context-aware Cross-layer Optimization and Resource Design (ACCORD) framework. This innovative framework anticipates the evolving demands of MCAs in real time, quickly adapting to provide customized QoS and optimal performance, even for the most dynamic and unpredictable MCAs. This also leads to improved network resource management and spectrum utilization. ACCORD operates as a closed feedback-loop system between the application client and network and consists of two key components: (1) Building Application Context: It focuses on understanding the specific context of MCA requirements. Contextual factors include device capabilities, user behavior (e.g., mobility speed), and network channel conditions. (2) Cross-layer Network Parameter Configuration: Utilizing a DRL approach, this component leverages the contextual information to optimize network configuration parameters across various layers, including PHY, MAC, and RLC, as well as the application layer, to meet the desired QoS requirement in real-time. Extensive evaluation with the 3GPP-compliant MATLAB 5G toolbox demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed ACCORD framework.</description>

      <title>Physics-Driven Data Generation for Contact-Rich Manipulation via Trajectory Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a low-cost data generation pipeline that integrates physics-based simulation, human demonstrations, and model-based planning to efficiently generate large-scale, high-quality datasets for contact-rich robotic manipulation tasks. Starting with a small number of embodiment-flexible human demonstrations collected in a virtual reality simulation environment, the pipeline refines these demonstrations using optimization-based kinematic retargeting and trajectory optimization to adapt them across various robot embodiments and physical parameters. This process yields a diverse, physically consistent dataset that enables cross-embodiment data transfer, and offers the potential to reuse legacy datasets collected under different hardware configurations or physical parameters. We validate the pipeline's effectiveness by training diffusion policies from the generated datasets for challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks across multiple robot embodiments, including a floating Allegro hand and bimanual robot arms. The trained policies are deployed zero-shot on hardware for bimanual iiwa arms, achieving high success rates with minimal human input.

      <description>arXiv:2502.20396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has delivered promising results in achieving human- or even superhuman-level capabilities across diverse problem domains, but success in dexterous robot manipulation remains limited. This work investigates the key challenges in applying reinforcement learning to solve a collection of contact-rich manipulation tasks on a humanoid embodiment. We introduce novel techniques to overcome the identified challenges with empirical validation. Our main contributions include an automated real-to-sim tuning module that brings the simulated environment closer to the real world, a generalized reward design scheme that simplifies reward engineering for long-horizon contact-rich manipulation tasks, a divide-and-conquer distillation process that improves the sample efficiency of hard-exploration problems while maintaining sim-to-real performance, and a mixture of sparse and dense object representations to bridge the sim-to-real perception gap. We show promising results on three humanoid dexterous manipulation tasks, with ablation studies on each technique. Our work presents a successful approach to learning humanoid dexterous manipulation using sim-to-real reinforcement learning, achieving robust generalization and high performance without the need for human demonstration.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Optimal Microgrid Planning with Adaptive BESS Degradation Costs and PV Asset Management: An Iterative Post-Optimization Correction Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition to renewable energy has positioned photovoltaic (PV) systems and battery energy storage systems (BESS) as essential assets in microgrids, particularly for remote installations. However, traditional planning models often neglect dynamic degradation costs or rely on complex or non-linear approaches, limiting their scalability and practical applicability. This paper introduces a microgrid planning model that integrates adaptive degradation cost modeling to enable accurate, efficient, and scalable long-term resource allocation. The proposed model employs the iterative post-optimization correction (IPOC) framework, solving a sequence of mixed-integer linear programming problems. Each iteration refines BESS degradation costs based on observed depth-of-discharge profiles and incorporates PV degradation costs to ensure realistic asset performance assessments. Sensitivity analysis of PV and BESS capital costs further underscores the model's robustness under varying economic conditions, with the IPOC framework achieving up to ~1% additional cost savings for the given test system compared to static approaches. The results demonstrate that by iteratively adjusting degradation penalties based on actual usage, the methodology optimizes BESS performance, ensures precise resource allocation, resolves issues of under- or overutilization, enhances system reliability, and facilitates scalable, sustainable microgrid planning.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Fairness-Aware Load Shedding: A Real-Time Solution via Identifying Binding Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18989v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timely and effective load shedding in power systems is critical for maintaining supply-demand balance and preventing cascading blackouts. To eliminate load shedding bias against specific regions in the system, optimization-based methods are uniquely positioned to help balance between economic and fairness considerations. However, the resulting optimization problem involves complex constraints, which can be time-consuming to solve and thus cannot meet the real-time requirements of load shedding. To tackle this challenge, in this paper we present an efficient machine learning algorithm to enable millisecond-level computation for the optimization-based load shedding problem. Numerical studies on both a 3-bus toy example and a realistic RTS-GMLC system have demonstrated the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for delivering fairness-aware and real-time load shedding decisions.</description>

      <title>Gaming on Coincident Peak Shaving: Equilibrium and Strategic Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02792v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power system operators and electric utility companies often charge consumers a peak demand charge when the aggregate system demand reaches its maximum, a practice known as coincident peak shaving. These charges incentivize consumers to reduce usage during critical periods, alleviating stress on electricity transmission and distribution systems, while also helping to recover the grid investment costs. In this paper, we analyze the problem through the lens of game theory, developing a model that captures how strategic consumer behavior influences overall system efficiency. Our results reveal that the coincident peak shaving game can be concave, quasiconcave with discontinuities, or non-concave with discontinuities, depending on the extent of consumers' demand-shifting capabilities. In a two-agent, two-period framework, we derive closed-form Nash equilibrium solutions for each scenario and extend our analysis to multi-agent settings. We prove the stability of these equilibrium points and propose an algorithm to compute equilibrium outcomes across all game configurations. Furthermore, we show that while the decentralized game model achieves peak-shaving performance comparable to a centralized approach, it does so at the cost of increased anarchy. In scenarios characterized by quasi-concave and non-concave conditions, our analytical results demonstrate that anarchy grows with greater consumer flexibility and disparities in marginal shifting costs, and we explore how the number of agents affects system efficiency. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Deep Incremental Model Informed Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Robotic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning attempts to use an available or learned model to improve the data efficiency of reinforcement learning. This work proposes a one-step lookback approach that jointly learns the deep incremental model and the policy to realize the sample-efficient continuous robotic control, wherein the control-theoretical knowledge is utilized to decrease the model learning difficulty and facilitate efficient training. Specifically, we use one-step backward data to facilitate the deep incremental model, an alternative structured representation of the robotic evolution model, that accurately predicts the robotic movement but with low sample complexity. This is because the formulated deep incremental model degrades the model learning difficulty into a parametric matrix learning problem, which is especially favourable to high-dimensional robotic applications. The imagined data from the learned deep incremental model is used to supplement training data to enhance the sample efficiency. Comparative numerical simulations on benchmark continuous robotics control problems are conducted to validate the efficiency of our proposed one-step lookback approach.</description>

      <title>Neural Configuration Distance Function for Continuum Robot Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for modeling the shape of a continuum robot as a Neural Configuration Euclidean Distance Function (N-CEDF). By learning separate distance fields for each link and combining them through the kinematics chain, the learned N-CEDF provides an accurate and computationally efficient representation of the robot's shape. The key advantage of a distance function representation of a continuum robot is that it enables efficient collision checking for motion planning in dynamic and cluttered environments, even with point-cloud observations. We integrate the N-CEDF into a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller to generate safe trajectories for multi-segment continuum robots. The proposed approach is validated for continuum robots with various links in several simulated environments with static and dynamic obstacles.</description>

      <title>Optimization Proxies using Limited Labeled Data and Training Time -- A Semi-Supervised Bayesian Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constrained optimization problems arise in various engineering systems such as inventory management and power grids. Standard deep neural network (DNN) based machine learning proxies are ineffective in practical settings where labeled data is scarce and training times are limited. We propose a semi-supervised Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) based optimization proxy for this complex regime, wherein training commences in a sandwiched fashion, alternating between a supervised learning step for minimizing cost, and an unsupervised learning step for enforcing constraint feasibility. We show that the proposed semi-supervised BNN outperforms DNN architectures on important non-convex constrained optimization problems from energy network operations, achieving up to a tenfold reduction in expected maximum equality gap and halving the inequality gaps. Further, the BNN's ability to provide posterior samples is leveraged to construct practically meaningful probabilistic confidence bounds on performance using a limited validation data, unlike prior methods.</description>

      <title>G3Flow: Generative 3D Semantic Flow for Pose-aware and Generalizable Object Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in imitation learning for 3D robotic manipulation have shown promising results with diffusion-based policies. However, achieving human-level dexterity requires seamless integration of geometric precision and semantic understanding. We present G3Flow, a novel framework that constructs real-time semantic flow, a dynamic, object-centric 3D semantic representation by leveraging foundation models. Our approach uniquely combines 3D generative models for digital twin creation, vision foundation models for semantic feature extraction, and robust pose tracking for continuous semantic flow updates. This integration enables complete semantic understanding even under occlusions while eliminating manual annotation requirements. By incorporating semantic flow into diffusion policies, we demonstrate significant improvements in both terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization. Extensive experiments across five simulation tasks show that G3Flow consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 68.3% and 50.1% average success rates on terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization tasks respectively. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of G3Flow in enhancing real-time dynamic semantic feature understanding for robotic manipulation policies.</description>

      <title>Detection Augmented Bandit Procedures for Piecewise Stationary MABs: A Modular Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are designed for stationary environments, where the reward distributions associated with the arms do not change with time. In many applications, however, the environment is more accurately modeled as being nonstationary. In this work, piecewise stationary MAB (PS-MAB) environments are investigated, in which the reward distributions associated with a subset of the arms change at some change-points and remain stationary between change-points. Our focus is on the asymptotic analysis of PS-MABs, for which practical algorithms based on change detection (CD) have been previously proposed. Our goal is to modularize the design and analysis of such CD-based Bandit (CDB) procedures. To this end, we identify the requirements for stationary bandit algorithms and change detectors in a CDB procedure that are needed for the modularization. We assume that the rewards are sub-Gaussian. Under this assumption and a condition on the separation of the change-points, we show that the analysis of CDB procedures can indeed be modularized, so that regret bounds can be obtained in a unified manner for various combinations of change detectors and bandit algorithms. Through this analysis, we develop new modular CDB procedures that are order-optimal. We compare the performance of our modular CDB procedures with various other methods in simulations.</description>
