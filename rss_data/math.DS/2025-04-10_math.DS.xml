      <title>Geometric perspective of linear stability in finite networks of nonlinear oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a complex-valued transformation of the Kuramoto model to develop an operator-description of the linear stability in finite networks of nonlinear oscillators. This mathematical approach offers analytical predictions for the linear stability of $q$-states, which include phase synchronization ($q = 0$) and waves with different spatial frequencies ($|q| &gt; 0$). This approach seamlessly incorporates the presence of time delays (represented by phase-lags in the coupling). With this, we are able to analytically determine the specific combination of connectivity and time delays (phase-lags) that leads to any given $q$-state to be linearly stable. This approach offers a geometric perspective of linear stability in finite networks in terms of the connectivity and delays (phase-lag), and it opens a path to designing and controlling the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual oscillator networks.</description>

      <title>The Density Finite Sums Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any set $A$ of natural numbers with positive upper Banach density and any $k\geq 1$, we show the existence of an infinite set $B\subset{\mathbb N}$ and a shift $t\geq0$ such that $A-t$ contains all sums of $m$ distinct elements from $B$ for all $m\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$. This can be viewed as a density analog of Hindman's finite sums theorem. Our proof reveals the natural relationships among infinite sumsets, the dynamics underpinning arithmetic progressions, and homogeneous spaces of nilpotent Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Harmful information spreading and its impact on vaccination campaigns modeled through fractal-fractional operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the huge efforts to develop and administer vaccines worldwide to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation spreading through fake news in media and social networks about vaccination safety, make that people refuse to be vaccinated, which harms not only these people but also the whole population.
  In this work, we model the effects of harmful information spreading in immunization acquisition through vaccination. Our model is posed for several fractional derivative operators. We have conducted a comprehensive foundation analysis of this model for the different fractional derivatives. Additionally, we have incorporated a strength parameter that shows the combined impact of nonlinear and linear components within an epidemiological model. We have used the second derivative of the Lyapunov function to ascertain the detection of wave patterns within the vaccination dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bistability and complex bifurcation diagrams generated by waning and boosting of immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an epidemiological model that incorporates waning of immunity at the individual level and boosting of the immune system upon re-exposure to the pathogen. When immunity is fully restored upon boosting, the system can be expressed as an SIRS-type model with discrete and distributed delays. We conduct a numerical bifurcation analysis varying the boosting force and the maximum period of immunity (in the absence of boosting), while keeping other parameters fixed at values representative of a highly infectious disease like pertussis. The stability switches of the endemic equilibrium, identified numerically, are validated using an established analytical approach, confirming that the equilibrium is unstable in a bounded parameter region, and stable outside this region. Using recently developed continuation methods for models with discrete and distributed delays, we explore periodic solutions and their bifurcations. Our analysis significantly extends previous findings and reveals a rich dynamical landscape, including catastrophic bifurcations of limit cycles, torus bifurcations, and bistability regions where two stable periodic solutions coexist, differing in amplitude and period. These complex bifurcations have critical public health implications: perturbations--such as non-pharmaceutical interventions--can shift the system between attractors, leading to long-term consequences from short-term measures.</description>

      <title>On the Destruction of Invariant Lagrangian Graphs for Conformal Symplectic Twist Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the fragility of invariant Lagrangian graphs for dissipative maps, focusing on their destruction under small perturbations. Inspired by Herman's work on conservative systems, we prove that all $C^0$-invariant Lagrangian graphs for an integrable dissipative twist maps can be destroyed by perturbations that are arbitrarily small in the $C^{1-\varepsilon}$-topology. This result is sharp, as evidenced by the persistence of $C^1$-invariant graphs under $C^1$-perturbations guaranteed by the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold theorem.</description>

      <title>On the Equilibrium Locus of a Parameterized Dynamical System with Independent First Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a family of dynamical systems with $k &gt; 0$ independent first integrals evolving in a compact region of an Euclidean space, we study the equilibrium locus. We show that under mild and generic conditions, it is a smooth manifold that can be viewed as the total space of a certain fiber bundle and that this bundle comes equipped with a natural connection. We then proceed to show parallel transport for this connection does exist and explore some of its properties. In particular, we elucidate how one can to some extent measure the variation of the system eigenvalues restricted to a given fiber.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every multi-correlation sequence is the sum of a generalized nilsequence and a null-sequence. This proves a conjecture of N. Frantzikinakis. A key ingredient is the reduction of ergodic multidimensional inverse theorems to analogous finitary inverse theorems, offering a new approach to the structure theory of multidimensional Host-Kra factors. This reduction is proven by combining the methods of Tao (2015) with the Furstenberg correspondence principle. We also prove the analogous multidimensional finitary inverse theorem with quasi-polynomial bounds.</description>

      <title>A Novel Nonlinear Fertility Catastrophe Model Based on Thom's Differential Equations of Morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel fertility model based on Thom's nonlinear differential equations of morphogenesis is presented, utilizing a three-dimensional catastrophe surface to capture the interaction between latent non-catastrophic fertility factors and catastrophic shocks. The model incorporates key socioeconomic and environmental variables and is applicable at macro-, meso-, and micro-demographic levels, addressing global fertility declines, regional population disparities, and micro-level phenomena such as teenage pregnancies. This approach enables a comprehensive analysis of reproductive health at aggregate, sub-national, and age-group-specific levels. An agent-based model for teenage pregnancy is described to illustrate how latent factors -- such as education, contraceptive use, and parental guidance -- interact with catastrophic shocks like socioeconomic deprivation, violence, and substance abuse. The bifurcation set analysis shows how minor shifts in socioeconomic conditions can lead to significant changes in fertility rates, revealing critical points in fertility transitions. By integrating Thom's morphogenesis equations with traditional fertility theory, this paper proposes a groundbreaking approach to understanding fertility dynamics, offering valuable insights for the development of public health policies that address both stable fertility patterns and abrupt demographic shifts.</description>

      <title>Winning and nullity of inhomogeneous bad</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the hyperplane absolute winning property of weighted inhomogeneous badly approximable vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$. This answers a question by Beresnevich--Nesharim--Yang and extends the main result of [Geometric and Functional Analysis, 31 (1), 1-33, 2021] to the inhomogeneous set-up.
  We also show for any nondegenerate curve and nondegenerate analytic manifold that almost every point is not weighted inhomogeneous badly approximable for any weight. This is achieved by duality and the quantitative nondivergence estimates from homogeneous dynamics motivated by [Acta Math. 231 (2023), 1-30], together with the methods from [arXiv:2307.10109].</description>

      <title>Discrete-to-continuum limit for nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems via EDP convergence for gradient systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence of spatial discretizations for reaction-diffusion systems with mass-action law satisfying a detailed balance condition. Considering systems on the d-dimensional torus, we construct appropriate space-discrete processes and show convergence not only on the level of solutions, but also on the level of the gradient systems governing the evolutions. As an important step, we prove chain rule inequalities for the reaction-diffusion systems as well as their discretizations, featuring a non-convex dissipation functional. The convergence is then obtained with variational methods by building on the recently introduced notion of gradient systems in continuity equation format.</description>

      <title>Controlling a Social Network of Individuals with Coevolving Actions and Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a population of individuals who have actions and opinions, which coevolve, mutually influencing one another on a complex network structure. In particular, we formulate a control problem for this social network, in which we assume that we can inject into the network a committed minority -- a set of stubborn nodes -- with the objective of steering the population, initially at a consensus, to a different consensus state. Our study focuses on two main objectives: i) determining the conditions under which the committed minority succeeds in its goal, and ii) identifying the optimal placement for such a committed minority. After deriving general monotone convergence result for the controlled dynamics, we leverage these results to build a computationally-efficient algorithm to solve the first problem and an effective heuristics for the second problem, which we prove to be NP-complete. The proposed methodology is illustrated though academic examples, and demonstrated on a real-world case study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the semiring of abstract finite dynamical systems up to isomorphism, with the operations of alternative and synchronous execution. We continue searching for efficient algorithms for solving polynomial equations of the form $P(X) = B$, with a constant side B, with the goal of decomposing complex behaviors into simpler systems. Taking inspiration from the characterization of injective polynomials P over dynamical systems, which is based on a condition on the lengths of limit cycles of their coefficients, we introduce a more general notion of pseudo-injectivity by relaxing this constraint. We prove that the associated equations can be solved efficiently, even in certain cases where the input is encoded in an exponentially more compact way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of probability measures under iteration of a surjective cellular automaton. We solve the following question in the negative: if the initial measure is ergodic and has full support, do all weak-* limit points of the sequence of measures have full support as well? The initial measure of our solution is not a product measure, and in this case the question remains open. To this end, we present a tool for studying the frequencies of symbols in preimages of surjective cellular automata, and prove some basic results about it. However, we show that by itself it is not enough to solve the stricter question in the positive.</description>

      <title>Abstract Fractional Cauchy Problem: Existence of Propagators and Inhomogeneous Solution Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Cauchy problem for the inhomogeneous differential equation given in terms of an unbounded linear operator $A$ and the Caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha \in (0, 2)$ in time. The previously known representation of the mild solution to such a problem does not have a conventional variation-of-constants like form, with the propagator derived from the associated homogeneous problem. Instead, it relies on the existence of two propagators with different analytical properties. This fact limits theoretical and especially numerical applicability of the existing solution representation. Here, we propose an alternative representation of the mild solution to the given problem, that consolidates the solution formulas for sub-parabolic, parabolic and sub-hyperbolic equations with a positive sectorial operator $A$ and non-zero initial data. The new representation is solely based on the propagator of the homogeneous problem and, therefore, can be considered as a more natural fractional extension of the solution to the classical parabolic Cauchy problem. By exploiting a trade-off between the regularity assumptions on the initial data in terms of the fractional powers of $A$ and the regularity assumptions on the right-hand side in time, we show that the proposed solution formula is strongly convergent for $t \geq 0$ under considerably weaker assumptions compared to the standard results from the literature. Crucially, the achieved relaxation of space regularity assumptions ensures that the new solution representation is practically feasible for any $\alpha \in (0, 2)$ and is amenable to the numerical evaluation using uniformly accurate quadrature-based algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Coffee leaf rust (CLR) severely affects coffee production worldwide, leading to reduced yields and economic losses. To reduce the cost of control, small-scale farmers often only apply control measures once a noticeable level of infection is reached. In this work, we develop mathematical models to better understand CLR dynamics and impulsive biocontrol with threshold-based interventions. We first use ordinary and impulsive differential equations to describe disease spread and the application of control measures once a certain infection level is detected. These models help determine when and how often interventions should occur. To capture the early stages of the disease and the chance that it might die out by itself, we then use a continuous-time Markov chain approach. This stochastic model allows us to estimate the probability that the pathogen fails to establish, thereby avoiding serious outbreaks.</description>
