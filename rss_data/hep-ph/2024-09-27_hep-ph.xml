      <title>Contributions of $\psi_{2}(3823)$ and $\psi(4040)$ charmonium in $B^+\rightarrow J/\psi\eta K^+$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a study on the $J/\psi\eta$ mass spectrum from $B^+\rightarrow J/\psi\eta K^+$ decays was reported by the LHCb detector. The results of this study are reported as a ratio of branching fractions as $F_{X}\equiv\frac{\mathcal{B}r(B^+\rightarrow XK^+)\times\mathcal{B}r(X\rightarrow J/\psi\eta)}{\mathcal{B}r(B^+\rightarrow \psi(2S) K^+)\times\mathcal{B}r(\psi(2S)\rightarrow J/\psi\eta)}$ for $X=\psi_2(3823),\psi(4040)$, which are $(5.95^{+3.38}_{-2.55})\times10^{-2}$ and $(40.60\pm11.20)\times10^{-2}$, respectively. Also, the products related to $B_{X}\equiv\mathcal{B}r(B^+\rightarrow XK^+)\times\mathcal{B}r(X\rightarrow J/\psi\eta)$ branching fractions are $B_{\psi_2(3823)}=(1.25^{+0.71}_{-0.53}\pm0.04)\times10^{-6}$ and $B_{\psi(4040)}=(8.53\pm2.35\pm0.30)\times10^{-6}$. For the first time, we calculated this branching fraction using factorization. According to our calculations, $F_X$ to be $F_{\psi_{2}(3823)}=(6.55\pm1.88)\times10^{-2}$ and $F_{\psi(4040)}=(14.33\pm4.15)\times10^{-2}$ at $\mu=m_b/2$. We have estimated $B_{\psi_{2}(3823)}=(0.26\pm0.05)\times10^{-6}$ at $\mu=m_b/2$ and $B_{\psi(4040)}=(2.88\pm0.64)\times10^{-6}$ at $\mu=2m_b$.</description>

      <title>Annihilating to the Darker: A Cure for WIMP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that the non-observation of WIMPs may be explained by dark matter primarily annihilating to the darker concealed sector while coupling to the standard model with only minimal strength. To demonstrate this scenario, we focus on the WIMP dark matter candidate from a $U(1)_x$ hidden sector, which couples more strongly to another concealed $U(1)_c$ sector than to the standard model. We explore two possible cases for the evolution of dark particles among hidden sectors: (1) The WIMP annihilates efficiently and achieves the observed relic density with the assistance of the concealed sector. (2) The WIMP transforms into another type of dark matter within the concealed sector and attains the observed relic density. Annihilating to the darker explains why WIMPs have remained undetected, and all WIMP models will continue to hold interest.</description>

      <title>Small-$x$ gluon GPD constrained from deeply virtual $J/\psi$ production and gluon PDF through universal-moment parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We phenomenologically constrain the small-$x$ and small-$\xi$ gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) with the deeply virtual $J/\psi$ production (DV$J/\psi$P) in the framework of GPDs through universal moment parameterization (GUMP). We use a hybrid cross-section formula combining collinear factorization to the next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy of the strong coupling $\alpha_s$, with corrections from non-relativistic QCD to account for the power corrections due to the heavy $J/\psi$ mass. We reach reasonable fit to the measured differential cross-sections of DV$J/\psi$P by H1 at Hadron-Electron Ring Accelerator (HERA) as well as forward gluon PDFs from JAM22 global analysis. We find that both NLO and non-relativistic corrections are significant for heavy vector meson productions. Of course, the gluon GPD we obtain still contain considerable freedom in need of inputs from other constraints, particularly in the distribution-amplitude-like region.</description>

      <title>Theory of neutrino fast flavor conversions. II. Solutions at the edge of instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dense neutrino environments, such as provided by core-collapse supernovae or neutron-star mergers, neutrino angular distributions may be unstable to collective flavor conversions, whose outcome remains to be fully understood. These conversions are much faster than hydrodynamical scales, suggesting that self-consistent configurations may never be strongly unstable. With this motivation in mind, we study weakly unstable modes, i.e., those with small growth rates. We show that our newly developed dispersion relation (Paper~I of this series) allows for an expansion in powers of the small growth rate. For weakly unstable distributions, we show that the unstable modes must either move with subluminal phase velocity, or very close to the speed of light. The instability is fed from neutrinos moving resonantly with the waves, allowing us to derive explicit expressions for the growth rate. For axisymmetric distributions, often assumed in the literature, numerical examples show the accuracy of these expressions. We also note that for the often-studied one-dimensional systems one should not forget the axial-symmetry-breaking modes, and we provide explicit expressions for the range of wavenumbers that exhibit instabilities.</description>

      <title>Long-lived Sterile Neutrino Searches at Future Muon Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of studying sterile neutrinos at a future high-energy muon collider, where these particles can generate small active neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism and exhibit long-lived particle signatures. A Dirac sterile neutrino model with ${\rm U(1)}_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ symmetry is introduced, where the heavy right-handed neutrino ($N_R$) produces tiny active neutrino masses, and the light left-handed neutrino ($N_L$) naturally behaves as a long-lived particle. The ${\rm U(1)}_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge symmetry also enhances sterile neutrino pair production at a future high-energy muon collider. Using the displaced vertex method, the muon collider can search for heavy sterile neutrino, especially for $m_L&gt; m_W$. We find that a muon collider with $\sqrt{s} = 3~ (10)$ TeV and luminosity $L=1~(10)$ ab$^{-1}$ can probe $N_L$ masses of $m_L \in [100,~1500~(5000)]$ GeV and mixing angles $\theta_{\nu L} \in [10^{-13}~(10^{-14}),~10^{-6}]$.</description>

      <title>The cosmology of ultralight scalar dark matter coupled to right-handed neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider ultralight scalar dark matter that couples to right-handed neutrinos. Due to the high density of neutrinos in the early universe, the background neutrino density dominates the dynamics of the scalar field, and qualitatively alters the field's cosmological evolution. This effect has not been included in previous literature, and changes the interpretation of cosmological data and its interplay with laboratory experiments. To illustrate these points a simplified model of a $1+1$ setup with a single scalar field is analyzed.
  We find that: {\it i}) The scalar field experiences an asymmetric potential and its energy density redshifts differently than ordinary matter. {\it ii}) Neutrino mass measurements at the CMB and oscillation experiments performed today complement one another (i.e., they constrain different regions of parameter space). {\it iii}) There exists potentially interesting cosmologies with either $O(1)$ variations in the dark matter density between the CMB and today, or $O(1)$ oscillations of neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>Determining the Meson Cloud Contribution of Nucleon Electromagnetic Form Factor Using Dispersion Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the meson cloud contribution to nucleon electromagnetic form factors in dispersion relation approach. In our calculations, experimental data on transition amplitudes for pion-nucleon scatterings are taken directly as inputs, with the assumption that the photon-pion interaction dominates over other meson-photon couplings. Combining with the quark core contribution evaluated in quark model, the proton electromagnetic form factors are well reproduced in the work. The resulting mean-square charge radius of the proton agrees well with experimental data, and the quark core radius is reasonable.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon-Photon Resonance Conversion of GRB221009A through Extra Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently observed very high energy (VHE) photons dubbed as GRB221009A by several terrestrial observatories such as LHAASO and Carpet-2 require a physics explanation beyond the standard model. Such energetic gamma ray bursts, originating from yet unknown very distance source at redshift z = 0.1505, would be directly scattererd by extragalactic background lights (EBL) rendering its improbable detection at the earth. We show that dark photon which resides in extra dimension would be able to resolve this issue when it oscillates resonantly with the photon in similar fashion with neutrino oscillation. We demonstrate that, for dark photon mass equals to 1 eV, the probability of GRB221009A photons with energy above 0.2 TeV to reach the earth lies in the range between $10^{-6} \, \text{to} \, 95\% $ for kinetic mixing values $10^{-14} \leq \epsilon \leq 10^{-12.5}$ allowed by current constraints.</description>

      <title>Refining Gravitational Wave and Collider Physics Dialogue via Singlet Scalar Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing effective field theory techniques, we advance computations of thermal parameters that enter predictions for the gravitational wave spectra from first-order electroweak phase transitions. Working with the real-singlet-extended Standard Model, we utilize recent lattice simulations to confirm the existence of first-order phase transitions across the free parameter space. For the first time, we account for several important two-loop corrections in the high-temperature expansion for determining thermal parameters, including the bubble wall velocity in the local thermal equilibrium approximation. We find that the requirement of completing bubble nucleation imposes stringent bounds on the new scalar boson mass. Moreover, the prospects for detection by LISA require first-order phase transitions in a two-step phase transition, which display strong sensitivity to the portal coupling between the Higgs and the singlet. Interestingly, signals from di-Higgs boson production at the HL-LHC probe parameter regions that significantly overlap with the LISA-sensitive region, indicating the possibility of accounting for both signals if detected. Conversely, depending on the mixing angle, a null result for di-Higgs production at the HL-LHC could potentially rule out the model as an explanation for gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Energy-scaling behavior of intrinsic transverse momentum parameters in Drell-Yan simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis based on models of the intrinsic transverse momentum of partons in nucleons by studying the dilepton transverse momentum in Drell-Yan events. Using parameter tuning in event generators and existing data from fixed-target experiments, from the Tevatron, and from the LHC, our investigation spans three orders of magnitude in center-of-mass energy and two orders of magnitude in dilepton invariant mass. The results show an energy-scaling behavior of the intrinsic transverse momentum parameters, independent of the dilepton invariant mass at a given center-of-mass energy.</description>

      <title>Search for Dark Matter in association with a Higgs boson at the LHC: A model independent study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical and cosmological observations strongly suggest the existence of Dark Matter. However, it's fundamental nature is still elusive. Collider experiments at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) offer a promising way to reveal the particle nature of the dark matter. In such an endeavour, we investigate the potential of the mono-Higgs plus missing $E_T$ signature at the LHC to search for dark matter. Without going in a particular Ultra-Violet complete model of dark matter, we have used the framework of Effective Field Theory to describe the dynamics of a relatively light fermionic dark matter candidate, which interacts with the Standard Model via dimension-6 and dimension-7 operators involving the Higgs and the gauge bosons. Both cut-based and Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) algorithms have been used to extract the signal for dark matter production over the Standard Model backgrounds, assuming an integrated luminosity of $3000~fb^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}~=~14$ TeV at the High Luminosity phase of the LHC (HL-LHC). The BDT is seen to separate the dark matter signal at $5\sigma$ significance, for masses below 200 GeV, showcasing the prospects of this search at the HL-LHC.</description>

      <title>Sterile sector impacting the correlations and degeneracies among mixing parameters at the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physics potential of the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) in probing active-sterile mixing. We present analytic expressions for relevant oscillation probabilities for three active and one sterile neutrino of eV-scale mass and highlight essential parameters impacting the oscillation signals at DUNE. We then explore the space of sterile parameters as well as study their correlations among themselves and with parameters appearing in the standard framework ($\delta_{13}$ and $\theta_{23}$). We perform a combined fit for the near and far detector at DUNE using GLoBES. We consider alternative beam tune (low energy and medium energy) and runtime combinations for constraining the sterile parameter space. We show that charged current and neutral current interactions over the near and far detector at DUNE allow for an improved sensitivity for a wide range of sterile neutrino mass splittings.</description>

      <title>Three Generations and a Trio of Trialities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the Standard Model's $\mathfrak{su}(3)\oplus \mathfrak{su}(2)\oplus \mathfrak{u}(1)$ internal symmetries within the triality symmetries $\mathfrak{tri}(\mathbb{C}) \oplus \mathfrak{tri}(\mathbb{H}) \oplus \mathfrak{tri}(\mathbb{O})$. From here, the corresponding Standard Model group action is applied to the triality triple $\left( \Psi_+, \Psi_-,V\right)$ for $\Psi_+, \Psi_-, V \in \mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}\otimes\mathbb{O}$. Together, $\Psi_+$ and $\Psi_-$ provide the correct irreducible representations for two generations. Owing to a certain Cartan Factorization, which we define, $V$ provides the irreducible representations for a third generation. Said more explicitly in another way, division algebraic multiplication merges a third generation of spinor representations into a set of scalar bosons. This set of scalar bosons includes the familiar Standard Model Higgs representation.</description>

      <title>Nucleon tomography and total angular momentum of valence quarks from synergy between lattice QCD and elastic scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exploratory work on integrating lattice-QCD results with experimental data for elastic scattering. Within the framework of generalized parton distributions (GPDs), this approach allows for the extraction of detailed information about nucleon tomography and the total angular momentum carried by valence quarks. To accomplish this reliably, we introduce a new quantity, the "double ratio", which significantly reduces the systematic uncertainties inherent in lattice QCD computations. Moreover, we introduce a "shadow" term in the extraction procedure, which is sensitive only to lattice-QCD results. This term allows us to investigate the model dependence of the extraction, providing a more flexible description of the nucleon that goes beyond the previously considered bell-shaped distribution.</description>

      <title>Relativistic diffusion model for hadron production in p-Pb collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate charged-hadron production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions of asymmetric systems within a nonequilibrium-statistical framework. Calculated centrality-dependent pseudorapidity distributions for p-Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=5.02 and 8.16 TeV are compared with data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Our approach combines a relativistic diffusion model with formulations based on quantum chromodynamics while utilizing numerical solutions of a Fokker-Planck equation to account for the shift and broadening of the fragmentation sources for particle-production with respect to the stopping (net-baryon) rapidity distributions. To represent the centrality dependence of charged-hadron production in asymmetric systems over a broad region of pseudorapidities, the consideration and precise modelling of the fragmentation sources - along with the central gluon-gluon source - is found to be essential. Specifically, this results in an inversion of the particle-production amplitude from backward- to forward-dominance when transitioning from central to peripheral collisions, in agreement with recent ATLAS and ALICE p-Pb data at sqrt(s_NN)=5.02 TeV.</description>

      <title>Gamma Lines and Dark Matter from Anomaly Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a simple theory for physics beyond the Standard Model where a Majorana dark matter is predicted from anomaly cancellation. We discuss in detail the minimal theory where the baryon number is a local symmetry spontaneously broken at the low scale. The correlation between the cosmological constraints on the dark matter relic density, the direct detection and collider bounds is investigated. We discuss in great detail the gamma lines from dark matter annihilation showing the possibility to test these predictions in the near future at gamma-ray telescopes such as CTA. We investigate all processes contributing to the total photon flux from dark matter annihilation and point out the unique features that can be used to test this theory for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Exploring the three-dimensional momentum distribution of longitudinally polarized quarks in the proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analyzing experimental data on semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering off longitudinally polarized targets, we extract the transverse momentum dependence of the quark helicity distribution, i.e., the difference between the three-dimensional motion of quarks with polarization parallel or antiparallel to the longitudinal polarization of the parent hadron. We perform the analysis at next-to-leading (NLL) and next-to-next-to-leading (NNLL) perturbative accuracy. The quality of the fit is very good for both cases, reaching a $\chi^2$ per number of data points equal to $1.11$ and $1.09$, respectively. Although the limited number of data points leads to significant uncertainties, the data are consistent with an interpretation in which the helicity distribution is narrower in transverse momentum than the unpolarized distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first study of the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ structure-dependent electromagnetic radiative corrections to unique first-forbidden nuclear beta decays. We show that the insertion of angular momentum into the nuclear matrix element by the virtual/real photon exchange opens up the decay at vanishing nuclear recoil momentum which was forbidden at tree level, leading to a dramatic change in the decay spectrum not anticipated in existing studies. We discuss its implications for precision tests on the Standard Model and searches for new physics.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star with Dark Matter Admixture: A Candidate for Bridging the Mass Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars and black holes are the after death remnants of massive stars. However, according to the most recent observations, the neutron stars maximum mass is between $2.0-2.5 M_{\odot}$ while black holes of less than 5 $M_{\odot}$ rarely has been observed. The region between the most massive neutron star and the least massive black hole is called the mass gap. If indeed its existence is confirmed by future observations, that indicates a gap in our understanding which seeks for explanation. In addition, the existence of compact objects within the mass gap should also be supported with the help of possible new theoretical scenarios. In this letter, we propose a possible explanation for the existence of compact objects within the mass gap region. Specifically, we propose that the mass gap region could be bridged by the existence of a hybrid compact object, composed of hadronic and self interacting - non annihilating fermionic dark matter, considering that the interaction between these two fluids its only gravitational. Fundamental questions about how these objects form and how they can be detected are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Polarized and unpolarized gluon PDFs: generative machine learning applications for lattice QCD matrix elements at short distance and large momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations share a defining challenge by requiring a small finite range of spatial separation $z$ between quark/gluon bilinears for controllable power corrections in the perturbative QCD factorization, and a large hadron boost $p_z$ for a successful determination of collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs). However, these two requirements make the determination of PDFs from lattice data very challenging. We present the application of generative machine learning algorithms to estimate the polarized and unpolarized gluon correlation functions utilizing short-distance data and extending the correlation up to $zp_z \lesssim 14$, surpassing the current capabilities of lattice QCD calculations. We train physics-informed machine learning algorithms to learn from the short-distance correlation at $z\lesssim 0.36$ fm and take the limit, $p_z \to \infty$, thereby minimizing possible contamination from the higher-twist effects for a successful reconstruction of the polarized gluon PDF. We also expose the bias and problems with underestimating uncertainties associated with the use of model-dependent and overly constrained functional forms, such as $x^\alpha(1-x)^\beta$ and its variants to extract PDFs from the lattice data. We propose the use of generative machine learning algorithms to mitigate these issues and present our determination of the polarized and unpolarized gluon PDFs in the nucleon.</description>

      <title>Localized Chiral Magnetic Effect in equilibrium QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of a non-uniform magnetic background field on the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in equilibrium QCD using lattice simulations with 2+1 flavors of dynamical staggered quarks at the physical point. We show that in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field the CME manifests itself via a localized electromagnetic current density along the direction of the field, which integrates to zero over the full volume. Our primary observable is the leading-order coefficient of the current in a chiral chemical potential expansion, which we compute for various lattice spacings and extrapolate to the continuum limit. Our findings demonstrate that, even though the global spatial average of the CME conductivity vanishes in equilibrium, steady currents still exist locally. Thus, spatially modulated magnetic fields provide a possible way of generating a non-trivial CME signal in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Loosely coupled particles in warm inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological perturbations in warm inflation are conventionally described by an EFT. It consists of the inflaton field coupled to a radiation fluid and applies to energy scales of order Hubble $H$ and inflaton decay width $\gamma$, but well below temperature $T$. This EFT lacks a proper treatment of inflatons produced with energy $\sim T$. While the direct contribution of these ``UV inflatons'' to the super-horizon curvature perturbations is subdominant because of the cosmological redshift, for $\gamma \sim H$, their indirect contribution is potentially important -- by their effect on the equation of state, by being exchanged as long-lived intermediate states, and by sourcing gravitational waves with their sizable anisotropic stress. To include these effects, we add to the EFT the Boltzmann distribution of the gas of UV inflatons and compute some of the corrections.</description>

      <title>Conformal Backreaction, Chiral and Conformal Anomalies in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The backreaction of a conformal matter sector and its associated conformal anomaly on gravity can be systematically studied using the formalism of the anomaly effective action. This action, defined precisely in flat spacetime within ordinary quantum field theory, can be analyzed perturbatively in terms of external graviton insertions. The expansion coefficients correspond to correlation functions of the stress-energy tensor, which are renormalized through two key counterterms: the square of the Weyl tensor $(C^2)$ and the Gauss-Bonnet term $(E)$. Anomalous conformal Ward identities impose hierarchical constraints on this expansion, revealing that the anomaly's contribution arises from bilinear mixings of the form $R \Box^{-1} E$ and $R \Box^{-1} C^2$, supplemented by local Weyl-invariant terms. These mixings reflect the non-local structure of the anomaly. The precise form of the effective action, however, may vary depending on the regularization scheme used, with potential differences manifesting through additional Weyl-invariant terms. These actions encapsulate the breaking of Weyl invariance in the early universe, with implications that are particularly relevant during the inflationary epoch. For chiral and gravitational anomalies, we demonstrate that the corresponding effective actions exhibit similar structures, influencing the evolution of chiral asymmetries in the early universe plasma.</description>

Abstract: We present DarkCLR, a novel framework for detecting semi-visible jets at the LHC. DarkCLR uses a self-supervised contrastive-learning approach to create observables that are approximately invariant under relevant transformations. We use background-enhanced data to create a sensitive representation and evaluate the representations using a normalized autoencoder as a density estimator. Our results show a remarkable sensitivity for a wide range of semi-visible jets and are more robust than a supervised classifier trained on a specific signal.</description>

Abstract: We examine the Universe's transparency to gamma rays within a Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) framework, focusing on photon subluminal quadratic corrections driven by a high-energy scale. Based on an explicit calculation, we provide a new expression for the cross section that overcomes the limitations of previous approaches and refines existing constraints for the LIV scale, while we introduce a new approximation that may be useful in LIV scenarios beyond effective field theory. These improvements appear essential for setting constraints on LIV effects with future observations at ultra-high energies, where previous approximations may fall short.</description>

Abstract: We compute the effects due to the virtual exchange (or the soft emission) of a scalar particle with generic couplings to the top quark in $t\bar t$ pair production at the LHC. We apply the results to two cases of interest, extending and completing previous studies. First, we consider the indirect search for light ($m_S&lt;2 m_t$) top-philic scalars with CP-even and/or CP-odd interactions. Second, we investigate how to set constraints on anomalous Yukawa couplings of the Higgs boson to the top quark. Our results show that the current precision of experimental data together with the accuracy of the SM predictions make such indirect determinations a powerful probe for new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next generation of neutrino oscillation experiments, JUNO, DUNE, and HK, are under construction now and will collect data over the next decade and beyond. As there are no approved plans to follow up this program with more advanced neutrino oscillation experiments, we consider here one option that had gained considerable interest more than a decade ago: a neutrino factory. Such an experiment uses stored muons in a racetrack configuration with extremely well characterized decays reducing systematic uncertainties and providing for more oscillation channels. Such a machine could also be one step towards a high energy muon collider program. We consider a long-baseline configuration to SURF using the DUNE far detectors or modifications thereof, and compare the expected sensitivities of the three-flavor oscillation parameters to the anticipated results from DUNE and HK. We show optimal beam configurations, the impact of charge identification, the role of statistics and systematics, and the expected precision to the relevant standard oscillation parameters in different DUNE vs. neutrino factory configurations.</description>

Abstract: We examine the determination of the gluon distribution of the proton in the low-$x$, low-$Q^2$ domain of deep inelastic electron-proton scattering (DIS). Adopting two-gluon exchange as the dominant interaction in the low-$x$, low-$Q^2$ domain implying the known result of scaling of the photoabsorption cross section in terms of the scaling variable $\eta(W^2,Q^2)$, we deduce a reliable result for the gluon distribution at leading order of the perturbative QCD improved parton model that differs significantly from the widely spread results from big collaborations based on evolving from a starting scale of $Q_0^2\cong 2$ GeV$^2$. The validity of evolution upon adopting its quantitative modification at low-$Q^2$ without any modification at larger values of $Q^2$ leads to a quantitative improvement of the extraction of the gluon distribution based on evolution from a starting scale of $Q^2$ conventionally chosen as $Q^2= Q_0^2\cong 2$ GeV$^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the Regge trajectory relations for the heavy tetraquarks $(Qq)(\bar{Q}\bar{q}')$ $(Q=b,\,c;\,q,\,q'=u,\,d,\,s)$ with hidden bottom and charm. By employing the new relations, both the $\lambda$-trajectories and the $\rho$-trajectories for the tetraquarks $(Qq)(\bar{Q}\bar{q}')$ can be discussed. The masses of the $\lambda$-mode excited states and the $\rho$-mode excited states are estimated, and they agree with other theoretical predictions. We show that the behaviors of the $\rho$-trajectories are different from those of the $\lambda$-trajectories. The $\rho$-trajectories behave as $M{\sim}x_{\rho}^{1/2}$ $(x_{\rho}=n_r,\,l)$ while the $\lambda$-trajectories behave as $M{\sim}x_{\lambda}^{2/3}$ $(x_{\lambda}=N_r,\,L)$. Moreover, the Regge trajectory behaviors for other types of tetraquarks are investigated based on the spinless Salpeter equation. We show that both the $\lambda$-trajectories and the $\rho$-trajectories are concave downwards in the $(M^2,\,x)$ plane. The Regge trajectories for the tetraquarks containing the light diquark and/or the light antidiquark also are concave in the $(M^2,\,x)$ plane when the masses of the light constituents are included and the confining potential is linear.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce the More-Interaction Particle Transformer (MIParT), a novel deep learning neural network designed for jet tagging. This framework incorporates our own design, the More-Interaction Attention (MIA) mechanism, which increases the dimensionality of particle interaction embeddings. We tested MIParT using the top tagging and quark-gluon datasets. Our results show that MIParT not only matches the accuracy and AUC of LorentzNet and a series of Lorentz-equivariant methods, but also significantly outperforms the ParT model in background rejection. Specifically, it improves background rejection by approximately 25% at a 30% signal efficiency on the top tagging dataset and by 3% on the quark-gluon dataset. Additionally, MIParT requires only 30% of the parameters and 53% of the computational complexity needed by ParT, proving that high performance can be achieved with reduced model complexity. For very large datasets, we double the dimension of particle embeddings, referring to this variant as MIParT-Large (MIParT-L). We find that MIParT-L can further capitalize on the knowledge from large datasets. From a model pre-trained on the 100M JetClass dataset, the background rejection performance of the fine-tuned MIParT-L improved by 39% on the top tagging dataset and by 6% on the quark-gluon dataset, surpassing that of the fine-tuned ParT. Specifically, the background rejection of fine-tuned MIParT-L improved by an additional 2% compared to the fine-tuned ParT. The results suggest that MIParT has the potential to advance efficiency benchmarks for jet tagging and event identification in particle physics.

      <title>Heavy four-quark mesons $bc\overline{b}\overline{c}$: Scalar particle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameters of the heavy four-quark scalar meson $T_{\mathrm{bc\overline{b} \overline{c}}}$ with content $bc \overline{b}\overline{c}$ are calculated by means of the sum rule method. This structure is considered as a diquark-antidiquark state built of scalar diquark and antidiquark components. The mass and current coupling of $T_{\mathrm{bc\overline{b} \overline{c}}}$ are evaluated in the context of the two-point sum rule approach. The full width of this tetraquark is estimated by taking into account two types of its possible strong decay channels. First class includes dissociation of $T_{\mathrm{bc\overline{b}\overline{c}}} $ to mesons $\eta_c\eta_{b}$, $B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{-}$, $B_{c}^{\ast +}B_{c}^{\ast -}$ and $B_{c}^{+}(1^3P_{0})B_{c}^{\ast-}$. Another type of processes are generated by annihilations $\overline{b}b \to \overline{q}q$ of constituent $ b$-quarks which produces the final-state charmed meson pairs $D^{+}D^{-}$, $ D^{0} \overline{D}^{0}$, $D^{*+}D^{*-}$, and $D^{*0}\overline{D}^{*0}$. Partial width all of these decays are found using the three-point sum rule method which is required to calculate strong couplings at corresponding meson-meson-tetraquark vertices. Predictions obtained for the mass $m=(12697 \pm 90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma[T_{\mathrm{bc\overline{b}\overline{c} }}]=(142.4 \pm 16.9)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ of this state are compared with alternative results, and are useful for further experimental investigations of fully heavy resonances.</description>

Abstract: Charm baryon decay plays an important role in studying non-perturbative baryonic transitions. Compared to other hadron multiplets, the flavor symmetry of baryon decuplet is more simple and attractive. In this work, we study the topological amplitudes of charmed baryon decays into decuplet baryon in the flavor symmetry and the linear $SU(3)_F$ breaking. It is found most of topological diagrams are suppressed by the K\"orner-Pati-Woo theorem in the $SU(3)_F$ limit. Only two independent amplitudes contributing to the $\mathcal{B}_{c\overline 3}\to \mathcal{B}_{10}M$ decays, with one dominating the branching fractions. The Lee-Yang parameters of all $\mathcal{B}_{c\overline 3}\to \mathcal{B}_{10}M$ modes are the same in the $SU(3)_F$ limit, and there are only four possible values for the CP asymmetries. After including the first-order $SU(3)_F$ breaking effects, the $\Xi^+_c\to \Sigma^{* +}\overline K^0$ and $\Xi^+_c\to \Xi^{* 0}\pi^+$ decays have non-zero branching fractions. The number of free parameter contributing to the $\mathcal{B}_{c\overline 3}\to \mathcal{B}_{10}M$ decays in the linear $SU(3)_F$ breaking is smaller than the available data. The $SU(3)_F$ breaking part of the quark loop diagram can be extracted by global fitting of branching fractions, which could help us understand the CP violation in charm sector. Additionally, some new isospin equations are proposed to test the K\"orner-Pati-Woo theorem.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Nonstandard Interactions and Lepton Flavor Universality violation at SND@LHC via charm production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the effect of neutrino nonstandard interactions (NSI) involving the charm quark at SND@LHC. Using an effective description of new physics in terms of four-fermion operators involving a charm quark, we constrain the Wilson coefficients of the effective interaction from two and three-body charmed meson decays. In our fit, we include charmed meson decays not only to pseudoscalar final states but also to vector final states and include decays to the $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ final states. We also consider constraints from charmed baryon decays. We then study the effect of new physics in neutrino scattering processes, involving charm production at SND@LHC, for various benchmark new physics couplings obtained from the low energy fits. Finally, we also study the effects of lepton universality violation (LUV) assuming that the new physics coupling is not lepton universal.</description>

      <title>The ground states of hidden-charm tetraquarks and their radial excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the great progress in the observations of charmonium-like states in recent years, we perform a systematic analysis about the ground states and the first radially excited states of $qc\bar{q}\bar{c}$ ($q$=$u/d$ and $s$) tetraquark systems. Their mass spectra, root mean square (r.m.s.) radii and radial density distributions are predicted within the framework of relativized quark model. By comparing with experimental data, some potential candidates for hidden-charm tetraquark states are suggested. For $qc\bar{q}\bar{c}$ ($q$=$u/d$) system, if $Z_{c}(3900)$ is supposed to be a compact tetraquark state with $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$, $Z(4430)$ can be interpreted as the first radially excited states of $Z_{c}(3900)$. Another broad structure $Z_{c}(4200)$ can also be explained as a partner of $Z_{c}(3900)$, and it arise from a higher state with $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$. In addition, theoretical predictions indicate that the possible assignments for $X(3930)$, $X(4050)$ and $X(4250)$ are low lying $0^{++}$ tetraquark states. As for the $sc\bar{s}\bar{c}$ system, $X(4140)$ and $X(4274)$ structures can be interpreted as this type of tetraquark states with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$, and $X(4350)$ can be described as a $sc\bar{s}\bar{c}$ tetraquark with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$. With regard to $qc\bar{s}\bar{c}$ ($q$=$u/d$) system, we find two potential candidates for this type of tetraquark, which are $Z_{cs}(4000)$ and $Z_{cs}(4220)$ structures. The measured masses of these two structures are in agreement with theoretical predictions for the $1^{+}$ state.</description>

      <title>WIMP dark matter in bulk viscous non-standard cosmologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explored an extension of the classical non-standard cosmological scenario in which the new field, $\phi$, which interacts with the radiation component in the early universe, experiences dissipative processes in the form of a bulk viscosity. Assuming an interaction term given by $\Gamma_{\phi}\rho_{\phi}$, where $\Gamma_{\phi}$ accounts for the decay rate of the field and $\rho_{\phi}$ corresponds to its energy density, and a bulk viscosity according to the expression $\xi=\xi_{0}\rho_{\phi}^{1/2}$ in the framework of Eckart's theory, we apply this novel non-standard cosmology to study the parameters space for WIMPs Dark Matter candidate production. This parameter space shows deviations from the classical non-standard cosmological scenario, obtaining new regions to search for this candidate. In particular, for certain combinations of the free parameters, we found large regions in which the model can establish the DM and reproduce the current observable relic density.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Form Factors of Hadrons from CFT in Momentum Space and the Dilaton in Perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the hard scattering amplitude of the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of hadrons at one-loop, in relation to their conformal field theory (CFT) description, within the framework of QCD factorization for hard exclusive processes at large momentum transfers. These form factors play an essential role in studying the quark and gluon angular momentum of the hadrons due to their relation to the Mellin moments of the Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) invariant amplitudes. Our analysis is performed using a diffeomorphism invariant approach, applying the formalism of the gravitational effective action and conformal symmetry in momentum space for the discussion of the quark and gluon contributions. The interpolating correlator in the hard scattering of any GFF is the non-Abelian $TJJ$ (stress-energy/gluon/gluon) 3-point function at $O(\alpha_s^2)$, revealing an effective dilaton interaction in the $t$-channel due to the trace anomaly, in the form of a massless anomaly pole in the QCD hard scattering, constrained by a sum rule on its spectral density. We investigate the role of quarks, gauge-fixing and ghost contributions in the reconstruction of the hard scattering amplitude mediated by this interaction, performed in terms of its transverse traceless, longitudinal, and trace decomposition, as identified from CFT in momentum space ($CFT_p$). We present a convenient parameterization of the hard scattering amplitude relevant for future experimental investigations of the DVCS/GFF amplitudes at the Electron-Ion Collider at BNL.</description>

Abstract: We present the two-loop helicity amplitudes contributing to the next-to-next-to-leading order QCD predictions for W-boson production in association with two photons at the Large Hadron Collider. We derived compact analytic expressions for the two-loop amplitudes in the leading colour limit, and provide numerical results for the subleading colour contributions. We employ a compact system of integration-by-part identities provided by the NeatIBP package, allowing for an efficient computation of the rational coefficients of the scattering amplitudes over finite fields.</description>

      <title>One loop $\beta$ functions for mirror noncommutative Euclidean Yukawa sector within electroweak-scale right handed neutrinos model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the renormalization scale dependence of noncommutative mirror Yukawa couplings. To achieve this, we first formulate an Euclidean noncommutative version of the Yukawa sector within the electroweak-scale mirror right handed neutrinos model. Then, we calculate the noncommutative one loop $\beta$ functions of Yukawa couplings for mirror fermions involved in this model, by taking advantage of the Slavnov Taylor identities for the universal mirror Yukawa couplings, and by using the noncommutative vulcanised scalar and spinor propagators that prevent the UV/IR mixing. This leads us to a system of six cubic coupled first order differential equations that depend only on the mirror Yukawa couplings and not on the noncommutative deformation and vulcanised parameters. We solve this system numerically for different initial conditions to get the evolution of the mirror Yukawa couplings in terms of the renormalization scale. Furthermore, we discuss the link to the commutative case and analyze the occurrence of the Landau pole for some specific sets of initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Metastable Dark Energy Decaying into Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the proposal that an energy transfer from dark energy into dark matter can be described in field theory by a first order phase transition. We analyze the model proposed in Ref. Abdalla et al. (2013), using updated constraints on the decay time of a metastable dark energy from the work of Ref. Shafieloo et al. (2018). The results of our analysis show no prospects for potentially observable signals that could distinguish this scenario. We also show that such model would not drive a complete transition to a dark matter dominated phase even in a distant future. Nevertheless, the model is not excluded by the latest data and we confirm that the mass of the dark matter particle that would result from such a process corresponds to an axion-like particle, which is currently one of the best motivated dark matter candidates. We argue that extensions to this model, possibly with additional couplings, still deserve further attention as it could provide an interesting and viable description for an interacting dark sector scenario based in a single scalar field.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes-shadow correspondence for rotating regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eikonal quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes (BHs) and parameters of null geodesics, ultimately tied to the appearance of BHs to external observers, are known to be related, and the eikonal QNM-BH shadow radii correspondence has been extensively studied for spherically symmetric BHs. The extension to rotating BHs is non-trivial, and has been worked out only for equatorial ($m=\pm\ell$) QNMs, or for general modes but limited to the Kerr metric. We extend the QNM-shadow radius correspondence to more general rotating space-times, and argue that the requirements for it to hold amount to conditions on the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for null geodesics and the Klein-Gordon equation. Metrics obtained by the Newman-Janis algorithm enjoy these conditions, provided certain mathematical requirements are imposed on the line element. We explicitly verify the correspondence for the rotating Bardeen and Hayward regular BHs, both of which satisfy the separability requirements. Our findings show that the QNM-shadow radius correspondence holds for a wide range of axisymmetric space-times beyond Kerr. This paves the way to potential strong-field multi-messenger tests of fundamental physics by hearing (via gravitational wave spectroscopy - the "thunder") and seeing (via VLBI imaging - the "lightning") BHs, although substantial improvements relative to the current observational sensitivity are required to make this possible.</description>

Abstract: We study the influence of analytical regularization used in the generalized function (distribution) space to the Tikhonov regularization procedure utilized in the different versions of Moore-Penrose's inversion. By introducing a new analytical term to the Tikhonov regularization of Moore-Penrose's inversion procedure, we derive new optimization conditions that extend the Tikhonov regularization framework and influence the fitting parameter. This enhancement yields a more robust and accurate reconstruction of physical quantities, demonstrating its potential impact on various studies. We illustrate the significance of new term through schematic examples of physical applications, highlighting its relevance to diverse fields. Our findings provide a valuable tool for improving inversion methods and their applications in physics and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient technique for calculating the angular two-point correlation functions (or ``overlap reduction functions'') induced by gravitational waves in both the pulse arrival times of pulsars and in the angular deflections of distant sources. In the most general case, there are six auto- and cross-correlations for the pulse arrival times and the two components of the angular deflection. We provide results for spin-2 (i.e., general-relativistic) gravitational waves as well as the spin-1 modes that may arise in alternative-gravity theories. These calculations can be easily implemented for future analysis or study, and we provide code to do so.</description>

      <title>Interacting ultralight dark matter and dark energy and fits to cosmological data in a field theory approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The description of dark matter as a pressure-less fluid and of dark energy as a cosmological constant, both minimally coupled to gravity, constitutes the basis of the concordance $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ model. However, the concordance model is based on using equations of motion directly for the fluids with constraints placed on their sources, and lacks an underlying Lagrangian. In this work, we propose a Lagrangian model of two spin zero fields describing dark energy and dark matter with an interaction term between the two along with self-interactions. We study the background evolution of the fields as well as their linear perturbations, suggesting an alternative to $\Lambda$CDM with dark matter and dark energy being fundamental dynamical fields. The parameters of the model are extracted using a Bayesian inference tool based on multiple cosmological data sets which include those of Planck (with lensing), BAO, Pantheon, SH0ES, and WiggleZ. Using these data, we set constraints on the dark matter mass and the interaction strengths. Furthermore, we find that the model is able to alleviate the Hubble tension for some data sets while also resolving the $S_8$ tension.</description>

Abstract: A thorough MCMC analysis of any inflationary model against the current cosmological data is essential for assessing the validity of such a model as a viable inflationary model. Warm Inflation, producing both thermal and quantum fluctuations, yield a complex form of scalar power spectrum, which, in general, cannot be directly written as a function of the comoving wavenumber $k$, an essential step to incorporate the primordial spectra into CAMB to do an MCMC analysis through CosmoMC/Cobaya. In this paper, we devised an efficient generalized methodology to mould the WI power spectra as a function of $k$, without the need of slow-roll approximation of the inflationary dynamics. The methodology is directly applicable to any Warm Inflation model, including the ones with complex forms of the dissipative coefficient and the inflaton potential.</description>

      <title>Feasibility study of True Muonium discovery with CERN-SPS H4 positron beam</title>

Abstract: True muonium ($\mu^+\mu^-$) is one of the heaviest and smallest electromagnetic bound states not containing hadrons, and has never been observed so far. In this work it is shown that the spin-1 TM state (ortho-TM) can be observed at a discovery level of significance in three months at the CERN SPS North-Area H4A beam line, using 43.7 GeV secondary positrons. In this way, by impinging the positrons on multiple thin low-Z targets, ortho-TM, which decays predominantly to $e^+e^-$, can be produced from $e^+e^- \to TM$ interactions on resonance ($\sqrt{s} \sim 2m_{\mu}$).</description>
