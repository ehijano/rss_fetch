      <title>Prior-Adapted Progressive Time-Resolved CBCT Reconstruction Using a Dynamic Reconstruction and Motion Estimation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) provides on-board volumetric anatomy for image guidance and treatment adaptation in radiotherapy. To compensate for respiration-induced anatomical motion, time-resolved CBCT is highly desired to capture the spatiotemporal anatomical variations but faces challenges in accuracy and efficiency due to substantial optimization needed in image reconstruction and motion modeling. We proposed a fast time-resolved CBCT reconstruction framework, based on a dynamic reconstruction and motion estimation method with new reconstructions initialized and conditioned on prior reconstructions in an adaptive fashion (DREME-adapt). DREME-adapt reconstructs a time-resolved CBCT sequence from a fractional standard CBCT scan while simultaneously generating a machine learning-based motion model that allows single-projection-driven intra-treatment CBCT estimation and motion tracking. Via DREME-adapt, a virtual fraction is generated from a pre-treatment 4D-CT set of each patient for a clean, 'cold-start' reconstruction. For subsequent fractions of the same patient, DREME-adapt uses pre-derived motion models and reference CBCTs as initializations to drive a 'warm-start' reconstruction, based on a lower-cost refining strategy. Three strategies: DREME-cs which drops the 'warm-start' component, DREME-adapt-vfx which uses a fixed initialization (virtual fraction's reconstruction results), and DREME-adapt-pro which initialize reconstructions through a progressive daisy chain scheme (virtual fraction for fraction 1, fraction 1 for fraction 2, and so on), were evaluated on a digital phantom study and a patient study. DREME-adapt allows fast and accurate time-resolved CBCT reconstruction and enhances the clinical adoption potential of the DREME framework.</description>

      <title>HeartSimSage: Attention-Enhanced Graph Neural Networks for Accelerating Cardiac Mechanics Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite element analysis (FEA) forms the cornerstone of modeling cardiac biomechanics but is computationally expensive, limiting its clinical application for digital twin creation, which often requires tens to hundreds of simulations to estimate tissue parameters. We developed an attention-enhanced graph neural network (GNN)-based FEA emulator, HeartSimSage, to rapidly predict passive biventricular myocardial displacements from patient-specific geometries, chamber pressures, and material properties. HeartSimSage addresses the limitations of current emulators by effectively handling diverse three-dimensional (3D) biventricular geometries, mesh topologies, fiber directions, structurally based constitutive models, and physiological boundary conditions. It supports flexible mesh structures with variable node counts, orderings, and element connectivity. To optimize information propagation, we designed a neighboring connection strategy inspired by Graph Sample and Aggregate (GraphSAGE) that prioritizes local interactions while maintaining mid-to-long-range dependencies. We further incorporated Laplace-Dirichlet solutions for enhanced spatial encoding and employed subset-based training for improved efficiency. By integrating an attention mechanism, HeartSimSage adaptively weighs neighbor contributions and filters irrelevant information, enhancing prediction accuracy. HeartSimSage achieves approximately 13,000x speedup on GPU and 190x on CPU compared to traditional FEA, while maintaining a nominal averaged error of 0.13% +- 0.12% in predicting biventricular displacements. We validated our model using a published left ventricle dataset and conducted sensitivity analyses on hyperparameters, neighboring strategies, and the attention mechanism.</description>

      <title>A Kinematic and Kinetic Dataset of Lower Limb Joints During Obstacle Crossing in Healthy Adults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crossing obstacles is a critical component of daily walking, especially for individuals with lower limb amputations, where the challenge and fall risk are heightened. While previous studies have examined obstacle crossing, they lack a systematic analysis of kinematic and kinetic changes in lower limb joints across the entire gait cycle when crossing obstacles of varying heights. This study develops a dataset of healthy individuals crossing obstacles and systematically analyzes the kinematics and kinetics of lower limb joints at different obstacle heights. Ten healthy adults participated in the experiment, crossing obstacles of varying heights (7.5 cm, 15 cm, 22.5 cm, and 30 cm), with biomechanical data including joint angles and torques of the hip, knee, and ankle recorded. As obstacle height increased, the proportion of the swing phase in the gait cycle significantly increased; the hip joint angle increased by approximately 1.5 times, and the knee joint angle increased by about 1.0 times. Both joints also exhibited significant increases in torque. In contrast, minimal changes were observed at the ankle joint, with torque remaining stable. Additionally, noticeable differences in the kinematics and kinetics between the dominant and non-dominant foot were observed, highlighting functional asymmetry. The dominant foot exhibited greater joint angles in the hip and knee joints, and less variation in the ankle joint compared to the non-dominant foot, demonstrating more coordinated movement. This detailed analysis of gait adjustments during obstacle crossing provides valuable insights into biomechanical changes in lower limb joints.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Modeling of the Anode Heel Effect in X-ray Beam Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study enhances Monte Carlo simulation accuracy in X-ray imaging by developing an AI-driven model for the anode heel effect, achieving improved beam intensity distribution and dosimetric precision. Through dynamic adjustments to beam weights on the anode and cathode sides of the X-ray tube, our machine learning model effectively replicates the asymmetry characteristic of clinical X-ray beams. Experimental results reveal dose rate increases of up to 9.6% on the cathode side and reductions of up to 12.5% on the anode side, for energy levels between 50 and 120 kVp. These experimentally optimized beam weights were integrated into the OpenGATE and GGEMS Monte Carlo toolkits, significantly advancing dosimetric simulation accuracy and the image quality which closely resembles the clinical imaging. Validation with fluence and dose actors demonstrated that the AI-based model closely mirrors clinical beam behavior, providing substantial improvements in dose consistency and accuracy over conventional X-ray models. This approach provides a robust framework for improving X-ray dosimetry, with potential applications in dose optimization, imaging quality enhancement, and radiation safety in both clinical and research settings.</description>

      <title>A tissue-informed deep learning-based method for positron range correction in preclinical 68Ga PET imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positron range (PR) limits spatial resolution and quantitative accuracy in PET imaging, particularly for high-energy positron-emitting radionuclides like 68Ga. We propose a deep learning method using 3D residual encoder-decoder convolutional neural networks (3D RED-CNNs), incorporating tissue-dependent anatomical information through a u-map-dependent loss function. Models were trained with realistic simulations and, using initial PET and CT data, generated positron range corrected images. We validated the models in simulations and real acquisitions. Three 3D RED-CNN architectures, Single-channel, Two-channel, and DualEncoder, were trained on simulated PET datasets and evaluated on synthetic and real PET acquisitions from 68Ga-FH and 68Ga-PSMA-617 mouse studies. Performance was compared to a standard Richardson-Lucy-based positron range correction (RL-PRC) method using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), structural similarity index (SSIM), contrast recovery (CR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). CNN-based methods achieved up to 19 percent SSIM improvement and 13 percent MAE reduction compared to RL-PRC. The Two-Channel model achieved the highest CR and CNR, recovering lung activity with 97 percent agreement to ground truth versus 77 percent for RL-PRC. Noise levels remained stable for CNN models (approximately 5.9 percent), while RL-PRC increased noise by 5.8 percent. In preclinical acquisitions, the Two-Channel model achieved the highest CNR across tissues while maintaining the lowest noise level (9.6 percent). Although no ground truth was available for real data, tumor delineation and spillover artifacts improved with the Two-Channel model. These findings highlight the potential of CNN-based PRC to enhance quantitative PET imaging, particularly for 68Ga. Future work will improve model generalization through domain adaptation and hybrid training strategies.</description>

      <title>Thermally Drawn Laser-Profiled Electrode Catheters For Next Generation Tracking Using Bioelectric Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating medical instruments safely and accurately inside a patient's vascular tree has been a long-standing challenge for interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons. While x-ray fluoroscopy remains the gold standard for instrument tracking, intermittent contrast injections for angiographic imaging with fixed frames are used to ensure accurate placement of stent grafts, balloons or other endovascular devices. The latter has limitations in placement accuracy, especially when the patient anatomy deforms due to device interaction. Meanwhile, prolonged exposure to ionizing radiation poses health risks for clinicians, requiring the use of cumbersome lead vests, and contrast injections raise concern about contrast-associated acute kidney injury. Bioelectric Navigation, a non-fluoroscopic tracking modality, aims to provide an alternative by utilizing weak electric currents to locally sense anatomical features in the vasculature surrounding the catheter. In this work, we introduce a new class of electrode catheters to serve as a basis of bioelectrically trackable devices. The catheters are fabricated using a combination of rapid prototyping, thermal drawing, and laser micro-machining. We specifically manufacture a 6Fr catheter incorporating 16 electrodes, and evaluate the device on its mechanical and electrical properties. We also introduce an algorithm to track the catheter's location along the centerline of an abdominal aneurysm phantom. We report its tracking accuracy as well as its usability evaluated by an expert endovascular surgeon, demonstrating the strong potential of this technology for its integration into the existing clinical workflow.</description>

      <title>Innovative Integration of 4D Cardiovascular Reconstruction and Hologram: A New Visualization Tool for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) planning requires advanced spatial visualization and consideration of coronary artery depth, calcification, and pericardial adhesions. Objective: To develop and evaluate a dynamic cardiovascular holographic visualization tool for preoperative CABG planning. Methods: Using 4D cardiac computed tomography angiography data from 14 CABG candidates, we developed a semi-automated workflow for time-resolved segmentation of cardiac structures, epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), and coronary arteries with calcium scoring. The workflow incorporated methods for cardiac segmentation, coronary calcification quantification, visualization of coronary depth within EAT, and pericardial adhesion assessment through motion analysis. Dynamic cardiovascular holograms were displayed using the Looking Glass platform. Thirteen cardiac surgeons evaluated the tool using a Likert scale. Additionally, pericardial adhesion scores from holograms of 21 patients (including seven undergoing secondary cardiac surgeries) were compared with intraoperative findings. Results: Surgeons rated the visualization tool highly for preoperative planning utility (mean Likert score: 4.57/5.0). Hologram-based pericardial adhesion scoring strongly correlated with intraoperative findings (r=0.786, P&lt;0.001). Conclusion: This study establishes a visualization framework for CABG planning that produces clinically relevant dynamic holograms from patient-specific data, with clinical feedback confirming its effectiveness for preoperative planning.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Radical Dynamics on the Beam Temporal Profile in FLASH Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to investigate the impact of the beam temporal profile on the radical dynamics and inter-track interactions of FLASH radiotherapy, supporting parameter optimization for the equipment development and clinical implementation. Methods: MonteCarlo simulations based on the IRT method were performed to analyze the dynamics after irradiation, including single-pulse or multi-pulses irradiation, pulse repetition rate, width and dose. The physicochemical experiments were performed to measure the eaq-lifetimes for validation. The generation and recombination of OH and eaq-radicals were recorded under 6 MeV electron irradiation with varying beam temporal profiles. The radial distributions of the radicals were statistically analyzed, and the corresponding LETd and LETt were calculated. The inter-track interactions were assessed through a mathematical model. Results: The spatial distribution and temporal evolution of radicals were significantly affected by the beam time profiles. Compared with multi-pulses irradiation, single-pulse mode with a width less than 1/10 of the radical lifetime, a repetition interval longer than the radical lifetime, and a dose exceeding 1 Gy/pulse can lead to radicals rapid consumption, reducing the residual content. Instantaneous high dose rates induced radical tracks overlaps. When the single-pulse dose exceeded 1 Gy, the overlap probability approached 100%, aligning with the threshold for radical instantaneous combination. Conclusion: Under a low-duty cycle and high instantaneous dose-rate time profile, the radicals were rapidly consumed through track overlap hence reduced damage to normal tissues, inducing FLASH effect. The optimized time profile can be used to guide the development of equipment and parameter settings in clinical practice to maximize the FLASH effect, such as the laser accelerators and superconducting photocathode guns.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Diffusion Models for Sparse-View Motion-Corrected Head Cone-beam CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a imaging modality widely used in head and neck diagnostics due to its accessibility and lower radiation dose. However, its relatively long acquisition times make it susceptible to patient motion, especially under sparse-view settings used to reduce dose, which can result in severe image artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel framework, joint reconstruction and motion estimation (JRM) with adaptive diffusion model (ADM), that simultaneously addresses motion compensation and sparse-view reconstruction in head CBCT. Leveraging recent advances in diffusion-based generative models, our method integrates a wavelet-domain diffusion prior into an iterative reconstruction pipeline to guide the solution toward anatomically plausible volumes while estimating rigid motion parameters in a blind fashion. We evaluate our method on simulated motion-affected CBCT data derived from real clinical computed tomography (CT) volumes. Experimental results demonstrate that JRM-ADM substantially improves reconstruction quality over traditional model-based and learning-based baselines, particularly in highly undersampled scenarios. Our approach enables motion-robust and low-dose CBCT imaging, paving the way for improved clinical viability.</description>

      <title>On the mechanics of inhaled bronchial transmission of pathogenic microdroplets generated from the upper respiratory tract, with implications for infection onset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Could the microdroplets formed by viscoelastic stretching and break-up of mucosal liquids in the upper respiratory tract (URT), when inhaled further downwind, explain the brisk pace at which deep lung infections emerge following onset of initial infection at the URT? While it is well-established that particulates inhaled from outside can possibly penetrate to the lower airway only if they are &lt; 5 microns, the fate of particulates (many &gt; 5-microns in diameter) sheared away from the intra-URT mucosa during inhalation remains an open question. These particulates predominantly originate at the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngeal chamber with the vocal folds. To resolve the posed question, this study considers a CT-based 3D anatomical airway reconstruction and isolates the tract from the laryngeal vocal fold region, mapping the entire tracheal cavity and concluding at generation 2 of the tracheobronchial tree. Through the delineated geometry, airflow simulation is conducted using the LES scheme to replicate relaxed inhalation at 15 L/min. Against the ambient air flux, numerical experiments have been performed to monitor the transport of liquid particulates with diameters 1-30 microns, bearing physical properties akin to aerosolized mucus with embedded virions. The full-scale numerical transmission trends to the lower airway were found consistent with the findings from a reduced-order mathematical model that conceptualized the impact of intra-airway vortex instabilities on local particle transport through point vortex idealization in an anatomy-guided 2D potential flow domain. The results collectively demonstrate markedly elevated trends of deep lung penetration by the URT-derived particulates, even if they are as large as 10- and 15 microns. The high viral load carried by such droplets to the bronchial spaces could mechanistically explain the accelerated seeding of infection in the lungs.</description>

      <title>Extending the time-over-threshold calibration of Timepix3 for spatial-resolved ion spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid pixel detectors have a well-established array of applications ranging from particle physics to life sciences. The small dimensions of Timepix3 as well as its relatively low energetic expenses make it an intriguing option additionally for ion detection in nuclear physics experiments, as it reveals simultaneously precise temporal, spatial and energetic properties of recorded events from nuclear reactions. Currently, a limiting factor is the electronics behavior at high input charge resulting in improper energy determination of incident heavier ions. While the low-energy per-pixel calibration of Timepix3 is normally performed with the use of photons of up to 60 keV, the characteristic linear range permits a correct extrapolation up to only 150 keV/pixel. We developed a global per-pixel energy correction method involving the use of short-ranged accelerated ions and spectroscopic alpha sources, to suitably extend the energy determination capability of Timepix3 for nuclear ion spectroscopy experiments, where spatial and temporal precision of recorded events are equally crucial. It was found that upon applying this correction, the reliable per-pixel energy range has been increased from the original 150 keV to at least 1.1 MeV, while maintaining the relative energy resolution to better than 2.5% for stopped protons of up to 1.9 MeV and better than 3.1% for alpha particles of 5.5 MeV. Furthermore, to demonstrate the spatial resolution of Timepix3 detectors with silicon sensors, we present alpha-radiography measurements from which we extract the modulation transfer function (MTF) and produce real-world biological sample images.</description>

      <title>MRI super-resolution reconstruction using efficient diffusion probabilistic model with residual shifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective:This study introduces a residual error-shifting mechanism that drastically reduces sampling steps while preserving critical anatomical details, thus accelerating MRI reconstruction. Approach:We propose a novel diffusion-based SR framework called Res-SRDiff, which integrates residual error shifting into the forward diffusion process. This enables efficient HR image reconstruction by aligning the degraded HR and LR distributions.We evaluated Res-SRDiff on ultra-high-field brain T1 MP2RAGE maps and T2-weighted prostate images, comparing it with Bicubic, Pix2pix, CycleGAN, and a conventional denoising diffusion probabilistic model with vision transformer backbone (TM-DDPM), using quantitative metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), gradient magnitude similarity deviation (GMSD), and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). Main results: Res-SRDiff significantly outperformed all comparative methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and GMSD across both datasets, with statistically significant improvements (p-values&lt;&lt;0.05). The model achieved high-fidelity image restoration with only four sampling steps, drastically reducing computational time to under one second per slice, which is substantially faster than conventional TM-DDPM with around 20 seconds per slice. Qualitative analyses further demonstrated that Res-SRDiff effectively preserved fine anatomical details and lesion morphology in both brain and pelvic MRI images. Significance: Our findings show that Res-SRDiff is an efficient and accurate MRI SR method, markedly improving computational efficiency and image quality. Integrating residual error shifting into the diffusion process allows for rapid and robust HR image reconstruction, enhancing clinical MRI workflows and advancing medical imaging research.
