      <title>Metabolic energy expenditure for time-varying isometric forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muscles consume metabolic energy (ATP) to produce force. A mathematical model for energy expenditure can be useful in estimating real-time costs of movements or to predict energy optimal movements. Metabolic cost models developed so far have predominantly aimed at dynamic movement tasks, where mechanical work dominates. Further, while it is known that both force magnitude and rate of change of force (force rate) affect metabolic cost, it is not known how these terms interact, or if the force rate dependence can be a consequence of the force dependence. Here, we performed extensive human subject experiments, involving each subject over 5 hours of metabolic trials, which systematically changed the mean forces and forces rates so as to characterize a holistic relation for metabolic cost based on both force and force rate -- or analogously, torque and torque rate. Our experiments involved humans producing symmetric or asymmetric sinusoidal forces with different means, amplitudes, frequencies, and rise and fall periods. We showed that the metabolic cost can be well-approximated by a sum of power law functions of torque and torque rate. We found that the metabolic cost scales non-linearly with joint torque (with exponent = 1.36) and non-linearly with torque rate (with exponent = 2.5). Surprisingly, the data suggested that the cost was roughly four times higher for decreasing the torque than increasing, mirroring the analogous ratio between the cost of positive and negative work. Using these metabolic cost relations, we show that if the metabolic cost scales with particular exponents with muscle force and force rates, the same exponents will be observed in multi-joint tasks with multiple muscles. Our new metabolic cost model involving both force and force rate will potentially allow better predictions of energy optimal movements and thus inform wearable robot design and analysis.</description>

      <title>A Functional Human Liver Tissue Model: 3D Bioprinted Co-culture Discoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reduce costs and delays related to developing new and effective drugs, there is a critical need for improved human liver tissue models. Here we describe an approach for 3D bioprinting functional human liver tissue models, in which we fabricate disc-shaped structures (discoids) 200 {\mu}m in thickness and 1-3 mm in diameter, embedded in a highly permeable support medium made from packed microgels. We demonstrate that the method is precise, accurate, and scalable; up to 100 tissues per hour can be manufactured with a variability and error in diameter of about 4%. Histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation of printed discs reveal self-organization, cell cohesion, and key liver marker expression. During the course of 3-4 weeks in culture, the tissues stably synthesize albumin and urea at high levels, outperforming spheroid tissue models. We find the tissues express more than 100 genes associated with molecular absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) at levels within the range of human liver. The liver tissue models exhibit enzymatic formation of metabolites after exposure to multiple test compounds. Together, these results demonstrate the promise of 3D printed discoids for pharmacological and toxicological applications.</description>
