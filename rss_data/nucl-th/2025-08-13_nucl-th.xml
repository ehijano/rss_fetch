      <title>$\textit{Ab initio}$ Exact Calculation of Strongly-Correlated Nucleonic Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense nucleonic matter is of vital importance for understanding compact stars and inferring the transition into deconfined quark phase. We present the $\textit{ab initio}$ exact calculations of infinite nucleonic matter with the state-of-the-art full configuration-interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method, enabling us to rigorously benchmark many-body methods and assess the degree to which the nucleonic matter is strongly correlated. This method has been numerically testified to exact diagonalization within a small basis. Calculations of nucleonic matter using the chiral nuclear forces reveal that the symmetric nuclear matter is strikingly strongly correlated than expected, raising questions on previous $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations of nuclear matter with truncations and offering insights into simultaneous descriptions of finite nuclei and infinite nucleonic matter from first principles.</description>

      <title>The Quark Structure of the Nucleon and Moat Regimes in Nuclear Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a model of nuclear structure that takes into account the quark substructure of the baryons to understand the behavior of static two-point correlation functions of meson fields in dense nuclear matter. We show that these correlation functions display ``moat'' regimes, where the inverse static correlation function is nonmonotonic in momentum space. This can have interesting consequences for the nature of nuclear matter, and it strengthens the possibility of a liquid-crystal phase for high densities.</description>

      <title>The charge radii of calcium isotopes within relativistic density functional theory: nucleon's finite-size and quadrupole shape fluctuation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomaly in the charge radii of Ca isotopes has been puzzling for nuclear theory for decades. We present the first self-consistent solution to this puzzle within the density functional theory without resorting to local parameter adjustment. By taking into account both the intrinsic electromagnetic structure of nucleons and the zero-point motions of nuclear shape, which have been often neglected in previous studies, the similar charge radii of $^{40}$Ca and $^{48}$Ca as well as an inverted parabolic behavior between them are reproduced. It is found that these effects also play crucial roles in the description of the isotonic shift between the charge radii of Sn and Cd isotopes.</description>

      <title>Role of two-body dissipation on the mean-field dynamics validity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of two-body dissipation in nuclear reactions at energies of several times Coulomb barrier remains unclear but is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of deep-inelastic reactions. In this letter, we report a systematic analysis of two-body dissipation effects on the validity of mean-field dynamics, enabled by the TDHF-QRx approach, which incorporates the collision term via the relaxation-time approximation rather than full collision calculations. For deep-inelastic reactions, the contact time between nuclei is found to increase, resulting in changes to the reaction process and fragment properties such as scattering angles and total kinetic energy. These changes become important with the increase of reaction energy and decrease of impact parameter. We identify the range of reaction condition where two-body dissipation becomes significant, providing valuable insights for the applicability of mean-field dynamics approaches. The limitations of model, particularly those arising from the incomplete conservation of the locality of two-body dissipation within the quantum framework, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Separable character of ab initio NCSM one-body densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent findings on the separability of optical potentials that are derived from folding off-shell densities with off-shell nucleon-nucleon amplitudes, we study the off-shell character of one-body density matrices created within the No-Core Shell Model (NCSM). Concentrating on nuclei with a 0$^+$ ground state from $^4$He through $^{48}$Ca, we investigate the off-shell character of their one-body density matrices in momentum space when using the momentum transfer and the average momentum as variables. A singular value decomposition of the one-body density matrices reveals that they can be characterized by only very few terms, depending on the mass number of the nucleus. These findings are independent of the nucleon-nucleon interactions employed, as well as from computational specifics as grid spacing and size of the model space.</description>

      <title>On continuum and resonant spectra from exact WKB analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonance phenomena are central to many quantum systems, where resonant states are typically described by pole singularities of S-matrix. In this work, we apply the complex scaling method (CSM) and exact WKB analysis to describe scattering problems, incorporating both bound and resonant states. We compute continuum spectrum based on the exact WKB analysis and derive the S-matrix for the inverted Rosen--Morse potential. We reinterpret the Aguilar--Balslev--Combes theorem, on which CSM is based; we then discuss the physical significance of the Siegert boundary condition and rigorously define physical states in a modified Hilbert space. Our analysis connects the scattering cross-section and spectral theory, providing insights into the scattering theory and related formulas.</description>

      <title>Charge dependence of mesons with flavored contact-interaction couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective interaction models of quantum chromodynamics, based on quark degrees of freedom, have been successfully employed to compute the properties of a large array of ground and excited meson and baryon states, along with their electromagnetic form factors, distribution functions and thermal behavior. Amongst them, the contact-interaction model, while non-renormalizable, implements confinement, satisfies Lorentz covariance and correctly describes chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking pattern. Original studies focused on the light hadron sector in the isospin limit and were thereafter extended to heavy mesons and baryons. The strong effective couplings, as well as infrared and ultraviolet regulators, are flavor-dependent model parameters adjusted to reproduce hadronic observables. In contrast, in this study we combine SU(4) flavor-symmetry breaking couplings, obtained from one-loop vacuum polarization amplitudes in the presence of background constituent quark currents, with the contact-interaction model. This allows us to reduce the number of mass-dimensioned parameters and to consistently relate all flavored couplings to a single mass scale, while the masses and weak decay constants of the pions, kaons, $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are in good agreement with average reference values. Allowing for realistic isospin breaking, $m_d/m_u = 1.7$, in conjunction with the effect of the flavored couplings, leads to a mass splitting, $m_{\pi^+}- m_{\pi^0} \approx 0.3$ MeV, that agrees with lattice QCD values. For the kaons, the mass difference is $m_{K^0}- m_{K^\pm} \approx 2.3$ MeV, whereas $m_{D^\pm} - m_{D^0} \approx 0.5$ MeV and the $\eta_c$ is 6\% lighter than the experimental mass.</description>

      <title>Extracting temperature of plasma through fusion reactions within a transport approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the method of extracting the temperature from weighted proton-to-neutron yield ratio from fusion reactions as in the previous experiment~[W. Bang, {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{111}, 055002 (2013).] using the Texas Petawatt laser beam. The Coulomb explosion of deuterium clusters is simulated based on the particle-in-cell model in a box system with periodic boundary conditions, and fusion reactions are incorporated through the stochastic method. As long as the deuteron numbers in deuterium clusters follow a log-normal distribution, the low-energy part of the final deuteron spectrum can be fitted by a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, while there are more deuterons in the intermediate- and high-energy region compared to a thermal distribution, and dominate the weighted yield ratio. Therefore, the effective temperature extracted from the weighted yield ratio is generally higher than that from fitting the final deuteron spectrum. The local density fluctuation, which intrinsically exists due to the log-normal distribution of deuteron numbers, further enhances hot deuteron-deuteron collisions, and significantly affects the weighted yield ratio.</description>

      <title>Spinless glueballs in generalized linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the generalized linear sigma model, a comprehensive analysis of scalar and pseudoscalar glueballs and their mixing with mesons is presented. The Lagrangian of the model contains two chiral nonets, a quark-antiquark type and a two-quark two-antiquark type. The pseudoscalar and scalar glueballs are introduced through their connections with the axial and the trace anomalies of QCD, respectively. It is found that in order to satisfy the axial anomaly and at the same time accurately generate all seven eta masses, it is necessary to include at least two pseudoscalar glueballs, a physical one and an unphysical one that gets integrated out and yields an effective instanton-type term which is needed in generation of the eta masses. At the leading order, which corresponds to keeping effective terms in the Lagrangian that contain no more than eight underlying quarks and antiquarks, the mass spectrum of the model is worked out and shown to be in complete agreement with experiment. The quark and glue contents of the isosinglet scalars below 2 GeV, and of the isosinglet pseudoscalars up to around 2.2 GeV, are analyzed in detail and their correlations with the scalar glueball condensate are examined. Decay widths of isosinglet scalars as well as different self consistencies within this framework are used to probe the glueball condensate and thereby estimate the quark and glue contents of these states. In the pseudoscalar sector, the state that is dominantly made of glue is clearly a state with mass above 2 GeV. In the scalar sector, the identification of glue contents is less certain and in principle the three isosinglets in the 1.5-2.0 GeV can contain substantial glue. These glue contents are determined as functions of the scalar glueball condensate which is the key quantity in this analysis.</description>

      <title>Coulomb excitation of $^{124}$Te: Emerging collectivity and persisting seniority structure in the $6_1^+$ level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-lying energy spectra of even-even tellurium isotopes near midshell have long been interpreted as `textbook' examples of vibrational collective motion. However, in many cases electric-quadrupole observables, which are a particularly sensitive probe of collectivity, remain undetermined. Coulomb-excitation measurements were performed to measure transition strengths connecting the ground and low-excitation states in $^{124}$Te. This isotope lies at a transitional point between collective structure near the neutron midshell and seniority structures near the $N=82$ shell. A transition strength, $B(E2; 6_1^+ \to 4_1^+)$, of 27(9)~W.u. was measured for the $6^+_1\rightarrow4^+_1$ transition for the first time in this nucleus; this value is significantly below that expected for a spherical vibrator, as well as other collective models. We examine the transition strengths in $^{124}$Te and its neighbors by comparison with large-basis shell-model calculations and by comparison with General Collective Model (GCM) fits. A GCM description of $^{120}$Te agrees with experimental $E2$ transition strengths, but no comparable description of $^{124}$Te is possible with the GCM. In contrast, there is remarkably good agreement between the $B(E2; 6_1^+ \to 4_1^+)$ values and shell-model calculations for $^{124-134}$Te. It appears that, despite approaching midshell, $^{124}$Te retains a seniority structure for the $6^+_1$ level, i.e. a significant $\pi 0g_{7/2}^2$ contribution. This persistence of the shell structure at the $6^+_1$ state is in contrast to the $B(E2)$ values of the lower-excitation $2^+_1$ and $4^+_1$ states in $^{124}$Te, and neighboring $^{120}$Te and $^{122}$Te, for which the collectivity becomes enhanced as more neutrons are removed from $N=82$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cooling of isolated dark-matter-admixed neutron stars, employing a realistic nuclear equation of state and realistic nuclear pairing gaps, together with fermionic dark matter of variable particle mass and dark-matter fraction. The related parameter space is scanned for the stellar structural and cooling properties. We find that a consistent description of all current cooling data requires fast direct Urca cooling and reasonable proton 1S0 gaps. but no neutron 3P2 pairing. Dark matter affects the cooling properties by a modification of the nuclear density profiles, but also changes stellar radius and maximum mass. Possible signals of a large dark matter content could be a very massive but slow-cooling star or a very light but fast-cooling star.</description>

      <title>Multipolar transitions excited by twisted photons in heavy quarkonia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the excitation of multipole transitions in quarkonium systems by high-energy photons carrying orbital angular momentum. We derive explicit expressions for the amplitude and probability of photoexcitation incorporating the dynamics of the quarkonium center of mass. It is shown that the leading contribution to the transitions induced by twisted photons comes from the multipole $j=|m_\gamma|$ and $m_\gamma=l'-l$ in the long-wave approximation. Despite the fact that similar transitions can be excited by plane-wave photons, twisted photons with $|m_\gamma|&gt;1$ enable the isolation of higher multipoles offering a unique spectroscopic tool. The fulfillment of the derived selection rules imposes constraints on the parameters of the wave packet of the quarkonium center of mass, since, in general, the angular momentum can be transferred to the center of mass. As a case study, we examine the octupole transition $1^{3}G_3 \rightarrow 3^{3}P_0$ in the charmonium system. We also compare the probabilities of excitation of this multipole transition by plane-wave and twisted photons with different polarizations.</description>

Abstract: Accurate modeling of the neutron star crust is essential for interpreting multimessenger observations and constraining the nuclear equation of state (EoS). However, standard phenomenological EoS models often rely on heuristic extrapolations in the low-density regime, which are inconsistent with microscopic predictions. In this work, we refine a unified meta-modeling framework for the EoS by incorporating low-density corrections based on energy density functionals constrained by ab initio neutron-matter calculations. Using Bayesian inference to combine information from astrophysical observations, nuclear theory, and experiments, we assess the impact of these corrections on key crustal properties, including the crust-core transition density and pressure, crustal composition, and moment of inertia. The improved model reduces uncertainties in the inner crust and emphasizes the importance of low-density physics in EoS modeling, highlighting the value of integrating both theoretical and observational constraints across densities to robustly describe the EoS. Moreover, the adopted approach can be readily applied to any existing EoS model to provide a solid framework for interpreting upcoming high-precision multimessenger data.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Simulations of Scattering in Scalar Field Theory on 120 Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulations of collisions of fundamental particles on a quantum computer are expected to have an exponential advantage over classical methods and promise to enhance searches for new physics. Furthermore, scattering in scalar field theory has been shown to be BQP-complete, making it a representative problem for which quantum computation is efficient. As a step toward large-scale quantum simulations of collision processes, scattering of wavepackets in one-dimensional scalar field theory is simulated using 120 qubits of IBM's Heron superconducting quantum computer ibm_fez. Variational circuits compressing vacuum preparation, wavepacket initialization, and time evolution are determined using classical resources. By leveraging physical properties of states in the theory, such as symmetries and locality, the variational quantum algorithm constructs scalable circuits that can be used to simulate arbitrarily-large system sizes. A new strategy is introduced to mitigate errors in quantum simulations, which enables the extraction of meaningful results from circuits with up to 4924 two-qubit gates and two-qubit gate depths of 103. The effect of interactions is clearly seen, and is found to be in agreement with classical Matrix Product State simulations. The developments that will be necessary to simulate high-energy inelastic collisions on a quantum computer are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Recent experimental data show an unexpectedly large spin alignment of $\phi$ mesons in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, which can be explained by short-distance fluctuations of strong force fields (vector $\phi$ fields) within the constituent-quark model. We calculate the hyperon spin correlations within the same model, taking into account hydrodynamic effects and a $\phi$ field fluctuating in space-time according to a Gaussian distribution. The $\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ spin correlation induced by the $\phi$ field is shown to be negative as opposed to that of $\Lambda\Lambda$ or $\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$. We thus propose a new net spin correlation as a sensitive probe to separate strong force effects from hydrodynamic ones. With the strength of the field fluctuations extracted from the observed $\phi$ spin alignment, we predict the collision energy dependence of the hyperon spin correlations and also investigate the dependence of net spin correlation on azimuthal-angle and rapidity difference.</description>
