      <title>New approach in the Besov space to the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the D-dimensional fractional magnetic B\'enard system without thermal diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the existence and uniqueness of local weak solutions for the d-dimensional $(d \geq 2)$ fractional magnetic B\'enard system without thermal diffusion, integrating the B\'enard equation and MHD system. For $\kappa = 0$ and $1 \leq \alpha=\beta &lt; 1 + \dfrac{d}{4}$, we establish that any starting conditions $(u_{0},B_{0})\in B_{2,1}^{1+\frac{d}{2}-2\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ and $\theta_{0}\in B_{2,1}^{1+\frac{d}{2}-\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$.</description>

      <title>On the Onsager's energy conservation for the convergence dynamics of the 3D-Leray-$\alpha$ gaseous star model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents a model that accurately represents the motions of gaseous stars We employ the Navier-Stokes-Poisson system to transform compressible Euler equations into non-compressible ones by combining quasineutral and inviscid conditions. We intend to put Onsager's hypothesis to the test using the Leray-alpha gaseous star model. This conjecture connects energy conservation with the regularity of weak solutions in the Euler equations. The model used in this work functions as an inviscid regularization of the Euler equations. It technically converges to the Euler equations as the regularization length scale $\alpha$ approaches $0^{+}$.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a first order in time nonlinear wave equation with nonhomogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann type boundary conditions in fractional Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the well-posedness of a first order in time nonlinear wave equation with nonhomogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann type boundary conditions, also known as known as Hodge, Lions or Navier-slip boundary conditions, in fractional Sobolev spaces. We do this by first showing the well-posedness of an abstract system and then apply the results to concrete operators and function spaces that represent the different boundary conditions in an appropriate sense. The analysis of the abstract system is based on a spectral decomposition of a positive self adjoint operator. The regularity of the solution is given in terms of the domains of fractional powers of this operator. Using Galerkins method and Newton-Kantorovich Theorem, we prove well-posedness of the abstract nonlinear system with possibly nonhomogeneous boundary conditions. The connection between the domains of fractional powers of the operator and fractional Sobolev spaces makes it possible to obtain results for a system with nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions with fractional Sobolev space regularity. For the Neumann type boundary conditions we show an integer valued Sobolev regularity of the solution.</description>

Abstract: This work is concerned with 2D-Navier Stokes equations in a multiply-connected bounded domain with permeable walls. The permeability is described by a Navier type condition.

      <title>Construction of solutions to a nonlinear critical elliptic system via local Pohozaev identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the following elliptic system with Sobolev critical growth $-\Delta u+P(|y'|,y'')u=u^{2^*-1}+\frac{\beta}{2} u^{\frac{2^*}{2}-1}v^{\frac{2^*}{2}},\ y\in R^N$,
  $-\Delta v+Q(|y'|,y'')v=v^{2^*-1}+\frac{\beta}{2} v^{\frac{2^*}{2}-1}u^{\frac{2^*}{2}}$, $y\in R^N ,u,v&gt;0,u,\,v\in H^1(R^N), $ where~$(y',y'')\in R^2 \times R^{N-2}$, $P(|y'|,y''), Q(|y'|,y'')$ are bounded non-negative function in $R^+\times R^{N-2}$, $2^*=\frac{2N}{N-2}$. By combining a finite reduction argument and local Pohozaev type of identities, assuming that $N\geq 5$ and $r^2(P(r,y'')+\kappa ^2Q(r,y''))$ have a common topologically nontrivial critical point, we construct an unbounded sequence of non-radial positive vector solutions of synchronized type, whose energy can be made arbitrarily large. Our result extends the result of a single critical problem by [Peng, Wang and Yan,J. Funct. Anal. 274: 2606-2633, 2018]. The novelties mainly include the following two aspects. On one hand, when $N\geq5$, the coupling exponent $\frac{2}{N-2}&lt;1$, which creates a great trouble for us to apply the perturbation argument directly. This constitutes the main difficulty different between the coupling system and a single equation. On the other hand, the weaker symmetry conditions of $P(y)$ and $Q(y)$ make us not estimate directly the corresponding derivatives of the reduced functional in locating the concentration points of the solutions, we employ some local Pohozaev identities to locate them.</description>

      <title>The time periodic problem for the Navier-Stokes equations in exterior domains in weighted spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers the time periodic problem of the Navier-Stokes system in an exterior domain under time periodic external forces. Existence of periodic mild solutions is obtained in the critical scale invariant space $C(\mathbb{R};L^n)$ if the external force is small without exploiting any divergence form as in the study of Okabe and Tsutsui (2017) for the whole space case in Lorentz spaces. Previous studies mainly rely on either potential theoretical estimates or time-space integral estimates in Lorentz spaces introduced by Yamazaki (Math. Ann.(2000)). To the best of our knowledge, there are no results using Muckenhoupt weights in $L^q$ class for $1&lt; q &lt;\infty$ to construct time periodic solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations in the exterior domain case. In this article, a new method based on radially symmetric Muckenhoupt weights in space is used. To apply these weights, we reconsider weighted $L^p$-$L^q$ decay estimates for the Stokes semigroup. This important result was announced by Kobayashi and Kubo (2012-2015) about ten years ago with a sketch of the proof by Kubo. In this paper, we give a rigorous proof of the result and, as an important application, solve the time periodic problem for the Navier-Stokes equations on an exterior domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the asymptotic behavior of the free boundary of the solution to the exterior Bernoulli problem for the half Laplacian when the Bernoulli's gradient parameter tends to $0^+$ and to $+\infty$. Moreover, we show that, under suitable conditions, the perpendicular rays of the free boundary always meets the convex envelope of the fixed boundary.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of periodic wave trains in the FitzHugh-Nagumo system against fully nonlocalized perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a nonlinear stability theory has been developed for periodic wave trains in reaction-diffusion systems, which diverges from previous approaches by lifting all localization or periodicity assumptions on perturbations. It solely relies on decay caused by diffusive smoothing in combination with spatio-temporal phase modulation and the Cole-Hopf transformation to close the nonlinear iteration argument. In this paper, we extend this theory beyond the parabolic setting by proving nonlinear stability of wave trains in the FitzHugh-Nagumo system against $C_{\mathrm{ub}}$-perturbations. Our analysis hinges on the observation that the high-frequency component of the $C_0$-semigroup generated by the linearization is (exponentially) damped, which serves to effectively compensate for the incomplete parabolicity. A novel challenge is that the temporal Green's function associated with the linearization is not an (integrable) function, complicating mode filtration in $C_{\mathrm{ub}}(\mathbb{R})$ using the Floquet-Bloch transform. Instead, we resort on its inverse Laplace representation to decompose the semigroup into high- and low-frequency parts and link to the Floquet-Bloch representation for low-frequency modes only. A second challenge arises in controlling regularity in the quasilinear iteration scheme for the modulated perturbation in the absence of parabolic smoothing. We tackle this issue by extending the method of nonlinear damping estimates to nonlocalized perturbations by using uniformly local Sobolev norms. Our approach does not exploit the specific structure of the FitzHugh-Nagumo system; rather, it is designed to apply to general dissipative semilinear problems as long as the linearization about the wave train generates a $C_0$-semigroup, which exhibits high-frequency damping.</description>

      <title>Classification and stability of penalized pinned elasticae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers critical points of the length-penalized elastic bending energy among planar curves whose endpoints are fixed. We classify all critical points with an explicit parametrization. The classification strongly depends on a special penalization parameter $\hat{\lambda}\simeq 0.70107$. Stability of all the critical points is also investigated, and again the threshold $\hat{\lambda}$ plays a decisive role. In addition, our explicit parametrization is applied to compare the energy of critical points, leading to uniqueness of minimal nontrivial critical points. As an application we obtain eventual embeddedness of elastic flows.</description>

      <title>Uniform log-Sobolev inequalities for mean field particles beyond flat-convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the nice recent work [48], S. Wang established uniform log-Sobolev inequalities for mean field particles when the energy is flat convex. In this note we comment how to extend his proof to some semi-convex energies provided the curvature lower-bound is not too negative. It is not clear that this could be obtained simply by applying a posteriori a perturbation argument to Wang's result. Rather, we follow his proof and, at steps where the convexity is used, we notice that the uniform conditional or local functional inequalities assumed give some room to allow for a bit of concavity. In particular, this allows to recover other previous results on non-convex systems at high temperature or weak coupling, and to consider situations which mix flat-convexity and weak coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the analytical and numerical study of a mathematical model for brain tumors with radiotherapy influence. Under certain assumptions on the given data in the model, we prove existence and uniqueness of a weak nonnegative (biological relevant) solution. Then, assuming only more regular initial data, we obtain the extra regularity of this solution. Besides, we analyze the optimal control of the advection coefficient responding for the radiotherapy effect on the tumor cell population. Finally, we provide numerical illustration to all obtained analytical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the subcritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) in dimension one posed on the unbounded real line. Several previous works have considered the deep neural network approximation of NLS solutions from the numerical and theoretical point of view in the case of bounded domains. In this paper, we introduce a new PINNs method to treat the case of unbounded domains and provide rigorous bounds on the associated approximation error in terms of the energy and Strichartz norms, provided a reasonable integration scheme is available. Applications to traveling waves, breathers and solitons, as well as numerical experiments confirming the validity of the approximation are also provided as well.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we study a discrete Coagulation-Fragmentation equation with a multiplicative coagulation kernel and a constant fragmentation kernel, which is critical. We apply the discrete Bernstein transform to the original Coagulation-Fragmentation equation to get two new singular Hamilton-Jacobi equations and use viscosity solution methods to analyze them. We obtain well-posedness, regularity, and long-time behaviors of the viscosity solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi equations in certain ranges, which imply the well-posedness and long-time behaviors of mass-conserving solutions to the Coagulation-Fragmentation equation. The results obtained provide some definitive answers to a conjecture posed in [11,10], and are counterparts to those for the continuous case studied in [32].</description>

Abstract: In this article, we consider the singular $p-$biharmonic problem involving Hardy potential and citical Hardy-Sobolev exponent. We study the existence of ground state solutions and least energy sign-changing solutions of the following problem \begin{equation*} \Delta_{p}^{2} u -\lambda_{1} \frac{|u|^{p-2}u}{|x|^{2p}}= \frac{|u|^{p_{*}(\alpha)-2}}{|x|^{\alpha}}u+\lambda_{2}\Big(|x|^{-\beta}*|u|^{q}\Big)|u|^{q-2}u \quad\mbox{ in }\R^{N}, \end{equation*} where $p&gt;2$, $2&lt;q&lt; p_{*}(\alpha)$, $\lambda_{1}&gt;0$, $\lambda_{2} \in \R$, $\alpha, \beta \in (0,N)$, $p_{*}(\alpha)=\frac{p(N-\alpha)}{N-2p}$ and $N\geq 5$. Firstly, we study existence of ground state solutions by using the minimization method on the associated Nehari manifold. Then, we investigate the least energy sign-changing solutions by considering the Nehari nodal set.</description>

      <title>Gradient estimates for parabolic nonlinear nonlocal equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary objective of this work is to establish pointwise gradient estimates for solutions to a class of parabolic nonlinear nonlocal measure data problems, expressed in terms of caloric Riesz potentials of the data. As a consequence of our pointwise estimates, we obtain that the first-order regularity properties of solutions to such general parabolic nonlinear nonlocal equations, both in terms of size and oscillations of the spatial gradient, closely resemble the ones of the fractional heat equation even at highly refined scales. Along the way, we show that solutions to homogeneous parabolic nonlinear nonlocal equations have H\"older continuous spatial gradients under optimal assumptions on the nonlocal tails.</description>

Abstract: We consider entire solutions $\omega\in\dot H^1(\mathbb R^2;\mathbb R^3)$ of the $H$-system $\Delta\omega=2\omega_x\wedge\omega_y,$ which we refer to as bubbles. Surprisingly, and contrary to conjectures raised in the literature, we find that bubbles with degree at least three can be degenerate: the linearized $H$-system around a bubble can admit solutions that are not tangent to the smooth family of bubbles. We then give a complete algebraic characterization of degenerate bubbles.</description>

      <title>Cauchy Problem for the Dirac operator on spatially non-compact spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a globally hyperbolic manifold with complete spacelike Cauchy hypersurface $\Sigma$. We prove well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for the Dirac operator on globally hyperbolic manifolds with complete Cauchy hypersurfaces. This result is needed as preparation in showing a Fredholmness result in the manner, provided by B\"ar and Strohmaier, for certain non-compact Cauchy hypersurfaces in future work. The results already have been published for a simpler setting in arxiv:2107.0853(2). This version is only focused on the Cauchy problem for a slightly modified setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the long term dynamics of the non-autonomous McKean-Vlasov stochastic reaction-diffusion equations on R^n. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of pullback measure attractors of the non-autonomous dynamical system generated by the solution operators defined in the space of probability measures. We then prove the existence and uniqueness of invariant measures and periodic measures of the equation under further conditions. We finally establish the upper semi-continuity of pullback measure attractors as well as the convergence of invariant measures and periodic measures when the distribution dependent stochastic equations converge to a distribution independent system.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence and some moment estimates for an invariant measure $\mu$ for the two-dimensional ($2$D) deterministic Euler equations on the unbounded domain $\mathbb R^2$ and with highly regular initial data. The result is achieved by first showing the existence of Markov stationary processes which solve the hyperviscous $2$D Navier-Stokes equations with kinematic viscosity $\nu&gt;0$ and an additive stochastic noise scaling as $\sqrt \nu$. We then study the inviscid limit and prove that, as $\nu$ tends to $0$, these processes converge, in an appropriate trajectory space, to a pathwise stationary solution to the Euler equations. Its law is the sought invariant measure $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Nonnegative cross-curvature in infinite dimensions: synthetic definition and spaces of measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonnegative cross-curvature (NNCC) is a geometric property of a cost function defined on a product space that originates in optimal transportation and the Ma-Trudinger-Wang theory. Motivated by applications in optimization, gradient flows and mechanism design, we propose a variational formulation of nonnegative cross-curvature on c-convex domains applicable to infinite dimensions and nonsmooth settings. The resulting class of NNCC spaces is closed under Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and for this class, we extend many properties of classical nonnegative cross-curvature: stability under generalized Riemannian submersions, characterization in terms of the convexity of certain sets of c-concave functions, and in the metric case, it is a subclass of positively curved spaces in the sense of Alexandrov. One of our main results is that Wasserstein spaces of probability measures inherit the NNCC property from their base space. Additional examples of NNCC costs include the Bures-Wasserstein and Fisher-Rao squared distances, the Hellinger-Kantorovich squared distance (in some cases), the relative entropy on probability measures, and the 2-Gromov-Wasserstein squared distance on metric measure spaces.</description>

Abstract: We study axisymmetric solutions to the wave equation on extremal Kerr backgrounds and obtain integrated local energy decay (or Morawetz estimates) through an analysis \textit{exclusively in physical-space}. Boundedness of the energy and Morawetz estimates for axisymmetric waves in extremal Kerr were first obtained by Aretakis through the construction of frequency-localized currents used in particular to express the trapping degeneracy. Here we extend to extremal Kerr a method introduced by Stogin in the sub-extremal case, simplifying Aretakis' derivation of Morawetz estimates through purely classical currents.</description>

      <title>Finite energy well-posedness for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with non-vanishing conditions at infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relevant physical phenomena are described by nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with non-vanishing conditions at infinity. This paper investigates the respective 2D and 3D Cauchy problems. Local well-posedness in the energy space for energy-subcritical nonlinearities, merely satisfying Kato-type assumptions, is proven, providing the analogue of the well-established local $H^1$-theory for solutions vanishing at infinity. The critical nonlinearity will be simply a byproduct of our analysis and the existing literature. Under an assumption that prevents the onset of a Benjamin-Feir type instability, global well-posedness in the energy space is proven for a) non-negative Hamiltonians, b) sign-indefinite Hamiltonians under additional assumptions on the zeros of the nonlinearity, c) generic nonlinearities and small initial data. The cases b) and c) only concern 3D.</description>

      <title>The Moser method and boundedness of solutions to infinitely degenerate elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02873v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is equipped with certain non-doubling metric and an Orlicz-Sobolev inequality holds for a special family of Young functions $\Phi $, then weak solutions to quasilinear infinitely degenerate elliptic divergence equations of the form $$\mathrm{div}\mathcal{A}\left( x,u\right) \nabla u=\phi _{0}-\mathrm{div}_{A} \vec{\phi}_{1}$$ are locally bounded. Furthermore, we establish a maximum principle for solutions whenever a global Orlicz-Soblev estimate is available. We obtain these results via the implementation of a Moser iteration method, what constitutes the first instance of such technique applied to infinite degenerate equations. These results partially extend previously known estimates for solutions of these equations but for which the right hand side did not have a drift term. We also obtain bounds for small negative powers of nonnegative solutions; these will be applied to obtain continuity of solutions in a subsequent paper.</description>

Moreover, we show existence for a non-homogeneous double-phase problem.

Abstract: Mass-conserving reaction-diffusion systems with bistable nonlinearity are useful models for studying cell polarity formation, which is a key process in cell division and differentiation. We rigorously show the existence and stability of stationary solutions with a single internal transition layer in such reaction-diffusion systems under general assumptions by the singular perturbation theory. Moreover, we present a meaningful model for understanding the existence of an unstable transition layer solution; our numerical simulations show that the unstable solution is a separatrix of the dynamics of the model.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of the sine-Gordon kinks under perturbations in weighted Sobolev norms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic stability of the sine-Gordon kinks under small perturbations in weighted Sobolev norms. Our main tool is the B\"acklund transform which reduces the study of the asymptotic stability of the kinks to the study of the asymptotic decay of solutions near zero. Our results consist of two parts. First, we prove an asymptotic stability result similar to the local results in arXiv:2003.09358 and arXiv:2009.04260. Our assumptions are the same as those in the local result in arXiv:2009.04260. In its proof, we apply a result obtained by the inverse scattering method on the local decay of the solutions with sufficiently small and localized initial data. Moreover, we derive an asymptotic formula for the perturbations, i.e. the difference between solutions and kinks. This result is similar to that in arXiv:2106.09605 and the full asymptotic stability result in arXiv:2009.04260. In its proof, we apply a result obtained by the method of testing by wave packets on the pointwise decay of the solutions with small and localized data.</description>

      <title>Local and Global Analysis of Semilinear Heat Equations with Hardy Potential on Stratified Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On stratified Lie groups we study a semilinear heat equation with the Hardy potential, a power non-linearity and a forcing term which depends only upon the spacial variable. The analysis of an equivalent formulation to the problem and an application of a decade old result of Avelin et al. facilitates the management of the singularity in the Hardy potential, thereby yielding results pertaining to both local and global nonexistence. In addition, local existence is verified when the gradient term appearing in the Hardy potential is unimodular almost everywhere. The global existence is also proved under an additional assumption that the forcing term depends on the time variable as well. Through these results this paper sheds light on the possible pivotal exponents for the existence of both local and global solutions to the equation, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between the model's parameters and the underlying stratified Lie group structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove optimal regularity results in $L_p$-based function spaces in space and time for a large class of linear parabolic equations with a nonlocal elliptic operator in bounded domains with limited smoothness. Here the nonlocal operator is given by a strongly elliptic and even pseudodifferential operator of order $2a$ ($0&lt;a&lt;1$) with nonsmooth $x$-dependent coefficients. This includes the prominent case of the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^a$, as well as elliptic operators $(-\nabla \cdot A(x)\nabla+b(x))^a$. The proofs are based on general results on maximal $L_p$-regularity and its relation to $\mathcal{R}$-boundedness of the resolvent of the associated (elliptic) operator. Finally, we apply these results to show existence of strong solutions locally in time for a class of nonlinear nonlocal parabolic equations, which include a fractional nonlinear diffusion equation and a fractional porous medium equation after a transformation.
  The nonlinear results are new for operators on domains with boundary; the linear results are so when $P$ is $x$-dependent nonsymmetric.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to prove the existence of Hadamard states for the Maxwell equations on any globally hyperbolic spacetime. This will be achieved by introducing a new gauge fixing condition, the Cauchy radiation gauge, that will allow to suppress all the unphysical degrees of freedom. The key ingredient for achieving this gauge is a new Hodge decomposition for differential k-forms in Sobolev spaces on complete (possibly non-compact) Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>An extension to non-nilpotent groups of Rothschild-Stein lifting method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their celebrated paper of 1976, Rothschild and Stein prove a lifting procedure that locally reduces to a free nilpotent Lie algebra any family of smooth vector fields $X_1,\dots,X_q$, over a manifold $M$. Then, a large class of differential operators can be lifted, and fundamental solutions on the lifted space can be re-projected to fundamental solutions of the given operators on $M$. In case that the Lie algebra $\mathfrak g=\mbox{Lie}(X_1,\dots,X_q)$ is finite dimensional but not nilpotent, this procedure could introduce a strong tilting of the space. In this paper we represent a global construction of a Lie group $G$ associated to $\mathfrak g$ that avoid this tilting problem. In particular $\mbox{Lie}(G)\cong\mathfrak g$ and a right $G$-action exists over $M$, faithful and transitive, inducing a natural projection $E\colon G\to M$. We represent the group $G$ as a direct product $M\times G^z$ where the model fiber $G^z$ has a group structure. We prove that for any simply connected manifold $M$ -- and a vast class of non-simply connected manifolds -- a fundamental solution for a differential operator $L=\sum_{\alpha\in\mathbb N^q} r_\alpha\cdot X^\alpha$ of finite degree over $M$ can be obtained, via a saturation method, from a fundamental solution for the associated lifted operator over the group $G$. This is a generalization of Biagi and Bonfiglioli analogous result for homogeneous vector fields over $M=\mathbb R^n$.</description>

Abstract: We consider perturbations of the one-dimensional cubic Schr\"odinger equation, of the form $i \, \partial_t \psi + \partial_x^2 \psi + |\psi|^2 \psi + g( |\psi|^2 ) \psi = 0$. Under hypotheses on the function $g$ that can be easily verified in some cases (such as $g(s) = s^\sigma$ with $\sigma &gt;1$), we show that the linearized problem around a small solitary wave presents a unique internal mode. Moreover, under an additional hypothesis (the Fermi golden rule) that can also be verified in the case of powers $g(s) = s^\sigma$, we prove the asymptotic stability of the solitary waves with small frequencies.</description>

      <title>Liouville theorems and universal estimates for superlinear elliptic problems without scale invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give applications of known and new Liouville type theorems to universal singularity and decay estimates for non scale invariant elliptic problems, including Lane-Emden and Schr\"odinger type systems. This applies to various classes of nonlinearities with regular variation and possibly different behaviors at $0$ and $\infty$. To this end, we adapt the method from [72] to elliptic systems, which relies on a generalized rescaling technique and on doubling arguments from [55].
  This is in particular facilitated by new Liouville type theorems in the whole space and in a half-space, for elliptic problems without scale invariance, that we obtain. Our results apply to some non-cooperative systems, for which maximum principle based techniques such as moving planes do not apply. To prove these Liouville type theorems, we employ two methods, respectively based on Pohozaev-type identities combined with functional inequalities on the unit sphere, and on reduction to a scalar equation by proportionality of components.
  In turn we will survey the existing methods for proving Liouville-type theorems for superlinear elliptic equations and systems, and list some of the typical existing results for (Sobolev subcritical) systems.
  In the case of scalar equations, we also revisit the classical Gidas-Spruck integral Bernstein method, providing some improvements which turn out to be efficient for certain nonlinearities, and we next compare the performances of various methods on a benchmark example.</description>

      <title>A gradient system based on anisotropic monochrome image processing with orientation auto-adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the mathematical analysis of a system of pseudo-parabolic partial differential equations governed by an energy functional, associated with anisotropic monochrome image processing. The energy functional is based on the one proposed by [Berkels et al. Cartoon extraction based on anisotropic image classification, SFB 611, 2006], which incorporates an orientation auto-adjustment mechanism, and our energy is a simplified version which reduces the order of derivatives to improve computational efficiency. The aim of this paper is to establish a stable minimization process that addresses some instability of the algorithm caused by the reduction of derivative order. As a part of the study, we here prove Main Theorems concerned with the well-posedness of the pseudo-parabolic system, and provide a mathematically rigorous guarantee for the stability of the image denoising process derived from our system.</description>

      <title>The Least Action Admissibility Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a new admissibility criterion for choosing physically relevant weak solutions of the equations of Lagrangian and continuum mechanics when non-uniqueness of solutions to the initial value problem occurs. The criterion is motivated by the classical least action principle but is now applied to initial value problems which exhibit non-unique solutions. Examples are provided to Lagrangian mechanics and the Euler equations of barotropic fluid mechanics. In particular an example is provided which shows the least action admissibility principle prefers the classical two shock solution to the Riemann initial value problem to solutions generated by convex integration, yet for the same example Dafermos's entropy rate criterion prefers the convex integration solutions to the two shock solution.</description>

      <title>H\"older regularity of solutions of the steady Boltzmann equation with soft potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the H\"older regularity of solutions to the steady Boltzmann equation with in-flow boundary condition in bounded and strictly convex domains $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{3}$ for gases with cutoff soft potential $(-3&lt;\gamma&lt;0)$. We prove that there is a unique solution with a bounded $L^{\infty}$ norm in space and velocity. This solution is H\"older continuous, and it's order depends not only on the regularity of the incoming boundary data, but also on the potential power $\gamma$. The result for modulated soft potential case $-2&lt;\gamma&lt;0$ is similar to hard potential case $(0\leq\gamma&lt;1)$ since we have $C^{1}$ velocity regularity from collision part. However, we observe that for very soft potential case $(-3&lt;\gamma\leq -2)$, the regularity in velocity obtained by the collision part is lower (H\"older only), but the boundary regularity still can transfer to solution (in both space and velocity) by transport and collision part under the restriction of $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Optimal boundary gradient estimates for the insulated conductivity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the boundary gradient estimate of the solution to the insulated conductivity problem with the Neumann boundary data when a convex insulating inclusion approaches the boundary of the matrix domain. The gradient of solutions may blow up as the distance between the inclusion and the boundary, denoted as $\varepsilon$, approaches to zero. The blow up rate was previously known to be sharp in dimension $n=2$ (see Ammari et al.\cite{AKLLL}). However, the sharp rates in dimensions $n\geq3$ are still unknown. In this paper, we solve this problem by establishing upper and lower bounds on the gradient and prove that the optimal blow up rates of the gradient are always of order $\epsilon^{-1/2}$ for general strictly convex inclusions in dimensions $n\geq3$. Several new difficulties are overcome and the impact of the boundary data on the gradient is specified. This result highlights a significant difference in blow-up rates compared to the interior estimates in recent works (\cites{LY,Weinkove,DLY,DLY2,LZ}), where the optimal rate is $\epsilon^{-1/2+\beta(n)}$, with $\beta(n)\in(0,1/2)$ varying with dimension $n$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the gradient does not blow up for the corresponding Dirichlet boundary problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moderate deviation principle is achieved by the weak convergence approach for a stochastic Schr\"odinger type equation with linear drift term and noise driven by a $Q$-Wiener process.

      <title>Time-uniform log-Sobolev inequalities and applications to propagation of chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-uniform log-Sobolev inequalities (LSI) satisfied by solutions of semi-linear mean-field equations have recently appeared to be a key tool to obtain time-uniform propagation of chaos estimates. This work addresses the more general settings of time-inhomogeneous Fokker-Planck equations. Time-uniform LSI are obtained in two cases, either with the bounded-Lipschitz perturbation argument with respect to a reference measure, or with a coupling approach at high temperature. These arguments are then applied to mean-field equations, where, on the one hand, sharp marginal propagation of chaos estimates are obtained in smooth cases and, on the other hand, time-uniform global propagation of chaos is shown in the case of vortex interactions with quadratic confinement potential on the whole space. In this second case, an important point is to establish global gradient and Hessian estimates, which is of independent interest. We prove these bounds in the more general situation of non-attractive logarithmic and Riesz singular interactions.</description>

      <title>Convection-Enabled Boundary Control of a 2D Channel Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear convection, the source of turbulence in fluid flows, may hold the key to stabilizing turbulence by solving a specific cubic polynomial equation. We consider the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional channel. The tangential and normal velocities are assumed to be periodic in the streamwise direction. The pressure difference between the left and right ends of the channel is constant. Moreover, we consider no-slip boundary conditions, that is, zero tangential velocity, at the top and bottom walls of the channel, and normal velocity actuation at the top and bottom walls. We design the boundary control inputs to achieve global exponential stabilization, in the L2 sense, of a chosen Poiseuille equilibrium profile for an arbitrarily large Reynolds number. The key idea behind our approach is to select the boundary controllers such that they have zero spatial mean (to guarantee mass conservation) but non-zero spatial cubic mean. We reveal that, because of convection, the time derivative of the L2 energy of the regulation error is a cubic polynomial in the cubic mean of the boundary inputs. Regulation is then achieved by solving a specific cubic equation, using the Cardano root formula. The results are illustrated via a numerical example.</description>
