      <title>Topological Order Without Band Topology in Moir\'e Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of zero-field fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in moir\'e materials has attracted intense interest in the interplay between topology and correlations. Here, we demonstrate that fractionalized topological order can emerge under realistic conditions even within a topologically trivial moir\'e band. By projecting long-range Coulomb interactions into a trivial band of twisted multilayer graphene, we identify a set of incompressible FCI ground states exhibiting fractional quantized Hall conductance. Their Laughlin-like behavior is further confirmed through the particle-cut entanglement spectrum. We trace the origin of this phase to the strongly inhomogeneous distribution of quantum geometry within the moir\'e Brillouin zone, which reshapes interaction effects independently of the band topology. Extending this heuristic quantum geometric mechanism, we demonstrate that similarly unexpected Laughlin-like FCIs can also be stabilized in higher-Chern-number moir\'e bands under experimentally accessible conditions. Our results establish realistic scenarios under which many-body topological order can emerge independently of single-particle band topology.</description>

      <title>Does Moire Matter? Critical Moire Dependence with Quantum Fluctuations in Graphene Based Integer and Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has emerged as a powerful platform for investigating flat-band-driven correlated phenomena, yet most aspects remain not understood. In this work, we systematically study the moire-dependent band topology in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. For the first time we demonstrate that the moire twist angle plays a crucial role in the formation of the moire Chern insulators in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (RHG/hBN) moire superlattices. In the moire-distant regime at filling factor v = 1, only systems with a twist angle {\theta} &lt; 1.1{\deg} exhibit an integer moire Chern insulator, while the fractional Chern insulator at v = 2/3 requires smaller twist angle to be stabilized. Our theoretical modelling, which includes quantum fluctuations and exact diagonalization results, suggests that mean-field theory, which has been widely adopted, does not explain the twist-angle dependence of the v = 1 phase diagram, and that correlation effects are crucial. Moreover, we realize two distinct stacking configurations ( /Xi=0 and /Xi=1) between graphene and hBN, and find that both cases can yield a Chern insulator at v = 1. Our experimental work upends the current mean-field paradigm, illuminates how quantum fluctuations and moir\'e effects shape the RHG/hBN phase diagram, and paves the way for future understanding and engineering of topological correlated states in rhombohedral graphene moire systems.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism induced surface Chern insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new pathway to the quantized anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) by coupling an altermagnet to a topological crystalline insulator (TCI). The former gaps the topological surface states of the TCI, thereby realizing the QAHE in a robust and switchable platform with near- vanishing magnetization. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by studying a slab of the TCI SnTe coupled to an altermagnetic RuO2 layer. Our first-principles calculations reveal that the d-wave altermagnetism in RuO2 induces a 7 meV gap to the Dirac surface states on the (110) surface of SnTe, producing a finite anomalous Hall effect. Our approach generalizes to broader classes of altermagnetic materials and TCIs, thereby providing a family of topological altermagnetic heterostructures with small or vanishing magnetization that support nontrivial Chern numbers. Our results highlight a promising new topological platform with great tunability and applications to spintronics.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable Josephson diodes in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report low-temperature measurements of two adjacent, gate-defined Josephson junctions (JJs) in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) at a moir\'e filling factor near $\nu = -2$. We show that both junctions exhibit a prominent, gate-tunable Josephson diode effect, which we explain by a combination of large kinetic inductance and non-uniform supercurrent distribution. Despite their proximity, the JJs display differences in their interference patterns and different diode behavior, underscoring that microscopic inhomogeneities such as twist angle variations shape the non-uniform supercurrent and drive the diode behavior. As a result, the nonreciprocal supercurrent can be tuned by gate voltage, enabling tuning of the diode efficiency and even reversing the polarity at fixed magnetic fields. Our findings offer potential routes for tailoring Josephson diode performance in superconducting quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Topological Magnetic Phases and Magnon-Phonon Hybridization in the Presence of Strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the interplay between quantum magnetism and topology has attracted growing interest, both for its fundamental importance and its technological potential. Topological magnons, quantized spin excitations with nontrivial band topology, hold particular promise for spintronics, offering routes to robust, low-dissipation devices for next-generation information processing and storage. While topological magnons in honeycomb ferromagnets with weak next-nearest-neighbor Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) have been extensively investigated, the strong-DMI regime remains largely unexplored. In this work, we examine topological magnetic phases and magnon-phonon hybridization in a two-dimensional magnetic system with strong DMI. We show that strong DMI drives a transition from a ferromagnetic ground state to a 120$^\circ$ noncollinear order. An additional Zeeman field further induces noncoplanar spin textures, giving rise to a diverse set of topological phases. We demonstrate that these topological phases can be directly probed through the anomalous thermal Hall effect. Finally, we find that the spin-spin interactions in the strong-$D$ phase enable magnon-phonon coupling that yields hybridized topological bands, whereas such coupling vanishes in the weak-$D$ phase.</description>

      <title>Emergent Topology in Kagome Ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a topological magnon phase in a two-dimensional kagome ferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and scalar spin chirality. By incorporating a chiral interaction term proportional to the scalar triple product chi_ijk = S_i (S_j x S_k), we examine how the interplay between DMI and the topological orbital coupling kappa_TO gives rise to geometric phase, nontrivial Berry curvature, and quantized Chern numbers in the magnon bands. Using a momentum-space representation and linear spin-wave theory, we compute the orbital texture, its vorticity, and the Berry curvature across the Brillouin zone. We show that noncoplanar spin textures, driven by finite DMI, form momentum-space skyrmions that act as sources of geometric curvature. Importantly, we demonstrate that DMI alone is insufficient to break time-reversal symmetry; only the presence of finite scalar chirality terms allows the system to develop a nonzero Berry phase and topological transport signatures. We further explore the effect of a global plaquette rotation, showing that while the band structure remains invariant under this unitary transformation, the Berry curvature and Chern number are modulated, highlighting the geometric sensitivity of the topological response. Our results establish a direct correspondence between the lattice geometry, chirality, and magnon topology, providing a route toward tunable topological phases in frustrated magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>The impact of dimensionality on universality of 2D quantum Hall transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regardless of model and platform details, the critical phenomena exhibit universal behaviors that are remarkably consistent across various experiments and theories, resulting in a significant scientific success of condensed matter physics. One widely known and commonly used example is the 2D quantum Hall transition; yet, its universal exponents still somewhat conflict between experiments, theoretical models, and numerical ansatzes. We study critical behaviors of quasi-2D Weyl semimetal systems with a finite thickness $L_z&gt;1$, disorder, and external magnetic field $B_z$. By analyzing the scaling behaviors of the localization lengths and local density of states using recursive methods, we find that the finite thickness yields a deviation from the 2D quantum Hall universality ($L_z=1$ case) and a crossover toward the 3D Gaussian Unitary Ensemble ($L_z\rightarrow \infty$ limit), potentially offering another cause of the discrepancy. Our work demonstrates the often-overlooked importance of auxiliary degrees of freedom, such as thickness, and that 3D quantum Hall physics is not merely a trivial finite-thickness extension of its 2D counterpart.</description>

      <title>Measuring the magnetic anisotropy of the spin Hall effect and spin relaxation length in nickel and permalloy via electrical spin injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin Hall effect in ferromagnets is of great interest in the field of spintronics, and while the effect has been quantified in many materials, the dependence of the spin Hall angle on the relative orientation of spin polarization and the magnetization is less well studied. Of equal importance for the purpose of spin-charge interconversion in ferromagnets is the spin relaxation length, which is predicted to be highly anisotropic with respect to magnetization. Using a modified lateral spin valve geometry with a copper channel and permalloy spin injector, we measure the dependence of the spin Hall angle and spin relaxation length on magnetization orientation in permalloy and nickel, using two distinct device geometries. This allows us to disentangle the contributions of the spin relaxation length and spin Hall angle to the measured spin-charge interconversion voltage output. Our results indicate a large anisotropy in both the spin relaxation length and spin Hall angle in both permalloy and nickel, in agreement with theoretical calculations. The quantities change in opposite directions, with the spin relaxation length rising as the magnetization is moved parallel to the spin polarization and the spin Hall angle falling, leading to a near total cancellation of the spin-charge interconversion output.</description>

      <title>Active Ionic Fluxes Induce Symmetry Breaking in Charge-Patterned Nanochannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological systems rely on autonomous modes of charge transport to transmit signals, whereas conventional artificial systems typically depend on external fields, such as voltage or pressure gradients, limiting their adaptability. Here we investigate nanochannels in which an electrolyte is confined by symmetric boundary configurations combining patterned surface charge with active ionic fluxes. We show that the interplay between diffusive, electrostatic and hydrodynamic interactions in such active-charged nanosystems can trigger a symmetry breaking as the activity increases. Our results suggest that active-charged nanochannels could amplify directed flows up to the order of meters per second, opening pathways toward adaptable iontronic devices and neuromorphic architectures.</description>

      <title>Helical orbitals in electrical uni-directional molecular motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of unidirectional motion has been a long-standing challenge in engineering of molecular motors. Here, a mechanism driving the rotation is presented based on electron current through helical orbitals on a $\pi$-bonded carbon chain. Such electron current through helical orbitals has been shown to be circulating around the carbon chain. It is natural to expect that the associated electronic angular momentum drives a rotation when the current is turned on. As intuitive as this relation might seem, it is also incomplete because a formal definition of helicality in terms of a physical observable has not yet been given. Such a definition is proposed here. Based on this definition, we show how helicality determines the motor's sense of rotation. We exemplify the relation between helicality and angular momentum in H\"uckel models of linear carbon chains (cumulenes and oligoynes). We attribute the previously reported opposite helicality sense of frontier orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) to the approximate sub-lattice symmetry. For oligoynes, this symmetry is hidden in the sense that it does not reduce to a mere labeling of atoms. Sub-lattice symmetry, combined with time-reversal invariance, allows us to derive Onsager-type reciprocal relations of various linear response coefficients, dictating e.g. an odd energy dependence of angular momentum response to voltage bias. We propose an observable consequence of the approximate sub-lattice symmetry: If the carbon chain is employed as an axle of a molecular rotor, the sense of rotation is independent on the direction of the current.</description>

      <title>Entanglement complexification transition driven by a single non-Hermitian impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While non-Hermitian bulk systems and their sensitivity to boundary conditions have been extensively studied, how a non-Hermitian boundary affects the entanglement structure of Hermitian critical systems remains largely unexplored. Here we present a fully analytical framework by exactly solving a Hermitian gapless chain with a single non-Hermitian impurity acting as a non-Hermitian boundary. When the entanglement cut is placed at the impurity, we uncover a sharp \emph{entanglement complexification transition}: the logarithmic entanglement entropy retains its scaling form, but the effective central charge evolves from real to complex values, accompanied by a spectral collapse of the correlation matrix. We demonstrate that the real regime follows analytic continuation from a unitary defect conformal field theory (CFT), whereas the complex regime lies entirely beyond this framework. For the latter, we derive an analytical formula in perfect agreement with numerics. Our results reveal that a single non-Hermitian impurity can drive a Hermitian critical system into a nonunitary defect-CFT phase, establishing a rare analytically solvable platform for boundary non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the coexistence of distinct topologically ordered phases within a single setup. We demonstrate this concept through tensor network simulations of the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard model under a spatially modulated chemical potential. Focusing on cylindrical geometries, we realize regions exhibiting the Laughlin-1/2 phase and its particle-hole conjugate, and confirm their topological character via the local St\v{r}eda's response and Laughlin's flux insertion protocol. Our approach offers a new pathway for experimentally and numerically charting entire phase diagrams within a single system, possibly eliminating the need for independent parameter scans.</description>

      <title>Surface diffusion of phosphorus on Si(100) after PBr3 adsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phosphorus diffusion on a Si(100) surface was studied using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at temperatures of 77 and 300 K. The phosphorus source utilized was the PBr$_3$ molecule, which fully dissociates on the surface at 77 K. We observed diffusion of P atoms both along and across the rows of Si dimers. To support the observation of different diffusion pathways of phosphorus, activation energy calculations were performed using density functional theory. At 77 K, phosphorus diffusion started and (or) finished mostly in bridge positions. At 300 K, phosphorus diffuses predominantly between end-bridge positions, accompanied by bromine diffusion. The presence of Br near phosphorus significantly restricts its mobility. Additionally, phosphorus was found to diffuse to an oxygen atom that appeared on the surface as a result of water adsorption. This diffusion occurs because the P site near the oxidized dimer is more stable compared to that on the clean surface. The obtained results complement the knowledge about the interaction of phosphorus with the silicon surface, specifically the phosphorus diffusion pathways on the Si(100) surface.</description>

      <title>Atomically-resolved exciton emission from single defects in MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how atomic defects shape the nanoscale optical properties of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is essential for advancing quantum technologies and optoelectronics. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and luminescence (STML), we correlate the atomic structure and optical fingerprints of individual defects in monolayer MoS$_2$. A bilayer of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) effectively decouples MoS$_2$ from the graphene substrate, increasing its band gap and extending the defect charge state lifetime. This enables the observation of sharp STML emission lines from MoS$_2$ excitons and trions exhibiting nanoscale sensitivity to local potential fluctuations. We identify the optical signatures of common point defects in MoS$_2$: sulfur vacancies (Vac$_\text{S}^-$), oxygen substitutions (O$_\text{S}$), and negatively charged carbon-hydrogen complexes (CH$_\text{S}^-$). While Vac$_\text{S}^-$ and O$_\text{S}$ only suppress pristine excitonic emission, CH$_\text{S}^-$ generate defect-bound exciton complexes ($A^-X$) about 200\,meV below the MoS$_2$ exciton. Sub-nanometer-resolved STML maps reveal large spectral shifts near charged defects, concurrent with the local band bending expected for band-to-defect optical transitions. These results establish an atomically precise correlation between structure, electronic states, and optical response, enabling deterministic engineering of quantum emitters in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Interband-Pairing-Boosted Supercurrent Diode Effect in Multiband Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unveil a mechanism that enables a robust supercurrent diode effect in Josephson junctions based on multiband superconductors. We predict that interband pairing can significantly amplifies this effect, even under weak spin-orbit coupling while intraband pairing alone would render it negligible. To illustrate this, we examine monolayer FeSe/STO, a system where recent experiments suggest interband pairing in either a nodeless $d$-wave or $\eta$ pairing state. Using experimentally derived parameters, we predict that FeSe/STO can serve as a high-temperature platform for realizing a substantial supercurrent diode effect, with efficiencies reaching up to $30\%$ for $d$-wave pairing and $12\%$ for $\eta$ pairing. These results demonstrate that measuring the supercurrent diode effect can provides a powerful probe of the pairing symmetry in monolayer FeSe/STO, offering critical insights into its superconducting state.</description>

      <title>Evanescent Orbital Pumping by Magnetization Dynamics Free of Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Converting magnetization spin to orbital current often relies on strong spin-orbit interaction that may cause additional angular momentum dissipation. We report that coherent magnetization dynamics in magnetic nanostructures can evanescently pump an orbital current into adjacent semiconductors due to the coupling between its stray electromagnetic field and electron orbitals without relying on spin-orbit coupling. The underlying photonic spin of the electromagnetic field governs the orbital polarization that flows along the gradient of the driven field. Due to the joint effect of the electric and magnetic fields, the orbital Hall current that flows perpendicularly to the gradient of the time-varying field is also generated and does not suffer from the orbital torque. These findings extend the paradigm of orbital pumping to include photonic angular momentum and pave the way for developing low-dissipation orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>Chiral Locking of Magnon Flow and Electron Spin Accumulation in Their Near-Field Radiative Spin Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a non-contact mechanism for directional injection of magnons in magnetic films when driven by a spin accumulation $\pmb{\mu}_s$ of electrons of a nearby metallic layer, governed by the long-range dipolar coupling between magnons and electron spins, which spontaneously generates a magnon current ${\bf J}_m$ flowing in the film plane. Crucially, in such near-field radiative spin transfer, the magnon flow ${\bf J}_m$ is always perpendicular to the spin accumulation $\pmb{\mu}_s$, showing a universal chiral locking relation. The spin injection is efficient even when $\pmb{\mu}_s$ is parallel to the magnetization, a feature breaking the limitation of the spin transfer by contact exchange interaction. Our findings reveal the critical role of dipolar chirality in driving the magnon thermal current and paving the way for the functional design of magnonic devices based on near-field radiative spin transfer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01662v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the electronic structures of 13-11-13 and 15-13-15 armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) superlattices (SLs) using a tight-binding model. We demonstrate that the conduction and valence subbands of 15-13-15 AGNR SLs can be accurately described by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, with topologically protected interface states emerging at the junctions between 15-AGNR and 13-AGNR segments. These interface states enable the formation of quantum dot arrays with energy levels well separated from bulk states, making them promising candidates for high-temperature solid-state quantum processors. For 15-13-15 AGNRH segments, we observe both localized zigzag edge states and topologically protected interface states under longitudinal electric fields, with the latter providing efficient tunneling channels in contrast to the less conductive edge states. We further explore nonlinear charge transport through these interface states under Pauli spin blockade, showing that tunneling current spectra reveal charge stability diagrams and Coulomb blockade oscillations, consistent with experimental findings in other serial double quantum dot systems. Additionally, we examine the impact of orbital offsets on tunneling current rectification and demonstrate that significant current rectification is achieved over a wide temperature range when level broadening is optimized. These results highlight the potential of 15-13-15 AGNRHs for robust spin-current conversion and applications in quantum devices, offering advantages over other proposed structures due to precise tunability of key parameters via bottom-up synthesis techniques and the ease of two-gate electrode integration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrons floating on a solid neon exhibit long charge coherence times, making them attractive for hybrid quantum systems. When combined with high-quality, high-impedance superconducting resonators and a local magnetic field gradient, this platform enables strong charge--photon and spin--charge coupling-key ingredients for scalable spin qubit architectures. In this work, we demonstrate that NbTiN nanowire resonators maintain high quality factors around 10^5 after depositing solid neon onto the resonators and subsequently loading electrons onto the neon surface, validating their suitability for electrons-on-neon platforms. Building on these experimental results, we theoretically analyze micromagnet designs and coupling strategies that can enable spin-photon interactions in this platform. Our analysis outlines performance targets for next-generation devices, showing that, at the charge sweet spot, spin qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.99% for single-qubit operations and 99.9% for two-qubit operations are achievable with natural neon.</description>

      <title>Core position-dependent gyrotropic and damping contributions to the Thiele equation approach for accurate spin-torque vortex oscillator dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the nonlinear dynamics of magnetic vortices in spin-torque vortex oscillators (STVOs) is essential for their application in neuromorphic computing. Conventional modeling approaches either rely on the standard Thiele equation, which provides only qualitative predictions, or on micromagnetic simulations, which are computationally expensive. In this work, we refine the Thiele approach by incorporating vortex-profile deformations into the evaluation of the gyrotropic and damping terms. By introducing a more realistic ansatz for the vortex magnetization profile, we determine these effective parameters semi-analytically, and we further develop a procedure to extract them directly from micromagnetic simulations. This numerical framework enables systematic benchmarking of existing analytical models and can be readily extended to other magnetic textures. The comparison between both approaches demonstrates that our semi-analytical model captures the essential nonlinearities of the magnetic vortex dynamics with high accuracy and at low computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin Seebeck effect refers to the magnonic thermal spin injection from a magnet into the adjacent heavy metal. A ferrimagnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is the material most studied for the spin Seebeck effect. Here, to account for a convex downward temperature dependence of the spin Seebeck effect observed in YIG/Pt system near the Curie temperature $T_{\rm C}$, we develop Ginzburg-Landau theory of the spin Seebeck effect in two-sublattice ferrimagnets. We find that only when we take into account the "N\'{e}el coupling", i.e., interfacial exchange coupling between the N\'{e}el order parameter of YIG and spin accumulation of Pt, the convex downward temperature dependence is explained. The present result sheds light on the importance of the N\'{e}el coupling in ferrimagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum metric and band topology in bilayer Dirac models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum metric, a fundamental component of quantum geometry, has attracted broad interest in recent years due to its critical role in various quantum phenomena. Meanwhile, band topology, which serves as an important framework in condensed matter physics, has led to the discovery of various topological phases. In this work, we introduce a bilayer Dirac model that allows precise tuning of both properties. Our approach combines two Dirac Hamiltonians with distinct energy scales; one producing relatively dispersive bands and the other yielding relatively flat bands. The dispersive and flat bands are weakly coupled via hybridization $\lambda$. By inducing a band inversion in the layer subspace, we achieve flexible tuning of band topology across all Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes and quantum metric scaling as $g \propto 1/\lambda^2$ near band inversion point. Using the bilayer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we investigate the localization properties of gapless boundary states, which are affected by quantum metric. Our work lays a foundation for exploring the interplay between band topology and quantum metric.</description>

      <title>Spin-Selective Second-Order Topological Insulators Enabling Cornertronics in 2D Altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in spintronics within the paradigm of altermagnets (AMs) opens new avenues for next-generation electronic device design. Here, we establish a spin-corner locking mechanism that generates second-order topological states in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic systems, through effective model analysis. Remarkably, the breaking of Mxy symmetry under uniaxial strain creates spin-resolved corner modes, driving the system into a corner-polarized second-order topological insulator (CPSOTI). Beyond critical strain, a topological phase transition to quantum anomalous Hall insulator occurs with quantized conductance. Through first-principles calculations, we identify two experimentally viable candidates for 2D intrinsic AM CrO and Cr$_2$Se$_2$O -- which host robust CPSOTI. Moreover, we construct the topological phase diagram of CrO and predict the existence of an altermagnetic Weyl semimetal phase. Our findings open technological avenues in altermagnetism and higher-order topology, while providing opportunities for coupling topological spintronics with cornertronics.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-forbidden intraband transitions leading to ultralow Gilbert damping in van der Waals ferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12544v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based upon first-principles calculations, we report ultralow Gilbert damping in two-dimensional (2D) van derWaals (vdW) ferromagnets. The low damping occurs at weak scattering because mirror symmetry prohibits intraband transitions. The monotonic dependence on the electronic scattering rate suggests the absent lower limit, in contrast to conventional ferromagnetic materials. Breaking mirror symmetry through magnetization rotation, layer stacking, or structural phase transition significantly increases damping by enabling intraband transitions. Topological nodal lines, also protected by mirror symmetry, contribute substantially to interband-transition-mediated damping, which can be tuned by adjusting the Fermi level. Our findings elucidate the unique characteristics of Gilbert damping in 2D vdW ferromagnets, providing valuable insights for designing low-dimensional spintronic devices with high energy efficiency.</description>

Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which are understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge-invariant momentum (gauge fields), and position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, $S$-duality, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. In essence, this work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new avenues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, suggests the existence of an $S$-duality of spacetime curvatures, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Projected and Solvable Topological Heavy Fermion Model of Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological heavy-fermion (THF) model of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) in the projected limit, where only the flat bands are present in the low-energy spectrum. Such limit has been previously analyzed in momentum-space Bistritzer-MacDonald-type continuum models, but not in a real-space formalism. In this regime, the Hubbard interaction ($U_1$) of the $f$-electrons is larger than the bandwidth ($2M$) of the flat bands but smaller than the gap ($\gamma$) between the flat and remote bands. In the THF model, concentrated charge (in real space) and concentrated Berry curvature (in momentum space) are respectively realized by exponentially localized $f$-orbitals and itinerant Dirac $c$-electrons. Local moments naturally arise from $f$-orbitals. Hybridizing the $f$-electrons with $c$-electrons produces power-law tails of the flat-band Wannier functions, raising the question of relevance of the local moment picture in the projected $U_1\ll \gamma$ limit. Nonetheless, we find that the local moments remain stable as long as $U_1 \gg \Delta(\omega)$ for $|\omega|\lesssim U_1$, where $\Delta(\omega)\sim \gamma^2 N(\omega)$ is the hybridization function seen by each $f$-site, and $N(\omega)$ is the density of states of the Dirac $c$-bands. Notably, the comparison between $U_1$ and $\gamma$ is irrelevant to the local moment formation if $N(\omega)$ is unknown. Within the framework of THF, we also derive the correlated self-energy of the flat bands using the Hubbard-I approximation and estimate the coupling strength between the local moments. Finally, we comment that, in the regime of extremely concentrated Berry curvature, the single-particle gap between flat bands and remote bands vanishes and the interaction is always larger than the gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductor-semiconductor hybrids are useful for realizing the Josephson diode effect, where nonreciprocity in the supercurrents occurs due to the interplay of the Josephson effect and applied magnetic fields. These junctions can host Andreev and Majorana states with the same ingredients, though their interplay with the Josephson diode effect is unclear. In this work, we consider short Josephson junctions based on superconductor-semiconductor systems under homogeneous Zeeman fields and investigate the Josephson diode effect in the presence of Andreev and Majorana states. Under generic conditions, the Zeeman field component parallel to the spin-orbit axis promotes an asymmetric low-energy spectrum as a function of the superconducting phase, which persists in the trivial and topological phases hosting Andreev and Majorana bound states, respectively. Interestingly, this asymmetry creates supercurrents that are not odd functions of the phase difference, leading to a nonreciprocal behaviour and the Josephson diode effect. We show that the Josephson diode effect is particularly promoted under the presence of both zero-energy Andreev and Majorana bound states, revealing that Josephson diodes can be realized in the trivial and topological phases of superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. We then demonstrate that the Zeeman field evolution of the diode's efficiencies can map the topological phase transition and the formation of Majorana bound states via an oscillatory behavior that becomes more visible in long superconductors. While Josephson diodes generally exist in the trivial and topological phases of Josephson junctions, we discover that in the tunneling regime only a Josephson diode effect in the topological phase remains due to the finite contribution of Majorana bound states. Our findings clarify the Josephson diode effect and aid in realizing Majorana-only Josephson diodes.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically study Floquet engineering of magnetic molecules via a time-periodic magnetic field that couples to the emergent total electronic spin of the metal center. By focusing on the low-lying energy levels using an $S = 1$ spin Hamiltonian containing the zero-field and Zeeman terms, we demonstrate their continuous tunability under the Floquet field. Remarkably, under the action of linearly polarized Floquet controls, the energy levels of a clock transition qubit retain their stability against variations in an external static magnetic field. This property is closely linked to having a net-zero total Zeeman shift, which results from both static and effective dynamical contributions. Further, using second-order Van Vleck degenerate perturbation theory, we derived analytically an effective Hamiltonian, which explicitly shows the dependence of the renormalized zero-field tensor on the driving field. Based on our theoretical predictions, experimentalists will be able to dynamically tune qubit energy gaps to values that are useful in their specific laboratory settings, while retaining the spin decoherence suppressing effect of maintaining a clock transition.</description>

      <title>Anomalous proximity effect under Andreev and Majorana bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03726v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the anomalous proximity effect in a ballistic normal metal/diffusive normal metal/superconductor junction based on Rashba semiconductor nanowire model. The system hosts two distinct phases: a trivial helical phase with zero-energy Andreev Bound States and a topological phase with Majorana Bound States. We analyze the local density of states and induced pair correlations at the edge of the normal metal region. We investigate their behavior under scalar onsite disorder and changing the Superconductor and diffusive regions lengths in the trivial helical and topological phases. We find that both phases exhibit a zero-energy peak in the local density of states and spin-triplet pair correlations in the clean limit, which we attribute primarily to odd-frequency spin-triplet pairs. Disorder rapidly splits the zero-energy peak in the trivial helical phase regardless of the lengths of the superconductor and diffusive normal regions. The zero-energy peak in the topological phase show similar fragility when the superconductor region is short. However, for long superconductor regions, the zero-energy peak in the topological phase remain robust against disorder. In contrast, spin-singlet correlations are suppressed near zero energy in both phases. Our results highlight that the robustness of the zero-energy peak against scalar disorder, contingent on the Superconductor region length, serves as a key indicator distinguishing trivial Andreev bound states from topological Majorana bound states.</description>

      <title>Analytical exploration of the optomechanical attractor diagram and of limit cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the interplay between mechanical and radiation pressure in an optomechanical cavity system. Our study is based on an analytical evaluation of the infinite Bessel summations involved, which previously had led to a numerical exploration of the so-called attractor diagram. The analytical expressions are then suitable for further asymptotic analysis in opposing regimes of the amplitude, which allows for a characterisation of the diagram in terms of elementary functions. Building on this framework, we investigate the emergence and properties of optomechanical limit cycles beyond the constraints of the resolved sideband approximation. By employing a Fokker-Planck formalism originally developed in the context of laser theory and then used in cavity optomechanics, we describe the quantum regime of these limit cycles, offering a more detailed and unified analytical perspective.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of strain-driven vacancy clustering in aluminum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13245v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first principles investigation of strain-driven vacancy clustering in aluminum. Specifically, we perform Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations to study the influence of hydrostatic strains on clustering in tri-, quad-, and heptavacancies. We find that compressive strains are a key driving force for vacancy aggregation, particularly for collapse of clusters on the (111) plane, consistent with prior experimental observations of vacancy clusters on this plane. Notably, we find that the heptavacancy on the (111) plane collapses to form a prismatic dislocation loop for hydrostatic compressive strains exceeding 5\%, highlighting the critical role of such strains in prismatic dislocation loop nucleation in aluminum.</description>

      <title>Defect mediated quantum melting of charge ordered insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2d) electronic systems on a lattice at fractional filling $\nu = p/q$ exhibit a competition between charge ordered insulators, called Wigner-Mott insulators (WMIs), at large Coulomb repulsion and Fermi-liquid metals at large electronic kinetic energy. When those two energy scales are roughly equal, insulating states that restore the lattice translation symmetry, which we call quantum charge liquids (QCLs), may emerge. When gapped, these QCLs must exhibit topological order. In this work, we show that the allowed topological ordered phases that are proximate to the WMI strongly depend on the charge ordering in the WMI. In particular, we show that when $q$ is even, no direct transition exists between a WMI with the smallest allowed unit cell size from filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" WMI, and the topological order with the smallest ground state degeneracy on a torus allowed by filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" TO. Furthermore, we describe the quantum melting transition of the WMIs to the proximate QCLs in terms of the proliferation of the topological defects of the WMIs. The field theory of this transition in terms of the topological defects reveals their role as precursors to the anyon excitations in the QCLs.</description>
