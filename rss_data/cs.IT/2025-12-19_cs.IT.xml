      <title>Information theory and discriminative sampling for model discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fisher information and Shannon entropy are fundamental tools for understanding and analyzing dynamical systems from complementary perspectives. They can characterize unknown parameters by quantifying the information contained in variables, or measure how different initial trajectories or temporal segments of a trajectory contribute to learning or inferring system dynamics. In this work, we leverage the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) within the data-driven framework of {\em sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics} (SINDy). We visualize information patterns in chaotic and non-chaotic systems for both single trajectories and multiple initial conditions, demonstrating how information-based analysis can improve sampling efficiency and enhance model performance by prioritizing more informative data. The benefits of statistical bagging are further elucidated through spectral analysis of the FIM. We also illustrate how Fisher information and entropy metrics can promote data efficiency in three scenarios: when only a single trajectory is available, when a tunable control parameter exists, and when multiple trajectories can be freely initialized. As data-driven model discovery continues to gain prominence, principled sampling strategies guided by quantifiable information metrics offer a powerful approach for improving learning efficiency and reducing data requirements.</description>

      <title>Optimal Key Rates for Decentralized Secure Aggregation with Arbitrary Collusion and Heterogeneous Security Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) considers a fully-connected network of $K$ users, where each pair of users can communicate bidirectionally over an error-free channel. Each user holds a private input, and the goal is for each user to compute the sum of all inputs without revealing any additional information, even in the presence of collusion among up to $T$ users. Traditional DSA typically requires large key sizes to protect all information except for the input sum and the information of colluding users. To mitigate the source keys overhead, we study decentralized secure aggregation with arbitrary collusion and heterogeneous security constraints. In this setting, the inputs of a predefined collection of user subsets, called the \emph{security set} $\bm{\mathcal{S}}$, must be protected from another predefined collection, the \emph{collusion set} $\bm{\mathcal{T}}$. For an arbitrary security set $\mathcal{S}\in \bm{\mathcal{S}}$ and an arbitrary collusion set $\mathcal{T}\in \bm{\mathcal{T}}$, we characterize the optimal communication and source key rates. A key contribution of this work is the characterization of the optimal source key rate, i.e., the minimum number of key bits per input bit that must be shared among users for decentralized secure aggregation with arbitrary collusion and heterogeneous security constraints to be feasible. In general, this characterization reduces to solving a linear program.</description>

      <title>New Quantum Stabilizer Codes from generalized Monomial-Cartesian Codes constructed using two different generalized Reed-Solomon codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we define Generalized Monomial Cartesian Codes (GMCC), which constitute a natural extension of generalized Reed-Solomon codes. We describe how two different generalized Reed-Solomon codes can be combined to construct one GMCC. We further establish sufficient conditions ensuring that the GMCC are Hermitian self-orthogonal, thus leading to new constructions of quantum codes.</description>

      <title>Novel Inconsistency Results for Partial Information Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial Information Decomposition (PID) seeks to disentangle how information about a target variable is distributed across multiple sources, separating redundant, unique, and synergistic contributions. Despite extensive theoretical development and applications across diverse fields, the search for a unique, universally accepted solution remains elusive, with numerous competing proposals offering different decompositions. A promising but underutilized strategy for making progress is to establish inconsistency results, proofs that certain combinations of intuitively appealing axioms cannot be simultaneously satisfied. Such results clarify the landscape of possibilities and force us to recognize where fundamental choices must be made. In this work, we leverage the recently developed mereological approach to PID to establish novel inconsistency results with far-reaching implications. Our main theorem demonstrates that three cornerstone properties of classical information theory, namely non-negativity, the chain rule, and invariance under invertible transformations, become mutually incompatible when extended to the PID setting. This result reveals that any PID framework must sacrifice at least one property that seems fundamental to information theory itself. Additionally, we strengthen the classical result of Rauh et al., which showed that non-negativity, the identity property, and the Williams and Beer axioms cannot coexist.</description>

      <title>Confusions and Erasures of Error-Bounded Block Decoders with Finite Blocklength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates two distinct types of block errors - undetected errors (confusions) and erasures - in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels with error-bounded block decoders operating in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime. While block error rate (BLER) is a common metric, it does not distinguish between confusions and erasures, which can have significantly different impacts in cross-layer protocol design, despite upper-layer protocols universally assuming physical (PHY) errors manifest as packet erasures rather than undetected corruptions - an assumption lacking rigorous PHY-layer validation. We present a systematic analysis of confusions and erasures under BLER-constrained maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. Through sphere-packing analysis, we provide analytical bounds for both block confusion and erasure probabilities, and derive the sensitivities of these bounds to blocklength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on this topic in the FBL regime. Our findings provide theoretical validation for the block erasure channel abstraction commonly assumed in medium access control (MAC) and network layer protocols, confirming that, for practical FBL codes, block confusions are negligible compared to block erasures, especially at large blocklengths and high SNR.</description>

      <title>Secure Event-triggered MolecularvCommunication - Information Theoretic Perspective and Optimal Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular Communication (MC) is an emerging field of research focused on understanding how cells in the human body communicate and exploring potential medical applications. In theoretical analysis, the goal is to investigate cellular communication mechanisms and develop nanomachine-assisted therapies to combat diseases. Since cells transmit information by releasing molecules at varying intensities, this process is commonly modeled using Poisson channels. In our study, we consider a discrete-time Poisson channel (DTPC). MC is often event-driven, making traditional Shannon communication an unsuitable performance metric. Instead, we adopt the identification framework introduced by Ahlswede and Dueck. In this approach, the receiver is only concerned with detecting whether a specific message of interest has been transmitted. Unlike Shannon transmission codes, the size of identification (ID) codes for a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) increases doubly exponentially with blocklength when using randomized encoding. This remarkable property makes the ID paradigm significantly more efficient than classical Shannon transmission in terms of energy consumption and hardware requirements. Another critical aspect of MC, influenced by the concept of the Internet of Bio-NanoThings, is security. In-body communication must be protected against potential eavesdroppers. To address this, we first analyze the DTPC for randomized identification (RI) and then extend our study to secure randomized identification (SRI). We derive capacity formulas for both RI and SRI, providing a comprehensive understanding of their performance and security implications.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics a la Souriau on K\"ahler Non Compact Symmetric Spaces for Cartan Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we clarify several issues concerning the abstract geometrical formulation of thermodynamics on non compact symmetric spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$ that are the mathematical model of hidden layers in the new paradigm of Cartan Neural Networks. We introduce a distinction between the generalized thermodynamics associated with Dynamical Systems and the challenging proposal of Gibbs probability distributions on $\mathrm{U/H}$ provided by generalized thermodynamics {\`a} la Souriau. Main result is the proof that $\mathrm{U/H}$.s supporting Gibbs distributions are only the K\"ahler ones. For the latter, we solve the problem of determining the space of temperatures, namely of Lie algebra elements for which the partition function converges. The space of generalized temperatures is the orbit under the adjoint action of $\mathrm{U}$ of a positivity domain in the Cartan subalgebra $C_c\subset\mathbb{H}$ of the maximal compact subalgebra $\mathbb{H}\subset\mathbb{U}$. We illustrate how our explicit constructions for the Poincar\'e and Siegel planes might be extended to the whole class of Calabi-Vesentini manifolds utilizing Paint Group symmetry. Furthermore we claim that Rao's, Chentsov's, Amari's Information Geometry and the thermodynamical geometry of Ruppeiner and Lychagin are the very same thing. The most important property of the Gibbs probability distributions provided by the here introduced setup is their covariance with respect to the action of the full group of symmetries $\mathrm{U}$. The partition function is invariant against $\mathrm{U}$ transformations and the set of its arguments, namely the generalized temperatures, can be always reduced to a minimal set whose cardinality is equal to the rank of the compact denominator group $\mathrm{H}\subset \mathrm{U}$.</description>

      <title>An Extension of Enumerative Sphere Shaping for Arbitrary Channel Input Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-uniform channel input distribution is key for achieving the capacity of arbitrary channels. However, message bits are generally assumed to follow a uniform distribution which must first be transformed to a non-uniform distribution by using a distribution matching algorithm. One such algorithm is enumerative sphere shaping (ESS). Compared to algorithms such as constant composition distribution matching (CCDM), ESS can utilize more channel input symbol sequences, allowing it to achieve a comparably low rate loss. However, the distribution of channel input symbols produced by ESS is fixed, restricting the utility of ESS to channels with Gaussian-like capacity-achieving input distributions. In this paper, we generalize ESS to produce arbitrary discrete channel input distributions, making it usable on most channels. Crucially, our generalization replaces fixed weights used internally by ESS with weights depending on the desired channel input distribution. We present numerical simulations using generalized ESS with probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) to transmit sequences of 256 symbols over a simplified model of an unamplified coherent optical link, a channel with a distinctly non-Gaussian capacity-achieving input distribution. In these simulations, we found that generalized ESS improves the maximum transmission rate by 0.0425 bit/symbol at a frame error rate below 10^{-4} compared to CCDM.</description>

      <title>Toward 6G Downlink NOMA: CRC-Aided GRAND for Noise-Resilient NOMA Decoding in Beyond-5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technology has emerged as a promising technology to enable massive connectivity and enhanced spectral efficiency in next-generation wireless networks. In this study, we propose a novel two-user downlink power-domain NOMA framework that integrates a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)-aided Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) with successive interference cancellation (SIC). Unlike conventional SIC methods, which are susceptible to error propagation when there is low power disparity between users, the proposed scheme leverages GRAND's noise-centric strategy to systematically rank and test candidate error patterns until the correct codeword is identified. In this architecture, CRC is utilized not only to detect errors but also to aid the decoding process, effectively eliminating the need for separate Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes and reducing overall system overhead. Furthermore, the strong user enhances its decoding performance by applying SIC that is reinforced by GRAND-based decoding of the weaker user's signals, thereby minimizing error propagation and increasing throughput. Comprehensive simulation results over both Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels, under varying power allocations and user distances, show that the CRC-aided GRAND-NOMA approach significantly improves the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance compared to state-of-the-art NOMA decoding techniques. These findings underscore the potential of integrating universal decoding methods like GRAND into interference-limited multiuser environments for robust future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Chirp Delay-Doppler Domain Modulation Based Joint Communication and Radar for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a sensing-centric joint communication and millimeter-wave radar paradigm to facilitate collaboration among intelligent vehicles.
  We first propose a chirp waveform-based delay-Doppler quadrature amplitude modulation (DD-QAM) that modulates data across delay, Doppler, and amplitude dimensions.
  Building upon this modulation scheme, we derive its achievable rate to quantify the communication performance.
  We then introduce an extended Kalman filter-based scheme for four-dimensional (4D) parameter estimation in dynamic environments, enabling the active vehicles to accurately estimate orientation and tangential-velocity beyond traditional 4D radar systems.
  Furthermore, in terms of communication, we propose a dual-compensation-based demodulation and tracking scheme that allows the passive vehicles to effectively demodulate data without compromising their sensing functions.
  Simulation results underscore the feasibility and superior performance of our proposed methods, marking a significant advancement in the field of autonomous vehicles.

      <title>Large Model Enabled Embodied Intelligence for 6G Integrated Perception, Communication, and Computation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of sixth-generation (6G) places intelligence at the core of wireless architecture, fusing perception, communication, and computation into a single closed-loop. This paper argues that large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) can endow base stations with perception, reasoning, and acting capabilities, thus transforming them into intelligent base station agents (IBSAs). We first review the historical evolution of BSs from single-functional analog infrastructure to distributed, software-defined, and finally LAM-empowered IBSA, highlighting the accompanying changes in architecture, hardware platforms, and deployment. We then present an IBSA architecture that couples a perception-cognition-execution pipeline with cloud-edge-end collaboration and parameter-efficient adaptation. Subsequently,we study two representative scenarios: (i) cooperative vehicle-road perception for autonomous driving, and (ii) ubiquitous base station support for low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicle safety monitoring and response against unauthorized drones. On this basis, we analyze key enabling technologies spanning LAM design and training, efficient edge-cloud inference, multi-modal perception and actuation, as well as trustworthy security and governance. We further propose a holistic evaluation framework and benchmark considerations that jointly cover communication performance, perception accuracy, decision-making reliability, safety, and energy efficiency. Finally, we distill open challenges on benchmarks, continual adaptation, trustworthy decision-making, and standardization. Together, this work positions LAM-enabled IBSAs as a practical path toward integrated perception, communication, and computation native, safety-critical 6G systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a technique for reducing the length of a quantum stabilizer code, and we call this deflation of the code. Deflation can be seen as a generalization of the well-known puncturing and shortening techniques in cases where more than a single qudit is removed. We show that the parameters of the deflated quantum code can be controlled, and argue that a similar approach is not as beneficial when applied to classical linear codes. Furthermore, it is shown that deflation introduces additional freedom compared to applying just puncturing and shortening consecutively. We exemplify that it is possible to obtain better parameters by deflating a code rather than consecutively using puncturing and shortening.</description>

      <title>Time-Frequency Analysis for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a quantitative approximation theory for shallow neural networks using tools from time-frequency analysis. Working in weighted modulation spaces $M^{p,q}_m(\mathbf{R}^{d})$, we prove dimension-independent approximation rates in Sobolev norms $W^{n,r}(\Omega)$ for networks whose units combine standard activations with localized time-frequency windows. Our main result shows that for $f \in M^{p,q}_m(\mathbf{R}^{d})$ one can achieve \[ \|f - f_N\|_{W^{n,r}(\Omega)} \lesssim N^{-1/2}\,\|f\|_{M^{p,q}_m(\mathbf{R}^{d})}, \] on bounded domains, with explicit control of all constants. We further obtain global approximation theorems on $\mathbf{R}^{d}$ using weighted modulation dictionaries, and derive consequences for Feichtinger's algebra, Fourier-Lebesgue spaces, and Barron spaces. Numerical experiments in one and two dimensions confirm that modulation-based networks achieve substantially better Sobolev approximation than standard ReLU networks, consistent with the theoretical estimates.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hamming weights of additive codes and geometric counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the geometric problem of determining the maximum number $n_q(r,h,f;s)$ of $(h-1)$-spaces in the projective space $\operatorname{PG}(r-1,q)$ such that each subspace of codimension $f$ does contain at most $s$ elements. In coding theory terms we are dealing with additive codes that have a large $f$th generalized Hamming weight. We also consider the dual problem of the minimum number $b_q(r,h,f;s)$ of $(h-1)$-spaces in $\operatorname{PG}(r-1,q)$ such that each subspace of codimension $f$ contains at least $s$ elements. We fully determine $b_2(5,2,2;s)$ as a function of $s$. We additionally give bounds and constructions for other parameters.</description>

      <title>On the Codebook Design for NOMA Schemes from Bent Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uplink grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technology for massive connectivity with low latency and high energy efficiency. In code-domain NOMA schemes, the requirements boil down to the design of codebooks that contain a large number of spreading sequences with low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) while maintaining low coherence. When employing binary Golay sequences with guaranteed low PAPR in the design, the fundamental problem is to construct a large set of $n$-variable quadratic bent or near-bent functions in a particular form such that the difference of any two is bent for even $n$ or near-bent for odd $n$ to achieve optimally low coherence. In this work, we propose a theoretical construction of NOMA codebooks by applying a recursive approach to those particular quadratic bent functions in smaller dimensions. The proposed construction yields desired NOMA codebooks that contain $6\cdot N$ Golay sequences of length $N=2^{4m}$ for any positive integer $m$ and have the lowest possible coherence $1/\sqrt{N}$.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial description of when a self-associated set of points fails to be arithmetically Gorenstein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the set of points associated to a self-dual code with no proportional columns is arithmetically Gorenstein if and only if the code is indecomposable. This answers a question asked by Toh{\u{a}}neanu. We do so by providing a combinatorial way to compute the dimension of the Schur square of a self-dual code through a zero-one symmetrization of its generator matrix. Our approach also allows us to compute the Gorenstein defect. As a consequence, we obtain a combinatorial characterization of arithmetically Gorenstein self-associated sets of points over an algebraically closed field.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Strong Data-Processing for Quantum Hockey-Stick Divergences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-processing is a desired property of classical and quantum divergences and information measures. In information theory, the contraction coefficient measures how much the distinguishability of quantum states decreases when they are transmitted through a quantum channel, establishing linear strong data-processing inequalities (SDPI). However, these linear SDPI are not always tight and can be improved in most of the cases. In this work, we establish non-linear SDPI for quantum hockey-stick divergence for noisy channels that satisfy a certain noise criterion. We also note that our results improve upon existing linear SDPI for quantum hockey-stick divergences and also non-linear SDPI for classical hockey-stick divergence. We define $F_\gamma$ curves generalizing Dobrushin curves for the quantum setting while characterizing SDPI for the sequential composition of heterogeneous channels. In addition, we derive reverse-Pinsker type inequalities for $f$-divergences with additional constraints on hockey-stick divergences. We show that these non-linear SDPI can establish tighter finite mixing times that cannot be achieved through linear SDPI. Furthermore, we find applications of these in establishing stronger privacy guarantees for the composition of sequential private quantum channels when privacy is quantified by quantum local differential privacy.</description>

      <title>Capacity Approximations for Insertion Channels with Small Insertion Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14771v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Channels with synchronization errors, exhibiting deletion and insertion errors, find practical applications in DNA storage, data reconstruction, and various other domains. Presence of insertions and deletions render the channel with memory, complicating capacity analysis. For instance, despite the formulation of an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) deletion channel more than fifty years ago, and proof that the channel is information stable, hence its Shannon capacity exists, calculation of the capacity remained elusive. However, a relatively recent result establishes the capacity of the deletion channel in the asymptotic regime of small deletion probabilities by computing the dominant terms of the capacity expansion. This paper extends that result to binary insertion channels, determining the dominant terms of the channel capacity for small insertion probabilities and establishing capacity in this asymptotic regime. Specifically, we consider two i.i.d. insertion channel models: insertion channel with possible random bit insertions after every transmitted bit and the Gallager insertion model, for which a bit is replaced by two random bits with a certain probability. To prove our results, we build on methods used for the deletion channel, employing Bernoulli(1/2) inputs for achievability and coupling this with a converse using stationary and ergodic processes as inputs, and show that the channel capacity differs only in the higher order terms from the achievable rates with i.i.d. inputs. The results, for instance, show that the capacity of the random insertion channel is higher than that of the Gallager insertion channel, and quantifies the difference in the asymptotic regime.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Port Selection and Beamforming Design for Integrated Data and Energy Transfer Assisted by Fluid Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) is considered as a key enabler of 6G, as it can provide both wireless energy transfer (WET) and wireless data transfer (WDT) services towards low power devices. Thanks to the extra degree of freedom provided by fluid antenna (FA), incorporating FA into IDET systems presents a promising approach to enhance energy efficiency performance. This paper investigates a FA assisted IDET system, where the transmitter is equipped with multiple FAs and transmits wireless signals to the data receiver (DR) and the energy receiver (ER), which are both equipped with a single traditional antenna. The switching delay and energy consumption induced by port selection are taken into account in IDET system for the first time. We aim to obtain the optimal beamforming vector and the port selection strategy at the transmitter, in order to maximize the short-term and long-term WET efficiency, respectively. The instant sub-optimal solution is obtained by alternatively optimizing the beamforming vector and port selection in each transmission frame, while a novel constrained soft actor critic (C-SAC) algorithm is proposed to find the feasible policy of port selection from the long-term perspective. Simulation results demonstrate that our scheme is able to achieve greater gain in terms of both the short-term and long-term WET efficiency compared to other benchmarks, while not degrading WDT performance.</description>

Abstract: The emergence of sixth-generation and beyond communication systems is expected to fundamentally transform digital experiences through introducing unparalleled levels of intelligence, efficiency, and connectivity. A promising technology poised to enable this revolutionary vision is the wireless large AI model (WLAM), characterized by its exceptional capabilities in data processing, inference, and decision-making. In light of these remarkable capabilities, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of WLAM, elucidating its fundamental principles, diverse applications, critical challenges, and future research opportunities. We begin by introducing the background of WLAM and analyzing the key synergies with wireless networks, emphasizing the mutual benefits. Subsequently, we explore the foundational characteristics of WLAM, delving into their unique relevance in wireless environments. Then, the role of WLAM in optimizing wireless communication systems across various use cases and the reciprocal benefits are systematically investigated. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of WLAM with emerging technologies, highlighting their potential to enable transformative capabilities and breakthroughs in wireless communication. Finally, we thoroughly examine the high-level challenges hindering the practical implementation of WLAM and discuss pivotal future research directions.</description>

      <title>Iterative Joint Detection of Kalman Filter and Channel Decoder for Sensor-to-Controller Link in Wireless Networked Control Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an iterative joint detection algorithm of Kalman filter (KF) and channel decoder for the sensor-to-controller link of wireless networked control systems, which utilizes the prior information of control system to improve control and communication performance. In this algorithm, we first use the KF to estimate the probability density of the control system outputs and calculate the prior probability of received signals to assist decoder. Then, the possible outputs of the control system are traversed to update the prior probability in order to implement iterative detection. The simulation results show that the prior information and the iterative structure can reduce the block error rate performance of communications while improving the root mean square error performance of controls.</description>

      <title>Graph-Theoretic Characterization of Noise Capacity of Conditional Disclosure of Secrets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Conditional Disclosure of Secrets (CDS) problem, Alice and Bob hold inputs $x\in \mathcal{X}$ and $y\in \mathcal{Y}$ and share a secret. Let $f:\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}\to\{0,1\}$ be a function such that the secret is revealed to a third party, Carol, if and only if $f(x,y)=1$. To protect the secret when $f(x,y)=0$, Alice and Bob share a common noise variable unknown to Carol. We study the \emph{noise capacity} of CDS, defined as the maximum number of secret bits that can be securely revealed per noise bit. We first derive necessary and sufficient conditions on $f$, represented by a CDS graph, for the extremal case where the noise capacity equals $1$. We then develop converse bounds on the noise rate for all linear schemes: $\frac{(\rho-1)(d-1)}{\rho d-1}$ if $\rho$ is finite, and $\frac{d-1}{d}$ if $\rho$ is infinite, where $\rho$ is the covering parameter of the CDS graph and $d$ is the number of unqualified edges in an unqualified path. Under maximal communication efficiency (message size equals secret size), we refine these bounds by analyzing qualified components and their connections. Achievability is shown for CDS instances with cyclic qualified edges and a single unqualified path. This graph-theoretic framework links noise efficiency limits to the unqualified path distance and covering parameter, providing a systematic method to analyze CDS under arbitrary graph topologies.</description>

      <title>Exact spectral gaps of random one-dimensional quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral gap of local random quantum circuits is a fundamental property that determines how close the moments of the circuit's unitaries match those of a Haar random distribution. When studying spectral gaps, it is common to bound these quantities using tools from statistical mechanics or via quantum information-based inequalities. By focusing on the second moment of one-dimensional unitary circuits where nearest neighboring gates act on sets of qudits (with open and closed boundary conditions), we show that one can exactly compute the associated spectral gaps. Indeed, having access to their functional form allows us to prove several important results, such as the fact that the spectral gap for closed boundary condition is exactly the square of the gap for open boundaries, as well as improve on previously known bounds for approximate design convergence. Finally, we verify our theoretical results by numerically computing the spectral gap for systems of up to 70 qubits, as well as comparing them to gaps of random orthogonal and symplectic circuits.</description>

      <title>Cartan meets Cram\'er-Rao</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Cartan-geometric, jet bundle formulation of curvature-aware variance bounds in parametric statistical estimation is developed. Building on our earlier extrinsic Hilbert space approach to the Cram\'er-Rao and Bhattacharyya-type inequalities, we show that the curvature corrections induced by the square root embedding of a statistical model admit a canonical intrinsic interpretation via jet geometry and Cartan's prolongation theory.
  For a scalar-parameter family with square root map $s_\theta=\sqrt{f(\cdot;\theta)}\in L^2(\mu)$, we regard $s_\theta$ as a section of the statistical bundle $E=\Theta\times L^2(\mu)$ and study its finite-order prolongations. We point out that the classical algebraic efficiency condition--that the estimator residual $(T-\theta)s_\theta$ lies in the span of derivatives of $s_\theta$ up to order $m$--is equivalent to the existence of a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) of order $m$ satisfied by the square root map. Geometrically, this means the prolonged section lies in an ODE-defined submanifold of the jet bundle and is an integral curve of the restricted Cartan vector field.
  The obstruction to such finite-order integrability is identified with the vertical component of the canonical Ehresmann connection on the jet tower, which coincides with the curvature correction term in variance bounds. This establishes a direct correspondence between algebraic projection conditions in $L^2(\mu)$ and intrinsic holonomy properties of statistical sections, yielding a unified geometric interpretation of higher-order information inequalities.</description>
