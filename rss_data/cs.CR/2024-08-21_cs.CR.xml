      <title>Towards Efficient Machine Learning Method for IoT DDoS Attack Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise in the number of IoT devices and its users, security in IoT has become a big concern to ensure the protection from harmful security attacks. In the recent years, different variants of DDoS attacks have been on the rise in IoT devices. Failure to detect DDoS attacks at the right time can result in financial and reputational loss for victim organizations. These attacks conducted with IoT devices can cause a significant downtime of applications running on the Internet. Although researchers have developed and utilized specialized models using artificial intelligence techniques, these models do not provide the best accuracy as there is always a scope of improvement until 100% accuracy is attained. We propose a hybrid feature selection algorithm that selects only the most useful features and passes those features into an XGBoost model, the results of which are explained using feature importances. Our model attains an accuracy of 99.993% on the CIC IDS 2017 dataset and a recall of 97.64 % on the CIC IoT 2023 dataset. Overall, this research would help researchers and implementers in the field of detecting IoT DDoS attacks by providing a more accurate and comparable model.</description>

      <title>Security Risks Due to Data Persistence in Cloud FPGA Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) into cloud computing systems has become commonplace. As the operating systems used to manage these systems evolve, special consideration must be given to DRAM devices accessible by FPGAs. These devices may hold sensitive data that can become inadvertently exposed to adversaries following user logout. Although addressed in some cloud FPGA environments, automatic DRAM clearing after process termination is not automatically included in popular FPGA runtime environments nor in most proposed cloud FPGA hypervisors. In this paper, we examine DRAM data persistence in AMD/Xilinx Alveo U280 nodes that are part of the Open Cloud Testbed (OCT). Our results indicate that DDR4 DRAM is not automatically cleared following user logout from an allocated node and subsequent node users can easily obtain recognizable data from the DRAM following node reallocation over 17 minutes later. This issue is particularly relevant for systems which support FPGA multi-tenancy.</description>

      <title>Private Means and the Curious Incident of the Free Lunch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the most well-known and fundamental building blocks of DP implementations -- sum, mean, count (and many other linear queries) -- can be released with substantially reduced noise for the same privacy guarantee. We achieve this by projecting individual data with worst-case sensitivity $R$ onto a simplex where all data now has a constant norm $R$. In this simplex, additional ``free'' queries can be run that are already covered by the privacy-loss of the original budgeted query, and which algebraically give additional estimates of counts or sums, and can be combined for lower final noise.</description>

      <title>Industry Perception of Security Challenges with Identity Access Management Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identity Access Management (IAM) is an area posing significant challenges, particularly in the context of remote connectivity and distributed or cloud-based systems. A wide range of technical solutions have been proposed by prior research, but the integration of these solutions in the commercial sector represent steps that significantly hamper their acceptance. The study aims to outline the current perception and security issues associated with IAMs solutions from the perspective of the beneficiaries. The analysis relies on a series of interviews with 45 cyber security professionals from different organisations all over the world. As results showed, cloud IAM solutions and on premises IAM solutions are affected by different issues. The main challenges for cloud based IAM solutions were Default configurations, Poor management of Non-Human Identities such as Service accounts, Poor certificate management, Poor API configuration and limited Log analysis. In contrast, the challenges for on premise solutions were Multi Factor Authentication, insecure Default configurations, Lack of skillsets required to manage IAM solution securely, Poor password policies, Unpatched vulnerabilities, and compromise of Single-Sign on leading to compromise of multiple entities. The study also determined that, regardless the evolving functionality of cloud based IAM solutions, 41% of respondents believe that the on premise solutions more secure than the cloud-based ones. As pointed out by the respondents, cloud IAM may potentially expose organisations to a wider range of vulnerabilities due to the complexity of the underlying solutions, challenges with managing permissions, and compliance to dynamic IAM policies.</description>

      <title>Smart Contract Coordinated Privacy Preserving Crowd-Sensing Campaigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crowd-sensing has emerged as a powerful data retrieval model, enabling diverse applications by leveraging active user participation. However, data availability and privacy concerns pose significant challenges. Traditional methods like data encryption and anonymization, while essential, may not fully address these issues. For instance, in sparsely populated areas, anonymized data can still be traced back to individual users. Additionally, the volume of data generated by users can reveal their identities. To develop credible crowd-sensing systems, data must be anonymized, aggregated and separated into uniformly sized chunks. Furthermore, decentralizing the data management process, rather than relying on a single server, can enhance security and trust. This paper proposes a system utilizing smart contracts and blockchain technologies to manage crowd-sensing campaigns. The smart contract handles user subscriptions, data encryption, and decentralized storage, creating a secure data marketplace. Incentive policies within the smart contract encourage user participation and data diversity. Simulation results confirm the system's viability, highlighting the importance of user participation for data credibility and the impact of geographical data scarcity on rewards. This approach aims to balance data origin and reduce cheating risks.</description>

      <title>ETGuard: Malicious Encrypted Traffic Detection in Blockchain-based Power Grid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating prevalence of encryption protocols has led to a concomitant surge in the number of malicious attacks that hide in encrypted traffic. Power grid systems, as fundamental infrastructure, are becoming prime targets for such attacks. Conventional methods for detecting malicious encrypted packets typically use a static pre-trained model. We observe that these methods are not well-suited for blockchain-based power grid systems. More critically, they fall short in dynamic environments where new types of encrypted attacks continuously emerge. Motivated by this, in this paper we try to tackle these challenges from two aspects: (1) We present a novel framework that is able to automatically detect malicious encrypted traffic in blockchain-based power grid systems and incrementally learn from new malicious traffic. (2) We mathematically derive incremental learning losses to resist the forgetting of old attack patterns while ensuring the model is capable of handling new encrypted attack patterns. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three different benchmark datasets. We also constructed the first malicious encrypted traffic dataset for blockchain-based power grid scenario. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/PPPmzt/ETGuard, hoping to inspire future research.</description>

      <title>Probing the Safety Response Boundary of Large Language Models via Unsafe Decoding Path Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are implicit troublemakers. While they provide valuable insights and assist in problem-solving, they can also potentially serve as a resource for malicious activities. Implementing safety alignment could mitigate the risk of LLMs generating harmful responses. We argue that: even when an LLM appears to successfully block harmful queries, there may still be hidden vulnerabilities that could act as ticking time bombs. To identify these underlying weaknesses, we propose to use a cost value model as both a detector and an attacker. Trained on external or self-generated harmful datasets, the cost value model could successfully influence the original safe LLM to output toxic content in decoding process. For instance, LLaMA-2-chat 7B outputs 39.18% concrete toxic content, along with only 22.16% refusals without any harmful suffixes. These potential weaknesses can then be exploited via prompt optimization such as soft prompts on images. We name this decoding strategy: Jailbreak Value Decoding (JVD), emphasizing that seemingly secure LLMs may not be as safe as we initially believe. They could be used to gather harmful data or launch covert attacks.</description>

      <title>Iterative Window Mean Filter: Thwarting Diffusion-based Adversarial Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face authentication systems have brought significant convenience and advanced developments, yet they have become unreliable due to their sensitivity to inconspicuous perturbations, such as adversarial attacks. Existing defenses often exhibit weaknesses when facing various attack algorithms and adaptive attacks or compromise accuracy for enhanced security. To address these challenges, we have developed a novel and highly efficient non-deep-learning-based image filter called the Iterative Window Mean Filter (IWMF) and proposed a new framework for adversarial purification, named IWMF-Diff, which integrates IWMF and denoising diffusion models. These methods can function as pre-processing modules to eliminate adversarial perturbations without necessitating further modifications or retraining of the target system. We demonstrate that our proposed methodologies fulfill four critical requirements: preserved accuracy, improved security, generalizability to various threats in different settings, and better resistance to adaptive attacks. This performance surpasses that of the state-of-the-art adversarial purification method, DiffPure.</description>

      <title>On NVD Users' Attitudes, Experiences, Hopes and Hurdles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is a major vulnerability database that is free to use for everyone. It provides information about vulnerabilities and further useful resources such as linked advisories and patches. The NVD is often considered as the central source for vulnerability information and as a help to improve the resource-intensive process of vulnerability management. Although the NVD receives much public attention, little is known about its usage in vulnerability management, users' attitudes towards it and whether they encounter any problems during usage. We explored these questions using a preliminary interview study with seven people, and a follow-up survey with 71 participants. The results show that the NVD is consulted regularly and often aids decision making. Generally, users are positive about the NVD and perceive it as a helpful, clearly structured tool. But users also faced issues: missing or incorrect entries, incomplete descriptions or incomprehensible CVSS ratings. In order to identify the problems origins, we discussed the results with two senior NVD members. Many of the problems can be attributed to higher-level problems such as the CVE List or limited resources. Nevertheless, the NVD is working on improving existing problems.</description>

      <title>PhishAgent: A Robust Multimodal Agent for Phishing Webpage Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phishing attacks are a major threat to online security, exploiting user vulnerabilities to steal sensitive information. Various methods have been developed to counteract phishing, each with varying levels of accuracy, but they also encounter notable limitations. In this study, we introduce PhishAgent, a multimodal agent that combines a wide range of tools, integrating both online and offline knowledge bases with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This combination leads to broader brand coverage, which enhances brand recognition and recall. Furthermore, we propose a multimodal information retrieval framework designed to extract the top k relevant items from offline knowledge bases, utilizing all available information from a webpage, including logos, HTML, and URLs. Our empirical results, based on three real-world datasets, demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances detection accuracy and reduces both false positives and false negatives, while maintaining model efficiency. Additionally, PhishAgent shows strong resilience against various types of adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>An Open Source Python Library for Anonymizing Sensitive Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open science is a fundamental pillar to promote scientific progress and collaboration, based on the principles of open data, open source and open access. However, the requirements for publishing and sharing open data are in many cases difficult to meet in compliance with strict data protection regulations. Consequently, researchers need to rely on proven methods that allow them to anonymize their data without sharing it with third parties. To this end, this paper presents the implementation of a Python library for the anonymization of sensitive tabular data. This framework provides users with a wide range of anonymization methods that can be applied on the given dataset, including the set of identifiers, quasi-identifiers, generalization hierarchies and allowed level of suppression, along with the sensitive attribute and the level of anonymity required. The library has been implemented following best practices for integration and continuous development, as well as the use of workflows to test code coverage based on unit and functional tests.</description>

      <title>Honeyquest: Rapidly Measuring the Enticingness of Cyber Deception Techniques with Code-based Questionnaires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fooling adversaries with traps such as honeytokens can slow down cyber attacks and create strong indicators of compromise. Unfortunately, cyber deception techniques are often poorly specified. Also, realistically measuring their effectiveness requires a well-exposed software system together with a production-ready implementation of these techniques. This makes rapid prototyping challenging. Our work translates 13 previously researched and 12 self-defined techniques into a high-level, machine-readable specification. Our open-source tool, Honeyquest, allows researchers to quickly evaluate the enticingness of deception techniques without implementing them. We test the enticingness of 25 cyber deception techniques and 19 true security risks in an experiment with 47 humans. We successfully replicate the goals of previous work with many consistent findings, but without a time-consuming implementation of these techniques on real computer systems. We provide valuable insights for the design of enticing deception and also show that the presence of cyber deception can significantly reduce the risk that adversaries will find a true security risk by about 22% on average.</description>

      <title>KeySpace: Public Key Infrastructure Considerations in Interplanetary Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As satellite networks grow larger and begin to incorporate interplanetary communication, there is an increasing interest in the unsolved problem of how to approach PKI in these conditions. In this paper we explore the goals and requirements for implementing key management systems in satellite networks, focusing on megaconstellations and interplanetary networks. We design a set of standardized experiments which can be used to compare systems against one another for particular network topologies. Using these, we demonstrate that terrestrial PKI techniques are feasible in highly distributed interplanetary networks, showing that it is possible to configure PKI systems to achieve efficient low-latency connection establishment, and minimize the impact of attacks through effective revocations.
  We evaluate this by building the Deep Space Network Simulator (DSNS), a novel network simulator aimed at efficient simulation of large space networks. We run simulations evaluating connection establishment and key revocation under a wide range of PKI configurations. Finally, we propose and evaluate two additional configuration options: OCSP Hybrid, and the use of relay nodes as a firewall. Together these minimize the extent of the network an attacker can reach with a compromised key, and reduce the attacker's load on interplanetary relay links.</description>

      <title>Fight Perturbations with Perturbations: Defending Adversarial Attacks via Neuron Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13060v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vulnerabilities of deep learning models towards adversarial attacks have attracted increasing attention, especially when models are deployed in security-critical domains. Numerous defense methods, including reactive and proactive ones, have been proposed for model robustness improvement. Reactive defenses, such as conducting transformations to remove perturbations, usually fail to handle large perturbations. The proactive defenses that involve retraining, suffer from the attack dependency and high computation cost. In this paper, we consider defense methods from the general effect of adversarial attacks that take on neurons inside the model. We introduce the concept of neuron influence, which can quantitatively measure neurons' contribution to correct classification. Then, we observe that almost all attacks fool the model by suppressing neurons with larger influence and enhancing those with smaller influence. Based on this, we propose \emph{Neuron-level Inverse Perturbation} (NIP), a novel defense against general adversarial attacks. It calculates neuron influence from benign examples and then modifies input examples by generating inverse perturbations that can in turn strengthen neurons with larger influence and weaken those with smaller influence.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent with Fixed-Size Minibatches: Tighter RDP Guarantees with or without Replacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) has been instrumental in privately training deep learning models by providing a framework to control and track the privacy loss incurred during training. At the core of this computation lies a subsampling method that uses a privacy amplification lemma to enhance the privacy guarantees provided by the additive noise. Fixed size subsampling is appealing for its constant memory usage, unlike the variable sized minibatches in Poisson subsampling. It is also of interest in addressing class imbalance and federated learning. However, the current computable guarantees for fixed-size subsampling are not tight and do not consider both add/remove and replace-one adjacency relationships. We present a new and holistic R{\'e}nyi differential privacy (RDP) accountant for DP-SGD with fixed-size subsampling without replacement (FSwoR) and with replacement (FSwR). For FSwoR we consider both add/remove and replace-one adjacency. Our FSwoR results improves on the best current computable bound by a factor of $4$. We also show for the first time that the widely-used Poisson subsampling and FSwoR with replace-one adjacency have the same privacy to leading order in the sampling probability. Accordingly, our work suggests that FSwoR is often preferable to Poisson subsampling due to constant memory usage. Our FSwR accountant includes explicit non-asymptotic upper and lower bounds and, to the authors' knowledge, is the first such analysis of fixed-size RDP with replacement for DP-SGD. We analytically and empirically compare fixed size and Poisson subsampling, and show that DP-SGD gradients in a fixed-size subsampling regime exhibit lower variance in practice in addition to memory usage benefits.</description>

      <title>Tracing Privacy Leakage of Language Models to Training Data via Adjusted Influence Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) can include sensitive information from individuals and organizations, leading to potential privacy leakage. This work implements Influence Functions (IFs) to trace privacy leakage back to the training data, thereby mitigating privacy concerns of Language Models (LMs). However, we notice that current IFs struggle to accurately estimate the influence of tokens with large gradient norms, potentially overestimating their influence. When tracing the most influential samples, this leads to frequently tracing back to samples with large gradient norm tokens, overshadowing the actual most influential samples even if their influences are well estimated. To address this issue, we propose Heuristically Adjusted IF (HAIF), which reduces the weight of tokens with large gradient norms, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of tracing the most influential samples. To establish easily obtained groundtruth for tracing privacy leakage, we construct two datasets, PII-E and PII-CR, representing two distinct scenarios: one with identical text in the model outputs and pre-training data, and the other where models leverage their reasoning abilities to generate text divergent from pre-training data. HAIF significantly improves tracing accuracy, enhancing it by 20.96\% to 73.71\% on the PII-E dataset and 3.21\% to 45.93\% on the PII-CR dataset, compared to the best SOTA IFs against various GPT-2 and QWen-1.5 models. HAIF also outperforms SOTA IFs on real-world pretraining data CLUECorpus2020, demonstrating strong robustness regardless prompt and response lengths.</description>

      <title>LeCov: Multi-level Testing Criteria for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in many different domains, but because of their limited interpretability, there are questions about how trustworthy they are in various perspectives, e.g., truthfulness and toxicity. Recent research has started developing testing methods for LLMs, aiming to uncover untrustworthy issues, i.e., defects, before deployment. However, systematic and formalized testing criteria are lacking, which hinders a comprehensive assessment of the extent and adequacy of testing exploration. To mitigate this threat, we propose a set of multi-level testing criteria, LeCov, for LLMs. The criteria consider three crucial LLM internal components, i.e., the attention mechanism, feed-forward neurons, and uncertainty, and contain nine types of testing criteria in total. We apply the criteria in two scenarios: test prioritization and coverage-guided testing. The experiment evaluation, on three models and four datasets, demonstrates the usefulness and effectiveness of LeCov.</description>

      <title>Privacy-preserving Universal Adversarial Defense for Black-box Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly used in critical applications such as identity authentication and autonomous driving, where robustness against adversarial attacks is crucial. These attacks can exploit minor perturbations to cause significant prediction errors, making it essential to enhance the resilience of DNNs. Traditional defense methods often rely on access to detailed model information, which raises privacy concerns, as model owners may be reluctant to share such data. In contrast, existing black-box defense methods fail to offer a universal defense against various types of adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce DUCD, a universal black-box defense method that does not require access to the target model's parameters or architecture. Our approach involves distilling the target model by querying it with data, creating a white-box surrogate while preserving data privacy. We further enhance this surrogate model using a certified defense based on randomized smoothing and optimized noise selection, enabling robust defense against a broad range of adversarial attacks. Comparative evaluations between the certified defenses of the surrogate and target models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments on multiple image classification datasets show that DUCD not only outperforms existing black-box defenses but also matches the accuracy of white-box defenses, all while enhancing data privacy and reducing the success rate of membership inference attacks.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Knowledge Unlearning: An Adversarial Framework for Assessing and Improving Unlearning Robustness in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM have achieved success in many fields but still troubled by problematic content in the training corpora. LLM unlearning aims at reducing their influence and avoid undesirable behaviours. However, existing unlearning methods remain vulnerable to adversarial queries and the unlearned knowledge resurfaces after the manually designed attack queries. As part of a red-team effort to proactively assess the vulnerabilities of unlearned models, we design Dynamic Unlearning Attack (DUA), a dynamic and automated framework to attack these models and evaluate their robustness. It optimizes adversarial suffixes to reintroduce the unlearned knowledge in various scenarios. We find that unlearned knowledge can be recovered in $55.2\%$ of the questions, even without revealing the unlearned model's parameters. In response to this vulnerability, we propose Latent Adversarial Unlearning (LAU), a universal framework that effectively enhances the robustness of the unlearned process. It formulates the unlearning process as a min-max optimization problem and resolves it through two stages: an attack stage, where perturbation vectors are trained and added to the latent space of LLMs to recover the unlearned knowledge, and a defense stage, where previously trained perturbation vectors are used to enhance unlearned model's robustness. With our LAU framework, we obtain two robust unlearning methods, AdvGA and AdvNPO. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple unlearning benchmarks and various models, and demonstrate that they improve the unlearning effectiveness by over $53.5\%$, cause only less than a $11.6\%$ reduction in neighboring knowledge, and have almost no impact on the model's general capabilities.</description>

      <title>Security Assessment of Hierarchical Federated Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) is a promising distributed deep learning model training paradigm, but it has crucial security concerns arising from adversarial attacks. This research investigates and assesses the security of HFL using a novel methodology by focusing on its resilience against adversarial attacks inference-time and training-time. Through a series of extensive experiments across diverse datasets and attack scenarios, we uncover that HFL demonstrates robustness against untargeted training-time attacks due to its hierarchical structure. However, targeted attacks, particularly backdoor attacks, exploit this architecture, especially when malicious clients are positioned in the overlapping coverage areas of edge servers. Consequently, HFL shows a dual nature in its resilience, showcasing its capability to recover from attacks thanks to its hierarchical aggregation that strengthens its suitability for adversarial training, thereby reinforcing its resistance against inference-time attacks. These insights underscore the necessity for balanced security strategies in HFL systems, leveraging their inherent strengths while effectively mitigating vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>While GitHub Copilot Excels at Coding, Does It Ensure Responsible Output?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code completion capabilities, giving rise to a new generation of LLM-based Code Completion Tools (LCCTs). Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these tools possess unique workflows, integrating multiple information sources as input and prioritizing code suggestions over natural language interaction, which introduces distinct security challenges. Additionally, LCCTs often rely on proprietary code datasets for training, raising concerns about the potential exposure of sensitive data. This paper exploits these distinct characteristics of LCCTs to develop targeted attack methodologies on two critical security risks: jailbreaking and training data extraction attacks. Our experimental results expose significant vulnerabilities within LCCTs, including a 99.4% success rate in jailbreaking attacks on GitHub Copilot and a 46.3% success rate on Amazon Q. Furthermore, We successfully extracted sensitive user data from GitHub Copilot, including 54 real email addresses and 314 physical addresses associated with GitHub usernames. Our study also demonstrates that these code-based attack methods are effective against general-purpose LLMs, such as the GPT series, highlighting a broader security misalignment in the handling of code by modern LLMs. These findings underscore critical security challenges associated with LCCTs and suggest essential directions for strengthening their security frameworks. The example code and attack samples from our research are provided at https://github.com/Sensente/Security-Attacks-on-LCCTs.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Defenses against GAN-Based Feature Inference Attacks in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2004.12571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized model training framework that aims to merge isolated data islands while maintaining data privacy. However, recent studies have revealed that Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based attacks can be employed in FL to learn the distribution of private datasets and reconstruct recognizable images. In this paper, we exploit defenses against GAN-based attacks in FL and propose a framework, Anti-GAN, to prevent attackers from learning the real distribution of the victim's data. The core idea of Anti-GAN is to manipulate the visual features of private training images to make them indistinguishable to human eyes even restored by attackers. Specifically, Anti-GAN projects the private dataset onto a GAN's generator and combines the generated fake images with the actual images to create the training dataset, which is then used for federated model training. The experimental results demonstrate that Anti-GAN is effective in preventing attackers from learning the distribution of private images while causing minimal harm to the accuracy of the federated model.</description>

      <title>DPM: Clustering Sensitive Data through Separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering is an important tool for data exploration where the goal is to subdivide a data set into disjoint clusters that fit well into the underlying data structure. When dealing with sensitive data, privacy-preserving algorithms aim to approximate the non-private baseline while minimising the leakage of sensitive information. State-of-the-art privacy-preserving clustering algorithms tend to output clusters that are good in terms of the standard metrics, inertia, silhouette score, and clustering accuracy, however, the clustering result strongly deviates from the non-private KMeans baseline. In this work, we present a privacy-preserving clustering algorithm called DPM that recursively separates a data set into clusters based on a geometrical clustering approach. In addition, DPM estimates most of the data-dependent hyper-parameters in a privacy-preserving way. We prove that DPM preserves Differential Privacy and analyse the utility guarantees of DPM. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation for synthetic and real-life data sets. We show that DPM achieves state-of-the-art utility on the standard clustering metrics and yields a clustering result much closer to that of the popular non-private KMeans algorithm without requiring the number of classes.</description>

      <title>Top of the Heap: Efficient Memory Error Protection of Safe Heap Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heap memory errors remain a major source of software vulnerabilities. Existing memory safety defenses aim at protecting all objects, resulting in high performance cost and incomplete protection. Instead, we propose an approach that accurately identifies objects that are inexpensive to protect, and design a method to protect such objects comprehensively from all classes of memory errors. Towards this goal, we introduce the Uriah system that (1) statically identifies the heap objects whose accesses satisfy spatial and type safety, and (2) dynamically allocates such "safe" heap objects on an isolated safe heap to enforce a form of temporal safety while preserving spatial and type safety, called temporal allocated-type safety. Uriah finds 72.0% of heap allocation sites produce objects whose accesses always satisfy spatial and type safety in the SPEC CPU2006/2017 benchmarks, 5 server programs, and Firefox, which are then isolated on a safe heap using Uriah allocator to enforce temporal allocated-type safety. Uriah incurs only 2.9% and 2.6% runtime overhead, along with 9.3% and 5.4% memory overhead, on the SPEC CPU 2006 and 2017 benchmarks, while preventing exploits on all the heap memory errors in DARPA CGC binaries and 28 recent CVEs. Additionally, using existing defenses to enforce their memory safety guarantees on the unsafe heap objects significantly reduces overhead, enabling the protection of heap objects from all classes of memory errors at more practical costs.</description>

      <title>Malla: Demystifying Real-world Large Language Model Integrated Malicious Services</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The underground exploitation of large language models (LLMs) for malicious services (i.e., Malla) is witnessing an uptick, amplifying the cyber threat landscape and posing questions about the trustworthiness of LLM technologies. However, there has been little effort to understand this new cybercrime, in terms of its magnitude, impact, and techniques. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on 212 real-world Mallas, uncovering their proliferation in underground marketplaces and exposing their operational modalities. Our study discloses the Malla ecosystem, revealing its significant growth and impact on today's public LLM services. Through examining 212 Mallas, we uncovered eight backend LLMs used by Mallas, along with 182 prompts that circumvent the protective measures of public LLM APIs. We further demystify the tactics employed by Mallas, including the abuse of uncensored LLMs and the exploitation of public LLM APIs through jailbreak prompts. Our findings enable a better understanding of the real-world exploitation of LLMs by cybercriminals, offering insights into strategies to counteract this cybercrime.</description>

      <title>A Circuit Approach to Constructing Blockchains on Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00220v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the creation of Bitcoin 15 years ago, there has been an explosion in the number of permissionless blockchains. Each of these blockchains provides an open ledger that anyone can read from and write to. In this multi-chain world, an important question emerges: how can we build a more secure overlay blockchain by reading from and writing to a given set of blockchains? Drawing an analogy with switching circuits, we approach the problem by defining two basic compositional operations between blockchains, serial and triangular compositions, and use these operations as building blocks to construct general overlay blockchains. Under the partially synchronous setting, we have the following results: 1) the serial composition, between two blockchains, yields an overlay blockchain that is safe if at least one of the two underlay blockchains is safe and that is live if both of them are live; 2) the triangular composition between three blockchains, akin to parallel composition of switching circuits, yields an overlay blockchain that is safe if all underlay blockchains are safe and that is live if over half of them are live; 3) repeated composition of these two basic operations can yield all possible tradeoffs of safety and liveness for an overlay blockchain built on arbitrary number of underlay chains. The results are also extended to the synchronous setting.</description>

Abstract: Embedded devices with neural network accelerators offer great versatility for their users, reducing the need to use cloud-based services. At the same time, they introduce new security challenges in the area of hardware attacks, the most prominent being side-channel analysis (SCA). It was shown that SCA can recover model parameters with a high accuracy, posing a threat to entities that wish to keep their models confidential. In this paper, we explore the susceptibility of quantized models implemented in OpenVINO, an embedded framework for deploying neural networks on embedded and Edge devices. We show that it is possible to recover model parameters with high precision, allowing the recovered model to perform very close to the original one. Our experiments on GoogleNet v1 show only a 1% difference in the Top 1 and a 0.64% difference in the Top 5 accuracies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Adversarial Transferability with Adversarial Weight Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs) that mislead the model while appearing benign to human observers. A critical concern is the transferability of AEs, which enables black-box attacks without direct access to the target model. However, many previous attacks have failed to explain the intrinsic mechanism of adversarial transferability. In this paper, we rethink the property of transferable AEs and reformalize the formulation of transferability. Building on insights from this mechanism, we analyze the generalization of AEs across models with different architectures and prove that we can find a local perturbation to mitigate the gap between surrogate and target models. We further establish the inner connections between model smoothness and flat local maxima, both of which contribute to the transferability of AEs. Further, we propose a new adversarial attack algorithm, \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{W}eight \textbf{T}uning (AWT), which adaptively adjusts the parameters of the surrogate model using generated AEs to optimize the flat local maxima and model smoothness simultaneously, without the need for extra data. AWT is a data-free tuning method that combines gradient-based and model-based attack methods to enhance the transferability of AEs. Extensive experiments on a variety of models with different architectures on ImageNet demonstrate that AWT yields superior performance over other attacks, with an average increase of nearly 5\% and 10\% attack success rates on CNN-based and Transformer-based models, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art attacks.</description>

      <title>Model Stealing Attack against Graph Classification with Authenticity, Uncertainty and Diversity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that GNNs are vulnerable to the model stealing attack, a nefarious endeavor geared towards duplicating the target model via query permissions. However, they mainly focus on node classification tasks, neglecting the potential threats entailed within the domain of graph classification tasks. Furthermore, their practicality is questionable due to unreasonable assumptions, specifically concerning the large data requirements and extensive model knowledge. To this end, we advocate following strict settings with limited real data and hard-label awareness to generate synthetic data, thereby facilitating the stealing of the target model. Specifically, following important data generation principles, we introduce three model stealing attacks to adapt to different actual scenarios: MSA-AU is inspired by active learning and emphasizes the uncertainty to enhance query value of generated samples; MSA-AD introduces diversity based on Mixup augmentation strategy to alleviate the query inefficiency issue caused by over-similar samples generated by MSA-AU; MSA-AUD combines the above two strategies to seamlessly integrate the authenticity, uncertainty, and diversity of the generated samples. Finally, extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in terms of concealment, query efficiency, and stealing performance.</description>

      <title>PsySafe: A Comprehensive Framework for Psychological-based Attack, Defense, and Evaluation of Multi-agent System Safety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems, when enhanced with Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibit profound capabilities in collective intelligence. However, the potential misuse of this intelligence for malicious purposes presents significant risks. To date, comprehensive research on the safety issues associated with multi-agent systems remains limited. In this paper, we explore these concerns through the innovative lens of agent psychology, revealing that the dark psychological states of agents constitute a significant threat to safety. To tackle these concerns, we propose a comprehensive framework (PsySafe) grounded in agent psychology, focusing on three key areas: firstly, identifying how dark personality traits in agents can lead to risky behaviors; secondly, evaluating the safety of multi-agent systems from the psychological and behavioral perspectives, and thirdly, devising effective strategies to mitigate these risks. Our experiments reveal several intriguing phenomena, such as the collective dangerous behaviors among agents, agents' self-reflection when engaging in dangerous behavior, and the correlation between agents' psychological assessments and dangerous behaviors. We anticipate that our framework and observations will provide valuable insights for further research into the safety of multi-agent systems. We will make our data and code publicly accessible at https://github.com/AI4Good24/PsySafe.</description>

Abstract: Ensuring privacy-preserving inference on cryptographically secure data is a well-known computational challenge. To alleviate the bottleneck of costly cryptographic computations in non-linear activations, recent methods have suggested linearizing a targeted portion of these activations in neural networks. This technique results in significantly reduced runtimes with often negligible impacts on accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that such computational benefits may lead to increased fairness costs. Specifically, we find that reducing the number of ReLU activations disproportionately decreases the accuracy for minority groups compared to majority groups. To explain these observations, we provide a mathematical interpretation under restricted assumptions about the nature of the decision boundary, while also showing the prevalence of this problem across widely used datasets and architectures. Finally, we show how a simple procedure altering the fine-tuning step for linearized models can serve as an effective mitigation strategy.</description>

      <title>How to Make the Gradients Small Privately: Improved Rates for Differentially Private Non-Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a simple and flexible framework for designing differentially private algorithms to find approximate stationary points of non-convex loss functions. Our framework is based on using a private approximate risk minimizer to "warm start" another private algorithm for finding stationary points. We use this framework to obtain improved, and sometimes optimal, rates for several classes of non-convex loss functions. First, we obtain improved rates for finding stationary points of smooth non-convex empirical loss functions. Second, we specialize to quasar-convex functions, which generalize star-convex functions and arise in learning dynamical systems and training some neural nets. We achieve the optimal rate for this class. Third, we give an optimal algorithm for finding stationary points of functions satisfying the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) condition. For example, over-parameterized neural networks often satisfy this condition. Fourth, we provide new state-of-the-art rates for stationary points of non-convex population loss functions. Fifth, we obtain improved rates for non-convex generalized linear models. A modification of our algorithm achieves nearly the same rates for second-order stationary points of functions with Lipschitz Hessian, improving over the previous state-of-the-art for each of the above problems.</description>

      <title>What is in Your Safe Data? Identifying Benign Data that Breaks Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs), even those tuned for safety and alignment, are susceptible to jailbreaking. Some have found that just further fine-tuning an aligned model with benign data (i.e., data without harmful content) surprisingly leads to substantial degradation in safety. We delve into the data-centric aspects of why benign fine-tuning inadvertently contributes to jailbreaking. First, we represent fine-tuning data through two lenses: representation and gradient spaces. Additionally, we propose a bi-directional anchoring method that, during the selection process, prioritizes data points that are close to harmful examples and far from benign ones. Our approach effectively identifies subsets of benign data that are more likely to degrade the model's safety after fine-tuning. Training on just 100 of these seemingly benign datapoints surprisingly leads to the fine-tuned model affirmatively responding to &gt;70% of tested harmful requests, compared to &lt;20% after fine-tuning on randomly selected data. We also observe that the selected data frequently appear as lists, bullet points, or math questions, indicating a systematic pattern in fine-tuning data that contributes to jailbreaking.</description>

      <title>RowPress Vulnerability in Modern DRAM Chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Memory isolation is a critical property for system reliability, security, and safety. We demonstrate RowPress, a DRAM read disturbance phenomenon different from the well-known RowHammer. RowPress induces bitflips by keeping a DRAM row open for a long period of time instead of repeatedly opening and closing the row. We experimentally characterize RowPress bitflips, showing their widespread existence in commodity off-the-shelf DDR4 DRAM chips. We demonstrate RowPress bitflips in a real system that already has RowHammer protection, and propose effective mitigation techniques that protect DRAM against both RowHammer and RowPress.</description>
