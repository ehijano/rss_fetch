      <title>The energy scaling behavior of a class of incompatible two-well problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study scaling laws for singularly perturbed two-well energies with prescribed Dirichlet boundary data in settings where the wells and/or the boundary data are incompatible. Our main focus is the geometrically linear two-well problem, for which we characterize the energy scaling in two dimensions for nearly all combinations of linear boundary data and stress-free strains. In particular, we prove that if the boundary data enforces oscillations and the weight $\epsilon$ of the surface energy is small, the minimal energy upon subtracting the zeroth-order contribution scales either as $\epsilon^{{4}/{5}}$ or as $\epsilon^{{2}/{3}}$, depending on whether the wells differ by a rank-one or a rank-two matrix, respectively. For the gradient and divergence-free two-well problem, we obtain analogous results, showing an $\epsilon^{{2}/{3}}$-scaling behavior in two dimensions whenever oscillations are energetically favored. These results follow by deriving matching upper and lower scaling bounds. The lower scaling bounds are established in a general $\mathcal{A}$-free framework for incompatible two-well problems, which allows us to compute the excess energy and characterize boundary data which enforce oscillations. The upper scaling bounds are obtained by branching constructions which are adapted to the incompatible setting.</description>

      <title>Robust series linearization of nonlinear advection-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) for advection-diffusion processes which are augmented by an auxiliary parameter $\delta$ such that $\delta=0$ corresponds to linear advection-diffusion. We derive potentially non-perturbative series expansions in $\delta$ that provide a process to obtain the solution of the nonlinear PDE through solving a hierarchical system of linear, forced PDEs with the forcing terms dependent on solutions at lower orders in the hierarchy. We rigorously detail our approach for a particular deformation that interpolates between linear advection-diffusion and the canonical Burgers' equation modeling nonlinear advection. In this case, we prove that the series has infinite radius of convergence for arbitrary integrable initial data, analyze the cases of a Dirac-delta initial condition (IC) (i.e., the fundamental solution) in an infinite domain and arbitrary IC in a periodic domain, and demonstrate the approach to turbulent behavior in a scenario with periodic forcing. We then treat models of nonlinear diffusion involving the $p$-Laplacian operator, including generalizations of the Poisson equation in $1$ and $2$ dimensions, and the heat equation in $1+1$ dimensions. We detail series expansions for two different deformations of these equations about their linear (ordinary Laplacian) counterparts, providing numerical evidence for the convergence of the series outside of a perturbative regime and demonstrating that the rate and radius of convergence are affected by choice of deformation. Our results provide a rigorous foundation for using series expansion techniques to study nonlinear advection-diffusion PDEs, opening new pathways for analysis and potential applications for quantum-assisted computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Local Well-Posedness of the Motion of Inviscid Liquid Crystals with a Free Surface Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the local well-posedness of the free-boundary Lin-Liu equations describing the motion of inviscid nematic liquid crystals in the presence of surface tension in Lagrangian coordinates. It is well known that a priori energy estimates alone are insufficient for establishing local existence in free-boundary problems involving inviscid fluid equations, primarily due to the loss of symmetry in the linearized equations. The main challenge is to develop an effective approximate system of equations that is asymptotically consistent with the free-boundary Lin-Liu model expressed in the Lagrangian coordinates. This system must accurately capture the coupling between the fluid motion and the harmonic heat flows within the interior, as well as the regularity of the moving boundary.</description>

      <title>From cohesive to brittle debonding: the quasistatic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approximation of brittle laws via steeper and steeper cohesive profiles is validated within the mechanical setting of debonding models, which describe the detachment process of a peeled elastic adhesive membrane. In a quasistatic framework, energetic solutions to a suitably rescaled cohesive debonding problem, formulated in terms of displacements, are proved to converge to a limit evolution of shapes solving its brittle counterpart. The proposed approach relies on an equivalent and recently introduced free-boundary reformulation of this latter model.</description>

      <title>Lower Bound of Nodal Sets in Elliptic Homogenization and Functions with Strong Maximum Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we first try to prove a uniform lower bound of nodal volume in elliptic homogenization setting. This lower bound is far from optimal. But, we can prove a constant lower bound in dimension two. Motivated by the proof, we extend this results to more general settings. To be more specific, we prove that the nodal volume has a constant lower bound for all continuous functions with strong maximum princple. Our result works for general functions beyond solutions to elliptic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial solutions for nonlinear problems driven by a superposition of fractional p-Laplacians with Neumann boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate existence results for nonlinear nonlocal problems governed by an operator obtained as a superposition of fractional $p$-Laplacians, subject to Neumann boundary conditions. A spectral analysis of the main operator leads us to apply different variational tools to establish our results. Specifically, we will use either the mountain pass method or the technique of linking over cones. Due to the generality of the setting, the resulting theory applies to a wide range of specific situations.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the special Kirchhoff equation studied by Pokhozhaev admits a third-order conservation law.

      <title>Existence and stability for traveling waves of fourth order semilinear wave and Schrodinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and spectral stability of traveling wave solutions for a class of fourth-order semilinear wave equations, commonly referred to as beam equations. Using variational methods based on a constrained maximization problem, we establish the existence of smooth, exponentially decaying traveling wave profiles for wavespeeds in the interval $(0, \sqrt{2})$. We derive precise spectral properties of the associated linearized operators and prove a Vakhitov-Kolokolov (VK) type stability criterion that completely characterizes spectral stability. Furthermore, we determine the sharp exponential decay rate of the traveling waves and demonstrate that it matches the decay rate of the Green's function for the linearized operator. Our analysis extends to fourth-order nonlinear Schrodinger equations, for which we establish analogous existence and stability results. The theoretical findings are complemented by numerical computations that verify the stability predictions and reveal the transition from unstable to stable regimes as the wavespeed varies. These results provide a comprehensive mathematical framework for understanding wave propagation phenomena in structural mechanics, particularly suspension bridge models.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic approximation of Abelian Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct novel solutions in $d\ge 3$ space dimensions of a family of nonlinear evolutions equations that includes the critical hyperbolic Abelian Higgs model (AHM). For the AHM, these solutions exhibit an ensemble of $N\ge 1$ slowly-moving, nearly parallel vortex filaments, whose leading-order dynamics are described by a wave map from ${\mathbb R}^{d-2}$ into the Abelian Higgs moduli space, a manifold carrying a natural Riemannian structure that parametrizes stationary 2d solutions of the AHM. We also prove extremely similar results that relate the critical Abelian Higgs heat flow, modeling certain superconductors, to the harmonic map heat flow into the Moduli space, as well as some parallel results for near-critical equations. When $d=3$, these results allow for the study of the poorly-understood phenomenon of vortex reconnection in this setting.</description>

      <title>Steady Solutions to the Relativistic Boltzmann Equation in a Slab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study steady solutions to the relativistic Boltzmann equation with hard-sphere interactions in a slab geometry. Under a spatial symmetry assumption in the transverse variables $x_2$ and $x_3$, the problem reduces to a one-dimensional spatial slab $x_1 \in [0,1]$ while retaining full three-dimensional momentum dependence. For non-negative inflow boundary conditions prescribed at $x_1=0$ and $x_1=1$, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a stationary solution in a weighted $L^1_p L^\infty_{x_1}$ framework, together with exponential decay in momentum.
  Our analysis treats the full slab domain and does not rely on any smallness assumption on the slab width. We establish sharp coercivity and continuity estimates for the collision frequency, together with weighted convolution and pointwise bounds for the nonlinear gain term. These estimates generate and propagate a $(-\Delta_p)^{-1}$-type regularity within the solution framework, which plays a crucial role in the existence and uniqueness argument. In addition, we obtain uniform weighted integrability of the solution over arbitrary two-dimensional hyperplanes through the origin. This hyperplane estimate is derived as a genuinely a posteriori regularity property, without imposing any a priori hyperplane bounds, and follows from a Lorentz-invariant geometric reduction.</description>

      <title>Global controllability of the Cahn-Hilliard equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12562v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the global control properties of the Cahn-Hilliard equation posed on the $d$-dimensional flat torus $\mathbb{T}^d$. We first prove that the system is small-time globally approximately controllable using a control supported on finitely many Fourier modes, following an approach based on geometric control theory techniques. Next, we show that the corresponding linearized problem is null-controllable with a localized control, where the control region is an arbitrary measurable set of positive Lebesgue measure. Our analysis is based on quantitative propagation of smallness estimates for the free solution. Furthermore, when $d\in \{1,2,3\},$ we ensure the local null controllability for the nonlinear system via a fixed-point argument. Finally, by combining these two results, we establish the global null controllability of the Cahn-Hilliard equation. In the first phase, the control is localized in Fourier modes, whereas in the second phase, it is spatially localized on a set of positive Lebesgue measure.</description>

      <title>Parabolic Equations with Singular Coefficients and Boundary Data: Analysis and Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate linear parabolic equations in divergence form with singular coefficients and non-smooth boundary data. When the diffusion, drift, or potential terms, as well as the initial or boundary conditions, are distributions rather than functions, classical and weak solution concepts become inadequate due to the ill-posedness of products involving distributions. To overcome this, we introduce a framework of very weak solutions based on regularization techniques and the theory of moderate nets. Existence of very weak solutions is established under minimal regularity assumptions. We further prove consistency with classical solutions when the data are smooth and demonstrate uniqueness via negligibility arguments. Finally, we present numerical computations that illustrate the robustness of the very weak solution framework in handling highly singular inputs, including delta-type potentials and distributional boundary traces.</description>

Abstract: In Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, the minimization problem of a nonlocal isoperimetric functional with a competition between perimeter and a nonlocal term derived from the negative power of the distance function, has been extensively studied. In this paper, we investigate this nonlocal isoperimetric problem in hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$, we prove that the geodesic balls are unique minimizers (up to hyperbolic isometries) for small volumes $m$ and obtain nonexistence results for large volumes $m$ under certain ranges of the exponent in the nonlocal term.</description>

      <title>Uniformity of Maximal Hypoellipticity on Graded Lie Groups: From Pointwise to Global</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On graded Lie groups, we develop a mechanism that transfers the uniformity of maximal hypoellipcity from the frozen coefficients principal part of a differential operator to the full operator. Our approach brings the century-old "freeze-unfreeze" strategy into the hypoelliptic setting, and offers a transparent and flexible framework for lifting symbol-level hypoelliptic properties to global elliptic estimates, without relying on pseudodifferential calculus. In addition, we prove that symmetric operators of hypoelliptic type on a graded Lie group are self-adjoint.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic equations with fifth-order symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the classification of hyperbolic equations. We study a class of equations of the form $$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x\partial y}=F\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x},\frac{\partial u}{\partial y},u\right),$$ where $u(x,y)$ is the unknown function and $x,y$ are independent variables. The classification is based on the requirement for the existence of higher fifth-order symmetries. As a result, a list of four equations with the required conditions was obtained.</description>

      <title>Directional Spectral Analysis: Dimension Reduction for Periodic Elliptic Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the limiting absorption principle for elliptic equations with periodic structures is very challenging when the dimension is greater than 1. The fundamental reason for the dimensional barrier is the mismatch between directional physical reality and the direction-independent classic spectral analysis. In this paper, we introduce a new approach which introduce the direction into classic spectral analysis. With the new approach, the solution obtained by the limiting absorption principle can be formulated in a semi-analytic form, which not only gives an explicit representation of the solutions, but also reflects the phenomenon in physics.
  The new approach resolves the mismatch between mathematics and physics, and also breaks the dimensional barriers. It also opens a door to a lot of further possibilities, ranging from the analysis of solutions and numerical simulations for the solutions.</description>

      <title>On the variational dual formulation of the Nash system and an adaptive convex gradient-flow approach to nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of base states on the consistency of the dual variational formulation for quadratic systems of PDEs, which are not necessarily conservative (typical examples include the noise-free Nash system with a quadratic Hamiltonian and multiple players). We identify a sufficient condition under which consistency holds over large time intervals. In particular, in the single-player case, there exists a sequence of base states (each exhibiting full consistency) that converges in mean to zero. We also prove existence of variational dual solutions to the noise-free Nash system for arbitrary base states. Furthermore, we propose a scheme based on Hilbertian gradient flows that, starting from an arbitrary base state, generates a sequence of new base states that is expected to converge to a solution of the original PDE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conservation laws are computed for various nonlinear partial differential equations that arise in elasticity and acoustics. Using a scaling homogeneity approach, conservation laws are established for two models describing shear wave propagation in a circular cylinder and a cylindrical annulus. Next, using the multiplier method, conservation laws are derived for a parameterized system of constitutive equations in cylindrical coordinates involving a general expression for the Cauchy stress. Conservation laws for the Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya-Kuznetsov equation and Westervelt-type equations in various coordinate systems are also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove an almost-sure global in time nonlinear smoothing effect for NLS on the two-dimensional torus. For deterministic data, this phenomenon was proved for the NLS on the circle by Erdo\u{g}an--Tzirakis, which remains unknown on multidimensional torus.
  Our argument is based on a quantitative quasi-invariance of Gaussian measures with covariance operator $(1-\Delta)^{-s}$ for $s&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Convection Effects and Optimal Insulation: Modelling and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an insulation problem that seeks to determine the optimal distribution of a given amount $m&gt;0$ of insulating material coating an insulated boundary part $\Gamma_I\subseteq \partial\Omega$ of a thermally conducting body $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, $d\in \mathbb{N}$, subject to convective heat transfer. The `$\textit{thickness}$' of the insulating layer $\Sigma_{I}^{\varepsilon}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is given locally via $\varepsilon \mathtt{d}$, where $\varepsilon&gt;0$ denotes the (arbitrarily small) conductivity and $\mathtt{d}\colon \Gamma_{I}\to [0,+\infty)$ the (to be determined) distribution of the insulating material. Then, the physical process is modelled by the stationary heat equation in the insulated thermally conducting body $\Omega_{I}^{\varepsilon}:= \Omega\cup\Sigma_{I}^{\varepsilon}$ with Robin-type boundary conditions on the interacting insulation boundary $\Gamma_I^{\varepsilon}\subseteq \partial\Omega_{I}^{\varepsilon}$ (reflecting convective heat transfer between the thermally conducting body $\Omega$ and its surrounding medium) as well as Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions at the remaining boundary parts, $\textit{i.e.}$, $\partial\Omega_{I}^{\varepsilon}\setminus \Gamma_I^{\varepsilon}$.
  More precisely, we establish $\Gamma(L^2(\mathbb{R}^d))$-convergence of the heat loss formulation (as ${\varepsilon \to 0^+}$), in the case that the thermally conducting body $\Omega$ is a bounded Lipschitz domain having a $C^{1,1}$-regular or piece-wise flat insulated boundary $\Gamma_I$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the transport of Gaussian measures under the flow of the 2-dimensional defocusing Schr\"odinger equation $i \partial_t u + \Delta u = |u|^{2k} u$ posed on $\mathbb T^2$. In particular, we show that the Gaussian measures with inverse covariance $\|u\|_{H^s}^2$, are quasi-invariant under the flow for $s&gt;2$. Moreover, we show that the Radon-Nykodim density belongs to every $L^p$ space, locally in space. The proof relies on the physical-space energies introduced in [52], as well as a new abstract quasi-invariance argument that allows us to combine space-time estimates, along the flow with probabilistic bounds on the support of the measure.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to learn distributed port-Hamiltonian systems (dpHs) using Gaussian processes (GPs), the partitioned finite element method (PFEM) is combined with the Gp-dpHs method. By following a late lumping approach, the discretization of the functional hyperparameters of the GP prior over the Hamiltonian functional is chosen independently from the discretization of the dpHs, thus reducing the numerical complexity of our method. We next model the mean of the GP prior of the Hamiltonian as a quadratic form, enabling the GP kernel to focus on the nonlinear part of a given dpHs. We illustrate our method on a nonlinear one dimensional wave equation with unknown physical parameters (tension and linear mass).</description>

      <title>Rigidity of weighted manifolds via classification results for semilinear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study model semilinear equations on complete and non-compact weighted Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature. Our main goal is to classify positive solutions of the equation at the Sobolev-critical exponent, and furthermore to prove that the existence of such solutions implies rigidity of the manifold and triviality of the weight.
  This is possible when the weighted manifold has non-negative finite dimensional Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature, and even under the weaker condition of non-negative infinite dimensional Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature, up to imposing some additional conditions in the latter case. To exhibit the sharpness of these additional conditions, we construct a non-trivial positive solution of the critical problem on a weighted manifold with positive infinite dimensional curvature.
  We also obtain a corresponding rigidity result for solutions of the Liouville equation on weighted Riemannian surfaces. Finally, we prove some non-existence theorems when the nonlinearity is sub-critical or simply under certain volume growth conditions. In particular, the latter rules out all positive solutions on shrinking gradient Ricci solitons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the study of a class of nonlinear nonlocal functional evolution problems defined in an abstract Banach algebra. We introduce an abstract functional setting that encompasses a wide range of structured population models appearing in biomathematical literature. Within this framework, we analyze the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem and the existence of stationary solutions in the positive cone of the Banach algebra. By reviewing a large number of approaches, we also derive conditions for the local and global stability of these stationary solutions. Additionally, we explore the limits of these conditions by exhibiting explicit counterexamples. In particular, for mutation--selection models with symmetric mutation operators, we uncover both sufficient conditions for existence, uniqueness and stability, and counterexamples to existence or stability.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an eigenvalue problem associated with an age-structured operator incorporating random diffusion and advection. Our primary focus is on examining the asymptotic behaviors of the principal eigenvalue with respect to large advection and small or large diffusion rates. We subsequently apply these results to a nonlinear age-structured model, providing a better understanding of how diffusion and advection influence the spatial distribution of species. Among other ingredients, our approach involves constructing various types of super- and sub-solutions to tackle the novel challenges posed by the nonlocal terms in the problems under consideration.</description>

      <title>Generic regularity and Lipschitz metric for a two-component Novikov system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Cauchy problem for a two-component generalization of the Novikov equation with cubic nonlinearity -- an integrable system whose solutions may develop strong nonlinear phenomena such as gradient blow-up and interactions between peakon-like structures. Our study has two main objectives: first, to analyze the generic regularity of global conservative solutions; and second, to construct a new metric that guarantees the Lipschitz continuity of the flow. Building on the geometric framework developed by Bressan and Chen for quasilinear second-order wave equations, we prove that the solution retains $C^k$ regularity away from a finite number of piecewise $C^{k-1}$ characteristic curves. Furthermore, we provide a description of the solution behavior in the vicinity of these curves. By introducing a Finsler norm on tangent vectors in the space of solutions, expressed in the transformed Bressan-Constantin variables, we introduce a Lipschitz metric representing the minimal energy transportation cost between two solutions.</description>

      <title>Fractional and Integer Order Sobolev Spaces for Compact Metric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact metric graph $\Gamma$ and the Laplacian $\Delta_{\Gamma}$ coupled with standard (Kirchhoff) vertex conditions, solutions to fractional elliptic partial differential equations of the form $(\kappa^2 - \Delta_{\Gamma})^{\alpha/2}u=f$ on $\Gamma$ exhibit a distinctive regularity structure: even-order derivatives are continuous across vertices, while odd-order derivatives may be discontinuous. This non-standard smoothness property precludes the direct application of classical tools from real functional analysis. Because of this, we introduce and systematically study new families of Sobolev spaces tailored to this setting. We define these spaces, denoted $W^{\alpha,p}(\Gamma)$ and $H^{\alpha}(\Gamma)$, to respect the continuity constraints on even-order derivatives at vertices, while permitting discontinuities in odd-order derivatives. We establish their fundamental properties, including characterizations, embedding theorems into H\"older and Lebesgue spaces, and compactness results. A central contribution in this investigation is the derivation of uniform bounds on the supremum norm of eigenfunctions for a class of Laplacians on metric graphs, a result of independent interest. Finally, we demonstrate that these spaces provide a natural framework for analyzing the regularity of solutions to fractional elliptic PDEs and SPDEs driven by Gaussian white noise on metric graphs, in particular, establishing a general characterization of the domain of the fractional powers of $(\kappa^2-\Delta_{\Gamma})$ and $(\kappa^2-\nabla(a\nabla))$ in terms of the Sobolev spaces we introduce, thereby extending all previously known characterizations in the literature, and improving the regularity results previously obtained to their sharp counterparts (with general fractional powers). We also show that these spaces are fundamental to the characterization of Gaussian free fields on metric graphs.</description>

      <title>Estimating parameters of the diffusion model via asymptotic expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A broad class of inverse problems deals with determining certain parameters, from measurement data, in models which are associated to certain partial differential equations. In this work we focus on the heat equation on a finite interval and we determine the dimensionless diffusion parameter from a single measurement. Our results extend to estimating additional parameters of the initial-boundary value problem, such as the length of the interval and/or the time required for the solution to achieve a specific state. Our approach relies on the asymptotic solution of an integral equation: The formulation of this integral equation is based on the solution of the direct problem via the Fokas method; the solution of this equation is achieved through the asymptotic evaluation of the associated integrals which yield an effective approximate solution, supported by numerical verifications. We apply these approximations to well-established problems in soil science and we compare our results with existing ones, displaying clear improvement.</description>

      <title>Growth estimates for axisymmetric Euler equations without swirl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the axisymmetric Euler equations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ without swirl, and establish several upper and lower bounds for the growth of solutions. On the one hand, we obtain an upper bound $t^2$ for the radial moment $\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} r\omega^\theta dx$, which is the conjectured optimal rate by Childress (Phys. D 237(14-17):1921-1925, 2008). On the other hand, for all initial data satisfying certain symmetry and sign conditions, we prove that the radial moment grows at least like $t/\log t$ as time goes to infinity, and $\|\omega(\cdot,t)\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)}$ exhibits at least $t^{1/4}$ growth in the limsup sense for all $1\leq p\leq \infty$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result to establish power-law $L^p$-norm growth for smooth, compactly supported initial vorticity in $\mathbb{R}^3$. For these initial data, we also show that nearly all vorticity must eventually escape to $r\to\infty$ in the time-integral sense.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider evolution equation with fractional Schr\"odinger operators in Morrey spaces. We prove order preserving properties of the associated semigroup in Morrey scale. We prove monotonicity of the semigroup with respect to Morrey's potentials and give some precise estimates of its exponential growth. We show that Arendt and Batty's type condition on the potential is necessary for exponential decay of Morrey's norms of the semigroup and find a large class of dissipative potentials for which it is also sufficient.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish local-in-time existence and uniqueness results for nonlocal conservation laws with a nonlinear mobility, in several space dimensions, under weak assumptions on the kernel, which is assumed to be bounded and of finite total variation. Contrary to the linear mobility case, solutions may develop shocks in finite time, even when the kernel is smooth. We construct entropy solutions via a vanishing viscosity method, and provide a rate of convergence for this approximation scheme.</description>

      <title>Exponential Absolute Minimizing extension and biased infinity Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the variational structure of the biased infinity Laplacian by introducing a notion of the $\beta$\textit{-Exponential Absolute Minimizing Extension} ($\beta$--AM) on arbitrary length space, which absolutely minimizing the exponential slope
  $$ L^{\beta}_u (E) := \beta \sup_{x,y \in E} \frac{u(y) - e^{-\beta |x-y|} u(x)}{1- e^{-\beta |x-y|}}. $$We also define the corresponding Exponential McShane-Whitney-type extension, and $\beta$-biased convexity, which equivalently characterize $\beta$-AM and may be of independent interest. These generalize the classical Absolute Minimizing Lipschitz Extension as a special case when $\beta = 0$. In Euclidean space with Euclidean norm, this corresponds to the Aronsson equation with Hamiltonian \[ H(u, \nabla u) = |\nabla u| + \beta u, \] equivalently viscosity solutions of $\Delta_{\infty}^{\beta} u = 0$. We show that $\beta$-AM arises as the continuum value of a biased tug-of-war game. Analogous to the unbiased case, we derive various properties of this extension. As an application, we further show that the linear blow-up property holds for biased infinity harmonic functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study non-degeneracy properties of $\Sigma$ via the Jacobi operator $J_\Sigma:=\Delta_\Sigma+|A_\Sigma|^2$ of a given minimal hypersurface $\Sigma$ asymptotic to a cone $C\subset \mathbb{R}^{N+1}$ of co-dimension one. Here $\Delta_{\Sigma}$ is the Laplace Beltrami operator of $\Sigma$ and $|A_{\Sigma}|$ is the norm of the second fundamental form of $\Sigma$. We also construct a right inverse of $J_{\Sigma}$, that is, we prove that the Jacobi equation $J_\Sigma\phi=f$ is solvable in $\Sigma$, at least under some suitable non-degeneracy assumptions about $\Sigma$ and about the asymptotic behavior of $f$ at infinity. We also discuss some examples where our results can be applied.</description>

Abstract: We study a new notion of convexity for subsets of the unit sphere, which closely resembles the horo-convexity for subsets of the hyperbolic space. We call this notion, accordingly, horo-convexity. For horo-convex hypersurfaces of the unit sphere, we prove the smooth convergence of the classical Guan/Li flow of inverse type and use this result to prove the full set of quermassintegral inequalities for horo-convex hypersurfaces of the unit sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the trigonometric Heckman-Opdam polynomials of type $A_1$. We establish connections with ultraspherical polynomials and derive an explicit expression for the associated Poisson kernel. Using the product formula, we introduce a natural convolution structure and develop a theory of fractional integrals associated with these polynomials. We also define a generalized Hilbert transform in the framework of the Cherednik operator and prove its boundedness on $L^p$-spaces.
  This work provides an alternative perspective on the approach of B. Muckenhoupt and E.M. Stein \cite{MS}.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the numerical solution of second-order Mean Field Game problems through Newton iterations in infinite dimensions, introduced in [14], where quadratic convergence of the method was rigorously established. Building upon this theoretical framework, we develop new numerical discretization techniques, including both a finite difference and a semi-Lagrangian scheme, that enable an effective computational implementation of the infinite-dimensional iterations.
  The proposed methods are tested on several benchmark problems, and the resulting numerical experiments demonstrate their robustness, accuracy, and efficiency. A comparative analysis between the two schemes and existing approaches from the literature is also presented, highlighting the potential of Newton-based solvers for MFG systems.</description>

      <title>Structure versus regularity of set-valued maps in convex generalized Nash equilibrium problems in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) in Banach space consists of $N&gt;1$ optimal control problems with couplings in both the objective functions and, most importantly, in the feasible sets. We address the existence of equilibria for convex GNEPs in Banach space. We show that the standard assumption of lower semicontinuity of the set-valued constraint maps - foundational in the current literature on GNEPs - can be replaced by graph convexity or the so-called Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz (KKM) property. Lower semicontinuity is often essential for obtaining upper semicontinuity of best response maps, crucial for the existence theory based on Kakutani-Fan fixed-point arguments. However, in function spaces or PDE-constrained settings, verifying lower semicontinuity becomes much more challenging (even in convex cases), whereas graph convexity, for example, is often straightforward to check. Our results unify several existence theorems in the literature and clarify the structural role of constraint maps. We also extend Rosen's uniqueness condition to Banach spaces using a multiplier bias framework. Additionally, we present a geometric counterpart to our analytic framework using preference maps. This geometric is intended as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, the analytic theory developed in the main body of the paper.</description>

      <title>A bilinear pointwise tracking optimal control problem for a semilinear elliptic PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a bilinear optimal control problem with pointwise tracking for a semilinear elliptic PDE in two and three dimensions. The control variable enters the PDE as a (reaction) coefficient and the cost functional contains point evaluations of the state variable. These point evaluations lead to an adjoint problem with a linear combination of Dirac measures as a forcing term. In Lipschitz domains, we derive the existence of optimal solutions and analyze first and necessary and sufficient second order optimality conditions. We also prove that every locally optimal control $\bar u$ belongs to $H^1(\Omega)$. Finally, assuming that the domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is a convex polygon, we prove that $\bar u \in C^{0,1}(\bar \Omega)$.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity for the Dean--Kawasaki Equation with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions: Taming the Square-Root</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the ergodicity of generalized Dean--Kawasaki equations with correlated noise and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In contrast to the ergodicity results of Fehrman, Gess, and Gvalani arXiv:2206.14789, our analysis accommodates irregular, square-root type noise coefficients. For such irregular coefficients, we prove that the law of the classical Dean--Kawasaki equation converges exponentially fast to equilibrium, while for the porous medium type Dean--Kawasaki equation, the convergence occurs at a polynomial rate. Furthermore, we obtain a regularization by noise effect, showing that the polynomial convergence rate improves to an exponential one whenever the noise coefficient is sufficiently regular, including the case of conservative multiplicative linear noise. Our approach relies on establishing a supercontraction property in a suitably weighted Lebesgue space, achieved through a refined doubling of variables argument. The construction of the weight function crucially exploits the specific structure of the Dean--Kawasaki-type correlated noise.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel estimates for Markov processes in bounded sets with jump kernels decaying at the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two types of purely discontinuous symmetric Markov processes $X$ in bounded smooth subsets of $\mathbb R^d$: conservative processes and processes killed either upon approaching the boundary of the set or by a killing potential $\kappa$. The jump kernel of $X$ is of the form $J(x,y)={\cal B}(x,y)|x-y|^{-d-\alpha}$, $\alpha\in (0,2)$, where the function ${\cal B}(x,y)$ decays to 0 at the boundary and is described in terms of two $O$-regularly varying functions and one slowly varying function. Under the conditions, introduced in \cite{CKSV24}, on ${\cal B}(x,y)$ and on the killing potential $\kappa$, we establish sharp two-sided estimates on the heat kernel of $X$: in Lipschitz sets when $X$ is conservative, and in $C^{1,1}$ open sets for the killed process.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the local boundary controllability of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation with right Neumann boundary controls at critical lengths. We show that the KdV system is not locally null-controllable in small time for all critical lengths for which the unreachable subspace of the linearized system has dimension at least two. This result extends the work of Coron, Koenig, and Nguyen, who established it for a subclass of these lengths. We also obtain a new controllability time for such systems for all but two critical lengths. It is worth noting that the latest results on the controllability time prior to this work date back to the work of Cerpa (2007) and Cerpa and Crepeau (2009).</description>

      <title>Stability and Regularization of Quasi-Variational Inequalities under Monotone Operator Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes comprehensive stability results for quasi-variational inequalities (QVIs) under monotone perturbations of the governing operator. We prove strong convergence of both minimal and maximal solutions when sequences of operators converge pointwise while preserving fundamental properties including homogeneity, strong monotonicity, Lipschitz continuity, and T-monotonicity. Our analysis extends to regularization techniques, finite-dimensional approximations, and non-monotone nonlinearities, providing explicit convergence rates under appropriate conditions. The theory encompasses applications to $p$-Laplacian operators, elliptic regularizations, and optimal control problems with QVI constraints. By developing a unified framework that bridges classical monotone operator theory with contemporary computational challenges, this work provides essential mathematical foundations for the robust numerical approximation and sensitivity analysis of quasi-variational problems arising in materials science, physics, and engineering applications.</description>

Abstract: We consider a reaction-diffusion equation on a 3D thin porous media of thickness $\varepsilon$ which is perforated by periodically distributed cylinders of size $\varepsilon$. On the boundary of the cylinders we prescribe a dynamical boundary condition of pure-reactive type. As $\varepsilon\to 0$, in the 2D limit the resulting reaction-diffusion equation has a source term coming from the dynamical-type boundary conditions imposed on boundaries of the original 3D domain.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with the homogenization of the $p$-Laplacian reaction-diffusion problems in a domain containing periodically distributed holes of size $\varepsilon$, with a dynamical boundary condition of pure-reactive type. We generalize our previous results established in the case where the diffusion is modeled by the Laplacian operator, i.e., with $p=2$. We prove the convergence of the homogenization process to a nonlinear $p$-Laplacian reaction-diffusion equation defined on a unified domain without holes with zero Dirichlet boundary condition and with extra terms coming from the influence of the nonlinear dynamical boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of two-dimensional interacting fermions submitted to a homogeneous transverse magnetic field. We consider a large magnetic field regime, with the gap between Landau levels set to the same order as that of potential energy contributions. Within the mean-field approximation, i.e. starting from Hartree's equation for the first reduced density matrix, we derive a drift equation for the particle density. We use vortex coherent states and the associated Husimi function to define a semi-classical density almost satisfying the limiting equation. We then deduce convergence of the density of the true Hartree solution by a Dobrushin-type stability estimate.</description>

      <title>On Liouville's theorem and the Strong Liouville Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore Liouville's theorem and the Strong Liouville Property (SLP) for harmonic functions on Riemannian cones and surfaces. Our approach recasts the classical Liouville property in terms of the growth of radial eigenfunctions (in the case of manifolds with rotational symmetry), allowing us to recover and sharpen known results under minimal assumptions. We provide explicit estimates for the slowest-growing nonconstant harmonic functions on cones and surfaces, and construct examples where doubling fails but Liouville and SLP still hold. Finally, we prove a nonlinear Liouville theorem for $p$-subharmonic functions, $p\geq 2$, under curvature bounds, in complete Riemannian surfaces with a pole which simultaneously recover Milnor's and Cheng--Yau's theorems as particular cases. This result appears to be new and suggests a unified geometric perspective on linear and nonlinear Liouville phenomena.</description>

      <title>Wavespeed selection and interstitial gap formation in an acid-mediated cancer invasion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a two-component reaction-diffusion system that has previously been developed to model invasion of cells into a resident cell population. The system is an idealised version of models of tumour growth in which tumour cells degrade the surrounding tissue by increasing the acidity of the local environment. By numerically computing families of travelling wave solutions to this problem, we observe that a general initial condition with either compact support, or sufficiently large exponential decay in the far field, tends to the travelling wave solution that has the largest possible decay at its front. Initial conditions with sufficiently slow exponential decay tend to those travelling wave solutions that have the same exponential decay as their initial conditions. We also show that in the limit that the (nondimensional) degradation rate of resident cells is large, the system has similar asymptotic structure as previously observed in perturbed Fisher--KPP models. The asymptotic analysis in this limit explains the formation of an interstitial gap (a region between the invading and receding fronts, in which both cell populations are small), the width of which is logarithmically large in the limit of large degradation rate. These results show that the general mechanism behind the formation of the interstitial gap in reaction-diffusion tumour models is connected to perturbations of the Fisher-KPP system. Biologically, this implies that order of magnitude difference in degradation rate is required to produce appreciably different gap sizes, while the velocity of the invading front is largely determined by the Fisher-KPP velocity, and only very weakly affected by the presence of the interstitial gap.</description>

      <title>Thin-film limit of the Cahn-Hilliard equation in a curved thin domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Cahn-Hilliard equation with Neumann boundary conditions in a three-dimensional curved thin domain around a given closed surface. When the thickness of the curved thin domain tends to zero, we show that the weighted average in the thin direction of a weak solution to the thin-domain problem converges on the limit surface in an appropriate sense. Moreover, we rigorously derive a limit problem, which is the surface Cahn-Hilliard equation with weighted Laplacian, by characterizing the limit function as a unique weak solution to the limit problem. The proof is based on a detailed analysis of the weighted average and the use of Sobolev inequalities and elliptic regularity estimates on the curved thin domain with constants explicitly depending on the thickness. This is the first result on a rigorous thin-film limit of nonlinear fourth order equations in general curved thin domains.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for the half Klein-Gordon equation on asymptotically flat backgrounds and applications to cubic Dirac equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to establish the $L^2_t$-endpoint Strichartz estimate for (half) Klein-Gordon equations on a weakly asymptotically flat space-time. As an application we prove small data global well-posedness and scattering for massive cubic Dirac equations in the full subcritical range in this setting.
  Crucial ingredient is a parametrix contruction following the work of Metcalfe-Tataru and Xue and complements Strichartz estimates obtained by Zheng-Zhang. The proof of the global result for the cubic Dirac equation follows the strategy developed by Machihara-Nakanishi-Ozawa in the Euclidean setting.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and stability of the Lagrange representation of the n-D wave equation via boundary triples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Lagrange representation of the wave equation with generalized Laplacian $\operatorname{div} T \nabla$. We allow the coefficients -- the Young modulus $T$ and the density $\rho$ -- to be $\mathrm{L}^{\infty}$ or even nonlocal operators. Moreover, the Lipschitz boundary of the domain $\Omega$ can be split into several parts admitting Dirichlet, Neumann and/or Robin-boundary conditions of displacement, velocity and stress. We show well-posedness of this classical model of the wave equation utilizing boundary triple theory for skew-adjoint operators. In addition we show semi-uniform stability of solutions under slightly stronger assumptions by means of a spectral result.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we address the Cauchy problem associated with the $k$-generalized Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation posed on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}$. By establishing an almost optimal linear $L^4$-estimate, along with a family of bilinear refinements, we significantly lower the well-posedness threshold for all $k \geq 2$. In particular, we show that the modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation is locally well-posed in $H^s(\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T})$ for all $s &gt; \frac{11}{24}$.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Pointwise Statistics in Hyperbolic Equations with Random Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider one-dimensional hyperbolic PDEs, linear and nonlinear, with random initial data. Our focus is the {\em pointwise statistics,} i.e., the probability measure of the solution at any fixed point in space and time. For linear hyperbolic equations, the probability density function (PDF) of these statistics satisfies the same linear PDE. For nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs, we derive a linear transport equation for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and a nonlocal linear PDE for the PDF. Both results are valid only as long as no shocks have formed, a limitation which is inherent to the problem, as demonstrated by a counterexample. For systems of linear hyperbolic equations, we introduce the multi-point statistics and derive their evolution equations. In all of the settings we consider, the resulting PDEs for the statistics are of practical significance: they enable efficient evaluation of the random dynamics, without requiring an ensemble of solutions of the underlying PDE, and their cost is not affected by the dimension of the random parameter space. Additionally, the evolution equations for the statistics lead to a priori statistical error bounds for Monte Carlo methods (in particular, Kernel Density Estimators) when applied to hyperbolic PDEs with random data.</description>

      <title>Individual-Based Foundation of SIR-Type Epidemic Models: mean-field limit and large time behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a kinetic framework for modeling the time evolution of the statistical distributions of the population densities in the three compartments of susceptible, infectious, and recovered individuals, under epidemic spreading driven by susceptible-infectious interactions. The model is based on a system of Boltzmann-type equations describing binary interactions between susceptible and infectious individuals, supplemented with linear redistribution operators that account for recovery and reinfection dynamics. The mean values of the kinetic system recover a SIR-type model with reinfection, where the macroscopic parameters are explicitly derived from the underlying microscopic interaction rules. In the grazing collision regime, the Boltzmann system can be approximated by a system of coupled Fokker-Planck equations. This limit allows for a more tractable analysis of the dynamics, including the large-time behavior of the population densities. In this context, we rigorously prove the convergence to equilibrium of the resulting mean-field system in a suitable Sobolev space by means of the so-called energy distance. The analysis reveals the dissipative structure of the dynamics and the role of the interaction terms in driving the system toward a stable equilibrium configuration. These results provide a multi-scale perspective connecting kinetic theory with classical epidemic models.</description>

      <title>Quadratic flatness and Regularity for Codimension-One Varifolds with Bounded Anisotropic Mean Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a $ n $-dimensional unit-density varifold $ V $ in an open subset of $ \mathbf{R}^{n+1} $ with bounded anisotropic mean curvature is $ C^{1, \alpha} $-regular almost everywhere, provided $\mathcal{H}^n \llcorner {\rm spt} \| V \| $ is absolutely continuous with respect to the weight measure $ \| V \| $. This result answers a natural question arising from the work of Allard on the regularity of varifolds with bounded anisotropic mean curvature (1986). Indeed, we prove a quadratic flatness theorem for general varifolds of bounded anisotropic mean curvature, that can be combined with Allard's local anisotropic regularity theorem to infer almost everywhere regularity. The quadratic flatness theorem is of independent interest, since it provides the first result in the literature dealing with the \emph{full support} of a~varifold with bounded anisotropic mean curvature.</description>

      <title>Global solvability for doubly degenerate nutrient taxis system with a wide range of bacterial responses in physical dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of bacteria's response to environmental conditions, we consider the doubly degenerate nutrient taxis system \begin{align*} \begin{cases} u_t=\nabla\cdot(uv\nabla u)-\chi\nabla\cdot(u^{\alpha}v\nabla v)+\ell uv,\\ v_t=\Delta v-uv, \end{cases} \end{align*} subjected to no-flux boundary conditions and smooth initial data, where $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ is the bacterial response parameter. Global solvability of weak solutions to this taxis system is highly challenging due to not only the doubly nonlinear diffusion and its degeneracy but also the strong chemotactic effect, where the latter is strong at the large species density if $\alpha$ is close to $2$. Recent findings on the global weak solvability for the considered system are summarised as follows \begin{itemize} \item In [M. Winkler, \textit{Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.}, 2021] for $\alpha=2$, $N=1$; \item In [M. Winkler, \textit{J. Differ. Equ.}, 2024] for $1\le\alpha\le 2$, $N=2$ with initial data of small size if $\alpha=2$; \item In [Z. Zhang and Y. Li, \textit{arXiv:2405.20637}, 2024] for $\alpha=2$, $N=2$; and \item In [G. Li, \textit{J. Differ. Equ.}, 2022] for $\frac{7}{6}&lt;\alpha&lt;\frac{13}{9}$, $N=3$. \end{itemize} Our work aims to provide a picture of global weak solvability for $0\le\alpha&lt;2$ in the physically dimensional setting $N=3$. As suggested by the analysis, it is divided into three separable cases, including (i) $0\le\alpha\le 1$: Weak chemotaxis effect; (ii) $1&lt;\alpha\le 3/2$: Moderate chemotaxis effect; and (iii) $3/2&lt;\alpha&lt;2$: Strong chemotaxis effect.</description>

      <title>Random Regularity of the Vlasov-Poisson System with Random Initial Inputs in the Quasineutral Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vlasov-Poisson system is widely used in plasma physics and other related fields. In this paper, we study the Vlasov-Poisson system with initial uncertainty in the quasineutral regime. First, we prove the uniform convergence in the Wasserstein distance between the uncertain Vlasov-Poisson system in the quasineutral regime and its quasineutral limit system with random initial inputs. This is achieved by deriving an upper bound for the Wasserstein distance and rigorously estimating each component of this bound. Furthermore, by defining a new norm with respect to the quasineutral parameter and estimating the distribution function as well as the electric field in this norm using a variable substitution, we establish the random regularity of the solutions in the quasineutral regime. This work develops a novel framework for quantifying the propagation of the initial uncertainty of the Vlasov-Poisson system in the quasineutral regime, providing a theoretical basis for designing high-performance numerical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Strong solutions for a class of stochastic thermo-magneto-hydrodynamic-type systems with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions, in both the PDE and probabilistic sense, for a broad class of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) on a bounded domain $\mathscr{O}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ ($d=2,3$), driven by multiplicative Gaussian noise. The solutions are global in time for $d=2$. This theory simultaneously covers several physically relevant systems, including stochastic convective Brinkman--Forchheimer equations, stochastic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), stochastic B\'enard convection in porous media, stochastic convective dynamo system, stochastic thermo-magneto-micropolar fluids, and stochastic diffusive tropical climate model, for which previous results only provide analytically weak martingale or pathwise solutions. The proof relies on Galerkin approximation and compactness argument. Up to a suitable stopping time, we derive strong moment bounds and verify a Cauchy property for the approximate solutions, in the absence of any inherent cancellation structure. By applying a Gronwall-type lemma for stochastic processes, we establish the existence and uniqueness of maximal strong pathwise solutions, which are global in two spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Intermittent solutions of the stationary 2D surface quasi-geostrophic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16583v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct non-trivial solutions to the stationary dissipative surface quasi-geostrophic equation on the two dimensional torus which lie strictly below the critical regularity threshold of $\dot{H}^{-1/2}(\mathbb{T}^2)$. Specifically, for any $\alpha &lt; 1/2$ and any dissipation exponent $0 &lt; \gamma \leq 2$ we construct non-trivial solutions such that
  $$
  u,\theta \in \dot{B}^{\alpha-1}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{T}^2) \cap \dot{B}^{\alpha-1}_{2,2}(\mathbb{T}^2).
  $$
  Due to the fact our solutions do not lie in $\dot{H}^{-1/2}(\mathbb{T}^2)$, this requires reinterpreting the notion of a solution. This leads us to formulate the notion of a weak paraproduct solution for the stationary SQG equation. The main new ingredient is the incorporation of intermittency into the construction of the solutions. This allows us to demonstrate non-trivial integrability results for certain fractional derivatives of our solutions. In particular, for highly intermittent solutions, we are able to conclude for every $1 \leq p &lt; 4/3$ we can construct $u$ and $\theta$ lying in $L^p(\mathbb{T}^2)$.</description>

      <title>Propagation of chaos for the Landau equation via microcanonical binary collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a fully constructive, conservative, and collision-level realization of Kac's program for the spatially homogeneous Landau equation across the full interaction range, including the Coulomb case. Our model is the microcanonical binary-collision (MBC) process: a reversible pure-jump $N$-particle Markov process that is Landau-native, realizing the grazing-collision mechanism via small conservative rotations of relative velocities. The analysis hinges on two critical structural pillars: a Fisher-information dissipation mechanism that extends the Guill\'en--Silvestre paradigm (Acta Math. 234:315-375, 2025) to a genuinely conservative particle system, yielding robust control of singular configurations, and a quantitative self-averaging principle that enforces a coherent deterministic emergence of the Landau flow from the microscopic dynamics. We prove propagation of chaos in the joint mean-field and grazing-collision limit ($N\to\infty, h\to 0$), identifying any limit point with the unique global solution to the Landau equation. Furthermore, we rigorously derive the Landau master equation as the grazing-collision limit of the MBC process. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first fully conservative, Landau-native binary-collision model rigorously shown to produce the Landau equation over the entire interaction range.</description>

      <title>On the Dirichlet problem for the degenerate $k$-Hessian equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence of a global $C^{1,1}$ solution to the Dirichlet problem for the $k$-Hessian equation with a nonnegative right-hand side $f$, focusing on the required conditions for $f$. The conditions $f^{1/(k-1)}\in C^{1,1}(\overline{\Omega_{0}})$ and $f^{3/(2k-2)}\in C^{2,1}(\overline{\Omega_{0}})$, together with $f\geq0$ in a domain $\Omega_{0}\Supset\Omega$, are optimal, as demonstrated by classical counterexamples. For the Monge-Amp\`ere equation ($k=n$), we establish the existence under the optimal condition $f^{3/(2n-2)}\in C^{2,1}(\overline{\Omega_{0}})$ together with $f\geq0$ in $\Omega_{0}$. For the general $k$-Hessian equation, we establish the existence under the condition $f\geq0$ in $\Omega_{0}$ together with one of the following three conditions: \begin{align*} &amp;(1)\quad f^{1/(k-1)}\in C^{1,1}(\overline{\Omega_{0}}),\ \ \inf_{\Omega}\Delta u\geq1,\ \ 2\leq k\leq n-1;\\ &amp;(2)\quad f^{3/(2k-2)}\in C^{2,1}(\overline{\Omega_{0}}),\ \ \inf_{\Omega}\Delta u\geq1,\ \ 5\leq k\leq n-1;\\ &amp;(3)\quad f^{3/(2k)}\in C^{2,1}(\overline{\Omega_{0}}),\ \ 2\leq k\leq n-1. \end{align*}</description>

      <title>Mosco convergence framework for singular limits of gradient flows on Hilbert spaces with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the question of convergence of a sequence of gradient flows defined on different Hilbert spaces. In order to give meaning to this idea, we introduce a notion of connecting operators. This permits us to generalize the concept of Mosco convergence of functionals to our present setting, and state a desired convergence result for gradient flows, which we then prove. We present a variety of examples, including thin domains, dynamic boundary conditions, and discrete-to-continuum limits.</description>

      <title>Stability and bifurcation of 2D viscous primitive equations with full diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stability and bifurcation of the two-dimensional viscous primitive equations with full diffusion under thermal forcing. The system governs perturbations about a motionless basic state with a linear temperature profile in a periodic channel, where the temperature is fixed at $T_0$ and $T_1$ on the bottom and upper boundaries, respectively. Through a rigorous analysis of three distinct thermal regimes, we identify a critical temperature difference $T_c$ that fundamentally dictates the system's dynamical transitions. Our main contributions are fourfold. Firstly, in the subcritical case $T_0 - T_1 &lt; T_c$, we use energy methods to establish the global nonlinear stability in $H^2$-norm, proving that perturbations decay exponentially. Secondly, precisely at the critical threshold $T_0 - T_1 = T_c$, we prove not only the nonlinear stability in $H^1$-norm but also the asymptotic convergence of all solutions to zero, leveraging spectral and dynamical systems theory. Finally, in the supercritical regime $T_0 - T_1 &gt; T_c$, a bootstrap argument reveals that the basic state is nonlinearly unstable across all $L^p$-norms for $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. Finally, near the critical point, the dynamics are first reduced to a two-dimensional system on a center manifold. This reduced system then undergoes a supercritical bifurcation, generating a countable family of stable steady states that are organized into a local ring attractor. This work closes a significant gap in the stability analysis of the thermally driven primitive equations, establishing a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding the formation of convection cells in large-scale geophysical flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of Fokker-Planck equations with spatially inhomogeneous nonlinear diffusion, based on the energy dissipation law. First, we consider the Fokker-Planck equation with porous-medium-type nonlinear diffusion that satisfies the energy dissipation law by introducing spatial inhomogeneity into the free energy. We obtain a result on the long-time behavior of the dissipation function for sufficiently large diffusion coefficients by extending the entropy dissipation method to the case of inhomogeneous diffusion.</description>

      <title>On quasi-isospectrality of potentials and Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study quasi-isospectral operators as a generalization of isospectral operators. The paper contains both expository material and original results. We begin by reviewing known results on isospectral potentials on compact manifolds and finite intervals, and then introduce the notion of quasi-isospectrality. We next investigate the BMT method as a systematic approach to constructing quasi-isospectral Sturm-Liouville operators on a finite interval, and apply it to several boundary value problems. Our main result shows that any two quasi-isospectral closed manifolds of odd dimension are, in fact, isospectral. In addition, we extend classical compactness results for isospectral potentials on low-dimensional manifolds to the quasi-isospectral setting via heat trace asymptotics.</description>

      <title>The stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar equation: Global solution and invariant measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar (LLBar) equation perturbed by both additive and multiplicative noises is a system of fourth order stochastic PDEs which models the evolution of magnetic spin fields in ferromagnetic materials at elevated temperatures, taking into account longitudinal damping, long-range interactions, spin current, and noise-induced phenomena at high temperatures. In this paper, we show the existence of a unique pathwise solution (which is analytically strong) to the stochastic LLBar equation posed in a bounded domain $\mathscr{D}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, where $d=1,2,3$. We also prove the convergence of this pathwise solution to that of the stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch (LLB) equation in the limit of vanishing exchange relaxation parameter. Finally, we show the Feller property of the Markov semigroup associated with the strong solution, and prove the existence of nontrivial invariant measures. For temperatures above the Curie temperature, exponential stability of the solution and uniqueness of invariant measure are obtained under certain dissipativity conditions.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the perturbed Landau-Dirac operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the Dirac operator with constant magnetic field in $\mathbb R^2$. Its spectrum consists of eigenvalues of infinite multiplicities, known as the Landau-Dirac levels. Under compactly supported perturbations, we study the distribution of the discrete eigenvalues near each Landau-Dirac level. Similarly to the Landau (Schr\"odinger) operator, we demonstrate that a three-terms asymptotic formula holds for the eigenvalue counting function. One of the main novelties of this work is the treatment of some perturbations of variable sign. In this context we explore some remarkable phenomena related to the finiteness or infiniteness of the discrete eigenvalues, which depend on the interplay of the different terms in the matrix perturbation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a comparison principle for the pluripotential complex Monge-Amp\`ere flows for the right-hand side of the form $dt \wedge d\mu$ where $d\mu$ is dominated by a Monge-Amp\`ere measure of a bounded plurisubharmonic function. As a consequence, we obtain the uniqueness of the weak solution to the pluripotential Cauchy-Dirichlet problem. We also study the long-term behavior of the solution under some assumption.</description>
