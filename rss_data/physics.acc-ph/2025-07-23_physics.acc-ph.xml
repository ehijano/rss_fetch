      <title>Modeling of the positron sources: an experiment-based benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-intensity positron sources are critical for next-generation electron-positron colliders, where positron beam quality and characteristics directly impact the luminosity. Accurate modeling and validated simulation tools for positron sources are essential to optimize their performance. However, modeling a positron source tends to be complex, as it involves multiple interdependent stages, from positron production and capture dynamics to beam transport through the injector linac to the collider ring. A reliable simulation framework should integrate these processes to ensure efficient positron production and transport. In this work, we present a start-to-end simulation tool developed for positron sources modeling. The model was benchmarked against existing simulation tools and validated through experimental measurements conducted at the SuperKEKB positron source. Key operational parameters were systematically scanned to evaluate the simulation model performance, including the primary electron impact position on the target, solenoid field strength around the capture linac, and RF phase settings. The primary Figure-of-Merit for all validation tests was the positron yield at the end of the SuperKEKB positron capture section. The simulation results demonstrate a very good agreement with experimental data and other simulation tools, confirming the model's reliability and establishing a framework for future positron source studies.</description>

      <title>Detuning Properties of RF Phase Modulation in an Electron Storage Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.15555v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In electron storage rings, it is possible to increase the bunch length by applying phase modulation to the radio frequency accelerating field by choosing appropriate parameters for the modulation. Such a bunch lengthening effect improves beam parameters such as beam lifetime, which can help us achieve better beam stability. It is well known that the modulation frequency around the double synchrotron frequency is effective in lengthening the bunch. The dependence of bunch lengthening on modulation frequency, the so-called detuning property, has a peak around the double synchrotron frequency with a frequency width that depends on the modulation amplitude. Nonlinear effects due to phase modulation lead to a peak frequency shift in a negative direction from the double synchrotron frequency, accompanied by an asymmetric peak shape. Beam current also affects the properties of the detuning condition of such bunch lengthening. We investigated the detuning property using a theoretical model and systematic measurements at the electron storage ring KARA, and we verified the qualitative agreement between the experiments and the theoretical model. The macro-particle simulations have confirmed the agreement.</description>
