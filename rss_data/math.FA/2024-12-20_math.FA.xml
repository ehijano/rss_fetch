      <title>A remark on the rigidity of a property characterizing the Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show rigidity results for the operator equations T(f.g) = Tf.Tg, T(f*g) = Tf.Tg and T(f.g) = Tf*Tg for bijective operators T acting on sufficently large spaces of smooth functions. Typically a condition like |T(f.g) - Tf.Tg| &lt; a for all f, g with a fixed function a will imply T(f.g) = Tf.Tg. Theorems of Alesker, Artstein-Avidan, Faifman and Milman then yield characterizations (up to diffeomorphisms) of the Fourier transform by mapping products into convolutions and vice-versa on the Schwartz space.</description>

      <title>Extension of Norm One Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through the establishment of several extension theorems, we provide explicit expressions for norm one projections and 1-complemented subspaces in the Hardy space $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ for $1\leq p&lt;\infty$, $p\neq 2$. Our characterization leads to two significant corollaries: first, all 1-complemented subspaces of $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ with dimension greater than one are isometric to $H^p(\mathbb{T})$; second, all norm one projections on $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ are restrictions of norm one projections on $L^p(\mathbb{T})$ that leave $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ invariant.
  The second corollary answers an open problem posed by P. Wojtaszczyk in 2003. Moreover, this is the first time that norm one projections and 1-complemented subspaces in an analytic function space have been completely understood.</description>

      <title>Multilinear matrix weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we fully characterize the classes of matrix weights for which multilinear Calder\'on-Zygmund operators extend to bounded operators on matrix weighted Lebesgue spaces. To this end, we develop the theory of multilinear singular integrals taking values in tensor products of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. On the one hand, we establish quantitative bounds in terms of multilinear Muckenhoupt matrix weight characteristics and scalar Fujii-Wilson conditions of a tensor product analogue of the convex body sparse operator, of a convex-set valued tensor product analogue of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator, and of a multilinear analogue of the Christ-Goldberg maximal operator. These bounds recover the sharpest known bounds in the linear case. Moreover, we define a notion of directional nondegeneracy for multilinear Calder\'on-Zygmund operators, which is new even in the scalar case. The noncommutavity of matrix multiplication, the absence of duality, and the natural presence of quasinorms in the multilinear setting present several new difficulties in comparison to previous works in the scalar or in the linear case. To overcome them, we use techniques inspired from convex combinatorics and differential geometry.</description>

      <title>$\ell^1$-bases, algebraic structure and strong Arens irregularity of Banach algebras in harmonic analysis$^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long standing problem in abstract harmonic analysis concerns the strong Arens irregularity (sAir, for short) of the Fourier algebra $A(G)$ of a locally compact group $G.$ The groups for which $A(G)$ is known to be sAir are all amenable. So far this class includes the abelian groups, the discrete amenable groups, the second countable amenable groups $G$ such that $\overline{[G, G]}$ is not open in $G,$ the groups of the form $\prod_{i=0}^\infty G_i$ where each $G_i$, $i\ge1$, is a non-trivial metrizable compact group and $G_0$ is an amenable second countable locally compact group, the groups of the form $G_0\times G$, where $G$ is a compact group whose local weight $w(G)$ has uncountable cofinality and $G_0$ is any locally compact amenable group with $w(G_0)\le w(G)$, and the compact group $SU(2).$ We were primarily concerned with the groups for which $A(G)$ is sAir. We introduce a new class of $\ell^1$-bases in Banach algebras. These new $\ell^1$-bases enable us, among other results, to unify most of the results related to Arens products proved in the past seventy years since Arens defined his products. This includes the strong Arens irregularity of algebras in harmonic analysis, and in particular almost all the cases mentioned above for the Fourier algebras. In addition, we also show that $A(G)$ is sAir for compact connected groups with an infinite dual rank. The $\ell^1$-bases for the Fourier algebra are constructed with coefficients of certain irreducible representations of the group. With this new approach using $\ell^1$-bases, the rich algebraic structure of the algebras and semigroups under study such as the second dual of Banach algebras with an Arens product or certain semigroup compactifications (the Stone-\v Cech compactification of an infinite discrete group, for instance) is also unveiled</description>

      <title>Characterization of minimal tripotents via annihilators and its application to the study of additive preservers of truncations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The contributions in this note begin with a new characterization of (positive) scalar multiples of minimal tripotents in a general JB$^*$-triple $E$, proving that a non-zero element $a\in E$ is a positive scalar multiple of a minimal tripotent in $E$ if, and only if, its inner quadratic annihilator (that is, the set $^{\perp_{q}}\!\{a\} = \{ b\in E: \{a,b,a\} =0\}$) is maximal among all inner quadratic annihilators of single elements in $E$. We subsequently apply this characterization to the study of surjective additive maps between atomic JBW$^*$-triples preserving truncations in both directions. Let $A: E\to F$ be a surjective additive mapping between atomic JBW$^*$-triples, where $E$ contains no one-dimensional Cartan factors as direct summands. We show that $A$ preserves truncations in both directions if, and only if, there exists a bijection $\sigma: \Gamma_1\to \Gamma_2$, a bounded family $(\gamma_k)_{k\in \Gamma_1}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^+$, and a family $(\Phi_k)_{k\in \Gamma_1},$ where each $\Phi_k$ is a (complex) linear or a conjugate-linear (isometric) triple isomorphism from $C_k$ onto $\widetilde{C}_{\sigma(k)}$ satisfying $\inf_{k} \{\gamma_k \} &gt;0,$ and $$A(x) = \Big( \gamma_{k} \Phi_k \left(\pi_k(x)\right) \Big)_{k\in\Gamma_1},\ \hbox{ for all } x\in E,$$ where $\pi_k$ denotes the canonical projection of $E$ onto $C_k.$</description>

      <title>Microlocal analysis of double fibration transforms with conjugate points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of normal operators of double fibration transforms with conjugate points. Examples of double fibration transforms include Radon transforms, $d$-plane transforms on the Euclidean space, geodesic X-ray transforms, light-ray transforms, and ray transforms defined by null bicharacteristics associated with real principal type operators. We show that, under certain stable conditions on the distribution of conjugate points, the normal operator splits into an elliptic pseudodifferential operator and several Fourier integral operators, depending on the degree of the conjugate points. These results were first proved for geodesic X-ray transforms by Holman and Uhlmann (Journal of Differential Geometry, {\bf 108} (2018), pp.459--494).</description>

      <title>Admissibility theory in abstract Sobolev scales and transfer function growth at high frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For strongly continous semigroups on Hilbert spaces, we investigate admissibility properties of control and observation operators shifted along continuous scales of spaces built by means of either interpolation and extrapolation or functional calculus. Our results show equivalence of admissibility in, on the one hand, a fractional domain of the generator and, on the other hand, a (different, in general) quadratic interpolation space of the same "Sobolev order". Furthermore, such properties imply quantified resolvent bounds in the original state space topology. When the semigroup is a group, the resulting frequency-domain estimates are in fact equivalent to the aforementioned time-domain properties. In the case of systems with both control and observation, we are able to translate input-output regularity properties into high-frequency growth rates of operator-valued transfer functions. As an application, based on results by Lasiecka, Triggiani and Tataru on interior and boundary regularity of the wave equation under Neumann control, we derive optimal asymptotics for the Neumann-to-Dirichlet wave transfer function. With that in hand, we establish non-uniform energy decay rates for the wave equation posed in a rectangle and subject to Neumann damping on an arbitrary open subset of the boundary.</description>

      <title>$L^2$ restriction estimates from the Fourier spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stein--Tomas restriction theorem is an important result in Fourier restriction theory. It gives a range of $q$ for which $L^q\to L^2$ restriction estimates hold for a given measure, in terms of the Fourier and Frostman dimensions of the measure. We generalise this result by using the Fourier spectrum; a family of dimensions that interpolate between the Fourier and Sobolev dimensions for measures. This gives us a continuum of Stein--Tomas type estimates, and optimising over this continuum gives a new $L^q\to L^2$ restriction theorem which often outperforms the Stein--Tomas result. We also provide results in the other direction by giving a range of $q$ in terms of the Fourier spectrum for which $L^q\to L^2$ restriction estimates fail, generalising an observation of Hambrook and {\L}aba. We illustrate our results with several examples, including the surface measure on the cone, the moment curve, and several fractal measures.</description>

      <title>Affirmative Resolution of Bourgain's Slicing Problem using Guan's Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the final step in the resolution of Bourgain's slicing problem in the affirmative. Thus we establish the following theorem: for any convex body $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ of volume one, there exists a hyperplane $H \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $$ Vol_{n-1}(K \cap H) &gt; c, $$ where $c &gt; 0$ is a universal constant. Our proof combines Milman's theory of $M$-ellipsoids, stochastic localization with a recent bound by Guan, and stability estimates for the Shannon-Stam inequality by Eldan and Mikulincer.</description>

      <title>Properties of local orthonormal systems, Part II: Geometric characterization of Bernstein inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(\Omega,\mathscr F,\mathbb P) $ be a probability space and let $(\mathscr F_n)$ be a binary filtration, i.e. exactly one atom of $\mathscr F_{n-1}$ is divided into two atoms of $\mathscr F_n$ without any restriction on their respective measures. Additionally, denote the collection of atoms corresponding to this filtration by $\mathscr A$. Let $S \subset L^\infty(\Omega)$ be a finite-dimensional linear subspace, having an additional stability property on atoms $\mathscr A$. For these data, we consider the two dictionaries $\mathscr C = \{ f \cdot \chi_A: f \in S, A \in \mathscr A\}$ and $\Phi$, a local orthonormal system generated by $S$ and the filtration $(\mathscr F_n)$. We are interested in approximation spaces corresponding to the best $n$-term approximation in $L^p$ for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ by elements of $\mathscr C$ and $\Phi$, respectively. It is known that in the classical Haar case, i.e. when $S = {\rm span} (\chi_{[0,1]})$ and the binary filtration $(\mathscr F_n)$ is dyadic (that is, an atom $A \in \mathscr A$ is divided into two new atoms of equal measure), those approximation spaces coincide, cf. [P. Petrushev, Multivariate $n$-term rational and piecewise polynomial approximation, J. Approx. Theory 121(1), 2003]. This motivates us to ask the question whether this is true in the general setting described above. The answer to this question is governed by the validity of a specific Bernstein type inequality.
  The main result of this paper is a geometric characterization of this type of Bernstein inequality, i.e. a characterization in terms of the behaviour of functions from the space $S$ on atoms $\mathscr A$ and rings $\mathscr R = \{ A \setminus B: A, B \in \mathscr A, B \subset A \}\setminus \mathscr A$. We specialize this general result to some examples of interest, including general Haar systems and spaces $S$ consisting of (multivariate) polynomials.</description>

      <title>Sharp Poincar\'e--Sobolev Inequalities of Choquet--Lorentz Integrals with Respect to Hausdorff Contents on Bounded John Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15224v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded John domain in $\mathbb R^n$ with $n\ge 2$, and let $\mathcal{H}_{\infty }^{\delta}$ denote the Hausdorff content of dimension $\delta\in (0,n]$. In this article, the authors prove the Poincar\'e and the Poincar\'e--Sobolev inequalities, with sharp ranges of indices, on Choquet--Lorentz integrals with respect to $\mathcal{H}_{\infty }^{\delta}$ for all continuously differentiable functions on $\Omega$. These results not only extend the recent Poincar\'e and Poincar\'e--Sobolev inequalities to the Choquet--Lorentz integrals, but also provide some endpoint estimates (weak type) in the critical case. One of the main novelties exists in that, to achieve the goals, the authors develop some new tools associated with Choquet--Lorentz integrals on $\mathcal{H}_{\infty }^{\delta}$, such as the fractional Hardy--Littlewood maximal inequality and the Hedberg-type pointwise estimate on the Riesz potential. As an application, the authors obtain the sharp boundedness of the Riesz potential on Choquet--Lorentz integrals. Moreover, even for classical Lorentz integrals, these Poincar\'e and Poincar\'e--Sobolev inequalities are also new.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores additional properties of some classes of Saphar type operators, namely left Drazin invertible, essentially left Drazin invertible, right Drazin invertible, and essentially right Drazin invertible operators on Banach spaces, building upon the groundwork laid in \cite{GM} and \cite{ZS}. Specifically, we propose alternative definitions for these operators and characterize them with a new type of operator decomposition, providing a deeper understanding of their properties. Furthermore, we investigate their behavior under powers. The operators we study are distinguished from other operators bearing the same name in existing literature, see \cite{Aiena}, \cite{Q. Jiang}. By employing more refined definitions, we uncover a broader range of properties for these operators, setting them apart from their counterparts in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.04878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In $\mathbb{R}^3$, a hyperbolic paraboloid is a classical saddle-shaped quadric surface. Recently, Elser has modeled problems arising in Deep Learning using rectangular hyperbolic paraboloids in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Motivated by his work, we provide a rigorous analysis of the associated projection. In some cases, finding this projection amounts to finding a certain root of a quintic or cubic polynomial. We also observe when the projection is not a singleton and point out connections to graphical and set convergence.</description>

      <title>Linear-quadratic optimal control for infinite-dimensional input-state-output systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the minimization of a quadratic cost functional composed of the output and the final state of abstract infinite-dimensional evolution equations in view of existence of solutions and optimality conditions. While the initial value is prescribed, we are minimizing over all inputs within a specified convex subset of square integrable controls with values in a Hilbert space. The considered class of infinite-dimensional systems is based on the system node formulation. Thus, our developed approach includes optimal control of a wide variety of linear partial differential equations with boundary control and observation that are not well-posed in the sense that the output continuously depends on the input and the initial value. We provide an application of particular optimal control problems arising in energy-optimal control of port-Hamiltonian systems. Last, we illustrate the our abstract theory by two examples including a non-well-posed heat equation with Dirichlet boundary control and a wave equation on an L-shaped domain with boundary control of the stress in normal direction.</description>

      <title>A nontrivial uniform algebra Dirichlet on its maximal ideal space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that there exists a nontrivial uniform algebra that is Dirichlet on its maximal ideal space and has a dense set of elements that are exponentials. This answers a 64-year-old question of John Wermer and a 16-year-old question of Garth Dales and Joel Feinstein. Our example is P(X) for a certain compact set X in complex Euclidean 2-space ($\mathbb{C}^2$). It is also shown that there exists a logmodular uniform algebra with proper Shilov boundary but with no nontrivial Gleason parts. This answers a modification of another 64-year-old question of Wermer.</description>

      <title>Stable Learning Using Spiking Neural Networks Equipped With Affine Encoders and Decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the learning problem associated with spiking neural networks. Specifically, we focus on spiking neural networks composed of simple spiking neurons having only positive synaptic weights, equipped with an affine encoder and decoder. These neural networks are shown to depend continuously on their parameters, which facilitates classical covering number-based generalization statements and supports stable gradient-based training. We demonstrate that the positivity of the weights continues to enable a wide range of expressivity results, including rate-optimal approximation of smooth functions and dimension-independent approximation of Barron regular functions. In particular, we show in theory and simulations that affine spiking neural networks are capable of approximating shallow ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we apply these neural networks to standard machine learning benchmarks, reaching competitive results. Finally, and remarkably, we observe that from a generalization perspective, contrary to feedforward neural networks or previous results for general spiking neural networks, the depth has little to no adverse effect on the generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Rigged Hilbert Space formulation for quasi-Hermitian composite systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discussion in this study delves into Dirac's bra-ket formalism for a quasi-Hermitian quantum composite system based on the rigged Hilbert space (RHS). We establish an RHS with a positive definite metric suitable for a quasi-Hermite composite system. The obtained RHS is utilized to construct the bra and ket vectors for the non-Hermite composite system and produce the spectral decomposition of the quasi-Hermitian operator. We show that the symmetric relations regarding quasi-Hermitian operators can be extended to dual spaces, and all descriptions obtained using the bra-ket formalism are completely developed in the dual spaces. Our methodology is applied to a non-Hermitian harmonic oscillator composed of conformal multi-dimensional many-body systems.</description>
