      <title>Simultaneous Measurement of Thermal Conductivity and Heat Capacity Across Diverse Materials Using the Square-Pulsed Source (SPS) Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art techniques like dual-frequency Time-Domain Thermoreflectance (TDTR) and Frequency-Domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR) offer superb capability for simultaneous measurements of thermal conductivity and heat capacity with a spatial resolution on the order of 10 {\mu}m. However, their applicability is limited to highly conductive materials with an in-plane thermal conductivity exceeding 10 W/(m*K). In this paper, we introduce the Square-Pulsed Source (SPS) technique, offering a novel approach to concurrently measure thermal conductivity and heat capacity with a 10 {\mu}m spatial resolution, while significantly extending the measurable thermal conductivity range to an unprecedented low of 0.1 W/(m*K), offering enhanced versatility. To demonstrate and validate its efficacy, we conducted measurements on various standard materials--PMMA, silica, sapphire, silicon, and diamond--spanning a wide thermal conductivity range from 0.1 to 2000 W/(m*K). The obtained results exhibit remarkable agreement with literature values, with a typical measurement uncertainty of less than 10% across the entire thermal conductivity range. By providing a unique capability to characterize both highly and lowly conductive materials with micron-scale spatial resolution, the SPS method opens new avenues for understanding and engineering thermal properties across diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Predicting ptychography probe positions using single-shot phase retrieval neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ptychography is a powerful imaging technique that is used in a variety of fields, including materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, the accuracy of the reconstructed ptychography image is highly dependent on the accuracy of the recorded probe positions which often contain errors. These errors are typically corrected jointly with phase retrieval through numerical optimization approaches. When the error accumulates along the scan path or when the error magnitude is large, these approaches may not converge with satisfactory result. We propose a fundamentally new approach for ptychography probe position prediction for data with large position errors, where a neural network is used to make single-shot phase retrieval on individual diffraction patterns, yielding the object image at each scan point. The pairwise offsets among these images are then found using a robust image registration method, and the results are combined to yield the complete scan path by constructing and solving a linear equation. We show that our method can achieve good position prediction accuracy for data with large and accumulating errors on the order of $10^2$ pixels, a magnitude that often makes optimization-based algorithms fail to converge. For ptychography instruments without sophisticated position control equipment such as interferometers, our method is of significant practical potential.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced Charge Transfer in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a charge transfer mechanism in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) quantum dots (QDs) is studied. A common dye, Rhodamine 6G (R6G), has been used as fluorescent molecule and QDs of molybdenum disulfide ($\rm{MoS_2}$) and tungsten disulfide ($\rm{WS_2}$) have been used as acceptors of electrons in the photo-induced charge transfer process. The MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$ QDs have been synthesized using ultrasonication method. These QDs have been characterized using transmission electron microscope (TEM), UV-Vis spectrophotometer, and fluorimeter. The TEM images of these QDs show well dispersed particles of size $~$2 nm. These QDs show intense fluorescence emission when excited with light having wavelength, $\lambda &lt; $ 350 nm. In presence of light, the photons help in creating charges in fluorescent dye molecule, and TMDCs QDs felicitate the charge transfer in the process. The charge transfer phenomenon has been studied using time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) set-up, which is a time resolved fluorescence spectroscopic technique. The time resolved fluorescence study shows a drastic change in the fluorescence (FL) lifetime of R6G molecules in the presence of QDs. This decrease in FL lifetime of R6G shows that the MoS$_2$, and WS$_2$ QDs provide additional path to the photo-generated electrons in the excited state of R6G. This study can be further extended to optoelectronic devices, where charge transfer plays an important role in the device efficiency and performance.</description>

      <title>Encryption in ghost imaging with Kronecker products of random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By forming measurement matrices with the Kronecker product of two random matrices, image encryption in computational ghost imaging is investigated. The two-dimensional images are conveniently reconstructed with the pseudo-inverse matrices of the two random matrices. To suppress the noise, the method of truncated singular value decomposition can be applied to either or both of the two pseudo-inverse matrices. Further, our proposal facilitates for image encryption since more matrices can be involved in forming the measurement matrix. Two permutation matrices are inserted into the matrix sequence. The image information can only be reconstructed with the correct permutation matrices and the matrix sequence in image decryption. The experimental results show the facilitations our proposal. The technique paves the way for the practicality and flexibility of computational ghost imaging.</description>

      <title>Realization of a cold atom gyroscope in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High precision gyroscopes in space are important for sophisticated scientific experiments and deep space navigation. Microgravity in the space provides an ideal condition for operation of a cold atom gyroscope. To demonstrate this advantage, an atom interferometer (AI) was launched and installed in the China Space Station in 2022. Here reported is a realization of the cold atom gyroscope with this AI. By applying point source interferometry, spatial fringes are obtained and acceleration and rotation are extracted. The angles of the Raman lasers are precisely calibrated to avoid measurement error, and other systematic errors are also considered for the rotation measurement. The evaluated rotation measurement is (-115.64+/-1.71)*10^-5 rad/s in space, and an acceleration measurement resolution of 1.03*10^-6 m/s^2 is also obtained for a single image. This study conducts the first AI-based gyroscope in space and paves a way for future space-based AI experiments.</description>

      <title>Physics-based Machine Learning Discovered Nano-circuitry for Nonlinear Ion Transport in Nanoporous Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.08151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confined ion transport is involved in nanoporous ionic systems. However, it is challenging to mechanistically predict its electrical characteristics for rational system design and performance evaluation using electrical circuit model due to the gap between the circuit theory and the underlying physical chemistry. Here we demonstrate that machine learning can bridge this gap and produce physics-based nano-circuitry, based on equation discovery from the modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck simulation results where an anomalous constructive diffusion-migration interplay of confined ions is unveiled. This bridging technique allows us to gain physical insights of ion dynamics in nanoporous electrodes, such as the non-ideal cyclic voltammetry.</description>
