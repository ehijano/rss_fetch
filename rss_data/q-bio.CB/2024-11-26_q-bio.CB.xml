      <title>Devil's staircase inside shrimps reveals periodicity of plateau spikes and bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Slow-fast dynamics are intrinsically related to complex phenomena, and are responsible for many of the homeostatic dynamics that keep biological systems healthfully functioning. We study a discrete-time membrane potential model that can generate a diverse set of spiking behavior depending on the choice of slow-fast time scales, from fast spiking to bursting, or plateau action potentials -- also known as cardiac spikes, since they are characteristic in heart myocytes. The plateau of cardiac spikes may lose stability, generating early or delayed afterdepolarizations (EAD and DAD, respectively), both of which are related to cardiac arrhythmia. We show the periodicity changes along the transition from the healthy action potentials to these impaired spikes. We show that while EADs are mainly periodic attractors, DAD usually comes with chaos. EADs are found inside shrimps -- isoperiodic structures of the parameter space. However, in our system, the shrimps have an internal structure made of multiple periodicities, revealing a complete devil's staircase. Understanding the periodicity of plateau attractors in slow-fast systems could come in handy to unveil the features of heart myocytes behavior that are linked to cardiac arrhythmias.</description>

      <title>Pitchfork Bifurcation In A Coupled Cell System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various biological phenomena, like cell differentiation and pattern formation in multicellular organisms, are explained using the bifurcation theory. Molecular network motifs like positive feedback and mutual repressor exhibit bifurcation and are responsible for the emergence of diverse cell types. Mathematical investigations of such problems usually focus on bifurcation in a molecular network in individual cells. However, in a multicellular organism, cells interact, and intercellular interactions affect individual cell dynamics. Therefore, the bifurcation in an ensemble of cells could differ from that for a single cell. This work considers a ring of identical cells. When independent, each cell exhibits supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. Using analytical and numerical tools, we investigate the bifurcation in this ensemble when cells interact through positive and negative coupling. We show that within a specific parameter zone, an ensemble of positively coupled cells behaves like a single cell with supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. In this regime, all cells are synchronized and have the same steady state. However, this unique behaviour is lost when cells interact through negative coupling. Apart from the synchronized (or homogenous) states, cell-cell coupling leads to certain heterogeneous steady states with unique patterns. We also investigate the distribution of such heterogeneous states under positive and negative coupling.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab using data-driven delay integro-differential equations</title>

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) poses a major public health challenge, with it being the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide as of 2024. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) CRC and deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) CRC comprise $15\%$ of all CRC and have shown remarkable response to immunotherapy, especially with PD-1 inhibitors. Mathematical models are a promising avenue for treatment optimisation, and we use delay integro-differential equations to model the interactions and dynamics of various cell types, immune checkpoints, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and cytokines. We note that many of these species are being modelled deterministically for the first time in cancer, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the complex underlying immune dynamics. We consider two compartments: the tumour site and the tumour-draining lymph node (TDLN), taking into account phenomena such as DC migration, T cell proliferation, acquired resistance to pembrolizumab, and CD8+ T cell exhaustion and reinvigoration. The parameter values and initial conditions for the model are estimated from experimental data, incorporating various pharmacokinetic, bioanalytical, and radiographic studies, as well as deconvolution of bulk RNA-sequencing data from the TCGA COADREAD database. We finally optimise CRC treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab $\unicode{x2014}$ one of the most used PD-1 inhibitors. We maximise treatment efficacy and efficiency in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC patients whilst accounting for toxicity, and improve upon currently FDA-approved therapeutic regimens for metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC. We demonstrate that a single medium-to-high dose of pembrolizumab is sufficient for effective tumour eradication, whilst being efficient, safe and practical.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Nucleus: Cytoplasmic Dominance in Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma Detection Using Single-Cell Raman Imaging Across Multiple Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.05675v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cytological diagnosis of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) is one of major challenges in the field of endocrine oncology due to absence of evident morphological indicators. Morphological abnormalities in the nucleus are typically key indicators in cancer cytopathology and are attributed to a range of biochemical alterations in nuclear components. Consequently, Raman spectroscopy has been widely used to detect cancer in various cytological samples, often identifying biochemical changes prior to observable morphological alterations. However, in the case of FTC, cytoplasmic features such as carotenoids, cytochromes, and lipid droplets have shown greater diagnostic relevance compared to nuclear features. This study leverages single-cell Raman imaging to explore the spatial origin of diagnostic signals in FTC and normal thyroid (NT) cells, assessing the contributions of the nucleus and cytoplasm independently. Our results demonstrate that Raman spectra from the cytoplasmic region can distinguish between FTC and NT cells with an accuracy of 84% under co-culture conditions, maintaining robustness across multiple devices. In contrast, classification based on nuclear spectra achieved only 53% accuracy, suggesting that biochemical alterations in the cytoplasm play a more significant role in FTC detection than those in the nucleus. Our work elevates the promise of Raman-based cytopathology by providing complementary organelle-dependent information to traditional diagnostic methods and demonstrating transferability across different devices.</description>
