      <title>Approximation Properties of Mellin-Steklov Type Exponential Sampling Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Mellin-Steklov exponential samplingoperators of order $r,r\in\mathbb{N}$, by considering appropriate Mellin-Steklov integrals. We investigate the approximation properties of these operators in continuousbounded spaces and $L^p, 1 \leq p &lt; \infty$ spaces on $\mathbb{R}_+.$ By using the suitablemodulus of smoothness, it is given high order of approximation. Further, we present a quantitative Voronovskaja type theorem and we study the convergence results of newly constructed operators in logarithmic weighted spaces offunctions. Finally, the paper provides some examples of kernels that support the our results.</description>

      <title>On Extended Family of Fractional Sobolev Spaces Via Ultradistributions of Slow Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a new version of fractional Sobolev spaces $\widetilde{\mathcal{W}}_{\mathcal{U}}^{\beta,p}(\mathbb{C}^{n})$ defined using the concept of tempered ultradistributions with respect to the spaces of ultradifferentiable functions $\mathcal{U}(\mathbb{C})$. The space $\widetilde{\mathcal{W}}_{\mathcal{U}}^{\beta,p}(\mathbb{C}^{n})$ is a natural generalization of the classical Sobolev space with integer order, where some additional conditions of growth control have been introduced. We analyze some possible definitions and their roles in the structure theory. We prove some density and compact embedding results, investigating the possibility of the extension domains. Some of the results we present here are extensions of the existing ones with some additional conditions. The construction of the new family of fractional Sobolev space is considered within the framework of Fourier transform of ultradistributions of slow growth.</description>

Abstract: We consider the irreducibility of the regular representation of a noncompact semisimpe Lie group $G$ on the Hilbert space of the image of the Joint-Eigenspace Fourier transform on its corresponding symmetric space $G/K.$ The $L^{2}-$decomposition of the Joint-Eigenspace Fourier transform leads to the complete characterization of the said irreducibility in terms of the simplicity of a pair of members of $\mathfrak{a}^{*}_{\mathbb{C}}.$</description>

      <title>Operators for matrix-valued Riesz bases over LCA groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The image of a given orthonormal basis for a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ under a bijective, bounded, and linear operator acting on $\mathcal{H}$ is called a Riesz basis of $\mathcal{H}$. Contrary to what happens with Riesz bases (in the usual sense) in separable Hilbert spaces, it is not true in general that the image of a matrix-valued orthonormal basis under a bounded, linear, and bijective operator on $L^2(G, \mathbb{C}^{s\times r})$ is also a basis and frame for the space $L^2(G, \mathbb{C}^{s\times r})$, where $G$ is a $\sigma$-compact and metrizable locally compact abelian (LCA) group. We give some classes of operators for the construction of matrix-valued Riesz bases from orthonormal bases of the space $L^2(G, \mathbb{C}^{s\times r})$. Motivated by a result due to Holub, we show that a bounded, linear, and bijective operator acting on $L^2(G, \mathbb{C}^{s\times r})$ which is adjointable with respect to the matrix-valued inner product is positive if and only if it maps a matrix-valued Riesz basis of the space $L^2(G, \mathbb{C}^{s\times r})$ to its dual Riesz basis.</description>

      <title>Moment problems related to intrinsic characterizations of the moment functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider linear functionals defined on an unital commutative real algebra A and establish characterizations for moment functionals on compact sets of characters that depend only on the given functional. For example, we obtain a characterization of a moment functional on a product of symmetric intervals, in which we do not assume that the functional is positive semidefinite but positive on a semiring of A, and a characterization of a moment functional that is a solution to the moment problem on a product of arbitrary intervals. We also prove a Positivstellensatz for an archimedean cone, which is neither a quadratic module nor a semiring.</description>

      <title>Hilbert function spaces and multiplier algebras of analytic discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thesis is devoted to two related problems.
  1. The isomorphism problem for analytic discs: Suppose $V$ is the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ embedded in the $d$-dimensional unit ball $\mathbb{B}_d$ and attached to the unit sphere. Consider the space $\mathcal{H}_V$, the restriction of the Drury-Arveson space to the variety $V$, and its multiplier algebra $\mathcal{M}_V = \operatorname{Mult}(\mathcal{H}_V)$. The isomorphism problem is the following: Is $V_1 \cong V_2$ equivalent to $\mathcal{M}_{V_1} \cong \mathcal{M}_{V_2}$?
  A theorem of Alpay, Putinar and Vinnikov states that for $V$ without self-crossings on the boundary $\mathcal{M}_V$ is the space of bounded analytic functions on $V$. We consider what happens when there are self-crossings on the boundary and prove that if $\mathcal{M}_{V_1} \cong \mathcal{M}_{V_2}$ algebraically, then $V_1$ and $V_2$ must have the same self-crossings up to a unit disc automorphism. We prove that an isomorphism between $\mathcal{M}_{V_1}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{V_2}$ can only be given by a composition with a map from $V_1$ to $V_2$. In the case of a single self-crossing we show that there are only two possible candidates for this map and find these candidates.
  2. The embedding dimension for complete Pick spaces: A Theorem of Agler and McCarthy states that any complete Pick space can be realized as $\mathcal{H}_V$, for some $V$ in $\mathbb{B}_d$, where $d$ can be infinite. The smallest such $d$ is called the embedding dimension. Given a complete Pick space can we find its embedding dimension? Can we at least determine if it is finite or infinite?
  We look into this problem for rotation-invariant spaces on the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$. We prove a general result which explicitly relates the embedding dimension with the kernel of the space. This allows us to prove that the embedding dimension for certain weighted Hardy-type spaces is infinite.</description>

      <title>Regularity of the Semigroup of Regular Probability Measures on Locally Compact Hausdorff Topological Groups in which every element is of finite order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a locally compact Hausdorff group in which every element is of finite order, and let $P(\mathcal{G})$ denote the class of all regular probability measures on $\mathcal{G}$. In this note, it is observed that a charecterisation of algebraically regular elements in certain subsemigroups of $P(\mathcal{G})$, Theorem 4.1 of \cite{MNN} for compact $\mathcal{G}$ remains true for locally compact $\mathcal{G}$.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Lipschitz mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the notion of modulus of continuity at a point of a mapping between metric spaces, we introduce the notion of extensively bounded mappings generalizing that of Lipschitz mappings. We also introduce a metric on it which becomes a norm if the codomain is a normed linear space. We study its basic properties. We also discuss a dilation of an extensively bounded mapping into a Lipschitz mapping as well as into a bounded linear mapping.</description>

      <title>The algebraic numerical range as a spectral set in Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate when the algebraic numerical range is a $C$-spectral set in a Banach algebra. While providing several counterexamples based on classical ideas as well as combinatorial Banach spaces, we discuss positive results for matrix algebras and provide an absolute constant in the case of complex $2\times2$-matrices with the induced $1$-norm. Furthermore, we discuss positive results for infinite-dimensional Banach algebras, including the Calkin algebra.</description>

      <title>Note about non-compact embeddings between Besov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we look at the behavior of embedding between Besov spaces and compare its behavior with Sobolev embeddings, mainly when the embeddings are non-compact. We classify that in the case of the non-compact embedding then, depending on parameters, whether or not the embedding is finitely strictly singular and strictly singular. These results could be considered as a continuation and extension of recent results on non-compact "optimal" Sobolev embeddings.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-modules, $L^p$-correspondences, and their $L^p$-operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an $L^p$-operator algebraic analogue of Hilbert C*-modules. We initiate the theory of concrete $L^p$-modules, their morphisms, and basic constructions such as countable direct sums and tensor products. We then define $L^p$-correspondences together with their Fock representations and the $L^p$-operator algebras generated by these. We present evidence that well-known $L^p$-operator algebras can be constructed from $L^p$-correspondences via covariant Fock representations. In particular, for $p \in (1,\infty)$ and $q$ its H\"older conjugate, we show that the $L^p$-module $(\ell_d^p, \ell_d^q)$ gives rise to an $L^p$-correspondence over $\Bbb{C}$ whose $L^p$-operator algebra is isometrically isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}_d^p$, the $L^p$-analogue of the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_d$ introduced by N.C. Phillips in 2012. As a second example, we fix a nondegenerate $L^p$-operator algebra $A$ with a bicontractive approximate identity together with an isometric automorphism $\varphi_A \in \mathrm{Aut}(A)$. We then show that there is a contractive map from the crossed product $F^p(\Bbb{Z}, A, \varphi_A)$ to the $L^p$-operator algebra generated by the covariant Fock representation of the $L^p$-correspondence $(A, A, \varphi_A)$.</description>

      <title>Extended Divergence-Measure Fields, the Gauss-Green Formula, and Cauchy Fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the Gauss-Green formula for extended divergence-measure fields (i.e., vector-valued measures whose distributional divergences are Radon measures) over open sets. We prove that, for almost every open set, the normal trace is a measure supported on the boundary of the set. Moreover, for any open set, we provide a representation of the normal trace of the field over the boundary of the open set as the limit of measure-valued normal traces over the boundaries of approximating sets. Furthermore, using this theory, we extend the balance law from classical continuum physics to a general framework in which the production on any open set is measured with a Radon measure and the associated Cauchy flux is bounded by a Radon measure concentrated on the boundary of the set. We prove that there exists an extended divergence-measure field such that the Cauchy flux can be recovered through the field, locally on almost every open set and globally on every open set. Our results generalize the classical Cauchy's Theorem (that is only valid for continuous vector fields) and extend the previous formulations of the Cauchy flux (that generate vector fields within $L^{p}$). Thereby, we establish the equivalence between entropy solutions of the multidimensional nonlinear partial differential equations of divergence form and of the mathematical formulation of physical balance laws via the Cauchy flux through the constitutive relations in the axiomatic foundation of Continuum Physics.</description>

      <title>The tempered disk and the tempered cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a non-archimedean valuation ring V (K its fraction field, in mixed characteristic): inspired by some views presented by Scholze, we introduce a new point of view on the non-archimedean analytic setting in terms of derived analytic geometry (then associating a "spectrum" to each ind-Banach algebra). In such a spectrum, for example, there exist open sets having functions with log-growth as sections for the structural sheaf. In this framework, a transfer theorem for the log-growth of solutions of p-adic differential equations can be interpreted as a continuity theorem (analog to the transfer theorem for their radii of convergence). As a dividend of such a theory, one can also introduce a variant of the classical convergent rigid cohomology for a smooth k-scheme, X_k (k residual field of V): the tempered cohomology. In this setting, the rigid analytic tube of radius 1 is replaced by a "tempered one". We finally compare our tempered cohomology with some other classical cohomology theories.</description>

      <title>Bishop-Phelps Type Scalarization for Vector Optimization in Real Topological-Linear Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that scalarization techniques (e.g., in the sense of Gerstewitz; Kasimbeyli; Pascoletti and Serafini; Zaffaroni) are useful for generating (weakly, properly) efficient solutions of vector optimization problems. One recognized approach is the conic scalarization method in vector optimization in real normed spaces proposed by Kasimbeyli (2010, SIAM J Optim 20), which is based on augmented dual cones and Bishop-Phelps type (norm-linear) scalarizing functions. In this paper, we present new results on cone separation in real topological-linear spaces by using Bishop-Phelps type separating cones / separating seminorm-linear functions. Moreover, we study some extensions of known scalarization results in vector optimization (in the sense of Eichfelder; Gerstewitz; Jahn; Kasimbeyli; Pascoletti and Serafini). On this basis, we propose a Bishop-Phelps type scalarization method for vector optimization problems in real topological-linear spaces, which can be seen as an extension of Kasimbeyli's conic scalarization method in real normed spaces. Within this framework, we derive new Bishop-Phelps type scalarization results for the concepts of weak efficiency and different types of proper efficiency.</description>

      <title>Multiresolution analysis on spectra of hermitian matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a multiresolution analysis on the space $\text{Herm}(n)$ of $n\times n$ complex Hermitian matrices which is adapted to invariance under conjugation by the unitary group $U(n).$ The orbits under this action are parametrized by the possible ordered spectra of Hermitian matrices, which constitute a closed Weyl chamber of type $A_{n-1}$ in $\mathbb R^n.$ The space $L^2(\text{Herm}(n))^{U(n)}$ of radial, i.e. $U(n)$-invariant $L^2$-functions on $\text{Herm}(n)$ is naturally identified with a certain weighted $L^2$-space on this chamber.
  The scale spaces of our multiresolution analysis are obtained by usual dyadic dilations as well as generalized translations of a scaling function, where the generalized translation is a hypergroup translation which respects the radial geometry. We provide a concise criterion to characterize orthonormal wavelet bases and show that such bases always exist. They provide natural orthonormal bases of the space $L^2(\text{Herm}(n))^{U(n)}.$
  Furthermore, we show how to obtain radial scaling functions from classical scaling functions on $\mathbb R^{n}$. Finally, generalizations related to the Cartan decompositions for general compact Lie groups are indicated.</description>

      <title>Banach's Indicatrix Reloaded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: S. Banach famously related the smoothness of a function to the size of its level sets. More precisely, he showed that a continuous function is of bounded variation exactly when its "indicatrix" is integrable. In a similar vein, we connect the smoothness of the function -- measured now by its integral modulus of continuity -- to the structure of its \emph{superlevel} sets. Our approach ultimately reduces to a continuum incidence problem for quantifying the regularity of open sets. The pay off is a refinement of Banach's original theorem and an answer to a question of Garsia--Sawyer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a two variable Nevanlinna representation for rational Pick functions can be viewed as the Cauchy transform of a simple undirected graph with variables assigned to the vertices. We give relations between representing functions of certain products of such graphs by way of Schur complements applied to adjacency matrices. We also study the connection between the structure of the graph and the regularity of the representing function at a boundary singularity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we develop a capacities theory connected with the fractional Sobolev spaces with variable exponents. Two kinds of capacities are studied: Sobolev capacity and relative capacity. Basic properties of capacities, including monotonicity, outer capacity and several results, are studies. We prove that both capacities is a Choquet capacity and all borel sets are capacitable.</description>

      <title>Linear topological invariants for kernels of differential operators by shifted fundamental solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the condition $(\Omega)$ for smooth kernels of partial differential operators in terms of the existence of shifted fundamental solutions satisfying certain properties. The conditions $(P\Omega)$ and $(P\overline{\overline{\Omega}})$ for distributional kernels are characterized in a similar way. By lifting theorems for Fr\'echet spaces and (PLS)-spaces, this provides characterizations of the problem of parameter dependence for smooth and distributional solutions of differential equations by shifted fundamental solutions. As an application, we give a new proof of the fact that the space $\{ f \in \mathscr{E}(X) \, | \, P(D)f = 0\}$ satisfies $(\Omega)$ for any differential operator $P(D)$ and any open convex set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$.</description>

      <title>Weak equals strong L2 regularity for partial tangential traces on Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the boundary trace operators that naturally correspond to $\mathrm{H}(\operatorname{curl},\Omega)$, namely the tangential and twisted tangential trace, where $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{3}$. In particular we regard partial tangential traces, i.e., we look only on a subset $\Gamma$ of the boundary $\partial\Omega$. We assume both $\Omega$ and $\Gamma$ to be strongly Lipschitz (possibly unbounded). We define the space of all $\mathrm{H}(\operatorname{curl},\Omega)$ fields that possess a $\mathrm{L}^{2}$ tangential trace in a weak sense and show that the set of all smooth fields is dense in that space, which is a generalization of Belgacem, Bernardi, Costabel and Dauge 1997. This is especially important for Maxwell's equation with mixed boundary condition as we answer the open problem by Weiss and Staffans 2013 (Section 5) for strongly Lipschitz pairs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study H\"ormander type Fourier multiplier theorem and the Nikolskii inequality on quantum tori. On the way to obtain these results, we also prove some classical inequalities such as Paley type, Hausdorff-Young-Paley, Hardy-Littlewood, and Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities on quantum tori. As applications we establish embedding theorems between Sobolev, Besov spaces as well as embeddings between Besov and Wiener and Beurling spaces on quantum tori. We also analyse $\beta$-versions of Wiener and Beurling spaces and their embeddings, and interpolation properties of all these spaces on quantum tori. As an applications of the analysis, we also derive a version of the Nash inequality, and the time decay for solutions of a heat type equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sequence of entropy numbers quantifies the degree of compactness of a linear operator acting between quasi-Banach spaces. We determine the asymptotic behavior of entropy numbers in the case of natural embeddings between finite-dimensional Lorentz spaces $\ell_{p,q}^n$ in all regimes; our results are sharp up to constants. This generalizes classical results obtained by Sch\"utt (in the case of Banach spaces) and Edmunds and Triebel, K\"uhn, as well as Gu\'edon and Litvak (in the case of quasi-Banach spaces) for entropy numbers of identities between finte-dimensional Lebesgue sequence spaces $\ell_p^n$. We employ techniques such as interpolation, volume comparison as well as techniques from sparse approximation and combinatorial arguments. Further, we characterize entropy numbers of embeddings between finite-dimensional symmetric quasi-Banach spaces in terms of best $s$-term approximation numbers.</description>

      <title>Additive mappings preserving orthogonality between complex inner product spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $H$ and $K$ be two complex inner product spaces with dim$(X)\geq 2$. We prove that for each non-zero additive mapping $A:H \to K$ with dense image the following statements are equivalent:
  $(a)$ $A$ is (complex) linear or conjugate-linear mapping and there exists $\gamma &gt;0$ such that $\| A (x) \| = \gamma \|x\|$, for all $x\in X$, that is, $A$ is a positive scalar multiple of a linear or a conjugate-linear isometry;
  $(b)$ There exists $\gamma_1 &gt;0$ such that one of the next properties holds for all $x,y \in H$:
  $(b.1)$ $\langle A(x) |A(y)\rangle = \gamma_1 \langle x|y\rangle,$
  $(b.2)$ $\langle A(x) |A(y)\rangle = \gamma_1 \langle y|x \rangle;$
  $(c)$ $A$ is linear or conjugate-linear and preserves orthogonality in both directions;
  $(d)$ $A$ is linear or conjugate-linear and preserves orthogonality;
  $(e)$ $A$ is additive and preserves orthogonality in both directions;
  $(f)$ $A$ is additive and preserves orthogonality.
  This extends to the complex setting a recent generalization of the Koldobsky--Blanco--Turn\v{s}ek theorem obtained by W\'ojcik for real normed spaces.</description>

Abstract: For every $p &gt; (1 + \sqrt{5})/2$ we construct a uniformly discrete real sequence $\{\lambda_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ ordered by increasing modulus, a function $g \in L^p(\mathbb{R})$, and continuous linear functionals $\{g^*_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ on $L^p(\mathbb{R})$, such that every $f \in L^p(\mathbb{R})$ admits a series expansion \[ f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} g_n^*(f) g(x-\lambda_n) \] convergent in the $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ norm. We also prove a similar result for the space $C_0(\mathbb{R})$, where in this case $\{\lambda_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is taken to be the sequence of positive integers.</description>

This answers a conjecture of Choe et al. about the compact differences $C_{\varphi_1} - C_{\varphi_2}$ on $H^p(\mathbb{D})$, $0&lt;p&lt;\infty$.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds via contour expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are frequently used in many branches of mathematics. Most of the classical results in this area are optimal, in the worst case analysis. However, in modern applications, both the ground and the nose matrices frequently have extra structural properties. For instance, it is often assumed that the ground matrix is essentially low rank, and the nose matrix is random or pseudo-random. We aim to rebuild a part of perturbation theory, adapting to these modern assumptions. We will do this using a contour expansion argument, which enables us to exploit the skewness among the leading eigenvectors of the ground and the noise matrix (which is significant when the two are uncorrelated) to our advantage. In the current paper, we focus on the perturbation of eigenspaces. This helps us to introduce the arguments in the cleanest way, avoiding the more technical consideration of the general case. In applications, this case is also one of the most useful. More general results appear in a subsequent paper. Our method has led to several improvements, which have direct applications in central problems. Among others, we derive a sharp result for perturbation of a low rank matrix with random perturbation, answering an open question in this area. Next, we derive new results concerning the spike model, an important model in statistics, bridging two different directions of current research. Finally, we use our results on the perturbation of eigenspaces to derive new results concerning eigenvalues of deterministic and random matrices. In particular, we obtain new results concerning the outliers in the deformed Wigner model and the least singular value of random matrices with non-zero mean.</description>
