      <description>arXiv:2403.13067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that weakly elliptic damping gives sharp energy decay for the abstract damped wave semigroup, where the damping is not in the functional calculus. In this case, there is no overdamping. We show applications in linearised water waves and Kelvin--Voigt damping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Camassa-Holm equation posed on the periodic domain $\mathbb{T}$. We show that Camassa-Holm equation is globally approximately controllable by three dimensional external force in $H^s(\mathbb{T})$ for $ s &gt; \frac{3}{2}$ . The proof is based on Agrachev-Sarychev approach in geometric control theory.</description>

      <title>Uniform vorticity depletion and inviscid damping for periodic shear flows in the high Reynolds number regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the two dimensional Navier-Stokes equations linearized around a shear flow on a (non-square) torus which possesses exactly two non-degenerate critical points. We obtain linear inviscid damping and vorticity depletion estimates for the linearized flow that are uniform with respect to the viscosity, and enhanced dissipation type decay estimates. The main task is to understand the associated Rayleigh and Orr-Sommerfeld equations, under the natural assumption that the linearized operator around the shear flow in the inviscid case has no discrete eigenvalues. The key difficulty is to understand the behavior of the solution to Orr-Sommerfeld equations in three distinct regimes depending on the spectral parameter: the non-degenerate case when the spectral parameter is away from the critical values, the intermediate case when the spectral parameter is close to but still separated from the critical values, and the most singular case when the spectral parameter is inside the viscous layer.</description>

      <title>Ionized Gas in an Annular Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a plasma that is created by a high voltage difference $\lambda$, which is known as a Townsend discharge. We consider it to be confined to the region $\Omega$ between two concentric spheres, two concentric cylinders, or more generally between two star-shaped surfaces. We first prove that if the plasma is initially relatively dilute, then either it may remain dilute for all time or it may not, depending on a certain parameter $\kappa(\lambda, \Omega)$. Secondly, we prove that there is a connected one-parameter family of steady states. This family connects the non-ionized gas to a plasma, either with a sparking voltage $\lambda^*$ or with very high ionization, at least in the cylindrical or spherical cases.</description>

      <title>Stability for a multi-frequency inverse random source problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present stability estimates for the inverse source problem of the stochastic Helmholtz equation in two and three dimensions by either near-field or far-field data. The random source is assumed to be a microlocally isotropic generalized Gaussian random function. For the direct problem, by exploring the regularity of the Green function, we demonstrate that the direct problem admits a unique bounded solution with an explicit integral representation, which enhances the existing regularity result. For the case using near-field data, the analysis of the inverse problem employs microlocal analysis to achieve an estimate for the Fourier transform of the micro-correlation strength by the near-field correlation data and a high-frequency tail. The stability follows by showing the analyticity of the data and applying a novel analytic continuation principle. The stability estimate by far-field data is derived by investigating the correlation of the far-field data. The stability estimate consists of the Lipschitz type data discrepancy and the logarithmic stability. The latter decreases as the upper bound of the frequency increases, which exhibits the phenomenon of increasing stability.</description>

      <title>Non-preservation of $\alpha$-concavity for the porous medium equation in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we prove that $\alpha$-concavity of the pressure is not preserved for the porous medium equation in dimensions $n=3$ and higher for any $\alpha\in [0,1]\backslash \{\frac{1}{2}\}$. Together with the result of Chau-Weinkove for $n=2$, this fully resolves an open problem posed by V\'asquez on whether pressure concavity is preserved in general for the porous medium equation.</description>

      <title>Singular limit of a chemotaxis model with indirect signal production and phenotype switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convergence of solutions to a partially diffusive chemotaxis system with indirect signal production and  phenotype switching is shown in a two-dimensional setting when the switching rate increases to infinity, thereby providing a rigorous justification of formal computations performed in the literature. The expected limit system being the classical parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel system, the obtained convergence is restricted to a finite time interval for general initial conditions but valid for arbitrary bounded time intervals when the mass of the initial condition is appropriately small. Furthermore, if the solution to the limit system blows up in finite time, then neither of the two phenotypes in the partially diffusive system can be uniformly bounded with respect to the $L_2$-norm beyond that time.</description>

      <title>Phenotypic plasticity trade-offs in an age-structured model of bacterial growth under stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under low concentrations of antibiotics causing DNA damage, \textit{Escherichia coli} bacteria can trigger stochastically a stress response known as the SOS response. While the expression of this stress response can make individual cells transiently able to overcome antibiotic treatment, it can also delay cell division, thus impacting the whole population's ability to grow and survive. In order to study the trade-offs that emerge from this phenomenon, we propose a bi-type age-structured population model that captures the phenotypic plasticity observed in the stress response. Individuals can belong to two types: either a fast-dividing but prone to death ``vulnerable'' type, or a slow-dividing but ``tolerant'' type. We study the survival probability of the population issued from a single cell as well as the population growth rate in constant and periodic environments. We show that the sensitivity of these two different notions of fitness with respect to the parameters describing the phenotypic plasticity differs between the stochastic approach (survival probability) and the deterministic approach (population growth rate). Moreover, under a more realistic configuration of periodic stress, our results indicate that optimal population growth can only be achieved through fine-tuning simultaneously both the induction of the stress response and the repair efficiency of the damage caused by the antibiotic.</description>

      <title>A mathematical foundation for QUMOND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We link the QUMOND theory with the Helmholtz-Weyl decomposition and introduce a new formula for the gradient of the Mondian potential using singular integral operators. This approach allows us to demonstrate that, under very general assumptions on the mass distribution, the Mondian potential is well-defined, once weakly differentiable, with its gradient given through the Helmholtz-Weyl decomposition. Furthermore, we establish that the gradient of the Mondian potential is an $L^p$ vector field. These findings lay the foundation for a rigorous mathematical analysis of various issues within the realm of QUMOND. Given that the Mondian potential satisfies a second-order partial differential equation, the question arises whether it has second-order derivatives. We affirmatively answer this question in the situation of spherical symmetry, although our investigation reveals that the regularity of the second derivatives is weaker than anticipated. We doubt that a similarly general regularity result can be proven without symmetry assumptions. In conclusion, we explore the implications of our results for numerous problems within the domain of QUMOND, thereby underlining their potential significance and applicability.</description>

      <title>The weak Harnack inequality for unbounded minimizers of elliptic functionals with generalized Orlicz growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we prove that the non-negative functions $u \in L^s_{loc}(\Omega)$, for some $s&gt;0$, belonging to the De Giorgi classes
  \begin{equation}\label{eq0.1}
  \fint\limits_{B_{r(1-\sigma)}(x_{0})} \big|\nabla \big(u-k\big)_{-}\big|^{p}\, dx \leqslant \frac{c}{\sigma^{q}} \,\Lambda\big(x_{0}, r, k\big)\bigg(\frac{k}{r}\bigg)^{p}\bigg(\frac{\big|B_{r}(x_{0})\cap\big\{u\leqslant k\big\}\big|}{|B_{r}(x_{0})|}\bigg)^{1-\delta},
  \end{equation}
  under proper assumptions on $\Lambda$, satisfy a weak Harnack inequality with a constant depending on the $L^s$-norm of $u$. Under suitable assumptions on $\Lambda$, the minimizers of elliptic functionals with generalized Orlicz growth belong to De Giorgi classes satisfying \eqref{eq0.1}; thus this study gives a wider interpretation of Harnack-type estimates derived to double-phase, degenerate double-phase functionals and functionals with variable exponents.</description>

      <title>Long-time behavior of an Arc-shaped Vortex Filament and its Application to the Stability of a Circular Vortex Filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear model equation, known as the Localized Induction Equation, describing the motion of a vortex filament immersed in an incompressible and inviscid fluid. We show stability estimates for an arc-shaped vortex filament, which is an exact solution to an initial-boundary value problem for the Localized Induction Equation. An arc-shaped filament travels along an axis at a constant speed without changing its shape, and is oriented in such a way that the arc stays in a plane that is perpendicular to the axis. We prove that an arc-shaped filament is stable in the Lyapunov sense for general perturbations except in the axis-direction, for which the perturbation can grow linearly in time. We also show that this estimate is optimal. We then apply the obtained stability estimates to study the stability of a circular vortex filament under some symmetry assumptions on the initial perturbation. We do this by dividing the circular filament into arcs, apply the stability estimate to each arc-shaped filament, and combine the estimates to obtain estimates for the whole circle. The optimality of the stability estimates for an arc-shaped filament also shows that a circular filament is not stable in the Lyapunov sense, namely, certain perturbations can grow linearly in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, thanks to a new and detailed study of the Green's function of Rayleigh equation near the extrema of the velocity of a shear layer, we obtain optimal bounds on the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to the linearized incompressible Euler equations both in the whole plane, the half plane and the periodic case, and improve the description of the so called "vorticity depletion property" discovered by F. Bouchet and H. Morita by putting into light a localization property of the solutions of Rayleigh equation near an extremal velocity.</description>

      <title>The stability of irrotational shocks and the Landau law of decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the long-time behavior of irrotational solutions of the three-dimensional compressible Euler equations with shocks, hypersurfaces of discontinuity across which the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions for irrotational flow hold. Our analysis is motivated by Landau's analysis of spherically-symmetric shock waves, who predicted that at large times, not just one, but two shocks emerge. These shocks are logarithmically-separated from the Minkowskian light cone and the fluid velocity decays at the non-time-integrable rate 1/(t(\log t)^{1/2}). We show that for initial data, which need not be spherically-symmetric, with two shocks in it and which is sufficiently close, in appropriately weighted Sobolev norms, to an N-wave profile, the solution to the shock-front initial value problem can be continued for all time and does not develop any further singularities. In particular this is the first proof of global existence for solutions (which are necessarily singular) of a quasilinear wave equation in three space dimensions which does not verify the null condition. The proof requires carefully-constructed multiplier estimates and analysis of the geometry of the shock surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the existence and nonexistence of solutions to the steady-state Gierer-Meinhardt system $$ \begin{cases} \displaystyle -\Delta u=\frac{u^p}{v^q}+\lambda \rho(x) \,, u&gt;0 &amp;\quad\mbox{ in }\mathbb{R}^N\setminus K,\\[0.1in] \displaystyle -\Delta v=\frac{u^m}{v^s} \,, v&gt;0 &amp;\quad\mbox{ in }\mathbb{R}^N\setminus K,\\[0.1in] \displaystyle \;\;\; \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial \nu}=0 &amp;\quad\mbox{ on }\partial K,\\[0.1in] \displaystyle \;\;\; u(x), v(x)\to 0 &amp;\quad\mbox{ as }|x|\to \infty, \end{cases} $$ where $K\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ $(N\geq 2)$ is a compact set, $\rho\in C^{0,\gamma}_{loc}(\overline{\mathbb{R}^N\setminus K})$, $\gamma\in (0,1)$, is a nonnegative function and $p,q,m,s, \lambda&gt;0$. Combining fixed point arguments with suitable barrier functions, we construct solutions with a prescribed asymptotic growth at infinity. Our approach can be extended to many other classes of semilinear elliptic systems with various sign of exponents.</description>

      <title>A scaling law for a model of epitaxially strained elastic films with dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A static variational model for shape formation in heteroepitaxial crystal growth is considered. The energy functional takes into account surface energy, elastic misfit-energy and nucleation energy of dislocations. A scaling law for the infimal energy is proven. The results quantify the expectation that in certain parameter regimes, island formation or topological defects are favorable. This generalizes results in the purely elastic setting from [Goldman and Zwicknagl (2014)]. To handle dislocations in the lower bound, a new variant of a ball-construction combined with thorough local estimates is presented.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the optimal regularity that is exactly propagated by a transport equation driven by a velocity field with BMO gradient. As an application, we study the 2D Euler equations in case the initial vorticity is bounded. The sharpness of our result for the Euler equations follows from a variation of Bahouri and Chemin's vortex patch example.</description>

      <title>Sharp local propagation of chaos for mean field particles with $W^{-1,\infty}$ kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two methods to obtain $O(1/N^2)$ local propagation of chaos bounds for $N$ diffusive particles in $W^{-1,\infty}$ mean field interaction. This extends the recent finding of Lacker [Probab. Math. Phys., 4(2):377-432, 2023] to the case of singular interactions. The first method is based on a hierarchy of relative entropies and Fisher informations, and applies to the 2D viscous vortex model in the high temperature regime. In the second method, we work on a hierarchy of $L^2$ distances and Dirichlet energies, and derive the desired sharp estimates for the same model in short time without restrictions on the temperature.</description>

Abstract: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is the development of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix, caused by a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Although in most of the cases it is resolved by the immune system, a small percentage of people might develop a more serious CIN which, if left untreated, can develop into cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women globally, for which the World Health Organization (WHO) recently adopted the Global Strategy for cervical cancer elimination by 2030. With this research topic being more imperative than ever, in this paper, we develop a nonlinear mathematical model describing the CIN progression. The model consists of partial differential equations describing the dynamics of epithelial, dysplastic and immune cells, as well as the dynamics of viral particles. We use our model to explore numerically three important factors of dysplasia progression, namely the geometry of the cervix, the strength of the immune response and the frequency of viral exposure.</description>

      <title>The defect, the Malgrange functor, and linear control systems</title>

Abstract: The notion of defect of a finitely presented functor on a module category is extended to arbitrary additive functors. The new defect and the contravariant Yoneda embedding form a right adjoint pair. The main result identifies the defect of the covariant Hom modulo projectives with the Bass torsion of the fixed argument. When applied to a linear control systems, it shows that the defect of the Malgrange functor of the system modulo projectives is isomorphic to the autonomy of the system. Furthermore, the defect of the contravariant Hom modulo injectives is shown to be isomorphic to the cotorsion coradical of the fixed argument. Since the Auslander-Gruson-Jensen transform of cotorsion is isomorphic to torsion, the above results raise two important questions: a) what is a control-theoretic interpretation of the covariant Yoneda embedding of the Malgrange module modulo injectives, and b) what is a control-theoretic interpretation of the Auslander-Gruson-Jensen duality?</description>

      <title>Improved $L^\infty$ bounds for eigenfunctions under random perturbations in negative curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been known since the work of Avakumov\'ic, H\"ormander and Levitan that, on any compact smooth Riemannian manifold, if $-\Delta_g \psi_\lambda = \lambda \psi_\lambda$, then $\|\psi_\lambda\|_{L^\infty} \leq C \lambda^{\frac{d-1}{4}} \|\psi_\lambda\|_{L^2}$. It is believed that, on manifolds of negative curvature, such a bound can be largely improved; however, only logarithmic improvements in $\lambda$ have been obtained so far. In the present paper, we obtain polynomial improvements over the previous bound in a generic setting, by adding a small random pseudodifferential perturbation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.00730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present study, Kolmogorov flow represents the stationary sinusoidal solution $(\sin y,0)$ to a two-dimensional spatially periodic Navier-Stokes system, driven by an external force. This system admits the additional non-stationary solution $(\sin y,0)+e^{-\nu t} (\sin y,0)$, which tends exponentially to the Kolmogorov flow at the minimum decay rate determined by the viscosity $\nu$. Enhanced damping or enhanced dissipation of the problem is obtained by presenting higher decay rate for the difference between a solution and the non-stationary basic solution. Moreover, for the understanding of the metastability problem in an explicit manner, a variety of exact solutions are presented to show enhanced and unenhanced dampings.</description>

      <title>Self-similar finite-time blowups with smooth profiles of the generalized Constantin-Lax-Majda model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05895v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the $a$-parameterized family of the generalized Constantin-Lax-Majda model, also known as the Okamoto-Sakajo-Wunsch model, admits exact self-similar finite-time blowup solutions with interiorly smooth profiles for all $a\leq 1$. Depending on the value of $a$, these self-similar profiles are either smooth on the whole real line or compactly supported and smooth in the interior of their closed supports. The existence of these profiles is proved in a consistent way by considering the fixed-point problem of an $a$-dependent nonlinear map, based on which detailed characterizations of their regularity, monotonicity, and far-field decay rates are established. Our work unifies existing results for some discrete values of $a$ and also explains previous numerical observations for a wide range of $a$.</description>

      <title>Discrete-to-continuum limits of interacting particle systems in one dimension with collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of interacting particle systems in which $n$ signed particles move on the real line. At close range particles with the same sign repel and particles with opposite sign attract each other. The repulsion and attraction are described by the same singular interaction force $f$. Particles of opposite sign may collide in finite time. Upon collision, pairs of colliding particles are removed from the system.
  In a recent paper by Peletier, Po\v{z}\'ar and the author, one particular particle system of this type was studied; that in which $f(x) = \frac1x$ is the Coulomb force. Global well-posedness of this particle system was shown and a discrete-to-continuum limit (i.e. $n \to \infty$) to a nonlocal PDE for the signed particle density was established. Both results rely on innovative use of techniques in ODE theory and viscosity solutions.
  In the present paper we extend these results to a large class of particle systems in order to cover many new applications. Motivated by these applications, we consider the presence of an external force $g$, consider interaction forces $f$ with a large range of singularities and allow $f$ to scale with $n$. To handle this class of $f$ we develop several new proof techniques in addition to those used for the Coulomb force.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long time Schr\"odinger evolution of Lagrangian states $f_h$ on a compact Riemannian manifold $(X,g)$ of negative sectional curvature. We consider two models of semiclassical random Schr\"odinger operators $P_h^\alpha=-h^2\Delta_g +h^\alpha Q_\omega$, $0&lt;\alpha\leq 1$, where the semiclassical Laplace-Beltrami operator $-h^2\Delta_g$ on $X$ is subject to a small random perturbation $h^\alpha Q_\omega$ given by either a random potential or a random pseudo-differential operator. Here, the potential or the symbol of $Q_\omega$ is bounded, but oscillates and decorrelates at scale $h^{\beta}$, $0&lt; \beta &lt; \frac{1}{2}$. We prove a quantitative result that, under appropriate conditions on $\alpha,\beta$, in probability with respect to $\omega$ the long time propagation $$\mathrm{e}^{\frac{i}{h}t_h P_h^\alpha } f_h, \quad o(|\log h|)=t_h\to\infty, ~~h\to 0,$$ rescaled to the local scale of $h$ around a uniformly at random chosen point $x_0$ on $X$, converges in law to an isotropic stationary monochromatic Gaussian field -- the Berry Gaussian field. We also provide and $\omega$-almost sure version of this convergence along sufficiently fast decaying subsequences $h_j\to 0$.</description>

Abstract: The elastic energy of a bending-resistant interface depends both on its geometry and its material composition. We consider such a heterogeneous interface in the plane, modeled by a curve equipped with an additional density function. The resulting energy captures the complex interplay between curvature and density effects, resembling the Canham-Helfrich functional. We describe the curve by its inclination angle, so that the equilibrium equations reduce to an elliptic system of second order. After a brief variational discussion, we investigate the associated nonlocal $L^2$-gradient flow evolution, a coupled quasilinear parabolic problem. We analyze the (non)preservation of quantities such as convexity, positivity, and symmetry, as well as the asymptotic behavior of the system. The results are illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Generalized impedance boundary conditions with vanishing or sign-changing impedance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Laplace type problem with a generalized impedance boundary condition of the form $\partial_\nu u=-\partial_x(g\partial_xu)$ on a flat part $\Gamma$ of the boundary. Here $\nu$ is the outward unit normal vector to $\partial\Omega$, $g$ is the impedance function and $x$ is the coordinate along $\Gamma$. Such problems appear for example in the modelling of small perturbations of the boundary. In the literature, the cases $g=1$ or $g=-1$ have been investigated. In this work, we address situations where $\Gamma$ contains the origin and $g(x)=\mathbb{1}_{x&gt;0}(x)x^\alpha$ or $g(x)=-\mbox{sign}(x)|x|^\alpha$ with $\alpha\ge0$. In other words, we study cases where $g$ vanishes at the origin and changes its sign. The main message is that the well-posedness in the Fredholm sense of the corresponding problems depends on the value of $\alpha$. For $\alpha\in[0,1)$, we show that the associated operators are Fredholm of index zero while it is not the case when $\alpha=1$. The proof of the first results is based on the reformulation as 1D problems combined with the derivation of compact embedding results for the functional spaces involved in the analysis. The proof of the second results relies on the computation of singularities and the construction of Weyl's sequences. We also discuss the equivalence between the strong and weak formulations, which is not straightforward. Finally, we provide simple numerical experiments which seem to corroborate the theorems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents some controllability and stabilization results for a system of two coupled linear Schr\"odinger equations in the one-dimensional case where the state components are interacting through the Kirchhoff boundary conditions. Considering the system in a bounded domain, the null boundary controllability result is shown. The result is achieved thanks to a new Carleman estimate, which ensures a boundary observation. Additionally, this boundary observation together with some trace estimates, helps us to use the Gramian approach, with a suitable choice of feedback law, to prove that the system under consideration decays exponentially to zero at least as fast as the function $e^{-2\omega t}$ for some $\omega&gt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When ions are crowded, the effect of steric repulsion between ions (which can produce oscillations in charge density profiles) becomes significant and the conventional Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation should be modified. Several modified PB equations were developed but the associated total ionic charge density has no oscillation. This motivates us to derive a general model of PB equations called the PB-steric equations with a parameter $\Lambda$, which not only include the conventional and modified PB equations but also have oscillatory total ionic charge density under different assumptions of steric effects and chemical potentials. As $\Lambda=0$, the PB-steric equation becomes the conventional PB equation, but as $\Lambda&gt;0$, the concentrations of ions and solvent molecules are determined by the Lambert type functions. To approach the modified PB equations, we study the asymptotic limit of PB-steric equations with the Robin boundary condition as $\Lambda$ goes to infinity. Our theoretical results show that the PB-steric equations (for $0\leq\Lambda\leq\infty$) may include the conventional and modified PB equations. On the other hand, we use the PB-steric equations to find oscillatory total ionic charge density which cannot be obtained in the conventional and modified PB equations.</description>

Exploiting the moving sphere method, it has been shown, when $p=2$, positive solutions of Euler-Lagrange equation of Sobolev trace inequality are classified. Since the moving sphere method strongly relies on the symmetries of the equation, in this paper we use asymptotic estimates and two important integral identities to classify positive solutions of Euler-Langrange equation of Sobolev trace inequality under finite energy when $1&lt;p&lt;n$.</description>

Abstract: We address the long-time behavior of the 2D Boussinesq system, which consists of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations driven by a non-diffusive density. We construct globally persistent solutions on a smooth bounded domain, when the initial data belongs to $(H^k\cap V)\times H^k$ for $k\in\mathbb{N}$ and $H^s\times H^s$ for $0&lt;s&lt;2$. The proofs use parabolic maximal regularity and specific compatibility conditions at the initial time. Additionally, we also deduce various asymptotic properties of the velocity and density in the long-time limit and present a necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence to a steady state.</description>

Abstract: On the two-sphere $\Sigma$, we consider the problem of minimising among suitable immersions $f \,\colon \Sigma \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ the weighted $L^\infty$ norm of the mean curvature $H$, with weighting given by a prescribed ambient function $\xi$, subject to a fixed surface area constraint. We show that, under a low-energy assumption which prevents topological issues from arising, solutions of this problem and also a more general set of ``pseudo-minimiser'' surfaces must satisfy a second-order PDE system obtained as the limit as $p \rightarrow \infty$ of the Euler-Lagrange equations for the approximating $L^p$ problems. This system gives some information about the geometric behaviour of the surfaces, and in particular implies that their mean curvature takes on at most three values: $H \in \{ \pm \vert \vert \xi H \vert \vert_{L^\infty} \}$ away from the nodal set of the PDE system, and $H = 0$ on the nodal set (if it is non-empty).</description>

Abstract: We solve the geodesic equation in the space of K\"ahler metrics under the setting of asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) K\"ahler manifolds and we prove global $\mathcal{C}^{1,1}$ regularity of the solution. Then, we relate the solution of the geodesic equation to the uniqueness of scalar-flat ALE metrics. To this end, we study the asymptotic behavior of $\varepsilon$-geodesics at spatial infinity. Under the assumption that the Ricci curvature of a reference ALE K\"ahler metric is non-positive, convexity of the Mabuchi $K$-energy along $\varepsilon$-geodesics. However, we will also prove that on the line bundle $\mathcal{O}(-k)$ over $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ with $n \geq 2$ and $k \neq n$, no ALE K\"ahler metric can have non-positive (or non-negative) Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>The functional volume product under heat flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the functional volume product for even functions is monotone increasing along the Fokker--Planck heat flow. This in particular yields a new proof of the functional Blaschke--Santal\'{o} inequality by K. Ball and also Artstein-Avidan--Klartag--Milman in the even case.
  This result is the consequence of a new understanding of the regularizing property of the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck semigroup. That is, we establish an improvement of Borell's reverse hypercontractivity inequality for even functions and identify the sharp range of the admissible exponents. As another consequence of successfully identifying the sharp range for the inequality, we derive the sharp $L^p$-$L^q$ inequality for the Laplace transform for even functions. The best constant of the inequality is attained by centered Gaussians, and thus this provides an analogous result to Beckner's sharp Hausdorff--Young inequality.
  Our technical novelty in the proof is the use of the Brascamp--Lieb inequality for log-concave measures and Cram\'{e}r--Rao's inequality in this context.</description>
