      <title>Electrodynamic forces driving DNA-protein interactions at large distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we address the general problem of selective electrodynamic interactions between DNA and protein, which is motivated by decades of theoretical study and our very recent experimental findings (M. Lechelon et al, \textit{Sci Adv} \textbf{8,} eabl5855 (2022)). Inspired by the Davydov and Holstein-Fr\"{o}hlich models describing electron motion along biomolecules, and using a model Hamiltonian written in second quantization, the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) is used to derive the dynamical equations of the system. We demonstrate the efficacy of this {second-quantized} model for a well-documented biochemical system consisting of a restriction enzyme, \textit{Eco}RI, which binds selectively to a palindromic six-base-pair target within a DNA oligonucleotide sequence to catalyze a DNA double-strand cleavage. The time-domain Fourier spectra of the electron currents numerically computed for the DNA fragment and for the \textit{Eco}RI enzyme, respectively, exhibit a cross-correlation spectrum with a sharp co-resonance peak. When the target DNA recognition sequence is randomized, this sharp co-resonance peak is replaced with a broad and noisy spectrum. Such a sequence-dependent charge transfer phenomenology is suggestive of a potentially rich variety of selective electrodynamic interactions influencing the coordinated activity of DNA substrates, enzymes, transcription factors, ligands, and other proteins under realistic biochemical conditions characterized by electron-phonon excitations.</description>

      <title>Does the random nature of cell-virus interactions during in vitro infections affect TCID$_{50}$ measurements and parameter estimation by mathematical models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Endpoint dilution (TCID50) assays cannot count the number of infectious virions (IVs), and instead are limited to counting the number of Specific INfections caused by the sample (SIN). The latter depends not only on whether virions are infectious, but also on the cells and the experimental conditions under which they interact. These interactions are random and controlled by parameters such as the rates at which IVs lose infectivity, enter cells, or fail to replicate following cell entry. Here, stochastic TCID50 assays are simulated to determine how the random number of infected wells relates to the parameters and the number of IVs in a sample. We introduce a new parameter estimation method based on the likelihood of observing a given TCID50 assay outcome given the model-predicted number of IVs in the sample. We then successively evaluate how parameter estimates are affected by the use of: 1) the new likelihood function vs the typical assumption of Gaussian-distributed measurement errors; 2) IV vs SIN units to express virus in the model; and 3) a stochastic vs an ODE model to simulate the course of a virus infection. Unlike previous methods, the new likelihood correctly handles measurements beyond the detection limits, and results in non-Gaussian distributions. Expressing virus using IV units makes it possible to impose physical constraints (e.g. one IV cannot infect more than one cell), and yields more biologically useful parameters (e.g. mutation emergence likelihood depends on the number of IVs, not SIN, produced). Using a stochastic rather than an ODE model we show that the variability observed between replicate in vitro virus infections is consistent with the level of stochasticity introduced by the TCID50 assay, which can be reduced through better assay design. The framework introduced herein offers several important improvements over current methods and should be widely adopted.</description>

      <title>Interplay of damage and repair in the control of epithelial tissue integrity in response to cyclic loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epithelial tissues are continuously exposed to cyclic stretch. Physiological stretching has been found to regulate soft tissue function at the molecular, cellular, and tissue scales, allowing tissues to preserve their homeostasis and adapt to challenges. In contrast, dysregulated or pathological stretching can induce damage and tissue fragilisation. Many mechanisms have been described for the repair of epithelial tissues across a range of time-scales. In this review, we present the timescales of (i) physiological cyclic loading regimes, (ii) strain-regulated remodelling and damage accumulation, and (iii) repair mechanisms in epithelial tissues. We discuss how fatigue in biological tissues differs from synthetic materials, in that damage can be partially or fully reversed by repair mechanisms acting on timescales shorter than cyclic loading. We highlight that timescales are critical to understanding the interplay between damage and repair in tissues that experience cyclic loading, opening up new avenues for exploring soft tissue homeostasis.</description>

      <title>High-power pulsed electrochemiluminescence for optogenetic manipulation of Drosophila larval behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) produces light through electrochemical reactions and has shown promise for various analytic applications in biomedicine. However, the use of ECL devices (ECLDs) as light sources has been limited due to insufficient light output and low operational stability. In this study, we present a high-power pulsed operation strategy for ECLDs to address these limitations and demonstrate their effectiveness in optogenetic manipulation. By applying a biphasic voltage sequence with short opposing phases, we achieve intense and efficient ECL through an exciplex-formation reaction pathway. This approach results in an exceptionally high optical power density, exceeding 100 microW/mm2, for several thousand pulses. Balancing the ion concentration by optimizing the voltage waveform further improves device stability. By incorporating multiple optimized pulses into a burst signal separated by short rest periods, extended light pulses of high brightness and with minimal power loss over time were obtained. These strategies were leveraged to elicit a robust optogenetic response in fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) larvae expressing the optogenetic effector CsChrimson. The semi-transparent nature of ECLDs facilitates simultaneous imaging of larval behaviour from underneath, through the device. These findings highlight the potential of ECLDs as versatile optical tools in biomedical and neurophotonics research.</description>
