      <title>Phase transitions for polyadic epidemic and voter models with multiscale groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polyadic (or higher-order) interactions can significantly impact the dynamics of interacting particle systems. However, so far, the group size interactions have been relatively small. In this work, we examine the influence of multiscale polyadic group interactions, where some groups are small and others very large. We consider two paradigmatic examples, an SIS-epidemic and the adaptive voter model. On the level of the mean field, we specifically discuss the impact of the multiscale polyadic interactions on equilibrium dynamics and phase transitions. For the SIS-epidemic model, we find a region of bistability that protects the disease-free state over a wide range beyond the classical epidemic threshold from a significant outbreak. For the adaptive voter model, we show that multiscale polyadic interactions can stabilize the network or increase the convergence rate to an unbiased equilibrium.</description>

      <title>A spatial hypergraph model where epidemic spread demonstrates clear higher-order effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a spatial hypergraph model that allows us to vary the amount of higher-order structure in the generated hypergraph. Specifically, we can vary from a model that is a pure pairwise graph into a model that is almost a pure hypergraph. We use this spatial hypergraph model to study higher-order effects in epidemic spread. We use a susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) epidemic model designed to mimic the spread of an airborne pathogen. We study three types of airborne effects that emulate airborne dilution effects. For the scenario of linear dilution, which roughly correspond to constant ventilation per person as required in many building codes, we see essentially no impact from introducing small hyperedges up to size 15 whereas we do see effects when the hyperedge set is dominated by large hyperedges. Specifically, we track the mean infections after the SIRS epidemic has run for awhile so it is in a "steady state" and find the mean is higher in the large hyperedge regime wheras it is unchanged from pairwise to small hyperedge regime.</description>

      <title>Online landmark replacement for out-of-sample dimensionality reduction methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A strategy to assist visualization and analysis of large and complex data sets is dimensionality reduction, with which one maps each data point into a low-dimensional manifold. However, various dimensionality reduction techniques are computationally infeasible for large data. Out-of-sample techniques aim to resolve this difficulty; they only apply the dimensionality reduction technique on a small portion of data, referred to as landmarks, and determine the embedding coordinates of the other points using landmarks as references. Out-of-sample techniques have been applied to online settings, or when data arrive as time series. However, existing online out-of-sample techniques use either all the previous data points as landmarks or the fixed set of landmarks and therefore are potentially not good at capturing the geometry of the entire data set when the time series is non-stationary. To address this problem, we propose an online landmark replacement algorithm for out-of-sample techniques using geometric graphs and the minimal dominating set on them. We mathematically analyze some properties of the proposed algorithm, particularly focusing on the case of landmark multidimensional scaling as the out-of-sample technique, and test its performance on synthetic and empirical time series data.</description>
