      <title>Hydrogen trapping in sub-stoichiometric niobium and vanadium carbide precipitates in high-strength steels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High strength steels (HSS) are widely used in aerospace industries but they can be susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement (HE), a phenomenon that with the ingress of a small amount of hydrogen, the materials can experience a ductile to brittle transition. Secondary carbide precipitates play a crucial role in reducing HE in steels by providing strong hydrogen traps, reducing diffusible hydrogen atoms that are detrimental to the steel ductility. Among the secondary carbide precipitates, sub-stoichiometric vanadium and niobium carbides contain high concentrations of carbon vacancies, which serve as robust hydrogen traps that greatly reduced diffusible hydrogen atoms, beneficial for the HE resistivity. This study investigated hydrogen trapping energies in VCx and NbCx and revealed that sub-stoichiometry plays a role in hydrogen trapping ability. Further examination of hydrogen trapping in vacancies revealed the charge density at vacancy can affect the bonding between hydrogen and neighboring V/Nb atoms. Additionally, the vacancy configurations in VCx and NbCx with varying x plays a role in hydrogen diffusional barriers inside them. Carbides with more vacancies possess reduced hydrogen diffusional barriers within them. In conclusion, the vacancies in certain carbide compounds can enhance both the trapping energy and possibly trapping capacity of hydrogen atoms, ultimately reducing the susceptibility of HSS to HE.</description>

      <title>Crystal structure, magnetic properties and magnetocaloric performance of RE$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$ (RE = Gd-Tm) compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycrystalline samples of the RE$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$ (RE = Gd--Tm) intermetallics have been investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) as well as by DC and AC magnetometric measurements. The XRD data confirm that the compounds crystallize with the orthorhombic Lu$_{5}$Ni$_2$In$_4$-type structure (space group Pbam, No. 55). With decreasing temperature, RE$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$ spontaneously order magnetically with the critical temperatures of magnetic order equal to 10.6, 14.2, 15.4, 7.2, 5.9 and 4.9 K for RE = Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er and Tm, respectively. The compounds have complex magnetic properties, showing features characteristic of both ferro- and antiferromagnetic orderings. Moreover, the magnetic properties change with increasing number of the 4f electrons from predominantly ferromagnetic in Gd$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$ to predominantly antiferromagnetic in Tm$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$. The magnetic data indicate that only the rare earth atoms carry magnetic moments. The maximum magnetic entropy change ($-\Delta S_{M}^{max}$) at the 0-9 T magnetic flux density change ($\Delta \mu_0 H$) equals 12.4 J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$ at 17 K for Gd$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$, 11.3 J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$ at 28 K for Tb$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$, 13.1 J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$ at 19 K for Dy$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$, 16.4 J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$ at 12 K for Ho$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$, 15.3 J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$ at 8 K for Er$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$ and 12.6 J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$ at 6.5 K for Tm$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$. For a selected rare earth element (RE), the member of the RE$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$ family of compounds reaches the highest $-\Delta S_{M}^{max}$ value, when compared with its RE$_{5}$T$_2$In$_4$ (T = Ni, Pd, Pt) isostructural analogues, making the RE$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$ intermetallics a good choice for application in low-temperature magnetic refrigeration.</description>

      <title>Structural and Bonding Insights into B$_8$Cu$_3^-$ Clusters: A DFT Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the structural and electronic properties B$_8$Cu$_3^-$ clusters -- boron-based frameworks doped with three copper atoms. The results indicate that the lowest-energy structure features a vertical Cu$_3$ triangle supported on a B$_8$ wheel geometry, whereas the horizontally supported configuration is 3.0 (5.6) kcal/mol higher in energy at the PBE0 ($\omega$B97X) functional. Electron localization function (ELF) and Mulliken population analyses reveal that the most stable isomer exhibits strong Cu-B interactions and significant electron delocalization, which contribute to its enhanced stability. Localized orbital locator (LOL) maps further support this finding by showing pronounced electron localization around the Cu$_3$ unit in the more stable structure. These insights highlight the possible role of Cu-centered multicenter bonding in stabilizing boron-based nanoclusters.</description>

      <title>Perpendicularly magnetized Tb/Co multilayers featuring tilted uniaxial anisotropy: Experiments and modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare earth/transition metal (RE/TM) multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are key ingredients for the development of spintronic applications. Their compensation temperature depends on the ratio of the thicknesses of rare earth and transition metal, allowing their magnetic properties to be tuned with temperature while maintaining their anisotropy even in nanometer-scale devices. In this work, we performed a thorough structural characterization and systematically investigate the magnetic properties of a whole family of ferrimagnetic [Tb/Co]$_{\times 5}$ multilayers varying the Tb thickness in the range of 0.4 nm - 1.25 nm. A linear dependence of the compensation temperature on the Tb layer thickness was observed. Moreover, a uniaxial anisotropy constant of 330$\pm$30 kJ/m$^3$, which is close to the values reported by other authors, was estimated. Additionally, we proposed a model to gain a better understanding of the angular dependence of the magnetization loops and the linear dependence of the compensation temperature. We present strong evidence demonstrating that the perpendicular anisotropy must be tilted away from the perpendicular axis in order to explain the observed features, particularly the hysteresis in the in-plane loops. Our work advances the understanding of DC magnetic properties in thin RE/TM ferrimagnetic films, which has the potential to impact different fields where these materials are involved.</description>

      <title>Two-Terminal Electrical Detection of the N\'eel Vector via Longitudinal Antiferromagnetic Nonreciprocal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a robust two-terminal electrical readout scheme for detecting the N\'eel vector orientation in antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials by leveraging longitudinal nonreciprocal transport driven by quantum metric dipoles. Unlike conventional readout mechanisms, our approach does not require spin-polarized electrodes, tunneling junctions, or multi-terminal geometries, offering a universal and scalable solution for AFM spintronics. As examples, we demonstrate pronounced second-order longitudinal nonlinear conductivity (LNC) in two-dimensional (2D) MnS and 3D CuMnAs, both of which exhibit clear sign reversal of LNC under 180$^\circ$ N\'eel vector reorientation. We show that this LNC is predominantly governed by the intrinsic, relaxation-time-independent quantum metric mechanism rather than the extrinsic nonlinear Drude effect. Our findings provide a practical and material-general pathway for electrically reading AFM memory states, with promising implications for next-generation AFM spintronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Multicrossmodal Automated Agent for Integrating Diverse Materials Science Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a multicrossmodal LLM-agent framework motivated by the growing volume and diversity of materials-science data ranging from high-resolution microscopy and dynamic simulation videos to tabular experiment logs and sprawling literature archives. While recent AI efforts have accelerated individual tasks such as property prediction or image classification, they typically treat each modality in isolation, leaving rich cross-modal correlations unexplored and forcing researchers to perform laborious manual integration. Moreover, existing multimodal foundation models often require expensive retraining or fine-tuning on domain data, and current multi-agent systems in materials informatics address only narrow subtasks. To overcome these obstacles, we design a coordinated team of specialized LLM agents, each equipped with domain-adapted prompts and plugins that project their outputs into a shared embedding space. A dynamic gating mechanism then weights and merges these insights, enabling unified reasoning over heterogeneous inputs without ever modifying the underlying LLM weights. We validate our approach on challenging case studies and demonstrate substantial gains in retrieval accuracy (85%), captioning fidelity, and integrated coverage (35%) compared to single-modality and zero-shot baselines. Our work paves the way for AI digital researchers capable of bridging data silos and accelerating the materials-discovery cycle.

      <title>Bridging Two Dimensions: Luminescent Sensors at the Intersection of Temperature and Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminescence thermometry and manometry are exponentially growing areas dealing with the optical detection of temperature and pressure, respectively, being appealing alternatives for conventional thermometers and manometers. The main benefit of luminescent thermometers and manometers is a possibility of remote temperature and/or pressure monitoring, in contrast to conventional gauges. Moreover, the use of luminescent nanoparticles as temperature/pressure sensors allow detection in micron- and nano-sized areas, previously inaccessible for conventional gauges. Therefore, the combination of both functionalities in a single material is highly appealing, as has been shown in a growing number of reports in the last years. Moreover, the bifunctional pressure and temperature sensors, operating with multiple independent spectroscopic parameters, allow simultaneous and distinct pressure and temperature readouts. However, the development of such truly bifunctional and reliable sensors is very challenging and rarely reported. This review summarizes the current status in the field, focusing on the sensing strategy and the selection of optically active sensor materials appropriate for a given application, including their sensitivity, spectral range of interest and pressure/temperature (in)dependence.</description>

      <title>Bonding relay for room-temperature oxide plasticity like metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxides have long been regarded as intrinsically brittle due to their strong, directional ionic or covalent bonds, in stark contrast to the ductile behavior of metals, where delocalized electron sharing enables plasticity through facile dislocation glide. Here, we challenge this paradigm by demonstrating that typical oxides, such as SrTiO3 and MgO, can exhibit room-temperature plasticity with pronounced crystallographic anisotropy. Through an integrated approach combining ab initio calculations, large scale molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental nanoindentation, we identify a universal structural criterion enabling room-temperature oxide plasticity: the presence of alternating positively and negatively charged atomic layers along specific slip directions, specifically the (1-10)[110] orientation in perovskite and rocksalt oxides. This charge alternating configuration enables a bonding relay mechanism, in which sequential bond breaking and reformation across the slip plane accompanied by interlayer persistent bonds mimics multi centered interactions in metals, thereby facilitating dislocation motion without catastrophic failure. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized pathway to achieving metal-like plasticity in oxides and establish a structural design principle for engineering flexible and mechanically resilient oxide materials.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Martensite and Austenite Phases and Realization of Two-way Martensitic Transition in Co-Ni-Ga Ferromagnetic Shape Memory Alloy Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three sets of Co-Ni-Ga alloy nanoparticles have been synthesized by a template-free chemical route. Structural, morphological, shape memory, and magnetic properties of room temperature martensite (M) phase, dual (M + secondary $\gamma$) phase and austenite (A) phase Co-Ni-Ga nanoparticles are reported. Temperature-dependent XRD analysis revealed that $Co_{36}Ni_{36}Ga_{28}$ nanoparticles exhibiting a single M phase at room temperature, completely transform to A phase at $\sim1000$ K. Upon cooling to room temperature, the A phase transforms back to single M phase, confirming the two-way martensitic transition in Co-Ni-Ga nanoparticles. Structural analysis shows that the $\gamma$-phase does not influence the martensitic transition of bi-phasic (M + $\gamma$) $Co_{41}Ni_{34}Ga_{25}$ nanoparticles. These nanoparticles display saturation magnetization ranging from 2.9 emu/g to 15.3 emu/g at room temperature. The $\gamma$ phase could be introduced in A phase $Co_{44}Ni_{26}Ga_{30}$ nanoparticles when heated up to 1073 K. Curie temperatures of A and M phases are higher than the martensitic transition temperatures in all the samples, qualifying them as ferromagnetic shape memory alloy nanoparticles. Observation of M $\leftrightarrow$ A phase transition, Co-Ni-Ga nanoparticles with tunable magnetic properties make them excellent candidates for low and high temperature nanoactuators and other ferromagnetic shape memory applications.</description>

      <title>Observation of Body-Centered Cubic Iron above 200 Gigapascals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystallographic structure of iron under extreme conditions is a key benchmark for cutting-edge experimental and numerical methods. Moreover, it plays a crucial role in understanding planetary cores, as it significantly influences the interpretation of observational data and, consequently, insights into their internal structure and dynamics. However, even the structure of pure solid iron under the Earth's core conditions remains uncertain, with the commonly expected hexagonal close-packed structure energetically competitive with various cubic lattices. In this study, iron was compressed in a diamond anvil cell to above 200 GPa, and dynamically probed near the melting point using MHz frequency X-ray pulses from the European X-ray Free Electron Laser. The emergence of an additional diffraction line at high temperatures suggests the formation of an entropically stabilized bcc structure. Rapid heating and cooling cycles captured intermediate phases, offering new insights into iron's phase transformation paths. The appearance of the bcc phase near melting at extreme pressures challenges current understanding of the iron phase diagram under Earth's core conditions.</description>

      <title>Chemical design of monolayer altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystal-symmetry-paired spin-momentum locking (CSML) arisen from the intrinsic crystal symmetry connecting different magnetic sublattices in altermagnets enables many exotic spintronics properties such as unconventional piezomagnetism and noncollinear spin current. However, the shortage of monolayer altermagnets restricts further exploration of dimensionally confined phenomena and applications of nanostructured devices. Here, we propose general chemical design principles inspired by sublattice symmetry of layered altermagnet V$_2$(Se,Te)$_2$O through symmetry-preserving structural modification and valence-adaptive chemical substitutions. In total, we construct 2600 candidates across four structural frameworks, M$_2$A$_2$B$_{1,0}$ and their Janus derivatives. High-throughput calculations identify 670 potential altermagnets with N\'eel-ordered ground states, among which 91 ones exhibiting CSML Dirac cones that enable spin-polarized ultra-fast transport. These materials also feature different ground-state magnetic orderings and demonstrate diverse electronic behaviors, ranging from semiconductors, metals, half-metals, to Dirac semimetals. This work not only reveals abundant monolayer altermagnets, but also establishes a rational principle for their design, opening gates for exploration of confined magnetism and spintronics in atomically thin systems.</description>

      <title>Eu-doped CsSrCl$_3$ Large Nanocrystal Clusters with Self-Reduction Effect and Near-Unity Quantum Yield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Europium halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for environmental-friendly blue-emitting materials. However, their development is hindered by relative low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY, e.g. ~2-5% for intrinsic CsEuCl3) and poor stability against air. Here, we introduce a one-step-procedure for synthesizing Eu$^{2+}$-doped CsSrCl$_3$ large nanocrystal clusters (LNCs) with the effect of self-reduction, therefore eliminating the use of conventional reductant oleylamine (OAm) and ensuring phase purity. The CsSrCl$_3$:Eu LNCs shows photoluminescence emission centered at 430 nm with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 25 nm and a PLQY of ~40%, which can be further enhanced to ~97% after passivating the surface defects by adding trioctylphosphine (TOP), the highest among all reported lead-free blue-emitting perovskite nanocrystals. The stability of CsSrCl$_3$:Eu can also be improved significantly by epitaxially growing ZnS shell on the surface. This work will shed more light on lanthanide and alkaline-earth metal (AEM)-based perovskites for nontoxic light-emitting materials.</description>

      <title>First-principles calculations of transport coefficients in Weyl semimetal TaAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study charge and heat transport from first-principles in the topological Weyl semimetal TaAs. Electron-phonon coupling matrix elements are calculated using density functional perturbation theory and used to derive the thermo-electric transport coefficients, including the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, electronic thermal conductivity and the Peltier coefficient. We compare the self-energy and momentum relaxation time approximations to the iterative solution of the Boltzmann Transport Equation, finding they give similar results for TaAs provided the chemical potential is treated accurately. For the iterative method, we derive an additional equation, which is needed to fully solve for transport under both thermal and an electrical potential gradients. Interestingly, the Onsager reciprocity between $S$ and $\Pi$ is no longer imposed, and we can deal with systems breaking time-reversal symmetry, in particular magnetic materials. We compare our results with the available experimental data for TaAs: the agreement is excellent for $\sigma_{xx}$, while $\sigma_{zz}$ is overestimated, probably due to differences in experimental carrier concentrations. The Seebeck coefficient is of the same order of magnitude in theory and experiments, and we find that its low-T behavior also strongly depends on the doping level.</description>

      <title>Exciton-defect interaction and optical properties from a first-principles T-matrix approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding exciton-defect interactions is critical for optimizing optoelectronic and quantum information applications in many materials. However, ab initio simulations of material properties with defects are often limited to high defect density. Here, we study effects of exciton-defect interactions on optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra in monolayer MoS2 using a first-principles T-matrix approach. We demonstrate that exciton-defect bound states can be captured by the disorder-averaged Green's function with the T-matrix approximation and further analyze their optical properties. Our approach yields photoluminescence spectra in good agreement with experiments and provides a new, computationally efficient framework for simulating optical properties of disordered 2D materials from first-principles.</description>

      <title>Exciton Bohr radius of lead halide perovskites for photovoltaic and light-emitting applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton Bohr radius (a_B) and exciton binding energy (E_b) of metal halide perovskites are two prime quantities in their applications to both light-emitting diode displays and photovoltaic devices. We develop a reliable theoretical method of simultaneously finding a_B and {\epsilon}_r^c (dielectric constant) based on the net exciton energy above the bulk band gap. It is estimated that a_B under the dielectric confinement is substantially smaller than a_B in the absence of dielectric confinement: 4.36 nm vs. 5.61 nm in the case of CH3NH3PbBr3. We attribute the enhanced a_B to variations of {\epsilon}_r^c and the electron-hole correlation energy. We also develop a simple method of finding E_b based on the same net exciton energy. Using this, we attribute the well-known difference in E_b between organic bromide perovskites and iodide counterparts to {\epsilon}_r^c and explain that iodide perovskites are more suited than bromide counterparts in photovoltaic applications, which require smaller E_b for efficient charge-carriers transport.</description>

      <title>Triplet Excitons Reconcile Charge Generation and Recombination in Low-Offset Organic Solar Cells: Efficiency Limits from a 5-State Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells has recently improved beyond 20%. The active layers of these devices comprise of at least two organic semiconductors, forming a type II heterojunction. Hereby, the device performance is determined by the kinetic interplay of various species, including localized excitons, charge transfer state as well as charge-separated states. However, a model which describes all relevant photovoltaic measures has yet to be developed. Herein, we present a comprehensive 5-state rate model which includes both singlet and triplet charge transfer states and takes into account the formation, re-splitting and decay of the local triplet state, parametric in the respective energy offset. We show that this model not only describes key device properties such as charge generation efficiency, photoluminescence, electroluminescence and Langevin reduction factor simultaneously but also elucidate how these vary across material combinations based on the D:A interfacial energy offset alone. We find that the electroluminescence and Langevin reduction factor depend strongly on the triplet properties and that the triplet decay becomes the dominant charge recombination pathway for systems with moderate offset, in full agreement to previous experimental results. Validation against literature data demonstrates the model's ability to predict the device efficiency accurately. Subsequently, we identify material combinations with singlet exciton to charge transfer state energetic offset of roughly 150meV as particularly promising. Our model explains further why recent certified efficiency records for binary blends remain at ca. 20% if no further means to improve photon and charge carrier harvesting are taken.</description>

      <title>Lithium Intercalation in the Anisotropic van der Waals Magnetic Semiconductor CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alkali metal intercalation is an important strategy for doping van der Waals materials. Lithium, in particular, was shown to achieve exceptional charge carrier densities, reaching levels at which fundamental electrical, optical, and magnetic material properties begin to be strongly modified. While lithium is known to be highly volatile, its migration dynamics in anisotropic layered crystals remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the intercalation of lithium in-between layers of the anisotropic magnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Using exfoliated crystals, we are able to monitor the dynamics of the intercalation process in real time through optical and electrical characterization methods. Our measurements reveal highly anisotropic migration of Lithium characterized by diffusion coefficients that differ by more than one order of magnitude along a- and b-directions. This finding is in good agreement with our molecular dynamics simulations which show trajectories of lithium atoms primarily follow the Br-chains in the a-direction. Beyond that, we find that partially covering CrSBr crystals by thin hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flakes has a significant impact on the intercalation process, and that lithium strongly enhances the electrical conductivity along the a-axis. Our method offers a new platform for lithium diffusion studies and encourages further research to pursue the fabrication of lithium-doped devices.</description>

      <title>Shubnikov-de Haas Oscillations in 2D $\text{PtSe}_2$: A fermiological Charge Carrier Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High magnetic field and low temperature transport is carried out in order to characterize the charge carriers of $\text{PtSe}_2$. In particular, the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations arising at applied magnetic field strengths $\gtrsim 4.5\,\text{T}$ are found to occur exclusively in plane and emerge at a layer thickness of $\approx 18\,\text{nm}$, increasing in amplitude and decreasing in frequency for thinner $\text{PtSe}_2$ flakes. Moreover, the quantum transport time, Berry phase, Dingle temperature and cyclotron mass of the charge carriers are ascertained. The emergence of weak antilocalization (WAL) lies in contrast to the presence of magnetic moments from Pt vacancies. An explanation is provided on how WAL and the Kondo effect can be observed within the same material. Detailed information about the charge carriers and transport phenomena in $\text{PtSe}_2$ is obtained, which is relevant for the design of prospective spintronic and orbitronic devices and for the realization of orbital Hall effect-based architectures.</description>

      <title>Linear scaling relation between two-dimensional massless Dirac fermion Fermi velocity and Fe-As bond length in iron arsenide superconductor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) massless Dirac fermions (MDF), which represent a type of quasi-particles with linear energy-momentum dispersions only in 2D momentum space, provide a fertile ground for realizing novel quantum phenomena. However, 2D MDF were seldom observed in the superconducting bulk states of 3D materials. Furthermore, as a cornerstone for accurately tuning the quantum phenomena based on 2D MDF, a quantitative relationship between 2D MDF and a structural parameter has rarely been revealed so far. Here, we report magneto-infrared spectroscopy studies of the iron-arsenide-superconductor systems NaFeAs and $A\mathrm{Fe_2As_2} (A = \mathrm{Ca, Ba})$ at temperature $T \sim 4.2 $ K and at magnetic fields ($B$) up to 17.5 T. Our results demonstrate the existence of 2D MDF in the superconducting bulk state of NaFeAs. Moreover, the 2D-MDF Fermi velocities in NaFeAs and $A\mathrm{Fe_2As_2} (A = \mathrm{Ca, Ba})$, which are extracted from the slopes of the linear $\sqrt{B}$ dependences of the Landau-level transition energies, scale linearly with the Fe-As bond lengths. The linear scaling between the 2D-MDF Fermi velocities and the Fe-As bond lengths is supported by (i) the linear relationship between the square root of the effective mass of the $d_{xy}$ electrons and the Fe-As bond length and (ii) the linear dependence of the square root of the calculated tight-binding hopping energy on the Fe-As bond length. Our results open up new avenues for exploring and tuning novel quantum phenomena based on 2D MDF in the superconducting bulk states of 3D materials.</description>

      <title>Energy transfer between localized emitters in photonic cavities from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative and nonradiative resonant couplings between defects are ubiquitous phenomena in photonic devices used in classical and quantum information technology applications. In this work we present a first principles approach to enable quantitative predictions of the energy transfer between defects in photonic cavities, beyond the dipole-dipole approximation and including the many-body nature of the electronic states. As an example, we discuss the energy transfer from a dipole like emitter to an F center in MgO in a spherical cavity. We show that the cavity can be used to controllably enhance or suppress specific spin flip and spin conserving transitions. Specifically, we predict that a ~10 to 100 enhancement in the non-radiative resonant energy transfer rate can be gained in the case of the F center in MgO by a rather moderate cavity with Q~400, and equal suppression in the rate can be achieved by incorporating a significant energy mismatch between the electronic excitation and the cavity mode. Our framework is general and readily applicable to a wide range of devices where localized emitters are embedded in micro-spheres, core-shell nanoparticles, and dielectric Mie resonators. Hence, our approach paves the way to predict how to control energy transfer in quantum memories and in ultra-high density optical memories, and in a variety of quantum information platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a brittle ceramic with a layered structure, however, recent experiments have suggested that inter-layer structural engineering could be key to new structural and functional properties. Here we report the scalable bulk synthesis of high-density crystalline h-BN solids, by using high-temperature spark plasma sintering (SPS) of h-BN powders, which show high values of mechanical strength, ductility, dielectric constant, thermal conductivity, and exceptional neutron radiation shielding capability. Through exhaustive characterizations we reveal that SPS induces non-basal plane crystallinity, twisting of layers, and facilitates inter-grain fusion with a high degree of in-plane alignment across macroscale dimensions, resulting in near-theoretical density and improved properties. Our findings highlight the importance of material design, via new approaches such as layer twisting and interlayer interconnections, to create novel ceramics with properties that could go beyond their intrinsic limits.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the atomic structure of substitutional platinum dopants in MoS$_2$ with single-sideband ptychography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We substitute individual Pt atoms into monolayer MoS$_2$ and study the resulting atomic structures with single-sideband (SSB) ptychography supported by ab initio simulations. We demonstrate that while high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging provides excellent Z-contrast, distinguishing some defect types such as single and double sulfur vacancies remains challenging due to their low relative contrast difference. However, SSB with its nearly linear Z-contrast and high phase sensitivity enables reliable identification of these defect configurations as well as various Pt dopant structures at significantly lower electron doses. Our findings uncover the precise atomic placement and highlight the potential of SSB ptychography for detailed structural analysis of dopant-modified 2D materials while minimizing beam-induced damage, offering new pathways for understanding and engineering atomic-scale features in 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Ferroelectric Altermagnets: From Model to Material Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiferroic altermagnets offer new opportunities for magnetoelectric coupling and electrically tunable spintronics. However, due to intrinsic symmetry conflicts between altermagnetism and ferroelectricity, achieving their coexistence, known as ferroelectric altermagnets (FEAM), remains an outstanding challenge, especially in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Here, we propose a universal, symmetry-based design principle for 2D FEAM, supported by tight-binding models and first-principles calculations. We show that lattice distortions can break spin equivalence and introduce the necessary rotation-related symmetry, enabling altermagnetism with electrically reversible spin splitting. Guided by this framework, we identify a family of 2D vanadium oxyhalides and sulfide halides as promising FEAM candidates. In these compounds, pseudo Jahn-Teller distortions and Peierls-like dimerization cooperatively establish the required symmetry conditions. We further propose the magneto-optical Kerr effect as an experimental probe to confirm FEAM and its electric spin reversal. Our findings provide a practical framework for 2D FEAM and advancing electrically controlled spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: A robust and efficient model for investigating the ultrafast dynamics of magnetic materials excited by laser pulses has been created, integrating dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equations with a quantum thermostat and a two-temperature model. The model has been successfully applied to three archetypal materials in the literature: nickel, cobalt, and iron. Additionally, analysis of the ultrafast dynamic susceptibility tensor indicates that off-diagonal components display specific features depending on whether a continuous external magnetic field is present.</description>

      <title>Harnessing natural and mechanical airflows for surface-based atmospheric pollutant removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, surface-based removal techniques, such as sorption, catalysis and filtration, are often limited by pollutant transport and removal rate constraints. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for applications in airflow through cities, HVAC systems and over vehicles. If these removal technologies are applied to their surfaces, cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal rates that exceed 1 GtCO$_2$e annually (20-year GWP). Cities have the highest atmospheric pollutant removal potential, with estimates averaging 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ annually. HVAC filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal costs as low as \$300 per tCO$_2$e removed when sorption or catalyst technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets, outperforming the \$2000 per tCO$_2$e removal cost when these technologies are applied to city surfaces. This estimate is based on the literature values for these technologies' costs per square meter. However, our calculations indicate that optimising catalyst properties and surface coverage could lower the cost estimates to below \$100 per tCO$_2$e across these applications. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a scalable pathway to advance climate and health objectives.</description>
