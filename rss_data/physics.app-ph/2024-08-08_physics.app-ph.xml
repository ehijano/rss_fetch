      <title>Characterization of a Displaced Coaxial Feed for Cascaded Cylindrical Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper characterizes a realistic feed for cylindrical metasurfaces, allowing it to be included in metasurface design. Specifically, it investigates a coaxial feed which is displaced from the center (off-center) of concentrically-cascaded cylindrical metasurfaces. Formulas are reported to quickly compute the multimodal S-matrix (scattering properties) of a displaced feed from that of the central feed. The theory is rigorously derived based on the addition theorem of Hankel functions for all azimuthal modes. Moreover, the resulting multimodal S-matrix is combined with the multimodal wave matrix theory used to model cylindrical metasurfaces, allowing devices to be designed that realize arbitrary field transformations from a displaced coaxial feed. A design example is reported, which opens new opportunities in the realization of realistic, high-performance cylindrical-metasurface-based devices.</description>

      <title>Topological resonance behaviors of surface acoustic wave under surface liquid-layer loadings and sensing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, topological resonance behaviors of surface acoustic wave (SAW) under surface liquid-layer loadings are investigated. The results show that through the coupling of waveguide and resonant cavity, a resonant peak with high Q-factor can emerge, and the frequency of which is significantly sensitive to the liquid parameters. Based on that, a topological-resonance SAW liquid-phase sensor is proposed. The results show that the formation of the topological phase transition is closely related to the liquid-layer loading. Furthermore, by changing the thickness of the liquid-layer loading, the operating-frequency range of the device can be significantly expanded, which is vital for biomedical detecting applications. Based on which, the sensing performances of topological-resonance SAW liquid-phase sensor are simulated, which are used to sensing the concentration of albumin and hemoglobin concentration in blood, and high sensitivities and Q-factors can be obtained for this device. The results presented in this paper can provide an important basis for the realization of highly sensitive and stable SAW biomedical sensors in the future.</description>

      <title>Klein Tunneling of Gigahertz Elastic Waves in Nanoelectromechanical Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Klein tunneling, the perfect transmission of a normally incident relativistic particle through an energy barrier, has been tested in various electronic, photonic, and phononic systems. Its potential in guiding and filtering classical waves in the Ultra High Frequency regime, on the other hand, has not been explored. Here, we report the realization of acoustic Klein tunneling in a nanoelectromechanical metamaterial system operating at gigahertz frequencies. The piezoelectric potential profiles are obtained by transmission-mode microwave impedance microscopy, from which reciprocal-space maps can be extracted. The transmission rate of normally incident elastic waves is near unity in the Klein tunneling regime and drops significantly outside this frequency range, consistent with microwave network analysis. Strong angular dependent transmission is also observed by controlling the launching angle of the emitter interdigital transducer. This work broadens the horizon in exploiting high-energy-physics phenomena for practical circuit applications in both classical and quantum regimes.</description>

      <title>Broadband mode exchanger based on subwavelength Y-junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimode silicon photonics, leveraging mode-division multiplexing technologies, offers significant potential to increase capacity of large-scale multiprocessing systems for on-chip optical interconnects. These technologies have implications not only for telecom and datacom applications, but also for cutting-edge fields such as quantum and nonlinear photonics. Thus, the development of compact, low-loss and low-crosstalk multimode devices, in particular mode exchangers, is crucial for effective on-chip mode manipulation. This work introduces a novel mode exchanger that exploits the properties of subwavelength grating metamaterials and symmetric Y-junctions, achieving low losses and crosstalk over a broad bandwidth and a compact size of only 6.5 {\mu}m {\times} 2.6 {\mu}m. The integration of SWG nanostructures in our design enables precise control of mode exchange through different propagation constants in the arms and metamaterial, and takes advantage of dispersion engineering to broaden the operating bandwidth. Experimental characterization demonstrates, to the best of our knowledge, the broadest operational bandwidth covering from 1420 nm to 1620 nm, with measured losses as low as 0.5 dB and extinction ratios higher than 10 dB. Enhanced performance is achieved within a 149 nm bandwidth (1471-1620 nm), showing measured losses below 0.4 dB and extinction ratios greater than 18 dB.</description>

      <title>High Performance MoS2 Phototransistors Photogated by PN Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photodetectors based on two-dimensional (2D) atomically thin semiconductors suffer from low light absorption, limiting their potential for practical applications. In this work, we demonstrate a high-performance MoS2 phototransistors by integrating few-layer MoS2 on a PN junction formed in a silicon (Si) substrate. The photovoltage created in the PN junction under light illumination electrically gates the MoS2 channel, creating a strong photoresponse in MoS2. We present an analytical model for the photoresponse of our device and show that it is in good agreement with measured experimental photocurrent in MoS2 and photovoltage in the Si PN junction. This device structure separates light absorption and electrical response functions, which provides us an opportunity to design new types of photodetectors. For example, incorporating ferroelectric materials into the gate structure can produce a negative capacitance that boosts gate voltage, enabling low power, high sensitivity phototransistor; this, combined with separating light absorption and electrical functions, enables advanced high-performance photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Absorption and scattering properties of nanoparticles in an absorbing medium: revisiting with experimental validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Absorption and scattering properties of nanoparticles immersed in an absorbing medium are essential in understanding the overall properties of composites and in designing materials with expected functionalities. In this paper, we establish the model that links the absorption and scattering coefficients of individual particles with the reflectance and transmittance spectra of thin-film composite, supported by well-controlled experiments. Thin films consisting of TiO$_2$ nanoparticles embedded in PMMA are fabricated on glass substrates using spin-coating and then peeled off to form standalone samples for spectroscopy measurements. The absorption $K$ and scattering $S$ coefficients of multiple nanoparticles are calculated from the measured transmittance and reflectance using the Kubelka-Munk theory in combination with the Saunderson correction. From the theoretical side, the absorption $K$ and scattering $S$ coefficients are the accumulation of absorption and scattering of individual particles, which are derived from the Mie theory. The agreement between the $K$ and $S$ coefficients extracted from experimental data and from theoretical calculations gives deep insight into the significant attenuating effect of absorption and scattering on each particle due to the surrounding medium. Furthermore, the validated model of nanoparticles immersed in an absorbing medium can be used to obtain the preliminary results for materials designed toward radiative cooling.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Transparent Electrodes: Interplay of High Purity SWCNTs network and a Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of transparent electrodes led to the development of optoelectronic devices such as OLEDs, LCDs, touchscreens, IR sensors, etc. Since ITO has many drawbacks in respect of its production cost and limited transparency in IR, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been a potential replacement for ITO due to their exceptional electrical and optical properties, especially in the IR region. In this work, we present the development of a CNT-polymer composite thin film that exhibits outstanding transparency across both visible and IR spectra prepared by layer-by-layer (LbL) technique. This approach not only ensures uniform integration and crosslinking of CNTs into lightweight matrices, but also represents a cost-effective method for producing transparent electrodes with remarkable optical and electrical properties. The produced films achieved a transparency above 80% in the UV-VIS range and approximately 70% in the mid-IR range. The sheet resistance of the fabricated thin films was measured at about 4 kOhm/sq, showing a tendency to decrease with the number of bilayers. Furthermore, in this work we have investigated electrical properties and transport mechanisms in more detail with computational analysis. Computational analysis was performed to better understand the electrical behavior of nanotube-polymer junctions in the interbundle structure. Based on all results, we propose that the transparent electrodes with 4 and 6 bilayers are the most optimal structures in terms of optical and electrical properties.</description>

Abstract: The interest in the ferroelectric non-volatile memory as a candidate for low power consumption electronic memories was raised after the discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide. Doping by different elements of hafnia films allows improving their ferroelectric properties. In this work, the transport experiments are combined with the simulations to study the evolution of ferroelectric properties and the mean distance between oxygen vacancies during the endurance of hafnium-zirconium oxide in metal-ferroelectric-metal structures to study the impact of different metal electrodes.</description>

      <title>Weight update in ferroelectric memristors with identical and non-identical pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) are a class of memristor which promise low-power, scalable, field-driven analog operation. In order to harness their full potential, operation with identical pulses is targeted. In this paper, several weight update schemes for FTJs are investigated, using either non-identical or identical pulses, and with time delays between the pulses ranging from 1 us to 10 s. Experimentally, a method for achieving non-linear weight update with identical pulses at long programming delays is demonstrated by limiting the switching current via a series resistor. Simulations show that this concept can be expanded to achieve weight update in a 1T1C cell by limiting the switching current through a transistor operating in sub-threshold or saturation mode. This leads to a maximum linearity in the weight update of 86% for a dynamic range (maximum switched polarization) of 30 {\mu}C/cm2. It is further demonstrated via simulation that engineering the device to achieve a narrower switching peak increases the linearity in scaled devices to &gt;93 % for the same range.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the role of Ta in the phase transition of Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 using low-temperature Raman spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase engineering strategies in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D-TMDs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and energy storage. Various methods, including direct synthesis, pressure control, and chemical doping, have been employed to manipulate structural transitions in 2D-TMDs. Metal intercalation emerges as an effective technique to modulate phase transition dynamics by inserting external atoms or ions between the layers of 2D-TMDs, altering their electronic structure and physical properties. Here, we investigate the significant structural phase transitions in Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 single crystals induced by Ta intercalation using a combination of Raman spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. The results highlight the pivotal role of Ta atoms in driving these transitions and elucidate the interplay between intercalation, phase transitions, and resulting electronic and vibrational properties in 2D-TMDs. By focusing on Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 as an ideal case study and investigating like metal intercalation, this study advances understanding in the field and paves the way for the development of novel applications for 2D-TMDs, offering insights into the potential of these materials for future technological advancements.</description>
