      <title>Modal Parameter Extraction via Propeller-Driven Vibration Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground Vibration Testing (GVT) supports aircraft certification but often requires lengthy and costly campaigns. Propeller-driven Vibration Testing (PVT) is assessed here as an output-only alternative, in line with Operational Modal Analysis approaches such as Taxi Vibration Testing and Flight Vibration Testing. A cantilever Aluminium 7075-T6 wing spar is instrumented with seven accelerometers and excited by an outboard electric motor and propeller. Seven runs are carried out: a motor-off baseline, five constant-throttle cases, and a manual up-down throttle sweep. The acquired spectra indicate that the dominant resonances remain observable under propeller excitation, while low-throttle conditions introduce narrowband harmonics that may mask structural peaks; the sweep reduces persistent overlap. Modal parameters are identified for the baseline and sweep cases using the Natural Excitation Technique with the Loewner Framework (NExT-LF). The first two modes remain closely matched (Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) &gt; 0.99), whereas the third mode shows reduced repeatability (MAC = 0.827) and a larger frequency shift, consistent with propeller-induced bending--torsion coupling and non-ideal sweep control. Overall, PVT provides a viable complement to GVT for extracting low-frequency modal information and motivates pursuing future work on automated throttle scheduling and coupling-aware test planning.</description>

      <title>Variable-Length Wideband CSI Feedback via Loewner Interpolation and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a variable-length wideband channel state information (CSI) feedback scheme for Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) systems in U6G band (6425MHz-7125MHz). Existing compressive sensing (CS)-based and deep learning (DL)- based schemes preprocess the channel by truncating it in the angular-delay domain. However, the energy leakage effect caused by the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) basis will be more serious and leads to a bottleneck in recovery accuracy when applied to wideband channels such as those in U6G. To solve this problem, we introduce the Loewner Interpolation (LI) framework which generates a set of dynamic bases based on the current CSI matrix, enabling highly efficient compression in the frequency domain. Then, the LI basis is further compressed in the spatial domain through a neural network. To achieve a flexible trade-off between feedback overhead and recovery accuracy, we design a rateless auto-encoder trained with tail dropout and a multi-objective learning schedule, supporting variable-length feedback with a singular model. Meanwhile, the codewords are ranked by importance, ensuring that the base station (BS) can still maintain acceptable reconstruction performance under limited feedback with tail erasures. Furthermore, an adaptive quantization strategy is developed for the feedback framework to enhance robustness. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme could achieve higher CSI feedback accuracy with less or equal feedback overhead, and improve spectral efficiency compared with baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Meta-Backscatter: Long-Distance Battery-Free Metamaterial-Backscatter Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery-free Internet of Things (BF-IoT) enabled by backscatter communication is a rapidly evolving technology offering advantages of low cost, ultra-low power consumption, and robustness. However, the practical deployment of BF-IoT is significantly constrained by the limited communication range of common backscatter tags, which typically operate with a range of merely a few meters due to inherent round-trip path loss. Meta-backscatter systems that utilize metamaterial tags present a promising solution, retaining the inherent advantages of BF-IoT while breaking the critical communication range barrier. By leveraging densely paved sub-wavelength units to concentrate the reflected signal power, metamaterial tags enable a significant communication range extension over existing BF-IoT tags that employ omni-directional antennas. In this paper, we synthesize the principles and paradigms of metamaterial sensing to establish a unified design framework and a forward-looking research roadmap. Specifically, we first provide an overview of backscatter communication, encompassing its development history, working principles, and tag classification. We then introduce the design methodology for both metamaterial tags and their compatible transceivers. Moreover, we present the implementation of a meta-backscatter system prototype and report the experimental results based on it. Finally, we conclude by highlighting key challenges and outlining potential avenues for future research.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents Bio-RV, a compact and resource-efficient RISC-V processor intended for biomedical control applications, such as accelerator-based biomedical SoCs and implantable pacemaker systems. The proposed Bio-RV is a multi-cycle RV32I core that provides explicit execution control and external instruction loading with capabilities that enable controlled firmware deployment, ASIC bring-up, and post-silicon testing. In addition to coordinating accelerator configuration and data transmission in heterogeneous systems, Bio-RV is designed to function as a lightweight host controller, handling interfaces with pacing, sensing, electrogram (EGM), telemetry, and battery management modules. With 708 LUTs and 235 flip-flops on FPGA prototypes, Bio-RV, implemented in a 180 nm CMOS technology, operate at 50 MHz and feature a compact hardware footprint. According to post-layout results, the proposed architectural decisions align with minimal energy use. Ultimately, Bio-RV prioritises deterministic execution, minimal hardware complexity, and integration flexibility over peak computing speed to meet the demands of ultra-low-power, safety-critical biomedical systems.</description>

      <title>Effective outdoor pathloss prediction: A multi-layer segmentation approach with weighting map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting pathloss by considering the physical environment is crucial for effective wireless network planning. Traditional methods, such as ray tracing and model-based approaches, often face challenges due to high computational complexity and discrepancies between models and real-world environments. In contrast, deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative, offering accurate path loss predictions with reduced computational complexity. In our research, we introduce a ResNet-based model designed to enhance path loss prediction. We employ innovative techniques to capture key features of the environment by generating transmission (Tx) and reception (Rx) depth maps, as well as a distance map from the geographic data. Recognizing the significant attenuation caused by signal reflection and diffraction, particularly at high frequencies, we have developed a weighting map that emphasizes the areas adjacent to the direct path between Tx and Rx for path loss prediction. {Extensive simulations demonstrate that our model outperforms PPNet, RPNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT) by 1.2-3.0 dB using dataset of ITU challenge 2024 and ICASSP 2023. In addition, the floating point operations (FLOPs) of the proposed model is 60\% less than those of benchmarks.} Additionally, ablation studies confirm that the inclusion of the weighting map significantly enhances prediction performance.</description>

      <title>SDP: A Unified Protocol and Benchmarking Framework for Reproducible Wireless Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based wireless sensing has made rapid progress, yet the field still lacks a unified and reproducible experimental foundation. Unlike computer vision, wireless sensing relies on hardware-dependent channel measurements whose representations, preprocessing pipelines, and evaluation protocols vary significantly across devices and datasets, hindering fair comparison and reproducibility.
  This paper proposes the Sensing Data Protocol (SDP), a protocol-level abstraction and unified benchmark for scalable wireless sensing. SDP acts as a standardization layer that decouples learning tasks from hardware heterogeneity. To this end, SDP enforces deterministic physical-layer sanitization, canonical tensor construction, and standardized training and evaluation procedures, decoupling learning performance from hardware-specific artifacts. Rather than introducing task-specific models, SDP establishes a principled protocol foundation for fair evaluation across diverse sensing tasks and platforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDP achieves competitive accuracy while substantially improving stability, reducing inter-seed performance variance by orders of magnitude on complex activity recognition tasks. A real-world experiment using commercial off-the-shelf Wi-Fi hardware further illustrating the protocol's interoperability across heterogeneous hardware. By providing a unified protocol and benchmark, SDP enables reproducible and comparable wireless sensing research and supports the transition from ad hoc experimentation toward reliable engineering practice.</description>

      <title>Drone Surveillance via Coordinated Beam Sweeping in MIMO-ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a scheme for drone surveillance coordinated with the fifth generation (5G) synchronization signal block (SSB) cell-search procedure to simultaneously detect low-altitude drones within a volumetric surveillance grid. Herein, we consider a multistatic configuration where multiple access points (APs) collaboratively illuminate the volume while independently transmitting SSB broadcast signals. Both tasks are performed through a beam sweeping. In the proposed scheme, coordinated APs send sensing beams toward a grid of voxels within the volumetric surveillance region simultaneously with the 5G SSB burst. To prevent interference between communication and sensing signals, we propose a precoder design that guarantees orthogonality of the sensing beam and the SSB in order to maximize the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) while ensuring a specified SINR for users, as well as minimizing the impact of the direct link. The results demonstrate that the proposed precoder outperforms the non-coordinated precoder and is minimally affected by variations in drone altitude.</description>

      <title>Airborne Particle Communication Through Time-varying Diffusion-Advection Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08534v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle based communication using diffusion and advection has emerged as an alternative signaling paradigm recently. While most existing studies assume constant flow conditions, real macro scale environments such as atmospheric winds exhibit time varying behavior. In this work, airborne particle communication under time varying advection is modeled as a linear time varying (LTV) channel, and a closed form, time dependent channel impulse response is derived using the method of moving frames. Based on this formulation, the channel is characterized through its power delay profile, leading to the definition of channel dispersion time as a physically meaningful measure of channel memory and a guideline for symbol duration selection. System level simulations under directed, time varying wind conditions show that waveform design is critical for performance, enabling multi symbol modulation using a single particle type when dispersion is sufficiently controlled. The results demonstrate that time varying diffusion advection channels can be systematically modeled and engineered using communication theoretic tools, providing a realistic foundation for particle based communication in complex flow environments.</description>

      <title>Stable Filtering for Efficient Dimensionality Reduction of Streaming Manifold Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many areas in science and engineering now have access to technologies that enable the rapid collection of overwhelming data volumes. While these datasets are vital for understanding phenomena from physical to biological and social systems, the sheer magnitude of the data makes even simple storage, transmission, and basic processing highly challenging. To enable efficient and accurate execution of these data processing tasks, we require new dimensionality reduction tools that 1) do not need expensive, time-consuming training, and 2) preserve the underlying geometry of the data that has the information required to understand the measured system. Specifically, the geometry to be preserved is that induced by the fact that in many applications, streaming high-dimensional data evolves on a low-dimensional attractor manifold. Importantly, we may not know the exact structure of this manifold a priori. To solve these challenges, we present randomized filtering (RF), which leverages a specific instantiation of randomized dimensionality reduction to provably preserve non-linear manifold structure in the embedded space while remaining data-independent and computationally efficient. In this work we build on the rich theoretical promise of randomized dimensionality reduction to develop RF as a real, practical approach. We introduce novel methods, analysis, and experimental verification to illuminate the practicality of RF in diverse scientific applications, including several simulated and real-data examples that showcase the tangible benefits of RF.</description>

      <title>Application of Ideal Observer for Thresholded Data in Search Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study advances task-based image quality assessment by developing an anthropomorphic thresholded visual-search model observer. The model is an ideal observer for thresholded data inspired by the human visual system, allowing selective processing of high-salience features to improve discrimination performance. By filtering out irrelevant variability, the model enhances diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency.
  The observer employs a two-stage framework: candidate selection and decision-making. Using thresholded data during candidate selection refines regions of interest, while stage-specific feature processing optimizes performance. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of thresholding on feature maps, candidate localization, and multi-feature scenarios. Results demonstrate that thresholding improves observer performance by excluding low-salience features, particularly in noisy environments. Intermediate thresholds often outperform no thresholding, indicating that retaining only relevant features is more effective than keeping all features.
  Additionally, the model demonstrates effective training with fewer images while maintaining alignment with human performance. These findings suggest that the proposed novel framework can predict human visual search performance in clinically realistic tasks and provide solutions for model observer training with limited resources. Our novel approach has applications in other areas where human visual search and detection tasks are modeled such as in computer vision, machine learning, defense and security image analysis.</description>

      <title>Predicting Region of Interest in Human Visual Search Based on Statistical Texture and Gabor Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding human visual search behavior is a fundamental problem in vision science and computer vision, with direct implications for modeling how observers allocate attention in location-unknown search tasks. In this study, we investigate the relationship between Gabor-based features and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based texture features in modeling early-stage visual search behavior. Two feature-combination pipelines are proposed to integrate Gabor and GLCM features for narrowing the region of possible human fixations. The pipelines are evaluated using simulated digital breast tomosynthesis images. Results show qualitative agreement among fixation candidates predicted by the proposed pipelines and a threshold-based model observer. A strong correlation is observed between GLCM mean and Gabor feature responses, indicating that these features encode related image information despite their different formulations. Eye-tracking data from human observers further suggest consistency between predicted fixation regions and early-stage gaze behavior. These findings highlight the value of combining structural and texture-based features for modeling visual search and support the development of perceptually informed observer models.</description>

      <title>DRL-based Power Allocation in LiDAL-Assisted RLNC-NOMA OWC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technique for optical wireless communication (OWC), enabling multiple users to share the optical spectrum simultaneously through the power domain. However, the imperfection of channel state information (CSI) and residual errors in decoding process deteriorate the performance of NOMA, especially when multi-parameteric and realistic dense-user indoor scenarios are considered. In this work, we model a LiDAL-assisted RLNC-NOMA OWC system, where the light detection and localization (LiDAL) technique exploits spatio-temporal information to improve user CSI, while random linear network coding (RLNC) enhances data resilience in the NOMA successive decoding process. Power allocation (PA) is a crucial issue in communication systems, particularly in the modeled system, due to the complex interactions between multiple users and the coding and detection processes. However, optimizing continuous PA dynamically requires advanced techniques to avoid excessive computational complexity. Therefore, we adopt a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to efficiently learn near-optimal power allocation strategies, enabling enhanced system performance. In particular, a DRL-based normalized advantage function (NAF) algorithm is proposed to maximize the average sum rate of the system, and its performance is analyzed and compared to other widely used DRL-based and conventional PA schemes, such as deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), gain ratio PA (GRPA), and exhaustive search.</description>

      <title>Efficient Incremental SLAM via Information-Guided and Selective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient incremental SLAM back-end that achieves the accuracy of full batch optimization while substantially reducing computational cost. The proposed approach combines two complementary ideas: information-guided gating (IGG) and selective partial optimization (SPO). IGG employs an information-theoretic criterion based on the log-determinant of the information matrix to quantify the contribution of new measurements, triggering global optimization only when a significant information gain is observed. This avoids unnecessary relinearization and factorization when incoming data provide little additional information. SPO executes multi-iteration Gauss-Newton (GN) updates but restricts each iteration to the subset of variables most affected by the new measurements, dynamically refining this active set until convergence. Together, these mechanisms retain all measurements to preserve global consistency while focusing computation on parts of the graph where it yields the greatest benefit. We provide theoretical analysis showing that the proposed approach maintains the convergence guarantees of full GN. Extensive experiments on benchmark SLAM datasets show that our approach consistently matches the estimation accuracy of batch solvers, while achieving significant computational savings compared to conventional incremental approaches. The results indicate that the proposed approach offers a principled balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it a robust and scalable solution for real-time operation in dynamic data-rich environments.</description>

      <title>From Antenna Abundance to Antenna Intelligence in 6G Gigantic MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current cellular systems achieve high spectral efficiency through Massive MIMO, which leverages an abundance of antennas to create favorable propagation conditions for multiuser spatial multiplexing. Looking towards future networks, the extrapolation of this paradigm leads to systems with many hundreds of antennas per base station, raising concerns regarding hardware complexity, cost, and power consumption. This article suggests more intelligent array designs that reduce the need for excessive antenna numbers. We revisit classical uniform array design principles and explain how their uniform spatial sampling leads to unnecessary redundancies in practical deployment scenarios. By exploiting non-uniform sparse arrays with site-specific antenna placements -- based on either pre-optimized irregular arrays or real-time movable antennas -- we demonstrate how superior multiuser MIMO performance can be achieved with far fewer antennas. These principles are inspired by previous works on wireless localization. We explain and demonstrate numerically how these concepts can be adapted for communications to improve the average sum rate and similar metrics. The results suggest a paradigm shift for future antenna array design, where antenna intelligence replaces sheer antenna count. This opens new opportunities for efficient, adaptable, and sustainable Gigantic MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna for Integrating Near-field Channel Estimation and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) introduces a new degree of freedom for future wireless communication systems by enabling the adaptive adjustment of antenna positions. Its large-range movement renders wireless channels transmission into the near-field region, which brings new performance enhancement for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). This paper proposes a novel multi-stage design framework for broadband near-field ISAC assisted by MA. The framework first divides the MA movement area into multiple subregions, and employs the Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm (NOMP) to achieve high-precision angle estimation in each subregion. Subsequently, a method called near-field localization via subregion ray clustering (LSRC) is proposed for identifying the positions of scatterers. This method finds the coordinates of each scatterer by jointly processing the angle estimates across all subregions. Finally, according to the estimated locations of the scatterers, the near-field channel estimation (CE) is refined for improving communication performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance MA sensing accuracy and CE, providing an efficient solution for MA-aided near-field ISAC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel piecewise smooth image model with piecewise constant local parameters that are automatically adapted to each image. Technically, the model is formulated in terms of factor graphs with NUP (normal with unknown parameters) priors, and the pertinent computations amount to iterations of conjugate-gradient steps and Gaussian message passing. The proposed model and algorithms are demonstrated with applications to denoising and contrast enhancement.</description>

      <title>LWM-Spectro: A Foundation Model for Wireless Baseband Signal Spectrograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The received in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) baseband signals inherently encode physical-layer and channel characteristics of wireless links. Learning robust and transferable representations directly from such raw signals, however, remains challenging due to heterogeneous communication systems, diverse propagation environments, and limited labeled data. To address this, we present LWM-Spectro, a transformer-based foundation model pretrained on large-scale I/Q data represented as time-frequency spectrograms. The model leverages self-supervised masked modeling, contrastive learning, and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to learn general-purpose wireless representations. These representations transfer effectively to downstream tasks such as modulation classification and joint SNR/mobility recognition, even with minimal supervision. Across tasks, LWM-Spectro consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning baselines in both few-shot and data-rich regimes, providing a unified foundation for wireless learning.</description>

      <title>EEG-based 90-Degree Turn Intention Detection for Brain-Computer Interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)--based turn intention prediction for lower limb movement is important to build an efficient brain-computer interface (BCI) system. This study investigates the feasibility of intention detection of left-turn, right-turn, and straight walk by utilizing EEG signals obtained before the event occurrence. Synchronous data was collected using 31-channel EEG and IMU-based motion capture systems for nine healthy participants while performing left-turn, right-turn, and straight walk movements. EEG data was preprocessed with steps including Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR), re-referencing, and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to remove data noise. Feature extraction from the preprocessed EEG data involved computing various statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, skew, and kurtosis), and Hjorth parameters (activity, mobility, and complexity). Further, the feature selection was performed using the Random forest algorithm for the dimensionality reduction. The feature set obtained was utilized for 3-class classification using XG boost, gradient boosting, and support vector machine (SVM) with RBF kernel classifiers in a five-fold cross-validation scheme. Using the proposed intention detection methodology, the SVM classifier using an EEG window of 1.5 s and 0 s time-lag has the best decoding performance with mean accuracy, precision, and recall of 81.23%, 85.35%, and 83.92%, respectively, across the nine participants. The decoding analysis shows the feasibility of turn intention prediction for lower limb movement using the EEG signal before the event onset.</description>

      <title>Joint Reproduction Number and Spatial Connectivity Structure Estimation via Graph Sparsity-Promoting Penalized Functional</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During an epidemic outbreak, decision makers crucially need accurate and robust tools to monitor the pathogen propagation. The effective reproduction number, defined as the expected number of secondary infections stemming from one contaminated individual, is a state-of-the-art indicator quantifying the epidemic intensity. Numerous estimators have been developed to precisely track the reproduction number temporal evolution. Yet, COVID-19 pandemic surveillance raised unprecedented challenges due to the poor quality of worldwide reported infection counts. When monitoring the epidemic in different territories simultaneously, leveraging the spatial structure of data significantly enhances both the accuracy and robustness of reproduction number estimates. However, this requires a good estimate of the spatial structure. To tackle this major limitation, the present work proposes a joint estimator of the reproduction number and connectivity structure. The procedure is assessed through intensive numerical simulations on carefully designed synthetic data and illustrated on real COVID-19 spatiotemporal infection counts.</description>

      <title>Analytical and Cross-Sectional Clinical Validity of a Smartphone-Based U-Turn Test in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Gait and balance impairment can profoundly impact people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Objectives: To evaluate the analytical and clinical validity of the U-Turn Test (UTT), a smartphone-based assessment of dynamic balance in PwMS. Methods: The GaitLab study (ISRCTN15993728) enrolled adult PwMS (EDSS 0.0-6.5). PwMS performed the UTT in a gait laboratory (supervised) using 6 smartphones at different wear locations and daily during a two-week remote period (unsupervised) using one smartphone (belt front). Median turn speed was computed per UTT. In the supervised setting, turn detection accuracy of smartphones was compared to motion capture (mocap) via F1 scores. Agreement between smartphone- and mocap-derived turn speed was assessed by Bland-Altman and ICC(3,1). In the unsupervised setting, test-retest reliability (ICC[2,1]) and correlations with Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), EDSS, Ambulation Score, 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12), and Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (ABC) were evaluated. Results: Ninety-six PwMS were included. Turn speed was comparable across supervised (1.44 rad/s) and unsupervised settings (1.47 rad/s). In the supervised setting, turn detection was highly accurate (F1 &gt;95% across wear locations). Turn speed agreement with mocap was high (ICC[3,1]: 0.87-0.92), with minimal bias (-0.04 to 0.11 rad/s). Unsupervised test-retest reliability (ICC[2,1]) was &gt;0.90 when aggregating &gt;=2 tests. Turn speed correlated with T25FW (rho=-0.79), EDSS (rho=-0.75), Ambulation score (rho=-0.73), MSWS-12 (rho=-0.65), and ABC (rho=-0.61). Conclusion: The UTT accurately and reproducibly measures turn speed across wear locations and settings, providing complementary dynamic balance insights to clinical measures and showing potential for use in multiple sclerosis trials.</description>

      <title>LEO Constellations as a Decentralized GNSS Network: Optimizing PNT Corrections in Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid expansion of low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations, thousands of satellites are now in operation, many equipped with onboard GNSS receivers capable of continuous orbit determination and time synchronization. This development is creating an unprecedented spaceborne GNSS network, offering new opportunities for network-driven precise LEO orbit and clock estimation. Yet, current onboard GNSS processing is largely standalone and often insufficient for high-precision applications, while centralized fusion is challenging due to computational bottlenecks and the lack of in-orbit infrastructure. In this work, we report a decentralized GNSS network over large-scale LEO constellations, where each satellite processes its own measurements while exchanging compact information with neighboring nodes to enable precise orbit and time determination. We model the moving constellation as a dynamic graph and tailor a momentum-accelerated gradient tracking (GT) method to ensure steady convergence despite topology changes. Numerical simulations with constellations containing hundreds of satellites show that the proposed method matches the accuracy of an ideal centralized benchmark, while substantially reducing communication burdens. Ultimately, this framework supports the development of autonomous and self-organizing space systems, enabling high-precision navigation with reduced dependence on continuous ground contact.</description>

      <title>Analog fast Fourier transforms for scalable and efficient signal processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge devices are being deployed at increasing volumes to sense and act on information from the physical world. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is often necessary to make this sensed data suitable for further processing -- such as by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms -- and for transmission over communication networks. Analog in-memory computing has been shown to be a fast, energy-efficient, and scalable solution for processing edge AI workloads, but not for Fourier transforms. This is because of the existence of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, which enormously reduces the complexity of the DFT but has so far belonged only to digital processors. Here, we show that the FFT can be mapped to analog in-memory computing systems, enabling them to efficiently scale to arbitrarily large Fourier transforms without requiring large sizes or large numbers of non-volatile memory arrays. We experimentally demonstrate analog FFTs on 1D audio and 2D image signals, performing analog computations on up to 524K charge-trapping memory devices simultaneously, where each device has precisely tunable, low-conductance analog states. The scalability of both the new analog FFT approach and the charge-trapping memory device is leveraged to compute a 65,536-point analog DFT, a scale that is otherwise inaccessible by analog systems and which is $&gt;$500$\times$ larger than any previous analog DFT demonstration. Analog FFT cores can provide higher energy efficiency and performance per area than specialized digital FFT processors at all FFT sizes, while also functioning as efficient matrix multiplication engines for AI workloads.</description>

      <title>Beyond ISAC: Toward Integrated Heterogeneous Service Provisioning via Elastic Multi-Dimensional Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the growing complexity of vertical applications, current integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in wireless networks remains insufficient for supporting all required beyond communication services. To this end, future networks are evolving toward an integrated heterogeneous service provisioning (IHSP) platform, which seeks to integrate a broad range of heterogeneous services beyond the dual-function scope of ISAC. Nevertheless, this trend intensifies conflicts among concurrent heterogeneous service requirements under constrained resource sharing. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by the joint use of two novel elastic design strategies: compromised service value assessment and flexible multi-dimensional resource multiplexing. Consequently, we propose a value-prioritized elastic multi-dimensional multiple access (MDMA) mechanism for IHSP systems. First, we modify the Value-of-Service (VoS) metric by incorporating elastic parameters to characterize user-specific tolerance and compromise in response to various performance degradations under constrained resources. This VoS metric serves as the foundation for prioritizing services and enabling effective fairness service scheduling among concurrent competing demands. Next, we adapt the MDMA to elastically multiplex services using appropriate multiple access schemes across different resource domains. This protocol leverages user-specific interference tolerances and cancellation capabilities across different domains to reduce resource-demanding conflicts and co-channel interference within the same domain. Then, we maximize the system's VoS by jointly optimizing MDMA and power allocation. Since this problem is non-convex, we develop a monotonic optimization-assisted dynamic programming algorithm for the optimal solution and a VoS-prioritized successive convex approximation algorithm for efficient suboptimal computation.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Multiobject Tracking With Neural-Enhanced Motion and Measurement Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiobject tracking (MOT) is an important task in applications including autonomous driving, ocean sciences, and aerospace surveillance. Traditional MOT methods are model-based and combine sequential Bayesian estimation with data association and an object birth model. More recent methods are fully data-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. Both approaches offer distinct advantages in specific settings. In particular, model-based methods are generally applicable across a wide range of scenarios, whereas data-driven MOT achieves superior performance in scenarios where abundant labeled data for training is available. A natural thought is whether a general framework can integrate the two approaches. This paper introduces a hybrid method that utilizes neural networks to enhance specific aspects of the statistical model in Bayesian MOT that have been identified as overly simplistic. By doing so, the performance of the prediction and update steps of Bayesian MOT is improved. To ensure tractable computation, our framework uses belief propagation to avoid high-dimensional operations combined with sequential Monte Carlo methods to perform low-dimensional operations efficiently. The resulting method combines the flexibility and robustness of model-based approaches with the capability to learn complex information from data of neural networks. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method based on the nuScenes autonomous driving dataset and demonstrate that it has state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>WaveNet's Precision in EEG Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to automate the classification of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) signals into physiological activity, pathological (epileptic) activity, power-line noise, and other non-cerebral artifacts. Traditional methods for iEEG signal classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of iEEG recordings. Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St. Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and tested on 209,231 samples using a 70/20/10 split. The model achieved a classification accuracy exceeding previous non-specialized CNN- and LSTM-based approaches and was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline. Notably, the model achieves high discrimination of noise and artifact classes, with precisions of 0.98 and approximately 1, respectively. Classification between physiological and pathological signals exhibits a modest but clinically interpretable overlap, with F1-scores of 0.96 and 0.90 and 175 and 272 cross-class false positives, respectively, reflecting inherent clinical overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis, is well-suited for iEEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and residual connections, enabling the capture of both fine-grained and long-range temporal dependencies. The study also details the preprocessing pipeline, including dynamic dataset partitioning, the use of focal loss to address class imbalance, and normalization steps that support high model performance. While the results demonstrate strong in-distribution performance, generalizability across datasets and clinical settings has yet to be established.</description>

      <title>Information Capacity: Evaluating the Efficiency of Large Language Models via Text Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08066v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further intensifies the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across diverse model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. A distinctive feature of information capacity is its incorporation of tokenizer efficiency, which affects inference costs but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 52 open-source models and observe a consistent information capacity among different-sized models within a series. Experiments on 5 heterogeneous datasets reveal strong linguistic bias in mainstream LLMs. Three major factors of information capacity include tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture. Empirical results verify the accuracy of performance prediction across model sizes based on information capacity and show the correlation between information capacity and benchmark scores.</description>
