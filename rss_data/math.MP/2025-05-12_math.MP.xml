      <title>A note on quantum Hamiltonian reduction and anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization of field-theoretic models with gauge symmetries is often obstructed by quantum anomalies. It is commonly believed that the origin of these anomalies lies in the infinite number of degrees of freedom, which requires completing the model within an appropriate regularization scheme. This paper provides an explicit example of a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian system with first-class constraints whose quantization exhibits anomalies. These anomalies arise from the nontrivial topology of the reduced phase space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Dirac equations in polar form proving that they can equivalently be re-configured into a system of equations consisting of derivatives of the velocity density plus the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, giving the momentum in terms of relativistic quantum potentials (i.e. displaying first-order derivatives of the two degrees of freedom of the spinor field): this system is said to have Madelung structure. Conservation laws, second-order equations and multi-valuedness are also discussed.</description>

      <title>On removing orders from amplitude equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a modified version of the renormalization group (RG) method and test its numerical accuracy. It has been tested on numerous scalar ODEs and systems of ODEs. Our method is primarily motivated by the possibility of simplifying amplitude equations. The key feature of our method is the introduction of a new homogeneous function at each order of the perturbation hierarchy, which is then used to remove terms from the amplitude equations. We have shown that there is a limit to how many terms can be removed, as doing so beyond a certain point would reintroduce linear growth. There is thus a \textit{core} in the amplitude equation, which consists of the terms that cannot be removed while avoiding linear growth. Using our modified RG method, higher accuracy can also be achieved while maintaining the same level of complexity in the amplitude equation.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formalism for non-diagonalisable systems of hydrodynamic type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the system of first order PDEs for pseudo-Riemannian metrics governing the Hamiltonian formalism for systems of hydrodynamic type. In the diagonal setting the integrability conditions ensure the compatibility of this system and, thanks to a classical theorem of Darboux, the existence of a family of solutions depending on functional parameters. In this paper we study the generalisation of this result to a class of non-diagonalisable systems of hydrodynamic type that naturally generalises Tsarev's integrable diagonal systems.</description>

      <title>FTNILO: Explicit Multivariate Function Inversion, Optimization and Counting, Cryptography Weakness and Riemann Hypothesis Solution Equation with Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new formalism, the Field Tensor Network Integral Logical Operator (FTNILO), to obtain the explicit equation that returns the minimum, maximum, and zeros of a multivariable injective function, and an algorithm for non-injective ones. This method extends the MeLoCoToN algorithm for inversion and optimization problems with continuous variables, by using Field Tensor Networks. The fundamentals of the method are the conversion of the problem of minimization of $N$ continuous variables into a problem of maximization of a dependent functional of a single variable. It can also be adapted to determine other properties, such as the zeros of any function. For this purpose, we use an extension of the imaginary time evolution, the new method of continuous signals, and partial or total integration, depending on the case. In addition, we show a direct way to recover both the tensor networks and the MeLoCoToN from this formalism. We show some examples of application, such as the Riemann hypothesis resolution. We provide an explicit integral equation that gives the solution of the Riemann hypothesis, being that if it results in a zero value, it is correct; otherwise, it is wrong. This algorithm requires no deep mathematical knowledge and is based on simple mathematical properties.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Symmetries of Planar Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the invariance of all planar Feynman graphs under the Yangian level-one momentum symmetry given certain constraints on the propagator powers. The proof relies on relating this symmetry to a planarized version of the conformal simplices of Bzowski, McFadden and Skenderis. In particular, this proves a momentum-space analogue of the position-space conformal condition on propagator powers. When combined with the latter, the invariance under the level-one momentum implies full Yangian symmetry of the considered graphs. These include all scalar Feynman integrals for which a Yangian symmetry was previously demonstrated at the level of examples, e.g. the fishnet or loom graphs, as well as generalizations to graphs with massive propagators.</description>

      <title>Bridging Classical and Quantum Information Scrambling with the Operator Entanglement Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal features of chaotic quantum dynamics underlie our understanding of thermalization in closed quantum systems and the complexity of quantum computations. Reversible automaton circuits, comprised of classical logic gates, have emerged as a tractable means to study such dynamics. Despite generating no entanglement in the computational basis, these circuits nevertheless capture many features expected from fully quantum evolutions. In this work, we demonstrate that the differences between automaton dynamics and fully quantum dynamics are revealed by the operator entanglement spectrum, much like the entanglement spectrum of a quantum state distinguishes between the dynamics of states under Clifford and Haar random circuits.While the operator entanglement spectrum under random unitary dynamics is governed by the eigenvalue statistics of random Gaussian matrices, we show evidence that under random automaton dynamics it is described by the statistics of Bernoulli random matrices, whose entries are random variables taking values $0$ or $1$. We study the crossover between automaton and generic unitary operator dynamics as the automaton circuit is doped with gates that introduce superpositions, namely Hadamard or $R_x = e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}X}$ gates. We find that a constant number of superposition-generating gates is sufficient to drive the operator dynamics to the random-circuit universality class, similar to earlier results on Clifford circuits doped with $T$ gates. This establishes the operator entanglement spectrum as a useful tool for probing the chaoticity and universality class of quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>On electrostatic manifolds with boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Static manifolds with boundary were recently introduced by Cruz and Vit\'orio in the context of the prescribed scalar curvature problem in a manifold with boundary with prescribed mean curvature. This kind of manifold is also interesting from the point of view of the general theory of relativity. In this article, we introduce electrostatic manifolds with boundary as a natural generalization of static manifolds with boundary in the presence of a non-zero electric field. We study the geometry of the zero-level set of the potential and its connection to the global properties of electrostatic manifolds with boundary. In particular, we establish some rigidity theorems for the 3-dimensional Euclidean ball and for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om manifold.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for step reinforced random walks with regularly varying memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a generalized step reinforced random walk, starting from the origin, the first step is taken according to the first element of an innovation sequence. Then in subsequent epochs, it recalls a past epoch with probability proportional to a regularly varying sequence $\{\mu_n\}$ of index $\gamma&gt;-1$; recalls and repeats the step taken with probability $p$, or with probability $1-p$ takes a fresh step from the innovation sequence. The innovation sequence is assumed to be i.i.d.\ with mean zero. We study the corresponding step reinforced random walk process with linearly scaled time as an r.c.l.l.\ function on $[0, \infty)$. We prove law of large numbers for the linearly scaled process almost surely and in $L^1$ for all possible values of $p$ and $\gamma$.
  Assuming finite second moments for the innovation sequence, we obtain interesting phase transitions based on the boundedness of a sequence associated with $\{\mu_n\}$. The random walk suitably scaled converges almost surely to a process, which may not be Gaussian, when the sequence is bounded and the convergence is in distribution to a Gaussian process otherwise. This phase transition introduces the point of criticality at $p_c=\frac{\gamma+1/2}{\gamma+1}$ for $\gamma&gt;-\frac12$. For the subcritical regime, the process is diffusive, while it is superdiffusive otherwise. However, for the critical regime, the scaled process can converge almost surely or in distribution depending on the choice of sequence $\{\mu_n\}$. Almost sure convergence in the critical regime is new. In the critical regime, the scaling can include many more novel choices in addition to $\sqrt{n \log n}$. Further, we use linear time scale and time independent scales even for the critical regime. We argue the exponential time scale for the critical regime is not natural. All the convergences in all the regimes are obtained for the process as an r.c.l.l.\ function.</description>

      <title>Surface Nematic Uniformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ant-like observer confined to a two-dimensional surface traversed by stripes would wonder whether this striped landscape could be devised in such a way as to appear to be the same wherever they go. Differently stated, this is the problem studied in this paper. In a more technical jargon, we determine all possible uniform nematic fields on a smooth surface. It was already known that for such a field to exist, the surface must have constant negative Gaussian curvature. Here, we show that all uniform nematic fields on such a surface are parallel transported (in Levi-Civita's sense) by special systems of geodesics, which (with scant inventiveness) are termed uniform. We prove that, for every geodesic on the surface, there are two systems of uniform geodesics that include it; they are conventionally called right and left, to allude at a possible intrinsic definition of handedness. We found explicitly all uniform fields for Beltrami's pseudosphere. Since both geodesics and uniformity are preserved under isometries, by a classical theorem of Minding, the solution for the pseudosphere carries over all other admissible surfaces, thus providing a general solution to the problem (at least in principle).</description>

      <title>Omni-Temporal Theory and Simulation of Hydrodynamic Dispersion using Fourier Transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic dispersion determines the extent of solute mixing and apparent diffusive flux in various chemical, geological, and biological systems that possess flow with strong velocity gradients. Though established dispersion theory captures the transient interplay between diffusion, flow, and reaction rates, a long-time approximation is commonly adopted where the characteristic time scale of flow substantially exceeds that of pore-scale diffusion. Here, we introduce a frequency-based theory to model omni-temporal dispersion through porous media that simultaneously captures fast and slow components of dispersion. To create this theory, we formally volume-average the Fourier-transformed pore-scale advection-diffusion equation for solute and obtain up-scaled transport coefficients for a periodic unit cell: a dispersion tensor, an advection suppression vector, and reaction-rate coefficients. These coefficients serve dually as transfer functions that correlate certain output with input quantities in the frequency domain, enabling the prediction of up-scaled temporal dynamics using inverse Fourier transformation. Their utility is demonstrated by deriving analytical expressions for the dispersion coefficient for cases of Poiseuille flow between parallel plates and through circular tubes. This omni-temporal theory produces breakthrough curves for a fast solute pulse between inactive parallel plates that agree with the solute propagation rates predicted by direct numerical simulation (DNS), in contrast with conventional asymptotic theory that overpredicts such by orders of magnitude. Deviations in solute peak magnitude from DNS are shown to arise from solute back-diffusion into the inlet plane as well as entry-region effects that are evidenced by a non-periodic variation of the closure variable b.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Topology Principles behind Topological Quantum Error Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is crucial for numerous quantum applications, including fault-tolerant quantum computation, which is of great scientific and industrial interest. Among various QEC paradigms, topological quantum error correction (TQEC) has attained the most experimental successes by far. In this paper, we build upon existing knowledge of TQEC by developing a generalized theoretical framework of TQEC. We begin by formally defining TQEC codes and exploring the algebraic topological principles underlying these quantum codes, including deriving the conditions for any topological manifold to serve as a quantum memory. We show that TQEC for qubits works for both orientable and non-orientable manifolds. Moreover, we extend the construction of TQEC to higher-dimensional manifolds and provide examples for higher-dimensional TQEC codes. Finally, we apply these principles to construct new codes on 2-dimensional manifolds that have received limited attention in prior literature. As a case study, we simulate the performance of TQEC codes on the Klein bottle $K$ and evaluate their efficacy for quantum error correction. This work contributes to the advancement of TQEC by proposing a broader class of codes and demonstrating their theoretical and practical potential. By addressing previously unexplored topological structures, our findings represent a step forward in achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation and communication.</description>

      <title>Validating Griffith fracture propagation in the phase-field approach to fracture: The case of Mode III by means of the trousers test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At present, there is an abundance of results showing that the phase-field approach to fracture in elastic brittle materials -- when properly accounting for material strength -- describes the \emph{nucleation} of fracture from large pre-existing cracks in a manner that is consistent with the Griffith competition between bulk deformation energy and surface fracture energy. By contrast, results that demonstrate the ability of this approach to describe Griffith fracture \emph{propagation} are scarce and restricted to Mode I. Aimed at addressing this lacuna, the main objective of this paper is to show that the phase-field approach to fracture describes Mode III fracture propagation in a manner that is indeed consistent with the Griffith energy competition. This is accomplished via direct comparisons between phase-field predictions for fracture propagation in the so-called \emph{trousers} \emph{test} and the corresponding results that emerge from the Griffith energy competition. The latter are generated from full-field finite-element solutions that -- as an additional critical contribution of this paper -- also serve to bring to light the hitherto unexplored limitations of the classical Rivlin-Thomas-Greensmith formulas that are routinely used to analyze the trousers test.</description>

Abstract: We consider the dynamical system with boundary control for the vector Schr\"odinger equation on the interval with a non-self-adjoint matrix potential. For this system, we study the inverse problem of recovering the matrix potential from the dynamical Dirichlet--to--Neumann operator. We first provide a method to recover spectral data for an abstract system from dynamic data and apply it to the Schr\"odinger equation. We then develop a strategy for solving the inverse problem for the Schr\"odinger equation using this method with other techniques of the Boundary control method.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study local Hamiltonian operators for multi-component evolutionary differential-difference equations. We address two main problems: the first one is the classification of low order operators for the two-component case. On the one hand, this extends the previously known results in the scalar case; on the other hand, our results include the degenerate cases, going beyond the foundational investigation conducted by Dubrovin. The second problem is the study and the computation of the Poisson cohomology for a two-component (-1,1)-order Hamiltonian operator with degenerate leading term appearing in many integrable differential-difference systems, notably the Toda lattice. The study of its Poisson cohomology sheds light on its deformation theory and the structure of the bi-Hamiltonian pairs where it is included in, as we demonstrate in a series of examples.</description>

      <title>Reductions: precontact versus presymplectic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that contact reductions can be described in terms of symplectic reductions in the traditional Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer as well as the constant rank picture. The point is that we view contact structures as particular (homogeneous) symplectic structures. A group action by contactomorphisms is lifted to a Hamiltonian action on the corresponding symplectic manifold, called the symplectic cover of the contact manifold. In contrast to the majority of the literature in the subject, our approach includes general contact structures (not only co-oriented) and changes the traditional view point: contact Hamiltonians and contact moment maps for contactomorphism groups are no longer defined on the contact manifold itself, but on its symplectic cover. Actually, the developed framework for reductions is slightly more general than purely contact, and includes a precontact and presymplectic setting which is based on the observation that there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes of precontact manifolds and certain homogeneous presymplectic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Alexandrov's Patchwork and the Bonnet--Myers Theorem for Lorentzian length spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present several key results for Lorentzian pre-length spaces with global timelike curvature bounds. Most significantly, we construct a Lorentzian analogue to Alexandrov's Patchwork, thus proving that suitably nice Lorentzian pre-length spaces with local upper timelike curvature bound also satisfy a corresponding global upper bound. Additionally, for spaces with global lower bound on their timelike curvature, we provide a Bonnet--Myers style result, constraining their finite diameter. Throughout, we make the natural comparisons to the metric case, concluding with a discussion of potential applications and ongoing work.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-boundedness of wave operators for fourth order Schr\"odinger operators with zero resonances on $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06763v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $H = \Delta^2 + V$ be the fourth-order Schr\"odinger operator on $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a real-valued fast-decaying potential $V$. If zero is neither a resonance nor an eigenvalue of $H$, then it was recently shown that the wave operators $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ and unbounded at the endpoints $p=1$ and $p=\infty$.
  This paper is to further establish the $L^p$-boundedness of $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ that exhibit all types of singularities at the zero energy threshold. We first prove that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ in the first kind resonance case, and then proceed to establish for the second kind resonance case that they are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; 3$, but not if $3 \le p \le \infty$. In the third kind resonance case, we also show that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;3$ and generically unbounded on $L^p(\R^3)$ for any $3\le p\le\infty$. Moreover, it is also shown that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\R^3)$ for all $3\le p&lt;\infty$ if in addition $H$ has the zero eigenvalue, but no $p$-wave zero resonances and all zero eigenfunctions are orthogonal to $x_ix_jx_kV$ in $L^2(\R^3)$ for all $i,j,k=1,2,3$ with $x=(x_1,x_2,x_3)\in \R^3$.
  These results describe precisely the validity of the $L^p$-boundedness of $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ for all types of singularities at the zero energy threshold with some exceptions for the endpoint cases $p=1,\infty$. As an application, $L^p$-$L^q$ decay estimates are also derived for the fourth-order Schr\"odinger equations and Beam equations with zero resonance singularities.</description>

      <title>Ensemble inequivalence and phase transitions in unlabeled networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discover a first-order phase transition in the canonical ensemble of random unlabeled networks with a prescribed average number of links. The transition is caused by the nonconcavity of microcanonical entropy. Above the critical point coinciding with the graph symmetry phase transition, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles are equivalent and have a well-behaved thermodynamic limit. Below the critical point, the ensemble equivalence is broken, and the canonical ensemble is a mixture of phases: empty networks and networks with average degrees diverging logarithmically with the network size. As a consequence, networks with bounded average degrees do not survive in the thermodynamic limit, decaying into the empty phase. The celebrated percolation transition in labeled networks is thus absent in unlabeled networks. In view of these differences between labeled and unlabeled ensembles, the question of which one should be used as a null model of different real-world networks cannot be ignored.</description>

      <title>Subwavelength Localisation in Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13954v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the different mechanisms of wave localisation in disordered finite systems of subwavelength resonators, where the disorder is in the spatial arrangement of the resonators. To do so, we employ the capacitance matrix formalism and develop a variety of tools to understand localisation in this setting. Namely, we adapt the Thouless criterion of localisation to quantify the various mechanisms of localisation. We also employ a propagation matrix approach to prove a Saxon-Hutner type theorem ensuring the existence of band gaps for disordered systems and to predict the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. We further investigate the stabilities of bandgaps and localised eigenmodes with respect to fluctuations in the system by introducing a method of defect mode prediction based on the discrete Green function and illuminating the phenomena of Anderson localisation and level repulsion under global disorder.</description>

      <title>Shielding of breathers for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a deterministic gas of breathers for the Focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. The gas of breathers is obtained from a $N$-breather solution in the limit $N\to \infty$.\\ The limit is performed at the level of scattering data by letting the $N$-breather spectrum to fill uniformly a suitable compact domain of the complex plane in the limit $N\to\infty$. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function and scaled as $1/N$. For particular choices of the domain and the interpolating function, the gas of breathers behaves as finite breathers solution. This extends the shielding effect discovered in "M. Bertola, T. Grava, and G. Orsatti - Physical Review Letters, 130.12 (2023): 1" for a soliton gas also to a breather gas.</description>

      <title>Generalised Process Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Process theories provide a powerful framework for describing compositional structures across diverse fields, from quantum mechanics to computational linguistics. Traditionally, they have been formalized using symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs). However, various generalizations, including time-neutral, higher-order, and enriched process theories, do not naturally conform to this structure. In this work, we propose an alternative formalization using operad algebras, motivated by recent results connecting SMCs to operadic structures, which captures a broader class of process theories. By leveraging the string-diagrammatic language, we provide an accessible yet rigorous formulation that unifies and extends traditional process-theoretic approaches. Our operadic framework not only recovers standard process theories as a special case but also enables new insights into quantum foundations and compositional structures. This work paves the way for further investigations into the algebraic and operational properties of generalised process theories within an operadic setting.</description>

      <title>Classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the action of a finite group $G$ by locality preserving automorphisms (quantum cellular automata) on quantum spin chains. We refer to such group actions as ``symmetries''. The natural notion of equivalence for such symmetries is \emph{stable equivalence}, which allows for stacking with factorized group actions. Stacking also endows the set of equivalence classes with a group structure. We prove that the anomaly of such symmetries provides an isomorphism between the group of stable equivalence classes of symmetries with the cohomology group $H^3(G,U(1))$, consistent with previous conjectures. This amounts to a complete classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains. We further show that a locality preserving symmetry is stably equivalent to one that can be presented by finite depth quantum circuits with covariant gates if and only if the slant product of its anomaly is trivial in $H^2(G, U(1)[G])$.</description>

      <title>Regular Bohr-Sommerfeld rules for non-self-adjoint Berezin--Toeplitz operators and complex Lagrangian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of real-analytic, non-self-adjoint Berezin--Toeplitz operators, up to exponentially small error, on complex one-dimensional compact manifolds, under the hypothesis of regularity of the energy levels. These results form a complex version of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions; they hold under a hypothesis that the skew-adjoint part is small but can be of principal order with respect to the semiclassical parameter.
  To this end, we develop a calculus of Fourier Integral Operators and Lagrangian states associated with complex Lagrangians; these tools are of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of graphical functions is generalized from scalar theories to theories with spin, leading to a numerator structure in Feynman integrals. The main part of this article treats the case of positive integer spin, which is obtained from spin $1/2$ theories after the evaluation of $\gamma$ traces. As an application (in this article used mainly to prove consistency and efficiency of the method), we calculate primitive Feynman integrals in Yukawa-$\phi^4$ (Gross-Neveu-Yukawa) theory up to loop order eight.</description>
