      <title>Dynamical Sampling in Shift-Invariant Spaces Associated with multi-dimensional Special Affine Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Special Affine Fourier Transformation(SAFT), which generalizes several well-known unitary transformations, has been demonstrated as a valuable tool in signal processing and optics. In this paper, we explore the multivariate dynamical sampling problem in shift-invariant spaces associated with the multi-dimensional SAFT. Specifically, we derive a sufficient and necessary condition under which a function in a shift-invariant space can be stably recovered from its dynamical sampling measurements associated with the multi-dimensional SAFT . We also present a straightforward example to elucidate our main result.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of some rotund properties in terms of farthest points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize rotund, uniformly rotund, locally uniformly rotund and compactly locally uniformly rotund spaces in terms of set of almost farthest points from the unit sphere using the generalized diameter. For this we introduce few notions involving the almost farthest points, namely strongly remotal, strongly uniquely remotal and uniformly strongly uniquely remotal sets. As a consequence, we obtain some characterizations of the aforementioned rotundity properties in terms of existing proximinality notions.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Differentially Private Human Faces Under a Face Radial Curve Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of releasing a Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) 3D human face. The human face is a complex structure with many features and inherently tied to one's identity. Protecting this data, in a formally private way, is important yet challenging given the dimensionality of the problem. We extend approximate DP techniques for functional data to the GDP framework. We further propose a novel representation, face radial curves, of a 3D face as a set of functions and then utilize our proposed GDP functional data mechanism. To preserve the shape of the face while injecting noise we rely on tools from shape analysis for our novel representation of the face. We show that our method preserves the shape of the average face and injects less noise than traditional methods for the same privacy budget. Our mechanism consists of two primary components, the first is generally applicable to function value summaries (as are commonly found in nonparametric statistics or functional data analysis) while the second is general to disk-like surfaces and hence more applicable than just to human faces.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for Random Quadratic Transportation Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the validity of asymptotic limits for the general transportation problem between random i.i.d. points and their common distribution, with respect to the squared Euclidean distance cost, in any dimension larger than three. Previous results were essentially limited to the two (or one) dimensional case, or to distributions whose absolutely continuous part is uniform.
  The proof relies upon recent advances in the stability theory of optimal transportation, combined with functional analytic techniques and some ideas from quantitative stochastic homogenization. The key tool we develop is a quantitative upper bound for the usual quadratic optimal transportation problem in terms of its boundary variant, where points can be freely transported along the boundary. The methods we use are applicable to more general random measures, including occupation measure of Brownian paths, and may open the door to further progress on challenging problems at the interface of analysis, probability, and discrete mathematics.</description>

      <title>Endpoint weak-type bounds beyond Calder\'on-Zygmund theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove weighted weak-type $(r,r)$ estimates for operators satisfying $(r,s)$ limited-range sparse domination of $\ell^q$-type. Our results contain improvements for operators satisfying limited-range and square function sparse domination. In the case of operators $T$ satisfying standard sparse form domination such as Calder\'on-Zygmund operators, we provide a new and simple proof of the sharp bound $$
  \|T\|_{L^1_w(\mathbf{R}^d)\rightarrow L^{1,\infty}_w(\mathbf{R}^d)} \lesssim [w]_1(1+\log [w]_{\text{FW}}). $$</description>

      <title>A Kakutani-Rokhlin decomposition for conditionally ergodic process in the measure-free setting of vector lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently the Kac formula for the conditional expectation of the first recurrence time of a conditionally ergodic conditional expectation preserving system was established in the measure free setting of vector lattices (Riesz spaces). We now give a formulation of the Kakutani-Rokhlin decomposition for conditionally ergodic systems in terms of components of weak order units in a vector lattice. In addition, we prove that every aperiodic conditional expectation preserving system can be approximated by a periodic system.</description>
