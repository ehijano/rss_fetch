      <title>Congestion and Penalization in Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce two novel models derived from the discrete optimal transport problem. The first model extends the traditional transport problem by adding a quadratic congestion factor directly into the cost function, while the second model replaces conventional constraints with weighted penalization terms. We present theoretical contributions, including the study and characterization of interior and corner solution for some specific cases, convergence to the optimal solutions, as well as smooth comparative statics analysis. Finally, we propose an $O((N+L)(NL)^2)$ algorithm for computing the optimal plan for the penalized model assuming interior solutions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Primitives of Transaction Fee Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transaction Fee Mechanism Design studies auctions run by untrusted miners for transaction inclusion in a blockchain. Under previously-considered desiderata, an auction is considered `good' if, informally-speaking, each party (i.e., the miner, the users, and coalitions of both miners and users) has no incentive to deviate from the fixed and pre-determined protocol.
  In this paper, we propose a novel desideratum for transaction fee mechanisms. We say that a TFM is off-chain influence proof when the miner cannot achieve additional revenue by running a separate auction off-chain. While the previously-highlighted EIP-1559 is the gold-standard according to prior desiderata, we show that it does not satisfy off-chain influence proofness. Intuitively, this holds because a Bayesian revenue-maximizing miner can strictly increase profits by persuasively threatening to censor any bids that do not transfer a tip directly to the miner off-chain.
  On the other hand, we reconsider the Cryptographic (multi-party computation assisted) Second Price Auction mechanism, which is technically not `simple for miners' according to previous desiderata (since miners may wish to set a reserve by fabricating bids). We show that, in a slightly different model where the miner is allowed to set the reserve directly, this auction satisfies simplicity for users and miners, and off-chain influence proofness.
  Finally, we prove a strong impossibility result: no mechanism satisfies all previously-considered properties along with off-chain influence proofness, even with unlimited supply, and even after soliciting input from the miner.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Optimal Queueing Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an M/M/1 queueing model where customers can strategically decide to enter or leave the queue. We characterize the class of queueing regimes such that, for any parameters of the model, the socially efficient behavior is an equilibrium outcome.</description>

      <title>Contest design with a finite type-space: A unifying approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the classical contest design problem of allocating a budget across different prizes to maximize effort in a finite type-space environment. For any contest, we characterize the unique symmetric equilibrium. In this equilibrium, different agent types mix over contiguous intervals so that more efficient agents always exert greater effort than less efficient agents. We then solve for the expected equilibrium effort, investigate the effect of increasing competition under linear costs, and identify conditions under which this effect persists under general costs. As a result, we find that the winner-takes-all contest is optimal under linear and concave costs. Lastly, we obtain an equilibrium convergence result for the continuum type-space, and since the finite type-space encompasses the complete information environment as a special case, our analysis offers a unified approach to studying contests in these classical environments.</description>

      <title>A Course in Dynamic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes are derived from a graduate-level course in dynamic optimization, offering an introduction to techniques and models extensively used in management science, economics, operations research, engineering, and computer science. The course emphasizes the theoretical underpinnings of discrete-time dynamic programming models and advanced algorithmic strategies for solving these models. Unlike typical treatments, it provides a proof for the principle of optimality for upper semi-continuous dynamic programming, a middle ground between the simpler countable state space case \cite{bertsekas2012dynamic}, and the involved universally measurable case \cite{bertsekas1996stochastic}. This approach is sufficiently rigorous to include important examples such as dynamic pricing, consumption-savings, and inventory management models. The course also delves into the properties of value and policy functions, leveraging classical results \cite{topkis1998supermodularity} and recent developments. Additionally, it offers an introduction to reinforcement learning, including a formal proof of the convergence of Q-learning algorithms. Furthermore, the notes delve into policy gradient methods for the average reward case, presenting a convergence result for the tabular case in this context. This result is simple and similar to the discounted case but appears to be new.</description>
