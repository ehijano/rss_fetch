      <title>Analysing Multi-Task Regression via Random Matrix Theory with Application to Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel theoretical framework for multi-task regression, applying random matrix theory to provide precise performance estimations, under high-dimensional, non-Gaussian data distributions. We formulate a multi-task optimization problem as a regularization technique to enable single-task models to leverage multi-task learning information. We derive a closed-form solution for multi-task optimization in the context of linear models. Our analysis provides valuable insights by linking the multi-task learning performance to various model statistics such as raw data covariances, signal-generating hyperplanes, noise levels, as well as the size and number of datasets. We finally propose a consistent estimation of training and testing errors, thereby offering a robust foundation for hyperparameter optimization in multi-task regression scenarios. Experimental validations on both synthetic and real-world datasets in regression and multivariate time series forecasting demonstrate improvements on univariate models, incorporating our method into the training loss and thus leveraging multivariate information.</description>

      <title>Active, anytime-valid risk controlling prediction sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rigorously establishing the safety of black-box machine learning models concerning critical risk measures is important for providing guarantees about model behavior. Recently, Bates et. al. (JACM '24) introduced the notion of a risk controlling prediction set (RCPS) for producing prediction sets that are statistically guaranteed low risk from machine learning models. Our method extends this notion to the sequential setting, where we provide guarantees even when the data is collected adaptively, and ensures that the risk guarantee is anytime-valid, i.e., simultaneously holds at all time steps. Further, we propose a framework for constructing RCPSes for active labeling, i.e., allowing one to use a labeling policy that chooses whether to query the true label for each received data point and ensures that the expected proportion of data points whose labels are queried are below a predetermined label budget. We also describe how to use predictors (i.e., the machine learning model for which we provide risk control guarantees) to further improve the utility of our RCPSes by estimating the expected risk conditioned on the covariates. We characterize the optimal choices of label policy and predictor under a fixed label budget and show a regret result that relates the estimation error of the optimal labeling policy and predictor to the wealth process that underlies our RCPSes. Lastly, we present practical ways of formulating label policies and empirically show that our label policies use fewer labels to reach higher utility than naive baseline labeling strategies (e.g., labeling all points, randomly labeling points) on both simulations and real data.</description>

      <title>The Implicit Bias of Adam on Separable Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adam has become one of the most favored optimizers in deep learning problems. Despite its success in practice, numerous mysteries persist regarding its theoretical understanding. In this paper, we study the implicit bias of Adam in linear logistic regression. Specifically, we show that when the training data are linearly separable, Adam converges towards a linear classifier that achieves the maximum $\ell_\infty$-margin. Notably, for a general class of diminishing learning rates, this convergence occurs within polynomial time. Our result shed light on the difference between Adam and (stochastic) gradient descent from a theoretical perspective.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Neural Networks' parameters through Optimal Contraction in a Prediction Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach to ensure the existence and uniqueness of optimal parameters in neural networks. The paper details how a recurrent neural networks (RNN) can be transformed into a contraction in a domain where its parameters are linear. It then demonstrates that a prediction problem modeled through an RNN, with a specific regularization term in the loss function, can have its first-order conditions expressed analytically. This system of equations is reduced to two matrix equations involving Sylvester equations, which can be partially solved. We establish that, if certain conditions are met, optimal parameters exist, are unique, and can be found through a straightforward algorithm to any desired precision. Also, as the number of neurons grows the conditions of convergence become easier to fulfill. Feedforward neural networks (FNNs) are also explored by including linear constraints on parameters. According to our model, incorporating loops (with fixed or variable weights) will produce loss functions that train easier, because it assures the existence of a region where an iterative method converges.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Networks and Machine Learning for COVID-19 Severity Explanation and Demographic Symptom Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the prevailing efforts to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there are still uncertainties that are yet to be discovered about its spread, future impact, and resurgence. In this paper, we present a three-stage data-driven approach to distill the hidden information about COVID-19. The first stage employs a Bayesian network structure learning method to identify the causal relationships among COVID-19 symptoms and their intrinsic demographic variables. As a second stage, the output from the Bayesian network structure learning, serves as a useful guide to train an unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithm that uncovers the similarities in patients' symptoms through clustering. The final stage then leverages the labels obtained from clustering to train a demographic symptom identification (DSID) model which predicts a patient's symptom class and the corresponding demographic probability distribution. We applied our method on the COVID-19 dataset obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. Results from the experiments show a testing accuracy of 99.99\%, as against the 41.15\% accuracy of a heuristic ML method. This strongly reveals the viability of our Bayesian network and ML approach in understanding the relationship between the virus symptoms, and providing insights on patients' stratification towards reducing the severity of the virus.</description>

      <title>Statistical Learning of Distributionally Robust Stochastic Control in Continuous State Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the control of stochastic systems with potentially continuous state and action spaces, characterized by the state dynamics $X_{t+1} = f(X_t, A_t, W_t)$. Here, $X$, $A$, and $W$ represent the state, action, and exogenous random noise processes, respectively, with $f$ denoting a known function that describes state transitions. Traditionally, the noise process $\{W_t, t \geq 0\}$ is assumed to be independent and identically distributed, with a distribution that is either fully known or can be consistently estimated. However, the occurrence of distributional shifts, typical in engineering settings, necessitates the consideration of the robustness of the policy. This paper introduces a distributionally robust stochastic control paradigm that accommodates possibly adaptive adversarial perturbation to the noise distribution within a prescribed ambiguity set. We examine two adversary models: current-action-aware and current-action-unaware, leading to different dynamic programming equations. Furthermore, we characterize the optimal finite sample minimax rates for achieving uniform learning of the robust value function across continuum states under both adversary types, considering ambiguity sets defined by $f_k$-divergence and Wasserstein distance. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework across various real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Improved Algorithms for Contextual Dynamic Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contextual dynamic pricing, a seller sequentially prices goods based on contextual information. Buyers will purchase products only if the prices are below their valuations. The goal of the seller is to design a pricing strategy that collects as much revenue as possible. We focus on two different valuation models. The first assumes that valuations linearly depend on the context and are further distorted by noise. Under minor regularity assumptions, our algorithm achieves an optimal regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$, improving the existing results. The second model removes the linearity assumption, requiring only that the expected buyer valuation is $\beta$-H\"older in the context. For this model, our algorithm obtains a regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{d+2\beta/d+3\beta})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the context space.</description>

      <title>Active clustering with bandit feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the  Active Clustering Problem (ACP). A learner interacts with an $N$-armed stochastic bandit with $d$-dimensional subGaussian feedback. There exists a hidden partition of the arms into $K$ groups, such that arms within the same group, share the same mean vector. The learner's task is to uncover this hidden partition with the smallest budget - i.e., the least number of observation - and with a probability of error smaller than a prescribed constant $\delta$. In this paper, (i) we derive a non-asymptotic lower bound for the budget, and (ii) we introduce the computationally efficient ACB algorithm, whose budget  matches the lower bound in most regimes. We improve on the performance of a uniform sampling strategy. Importantly, contrary to the batch setting, we establish that there is no computation-information gap in the active setting.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Generative Modelling for Divide-and-Conquer MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Divide-and-conquer MCMC is a strategy for parallelising Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling by running independent samplers on disjoint subsets of a dataset and merging their output. An ongoing challenge in the literature is to efficiently perform this merging without imposing distributional assumptions on the posteriors. We propose using diffusion generative modelling to fit density approximations to the subposterior distributions. This approach outperforms existing methods on challenging merging problems, while its computational cost scales more efficiently to high dimensional problems than existing density estimation approaches.</description>

      <title>A Clipped Trip: the Dynamics of SGD with Gradient Clipping in High-Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of modern machine learning is due in part to the adaptive optimization methods that have been developed to deal with the difficulties of training large models over complex datasets. One such method is gradient clipping: a practical procedure with limited theoretical underpinnings. In this work, we study clipping in a least squares problem under streaming SGD. We develop a theoretical analysis of the learning dynamics in the limit of large intrinsic dimension-a model and dataset dependent notion of dimensionality. In this limit we find a deterministic equation that describes the evolution of the loss. We show that with Gaussian noise clipping cannot improve SGD performance. Yet, in other noisy settings, clipping can provide benefits with tuning of the clipping threshold. In these cases, clipping biases updates in a way beneficial to training which cannot be recovered by SGD under any schedule. We conclude with a discussion about the links between high-dimensional clipping and neural network training.</description>

      <title>Joint Linked Component Analysis for Multiview Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose the joint linked component analysis (joint\_LCA) for multiview data. Unlike classic methods which extract the shared components in a sequential manner, the objective of joint\_LCA is to identify the view-specific loading matrices and the rank of the common latent subspace simultaneously. We formulate a matrix decomposition model where a joint structure and an individual structure are present in each data view, which enables us to arrive at a clean svd representation for the cross covariance between any pair of data views. An objective function with a novel penalty term is then proposed to achieve simultaneous estimation and rank selection. In addition, a refitting procedure is employed as a remedy to reduce the shrinkage bias caused by the penalization.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Neural Network Symmetrisation in Markov Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of symmetrising a neural network along a group homomorphism: given a homomorphism $\varphi : H \to G$, we would like a procedure that converts $H$-equivariant neural networks into $G$-equivariant ones. We formulate this in terms of Markov categories, which allows us to consider neural networks whose outputs may be stochastic, but with measure-theoretic details abstracted away. We obtain a flexible, compositional, and generic framework for symmetrisation that relies on minimal assumptions about the structure of the group and the underlying neural network architecture. Our approach recovers existing methods for deterministic symmetrisation as special cases, and extends directly to provide a novel methodology for stochastic symmetrisation also. Beyond this, we believe our findings also demonstrate the utility of Markov categories for addressing problems in machine learning in a conceptual yet mathematically rigorous way.</description>

      <title>A Primal-Dual-Assisted Penalty Approach to Bilevel Optimization with Coupled Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest in bilevel optimization has grown in recent years, partially due to its applications to tackle challenging machine-learning problems. Several exciting recent works have been centered around developing efficient gradient-based algorithms that can solve bilevel optimization problems with provable guarantees. However, the existing literature mainly focuses on bilevel problems either without constraints, or featuring only simple constraints that do not couple variables across the upper and lower levels, excluding a range of complex applications. Our paper studies this challenging but less explored scenario and develops a (fully) first-order algorithm, which we term BLOCC, to tackle BiLevel Optimization problems with Coupled Constraints. We establish rigorous convergence theory for the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on two well-known real-world applications - hyperparameter selection in support vector machine (SVM) and infrastructure planning in transportation networks using the real data from the city of Seville.</description>

      <title>Review and Prospect of Algebraic Research in Equivalent Framework between Statistical Mechanics and Machine Learning Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical equivalence between statistical mechanics and machine learning theory has been known since the 20th century, and researches based on such equivalence has provided novel methodology in both theoretical physics and statistical learning theory. For example, algebraic approach in statistical mechanics such as operator algebra enables us to analyze phase transition phenomena mathematically. In this paper, for theoretical physicists who are interested in artificial intelligence, we review and prospect algebraic researches in machine learning theory. If a learning machine has hierarchical structure or latent variables, then the random Hamiltonian cannot be expressed by any quadratic perturbation because it has singularities. To study an equilibrium state defined by such a singular random Hamiltonian, algebraic approach is necessary to derive asymptotic form of the free energy and the generalization error. We also introduce the most recent advance, in fact,theoretical foundation for alignment of artificial intelligence is now being constructed based on algebraic learning theory. This paper is devoted to the memory of Professor Huzihiro Araki who is a pioneer founder of algebraic research in both statistical mechanics and quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent diffusion causes particles placed in proximity to separate. We investigate the required swimming efforts to maintain a particle close to its passively advected counterpart. We explore optimally balancing these efforts with the intended goal by developing and comparing a novel Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PIRL) strategy with prescribed control (PC) and standard physics-agnostic Reinforcement Learning strategies. Our PIRL scheme, coined the Actor-Physicist, is an adaptation of the Actor-Critic algorithm in which the Neural Network parameterized Critic is replaced with an analytically derived physical heuristic function (the physicist). This strategy is then compared with an analytically computed optimal PC policy derived from a stochastic optimal control formulation and standard physics-agnostic Actor-Critic type algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Interpretable Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can a deep neural network be approximated by a small decision tree based on simple features? This question and its variants are behind the growing demand for machine learning models that are *interpretable* by humans. In this work we study such questions by introducing *interpretable approximations*, a notion that captures the idea of approximating a target concept $c$ by a small aggregation of concepts from some base class $\mathcal{H}$. In particular, we consider the approximation of a binary concept $c$ by decision trees based on a simple class $\mathcal{H}$ (e.g., of bounded VC dimension), and use the tree depth as a measure of complexity. Our primary contribution is the following remarkable trichotomy. For any given pair of $\mathcal{H}$ and $c$, exactly one of these cases holds: (i) $c$ cannot be approximated by $\mathcal{H}$ with arbitrary accuracy; (ii) $c$ can be approximated by $\mathcal{H}$ with arbitrary accuracy, but there exists no universal rate that bounds the complexity of the approximations as a function of the accuracy; or (iii) there exists a constant $\kappa$ that depends only on $\mathcal{H}$ and $c$ such that, for *any* data distribution and *any* desired accuracy level, $c$ can be approximated by $\mathcal{H}$ with a complexity not exceeding $\kappa$. This taxonomy stands in stark contrast to the landscape of supervised classification, which offers a complex array of distribution-free and universally learnable scenarios. We show that, in the case of interpretable approximations, even a slightly nontrivial a-priori guarantee on the complexity of approximations implies approximations with constant (distribution-free and accuracy-free) complexity. We extend our trichotomy to classes $\mathcal{H}$ of unbounded VC dimension and give characterizations of interpretability based on the algebra generated by $\mathcal{H}$.</description>

      <title>Scalable Differentiable Causal Discovery in the Presence of Latent Confounders with Skeleton Posterior (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentiable causal discovery has made significant advancements in the learning of directed acyclic graphs. However, its application to real-world datasets remains restricted due to the ubiquity of latent confounders and the requirement to learn maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs). To date, existing differentiable MAG learning algorithms have been limited to small datasets and failed to scale to larger ones (e.g., with more than 50 variables).
  The key insight in this paper is that the causal skeleton, which is the undirected version of the causal graph, has potential for improving accuracy and reducing the search space of the optimization procedure, thereby enhancing the performance of differentiable causal discovery. Therefore, we seek to address a two-fold challenge to harness the potential of the causal skeleton for differentiable causal discovery in the presence of latent confounders: (1) scalable and accurate estimation of skeleton and (2) universal integration of skeleton estimation with differentiable causal discovery.
  To this end, we propose SPOT (Skeleton Posterior-guided OpTimization), a two-phase framework that harnesses skeleton posterior for differentiable causal discovery in the presence of latent confounders. On the contrary to a ``point-estimation'', SPOT seeks to estimate the posterior distribution of skeletons given the dataset. It first formulates the posterior inference as an instance of amortized inference problem and concretizes it with a supervised causal learning (SCL)-enabled solution to estimate the skeleton posterior. To incorporate the skeleton posterior with differentiable causal discovery, SPOT then features a skeleton posterior-guided stochastic optimization procedure to guide the optimization of MAGs.

      <title>Optimization-based Structural Pruning for Large Language Models without Back-Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared to the moderate size of neural network models, structural weight pruning on the Large-Language Models (LLMs) imposes a novel challenge on the efficiency of the pruning algorithms, due to the heavy computation/memory demands of the LLMs. Recent efficient LLM pruning methods typically operate at the post-training phase without the expensive weight finetuning, however, their pruning criteria often rely on heuristically designed metrics, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. We instead propose a novel optimization-based structural pruning that learns the pruning masks in a probabilistic space directly by optimizing the loss of the pruned model. To preserve the efficiency, our method 1) works at post-training phase} and 2) eliminates the back-propagation through the LLM per se during the optimization (i.e., only requires the forward pass of the LLM). We achieve this by learning an underlying Bernoulli distribution to sample binary pruning masks, where we decouple the Bernoulli parameters from the LLM loss, thus facilitating an efficient optimization via a policy gradient estimator without back-propagation. As a result, our method is able to 1) operate at structural granularities of channels, heads, and layers, 2) support global and heterogeneous pruning (i.e., our method automatically determines different redundancy for different layers), and 3) optionally use a metric-based method as initialization (of our Bernoulli distributions). Extensive experiments on LLaMA, LLaMA-2, and Vicuna using the C4 and WikiText2 datasets demonstrate that our method operates for 2.7 hours with around 35GB memory for the 13B models on a single A100 GPU, and our pruned models outperform the state-of-the-arts w.r.t. perplexity. Codes will be released.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an online decision-making problem with a reward function defined over graph-structured data. We formally formulate the problem as an instance of graph action bandit. We then propose \texttt{GNN-TS}, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) powered Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm which employs a GNN approximator for estimating the mean reward function and the graph neural tangent features for uncertainty estimation. We prove that, under certain boundness assumptions on the reward function, GNN-TS achieves a state-of-the-art regret bound which is (1) sub-linear of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((\tilde{d} T)^{1/2})$ in the number of interaction rounds, $T$, and a notion of effective dimension $\tilde{d}$, and (2) independent of the number of graph nodes. Empirical results validate that our proposed \texttt{GNN-TS} exhibits competitive performance and scales well on graph action bandit problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study seeks to develop an effective strategy based on the novel framework of statistical arbitrage based on graph clustering algorithms. Amalgamation of quantitative and machine learning methods, including the Kelly criterion, and an ensemble of machine learning classifiers have been used to improve risk-adjusted returns and increase immunity to transaction costs over existing approaches. The study seeks to provide an integrated approach to optimal signal detection and risk management. As a part of this approach, innovative ways of optimizing take profit and stop loss functions for daily frequency trading strategies have been proposed and tested. All of the tested approaches outperformed appropriate benchmarks. The best combinations of the techniques and parameters demonstrated significantly better performance metrics than the relevant benchmarks. The results have been obtained under the assumption of realistic transaction costs, but are sensitive to changes in some key parameters.</description>

Abstract: Hyperbolic models can reproduce the heavy-tailed degree distribution, high clustering, and hierarchical structure of empirical networks. Current algorithms for finding the hyperbolic coordinates of networks, however, do not quantify uncertainty in the inferred coordinates. We present BIGUE, a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that samples the posterior distribution of a Bayesian hyperbolic random graph model. We show that combining random walk and random cluster transformations significantly improves mixing compared to the commonly used and state-of-the-art dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. Using this algorithm, we also provide evidence that the posterior distribution cannot be approximated by a multivariate normal distribution, thereby justifying the use of MCMC to quantify the uncertainty of the inferred parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing use of voice-activated systems and speech recognition technologies, the danger of backdoor attacks on audio data has grown significantly. This research looks at a specific type of attack, known as a Stochastic investment-based backdoor attack (MarketBack), in which adversaries strategically manipulate the stylistic properties of audio to fool speech recognition systems. The security and integrity of machine learning models are seriously threatened by backdoor attacks, in order to maintain the reliability of audio applications and systems, the identification of such attacks becomes crucial in the context of audio data. Experimental results demonstrated that MarketBack is feasible to achieve an average attack success rate close to 100% in seven victim models when poisoning less than 1% of the training data.</description>

Abstract: While powerful probabilistic models such as Gaussian Processes naturally have this property, deep neural networks often lack it. In this paper, we introduce Distance Aware Bottleneck (DAB), i.e., a new method for enriching deep neural networks with this property. Building on prior information bottleneck approaches, our method learns a codebook that stores a compressed representation of all inputs seen during training. The distance of a new example from this codebook can serve as an uncertainty estimate for the example. The resulting model is simple to train and provides deterministic uncertainty estimates by a single forward pass. Finally, our method achieves better out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and misclassification prediction than prior methods, including expensive ensemble methods, deep kernel Gaussian Processes, and approaches based on the standard information bottleneck.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Evidential Conformal Prediction (ECP) method for image classifiers to generate the conformal prediction sets. Our method is designed based on a non-conformity score function that has its roots in Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) as a method of quantifying model (epistemic) uncertainty in DNN classifiers. We use evidence that are derived from the logit values of target labels to compute the components of our non-conformity score function: the heuristic notion of uncertainty in CP, uncertainty surprisal, and expected utility. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that ECP outperforms three state-of-the-art methods for generating CP sets, in terms of their set sizes and adaptivity while maintaining the coverage of true labels.</description>

      <title>Improving Reward-Conditioned Policies for Multi-Armed Bandits using Normalized Weight Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently proposed reward-conditioned policies (RCPs) offer an appealing alternative in reinforcement learning. Compared with policy gradient methods, policy learning in RCPs is simpler since it is based on supervised learning, and unlike value-based methods, it does not require optimization in the action space to take actions. However, for multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems, we find that RCPs are slower to converge and have inferior expected rewards at convergence, compared with classic methods such as the upper confidence bound and Thompson sampling. In this work, we show that the performance of RCPs can be enhanced by constructing policies through the marginalization of rewards using normalized weight functions, whose sum or integral equal $1$, although the function values may be negative. We refer to this technique as generalized marginalization, whose advantage is that negative weights for policies conditioned on low rewards can make the resulting policies more distinct from them. Strategies to perform generalized marginalization in MAB with discrete action spaces are studied. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed technique improves RCPs and makes them competitive with classic methods, showing superior performance on challenging MABs with large action spaces and sparse reward signals.</description>

      <title>On the Effectiveness of Supervision in Asymmetric Non-Contrastive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised contrastive representation learning has been shown to be effective in various transfer learning scenarios. However, while asymmetric non-contrastive learning (ANCL) often outperforms its contrastive learning counterpart in self-supervised representation learning, the extension of ANCL to supervised scenarios is less explored. To bridge the gap, we study ANCL for supervised representation learning, coined SupSiam and SupBYOL, leveraging labels in ANCL to achieve better representations. The proposed supervised ANCL framework improves representation learning while avoiding collapse. Our analysis reveals that providing supervision to ANCL reduces intra-class variance, and the contribution of supervision should be adjusted to achieve the best performance. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of supervised ANCL across various datasets and tasks. The code is available at: https://github.com/JH-Oh-23/Sup-ANCL.</description>

      <title>Iterated Schr\"odinger bridge approximation to Wasserstein Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel discretization scheme for Wasserstein gradient flows that involves successively computing Schr\"{o}dinger bridges with the same marginals. This is different from both the forward/geodesic approximation and the backward/Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) approximations. The proposed scheme has two advantages: one, it avoids the use of the score function, and, two, it is amenable to particle-based approximations using the Sinkhorn algorithm. Our proof hinges upon showing that relative entropy between the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge with the same marginals at temperature $\epsilon$ and the joint distribution of a stationary Langevin diffusion at times zero and $\epsilon$ is of the order $o(\epsilon^2)$ with an explicit dependence given by Fisher information. Owing to this inequality, we can show, using a triangular approximation argument, that the interpolated iterated application of the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge approximation converge to the Wasserstein gradient flow, for a class of gradient flows, including the heat flow. The results also provide a probabilistic and rigorous framework for the convergence of the self-attention mechanisms in transformer networks to the solutions of heat flows, first observed in the inspiring work SABP22 in machine learning research.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Intervention Optimization for Causal Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal discovery is crucial for understanding complex systems and informing decisions. While observational data can uncover causal relationships under certain assumptions, it often falls short, making active interventions necessary. Current methods, such as Bayesian and graph-theoretical approaches, do not prioritize decision-making and often rely on ideal conditions or information gain, which is not directly related to hypothesis testing. We propose a novel Bayesian optimization-based method inspired by Bayes factors that aims to maximize the probability of obtaining decisive and correct evidence. Our approach uses observational data to estimate causal models under different hypotheses, evaluates potential interventions pre-experimentally, and iteratively updates priors to refine interventions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through various experiments. Our contributions provide a robust framework for efficient causal discovery through active interventions, enhancing the practical application of theoretical advancements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable machine learning (XML) has emerged as a major challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Although black-box models such as Deep Neural Networks and Gradient Boosting often exhibit exceptional predictive accuracy, their lack of interpretability is a notable drawback, particularly in domains requiring transparency and trust. This paper tackles this core AI problem by proposing a novel method to enhance explainability with minimal accuracy loss, using a Mixture of Linear Models (MLM) estimated under the co-supervision of black-box models. We have developed novel methods for estimating MLM by leveraging AI techniques. Specifically, we explore two approaches for partitioning the input space: agglomerative clustering and decision trees. The agglomerative clustering approach provides greater flexibility in model construction, while the decision tree approach further enhances explainability, yielding a decision tree model with linear or logistic regression models at its leaf nodes. Comparative analyses with widely-used and state-of-the-art predictive models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Experimental results show that statistical models can significantly enhance the explainability of AI, thereby broadening their potential for real-world applications. Our findings highlight the critical role that statistical methodologies can play in advancing explainable AI.</description>

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems are trained on large data corpora to generate new pieces of text, images, videos, and other media. There is growing concern that such systems may infringe on the copyright interests of training data contributors. To address the copyright challenges of generative AI, we propose a framework that compensates copyright owners proportionally to their contributions to the creation of AI-generated content. The metric for contributions is quantitatively determined by leveraging the probabilistic nature of modern generative AI models and using techniques from cooperative game theory in economics. This framework enables a platform where AI developers benefit from access to high-quality training data, thus improving model performance. Meanwhile, copyright owners receive fair compensation, driving the continued provision of relevant data for generative model training. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully identifies the most relevant data sources used in artwork generation, ensuring a fair and interpretable distribution of revenues among copyright owners.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Sampling Flexibility for Low-tubal-rank Tensor Completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Bernoulli sampling is extensively studied in tensor completion, t-CUR sampling approximates low-tubal-rank tensors via lateral and horizontal subtensors. However, both methods lack sufficient flexibility for diverse practical applications. To address this, we introduce Tensor Cross-Concentrated Sampling (t-CCS), a novel and straightforward sampling model that advances the matrix cross-concentrated sampling concept within a tensor framework. t-CCS effectively bridges the gap between Bernoulli and t-CUR sampling, offering additional flexibility that can lead to computational savings in various contexts. A key aspect of our work is the comprehensive theoretical analysis provided. We establish a sufficient condition for the successful recovery of a low-rank tensor from its t-CCS samples. In support of this, we also develop a theoretical framework validating the feasibility of t-CUR via uniform random sampling and conduct a detailed theoretical sampling complexity analysis for tensor completion problems utilizing the general Bernoulli sampling model. Moreover, we introduce an efficient non-convex algorithm, the Iterative t-CUR Tensor Completion (ITCURTC) algorithm, specifically designed to tackle the t-CCS-based tensor completion. We have intensively tested and validated the effectiveness of the t-CCS model and the ITCURTC algorithm across both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ability of deep neural networks to identify the support of the target function. Our findings reveal that mini-batch SGD effectively learns the support in the first layer of the network by shrinking to zero the weights associated with irrelevant components of input. In contrast, we demonstrate that while vanilla GD also approximates the target function, it requires an explicit regularization term to learn the support in the first layer. We prove that this property of mini-batch SGD is due to a second-order implicit regularization effect which is proportional to $\eta / b$ (step size / batch size). Our results are not only another proof that implicit regularization has a significant impact on training optimization dynamics but they also shed light on the structure of the features that are learned by the network. Additionally, they suggest that smaller batches enhance feature interpretability and reduce dependency on initialization.</description>

Abstract: Large matrices arise in many machine learning and data analysis applications, including as representations of datasets, graphs, model weights, and first and second-order derivatives. Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA) is an area which uses randomness to develop improved algorithms for ubiquitous matrix problems. The area has reached a certain level of maturity; but recent hardware trends, efforts to incorporate RandNLA algorithms into core numerical libraries, and advances in machine learning, statistics, and random matrix theory, have lead to new theoretical and practical challenges. This article provides a self-contained overview of RandNLA, in light of these developments.</description>

      <title>Retraining with Predicted Hard Labels Provably Increases Model Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of a model trained with \textit{noisy labels} is often improved by simply \textit{retraining} the model with its own predicted \textit{hard} labels (i.e., $1$/$0$ labels). Yet, a detailed theoretical characterization of this phenomenon is lacking. In this paper, we theoretically analyze retraining in a linearly separable setting with randomly corrupted labels given to us and prove that retraining can improve the population accuracy obtained by initially training with the given (noisy) labels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such theoretical result. Retraining finds application in improving training with label differential privacy (DP) which involves training with noisy labels. We empirically show that retraining selectively on the samples for which the predicted label matches the given label significantly improves label DP training at \textit{no extra privacy cost}; we call this \textit{consensus-based retraining}. For e.g., when training ResNet-18 on CIFAR-100 with $\epsilon=3$ label DP, we obtain $6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy with consensus-based retraining.</description>

      <title>Management Decisions in Manufacturing using Causal Machine Learning -- To Rework, or not to Rework?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a data-driven model for estimating optimal rework policies in manufacturing systems. We consider a single production stage within a multistage, lot-based system that allows for optional rework steps. While the rework decision depends on an intermediate state of the lot and system, the final product inspection, and thus the assessment of the actual yield, is delayed until production is complete. Repair steps are applied uniformly to the lot, potentially improving some of the individual items while degrading others. The challenge is thus to balance potential yield improvement with the rework costs incurred. Given the inherently causal nature of this decision problem, we propose a causal model to estimate yield improvement. We apply methods from causal machine learning, in particular double/debiased machine learning (DML) techniques, to estimate conditional treatment effects from data and derive policies for rework decisions. We validate our decision model using real-world data from opto-electronic semiconductor manufacturing, achieving a yield improvement of 2 - 3% during the color-conversion process of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs).</description>

      <title>DistPred: A Distribution-Free Probabilistic Inference Method for Regression and Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional regression and prediction tasks often only provide deterministic point estimates. To estimate the uncertainty or distribution information of the response variable, methods such as Bayesian inference, model ensembling, or MC Dropout are typically used. These methods either assume that the posterior distribution of samples follows a Gaussian process or require thousands of forward passes for sample generation. We propose a novel approach called DistPred for regression and forecasting tasks, which overcomes the limitations of existing methods while remaining simple and powerful. Specifically, we transform proper scoring rules that measure the discrepancy between the predicted distribution and the target distribution into a differentiable discrete form and use it as a loss function to train the model end-to-end. This allows the model to sample numerous samples in a single forward pass to estimate the potential distribution of the response variable. We have compared our method with several existing approaches on multiple datasets and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, our method significantly improves computational efficiency. For example, compared to state-of-the-art models, DistPred has a 90x faster inference speed. Experimental results can be reproduced through https://github.com/Anoise/DistPred.</description>

      <title>Spillover Detection for Donor Selection in Synthetic Control Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic control (SC) models are widely used to estimate causal effects in settings with observational time-series data. To identify the causal effect on a target unit, SC requires the existence of correlated units that are not impacted by the intervention. Given one of these potential donor units, how can we decide whether it is in fact a valid donor - that is, one not subject to spillover effects from the intervention? Such a decision typically requires appealing to strong a priori domain knowledge specifying the units, which becomes infeasible in situations with large pools of potential donors. In this paper, we introduce a practical, theoretically-grounded donor selection procedure, aiming to weaken this domain knowledge requirement. Our main result is a Theorem that yields the assumptions required to identify donor values at post-intervention time points using only pre-intervention data. We show how this Theorem - and the assumptions underpinning it - can be turned into a practical method for detecting potential spillover effects and excluding invalid donors when constructing SCs. Importantly, we employ sensitivity analysis to formally bound the bias in our SC causal estimate in situations where an excluded donor was indeed valid, or where a selected donor was invalid. Using ideas from the proximal causal inference and instrumental variables literature, we show that the excluded donors can nevertheless be leveraged to further debias causal effect estimates. Finally, we illustrate our donor selection procedure on both simulated and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Just How Flexible are Neural Networks in Practice?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely believed that a neural network can fit a training set containing at least as many samples as it has parameters, underpinning notions of overparameterized and underparameterized models. In practice, however, we only find solutions accessible via our training procedure, including the optimizer and regularizers, limiting flexibility. Moreover, the exact parameterization of the function class, built into an architecture, shapes its loss surface and impacts the minima we find. In this work, we examine the ability of neural networks to fit data in practice. Our findings indicate that: (1) standard optimizers find minima where the model can only fit training sets with significantly fewer samples than it has parameters; (2) convolutional networks are more parameter-efficient than MLPs and ViTs, even on randomly labeled data; (3) while stochastic training is thought to have a regularizing effect, SGD actually finds minima that fit more training data than full-batch gradient descent; (4) the difference in capacity to fit correctly labeled and incorrectly labeled samples can be predictive of generalization; (5) ReLU activation functions result in finding minima that fit more data despite being designed to avoid vanishing and exploding gradients in deep architectures.</description>

      <title>Explainable Artificial Intelligence and Multicollinearity : A Mini Review of Current Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods help to understand the internal mechanism of machine learning models and how they reach a specific decision or made a specific action. The list of informative features is one of the most common output of XAI methods. Multicollinearity is one of the big issue that should be considered when XAI generates the explanation in terms of the most informative features in an AI system. No review has been dedicated to investigate the current approaches to handle such significant issue. In this paper, we provide a review of the current state-of-the-art approaches in relation to the XAI in the context of recent advances in dealing with the multicollinearity issue. To do so, we searched in three repositories that are: Web of Science, Scopus and IEEE Xplore to find pertinent published papers. After excluding irrelevant papers, seven papers were considered in the review. In addition, we discuss the current XAI methods and their limitations in dealing with the multicollinearity and suggest future directions.</description>

      <title>Standardizing Structural Causal Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic datasets generated by structural causal models (SCMs) are commonly used for benchmarking causal structure learning algorithms. However, the variances and pairwise correlations in SCM data tend to increase along the causal ordering. Several popular algorithms exploit these artifacts, possibly leading to conclusions that do not generalize to real-world settings. Existing metrics like $\operatorname{Var}$-sortability and $\operatorname{R^2}$-sortability quantify these patterns, but they do not provide tools to remedy them. To address this, we propose internally-standardized structural causal models (iSCMs), a modification of SCMs that introduces a standardization operation at each variable during the generative process. By construction, iSCMs are not $\operatorname{Var}$-sortable, and as we show experimentally, not $\operatorname{R^2}$-sortable either for commonly-used graph families. Moreover, contrary to the post-hoc standardization of data generated by standard SCMs, we prove that linear iSCMs are less identifiable from prior knowledge on the weights and do not collapse to deterministic relationships in large systems, which may make iSCMs a useful model in causal inference beyond the benchmarking problem studied here.</description>

      <title>Linear Bellman Completeness Suffices for Efficient Online Reinforcement Learning with Few Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most natural approaches to reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation is value iteration, which inductively generates approximations to the optimal value function by solving a sequence of regression problems. To ensure the success of value iteration, it is typically assumed that Bellman completeness holds, which ensures that these regression problems are well-specified. We study the problem of learning an optimal policy under Bellman completeness in the online model of RL with linear function approximation. In the linear setting, while statistically efficient algorithms are known under Bellman completeness (e.g., Jiang et al. (2017); Zanette et al. (2020)), these algorithms all rely on the principle of global optimism which requires solving a nonconvex optimization problem. In particular, it has remained open as to whether computationally efficient algorithms exist. In this paper we give the first polynomial-time algorithm for RL under linear Bellman completeness when the number of actions is any constant.</description>

      <title>ROTI-GCV: Generalized Cross-Validation for right-ROTationally Invariant Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two key tasks in high-dimensional regularized regression are tuning the regularization strength for good predictions and estimating the out-of-sample risk. It is known that the standard approach -- $k$-fold cross-validation -- is inconsistent in modern high-dimensional settings. While leave-one-out and generalized cross-validation remain consistent in some high-dimensional cases, they become inconsistent when samples are dependent or contain heavy-tailed covariates. To model structured sample dependence and heavy tails, we use right-rotationally invariant covariate distributions - a crucial concept from compressed sensing. In the common modern proportional asymptotics regime where the number of features and samples grow comparably, we introduce a new framework, ROTI-GCV, for reliably performing cross-validation. Along the way, we propose new estimators for the signal-to-noise ratio and noise variance under these challenging conditions. We conduct extensive experiments that demonstrate the power of our approach and its superiority over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Is Efficient PAC Learning Possible with an Oracle That Responds 'Yes' or 'No'?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The empirical risk minimization (ERM) principle has been highly impactful in machine learning, leading both to near-optimal theoretical guarantees for ERM-based learning algorithms as well as driving many of the recent empirical successes in deep learning. In this paper, we investigate the question of whether the ability to perform ERM, which computes a hypothesis minimizing empirical risk on a given dataset, is necessary for efficient learning: in particular, is there a weaker oracle than ERM which can nevertheless enable learnability? We answer this question affirmatively, showing that in the realizable setting of PAC learning for binary classification, a concept class can be learned using an oracle which only returns a single bit indicating whether a given dataset is realizable by some concept in the class. The sample complexity and oracle complexity of our algorithm depend polynomially on the VC dimension of the hypothesis class, thus showing that there is only a polynomial price to pay for use of our weaker oracle. Our results extend to the agnostic learning setting with a slight strengthening of the oracle, as well as to the partial concept, multiclass and real-valued learning settings. In the setting of partial concept classes, prior to our work no oracle-efficient algorithms were known, even with a standard ERM oracle. Thus, our results address a question of Alon et al. (2021) who asked whether there are algorithmic principles which enable efficient learnability in this setting.</description>

      <title>BLoB: Bayesian Low-Rank Adaptation by Backpropagation for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from overconfidence during inference, particularly when adapted to downstream domain-specific tasks with limited data. Previous work addresses this issue by employing approximate Bayesian estimation after the LLMs are trained, enabling them to quantify uncertainty. However, such post-training approaches' performance is severely limited by the parameters learned during training. In this paper, we go beyond post-training Bayesianization and propose Bayesian Low-Rank Adaptation by Backpropagation (BLoB), an algorithm that continuously and jointly adjusts both the mean and covariance of LLM parameters throughout the whole fine-tuning process. Our empirical results verify the effectiveness of BLoB in terms of generalization and uncertainty estimation, when evaluated on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an innovative approach for solving high-dimensional Fokker-Planck-L\'evy (FPL) equations in modeling non-Brownian processes across disciplines such as physics, finance, and ecology. We utilize a fractional score function and Physical-informed neural networks (PINN) to lift the curse of dimensionality (CoD) and alleviate numerical overflow from exponentially decaying solutions with dimensions. The introduction of a fractional score function allows us to transform the FPL equation into a second-order partial differential equation without fractional Laplacian and thus can be readily solved with standard physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). We propose two methods to obtain a fractional score function: fractional score matching (FSM) and score-fPINN for fitting the fractional score function. While FSM is more cost-effective, it relies on known conditional distributions. On the other hand, score-fPINN is independent of specific stochastic differential equations (SDEs) but requires evaluating the PINN model's derivatives, which may be more costly. We conduct our experiments on various SDEs and demonstrate numerical stability and effectiveness of our method in dealing with high-dimensional problems, marking a significant advancement in addressing the CoD in FPL equations.</description>

      <title>The Role of Inherent Bellman Error in Offline Reinforcement Learning with Linear Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the offline RL problem with linear function approximation. Our main structural assumption is that the MDP has low inherent Bellman error, which stipulates that linear value functions have linear Bellman backups with respect to the greedy policy. This assumption is natural in that it is essentially the minimal assumption required for value iteration to succeed. We give a computationally efficient algorithm which succeeds under a single-policy coverage condition on the dataset, namely which outputs a policy whose value is at least that of any policy which is well-covered by the dataset. Even in the setting when the inherent Bellman error is 0 (termed linear Bellman completeness), our algorithm yields the first known guarantee under single-policy coverage.
  In the setting of positive inherent Bellman error ${\varepsilon_{\mathrm{BE}}} &gt; 0$, we show that the suboptimality error of our algorithm scales with $\sqrt{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{BE}}}$. Furthermore, we prove that the scaling of the suboptimality with $\sqrt{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{BE}}}$ cannot be improved for any algorithm. Our lower bound stands in contrast to many other settings in reinforcement learning with misspecification, where one can typically obtain performance that degrades linearly with the misspecification error.</description>

      <title>Multiple Descents in Unsupervised Learning: The Role of Noise, Domain Shift and Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of double descent has recently gained attention in supervised learning. It challenges the conventional wisdom of the bias-variance trade-off by showcasing a surprising behavior. As the complexity of the model increases, the test error initially decreases until reaching a certain point where the model starts to overfit the train set, causing the test error to rise. However, deviating from classical theory, the error exhibits another decline when exceeding a certain degree of over-parameterization. We study the presence of double descent in unsupervised learning, an area that has received little attention and is not yet fully understood. We conduct extensive experiments using under-complete auto-encoders (AEs) for various applications, such as dealing with noisy data, domain shifts, and anomalies. We use synthetic and real data and identify model-wise, epoch-wise, and sample-wise double descent for all the aforementioned applications. Finally, we assessed the usability of the AEs for detecting anomalies and mitigating the domain shift between datasets. Our findings indicate that over-parameterized models can improve performance not only in terms of reconstruction, but also in enhancing capabilities for the downstream task.</description>

      <title>Efficient Discovery of Significant Patterns with Few-Shot Resampling</title>

Abstract: Significant pattern mining is a fundamental task in mining transactional data, requiring to identify patterns significantly associated with the value of a given feature, the target. In several applications, such as biomedicine, basket market analysis, and social networks, the goal is to discover patterns whose association with the target is defined with respect to an underlying population, or process, of which the dataset represents only a collection of observations, or samples. A natural way to capture the association of a pattern with the target is to consider its statistical significance, assessing its deviation from the (null) hypothesis of independence between the pattern and the target. While several algorithms have been proposed to find statistically significant patterns, it remains a computationally demanding task, and for complex patterns such as subgroups, no efficient solution exists.
  We present FSR, an efficient algorithm to identify statistically significant patterns with rigorous guarantees on the probability of false discoveries. FSR builds on a novel general framework for mining significant patterns that captures some of the most commonly considered patterns, including itemsets, sequential patterns, and subgroups. FSR uses a small number of resampled datasets, obtained by assigning i.i.d. labels to each transaction, to rigorously bound the supremum deviation of a quality statistic measuring the significance of patterns. FSR builds on novel tight bounds on the supremum deviation that require to mine a small number of resampled datasets, while providing a high effectiveness in discovering significant patterns. As a test case, we consider significant subgroup mining, and our evaluation on several real datasets shows that FSR is effective in discovering significant subgroups, while requiring a small number of resampled datasets.</description>

      <title>Learning sum of diverse features: computational hardness and efficient gradient-based training for ridge combinations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the computational and sample complexity of learning a target function $f_*:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ with additive structure, that is, $f_*(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}}\sum_{m=1}^M f_m(\langle x, v_m\rangle)$, where $f_1,f_2,...,f_M:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ are nonlinear link functions of single-index models (ridge functions) with diverse and near-orthogonal index features $\{v_m\}_{m=1}^M$, and the number of additive tasks $M$ grows with the dimensionality $M\asymp d^\gamma$ for $\gamma\ge 0$. This problem setting is motivated by the classical additive model literature, the recent representation learning theory of two-layer neural network, and large-scale pretraining where the model simultaneously acquires a large number of "skills" that are often localized in distinct parts of the trained network. We prove that a large subset of polynomial $f_*$ can be efficiently learned by gradient descent training of a two-layer neural network, with a polynomial statistical and computational complexity that depends on the number of tasks $M$ and the information exponent of $f_m$, despite the unknown link function and $M$ growing with the dimensionality. We complement this learnability guarantee with computational hardness result by establishing statistical query (SQ) lower bounds for both the correlational SQ and full SQ algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Perspective on Explainable Artificial Intelligence Methods: SHAP and LIME</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have emerged to convert the black box of machine learning (ML) models into a more digestible form. These methods help to communicate how the model works with the aim of making ML models more transparent and increasing the trust of end-users into their output. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanation (LIME) are two widely used XAI methods, particularly with tabular data. In this perspective piece, we discuss the way the explainability metrics of these two methods are generated and propose a framework for interpretation of their outputs, highlighting their weaknesses and strengths. Specifically, we discuss their outcomes in terms of model-dependency and in the presence of collinearity among the features, relying on a case study from the biomedical domain (classification of individuals with or without myocardial infarction). The results indicate that SHAP and LIME are highly affected by the adopted ML model and feature collinearity, raising a note of caution on their usage and interpretation.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Generative Models for Time-Varying Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15742v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the counterfactual outcome of treatment is essential for decision-making in public health and clinical science, among others. Often, treatments are administered in a sequential, time-varying manner, leading to an exponentially increased number of possible counterfactual outcomes. Furthermore, in modern applications, the outcomes are high-dimensional and conventional average treatment effect estimation fails to capture disparities in individuals. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel conditional generative framework capable of producing counterfactual samples under time-varying treatment, without the need for explicit density estimation. Our method carefully addresses the distribution mismatch between the observed and counterfactual distributions via a loss function based on inverse probability re-weighting, and supports integration with state-of-the-art conditional generative models such as the guided diffusion and conditional variational autoencoder. We present a thorough evaluation of our method using both synthetic and real-world data. Our results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating high-quality counterfactual samples and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>SiBBlInGS: Similarity-driven Building-Block Inference using Graphs across States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04817v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series data across scientific domains are often collected under distinct states (e.g., tasks), wherein latent processes (e.g., biological factors) create complex inter- and intra-state variability. A key approach to capture this complexity is to uncover fundamental interpretable units within the data, Building Blocks (BBs), which modulate their activity and adjust their structure across observations. Existing methods for identifying BBs in multi-way data often overlook inter- vs. intra-state variability, produce uninterpretable components, or do not align with properties of real-world data, such as missing samples and sessions of different duration. Here, we present a framework for Similarity-driven Building Block Inference using Graphs across States (SiBBlInGS). SiBBlInGS offers a graph-based dictionary learning approach for discovering sparse BBs along with their temporal traces, based on co-activity patterns and inter- vs. intra-state relationships. Moreover, SiBBlInGS captures per-trial temporal variability and controlled cross-state structural BB adaptations, identifies state-specific vs. state-invariant components, and accommodates variability in the number and duration of observed sessions across states. We demonstrate SiBBlInGS's ability to reveal insights into complex phenomena as well as its robustness to noise and missing samples through several synthetic and real-world examples, including web search and neural data.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Non-Linear Feature Learning with One Gradient Step in Two-Layer Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature learning is thought to be one of the fundamental reasons for the success of deep neural networks. It is rigorously known that in two-layer fully-connected neural networks under certain conditions, one step of gradient descent on the first layer can lead to feature learning; characterized by the appearance of a separated rank-one component -- spike -- in the spectrum of the feature matrix. However, with a constant gradient descent step size, this spike only carries information from the linear component of the target function and therefore learning non-linear components is impossible. We show that with a learning rate that grows with the sample size, such training in fact introduces multiple rank-one components, each corresponding to a specific polynomial feature. We further prove that the limiting large-dimensional and large sample training and test errors of the updated neural networks are fully characterized by these spikes. By precisely analyzing the improvement in the training and test errors, we demonstrate that these non-linear features can enhance learning.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of obtaining sharp bounds for the performance of temporal difference (TD) methods with linear function approximation for policy evaluation in discounted Markov decision processes. We show that a simple algorithm with a universal and instance-independent step size together with Polyak-Ruppert tail averaging is sufficient to obtain near-optimal variance and bias terms. We also provide the respective sample complexity bounds. Our proof technique is based on refined error bounds for linear stochastic approximation together with the novel stability result for the product of random matrices that arise from the TD-type recurrence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While supervised federated learning approaches have enjoyed significant success, the domain of unsupervised federated learning remains relatively underexplored. Several federated EM algorithms have gained popularity in practice, however, their theoretical foundations are often lacking. In this paper, we first introduce a federated gradient EM algorithm (FedGrEM) designed for the unsupervised learning of mixture models, which supplements the existing federated EM algorithms by considering task heterogeneity and potential adversarial attacks. We present a comprehensive finite-sample theory that holds for general mixture models, then apply this general theory on specific statistical models to characterize the explicit estimation error of model parameters and mixture proportions. Our theory elucidates when and how FedGrEM outperforms local single-task learning with insights extending to existing federated EM algorithms. This bridges the gap between their practical success and theoretical understanding. Our numerical results validate our theory, and demonstrate FedGrEM's superiority over existing unsupervised federated learning benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Causal Machine Learning for Cost-Effective Allocation of Development Aid</title>

Abstract: The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations provide a blueprint of a better future by 'leaving no one behind', and, to achieve the SDGs by 2030, poor countries require immense volumes of development aid. In this paper, we develop a causal machine learning framework for predicting heterogeneous treatment effects of aid disbursements to inform effective aid allocation. Specifically, our framework comprises three components: (i) a balancing autoencoder that uses representation learning to embed high-dimensional country characteristics while addressing treatment selection bias; (ii) a counterfactual generator to compute counterfactual outcomes for varying aid volumes to address small sample-size settings; and (iii) an inference model that is used to predict heterogeneous treatment-response curves. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using data with official development aid earmarked to end HIV/AIDS in 105 countries, amounting to more than USD 5.2 billion. For this, we first show that our framework successfully computes heterogeneous treatment-response curves using semi-synthetic data. Then, we demonstrate our framework using real-world HIV data. Our framework points to large opportunities for a more effective aid allocation, suggesting that the total number of new HIV infections could be reduced by up to 3.3% (~50,000 cases) compared to the current allocation practice.</description>

Abstract: Attention-based architectures, in particular transformers, are at the heart of a technological revolution. Interestingly, in addition to helping obtain state-of-the-art results on a wide range of applications, the attention mechanism intrinsically provides meaningful insights on the internal behavior of the model. Can these insights be used as explanations? Debate rages on. In this paper, we mathematically study a simple attention-based architecture and pinpoint the differences between post-hoc and attention-based explanations. We show that they provide quite different results, and that, despite their limitations, post-hoc methods are capable of capturing more useful insights than merely examining the attention weights.</description>

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models have become ubiquitous for generative modeling. The core idea is to transport the data distribution to a Gaussian by using a diffusion. Approximate samples from the data distribution are then obtained by estimating the time-reversal of this diffusion using score matching ideas. We follow here a similar strategy to sample from unnormalized probability densities and compute their normalizing constants. However, the time-reversed diffusion is here simulated by using an original iterative particle scheme relying on a novel score matching loss. Contrary to standard denoising diffusion models, the resulting Particle Denoising Diffusion Sampler (PDDS) provides asymptotically consistent estimates under mild assumptions. We demonstrate PDDS on multimodal and high dimensional sampling tasks.</description>

Abstract: This work provides a theoretical framework for assessing the generalization error of graph neural networks in the over-parameterized regime, where the number of parameters surpasses the quantity of data points. We explore two widely utilized types of graph neural networks: graph convolutional neural networks and message passing graph neural networks. Prior to this study, existing bounds on the generalization error in the over-parametrized regime were uninformative, limiting our understanding of over-parameterized network performance. Our novel approach involves deriving upper bounds within the mean-field regime for evaluating the generalization error of these graph neural networks. We establish upper bounds with a convergence rate of $O(1/n)$, where $n$ is the number of graph samples. These upper bounds offer a theoretical assurance of the networks' performance on unseen data in the challenging over-parameterized regime and overall contribute to our understanding of their performance.</description>

Abstract: The remarkable generalization performance of large-scale models has been challenging the conventional wisdom of the statistical learning theory. Although recent theoretical studies have shed light on this behavior in linear models and nonlinear classifiers, a comprehensive understanding of overparameterization in nonlinear regression models is still lacking. This study explores the predictive properties of overparameterized nonlinear regression within the Bayesian framework, extending the methodology of the adaptive prior considering the intrinsic spectral structure of the data. Posterior contraction is established for generalized linear and single-neuron models with Lipschitz continuous activation functions, demonstrating the consistency in the predictions of the proposed approach. Moreover, the Bayesian framework enables uncertainty estimation of the predictions. The proposed method was validated via numerical simulations and a real data application, showing its ability to achieve accurate predictions and reliable uncertainty estimates. This work provides a theoretical understanding of the advantages of overparameterization and a principled Bayesian approach to large nonlinear models.</description>

      <title>Position: Understanding LLMs Requires More Than Statistical Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The last decade has seen blossoming research in deep learning theory attempting to answer, "Why does deep learning generalize?" A powerful shift in perspective precipitated this progress: the study of overparametrized models in the interpolation regime. In this paper, we argue that another perspective shift is due, since some of the desirable qualities of LLMs are not a consequence of good statistical generalization and require a separate theoretical explanation. Our core argument relies on the observation that AR probabilistic models are inherently non-identifiable: models zero or near-zero KL divergence apart -- thus, equivalent test loss -- can exhibit markedly different behaviors. We support our position with mathematical examples and empirical observations, illustrating why non-identifiability has practical relevance through three case studies: (1) the non-identifiability of zero-shot rule extrapolation; (2) the approximate non-identifiability of in-context learning; and (3) the non-identifiability of fine-tunability. We review promising research directions focusing on LLM-relevant generalization measures, transferability, and inductive biases.</description>

Abstract: Deep nonparametric regression, characterized by the utilization of deep neural networks to learn target functions, has emerged as a focus of research attention in recent years. Despite considerable progress in understanding convergence rates, the absence of asymptotic properties hinders rigorous statistical inference. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework that transforms the deep estimation paradigm into a platform conducive to conditional mean estimation, leveraging the conditional diffusion model. Theoretically, we develop an end-to-end convergence rate for the conditional diffusion model and establish the asymptotic normality of the generated samples. Consequently, we are equipped to construct confidence regions, facilitating robust statistical inference. Furthermore, through numerical experiments, we empirically validate the efficacy of our proposed methodology.</description>

Abstract: Many modern spatio-temporal data sets, in sociology, epidemiology or seismology, for example, exhibit self-exciting characteristics, triggering and clustering behaviors both at the same time, that a suitable Hawkes space-time process can accurately capture. This paper aims to develop a fast and flexible parametric inference technique to recover the parameters of the kernel functions involved in the intensity function of a space-time Hawkes process based on such data. Our statistical approach combines three key ingredients: 1) kernels with finite support are considered, 2) the space-time domain is appropriately discretized, and 3) (approximate) precomputations are used. The inference technique we propose then consists of a $\ell_2$ gradient-based solver that is fast and statistically accurate. In addition to describing the algorithmic aspects, numerical experiments have been carried out on synthetic and real spatio-temporal data, providing solid empirical evidence of the relevance of the proposed methodology.</description>

Abstract: Real-world applications of machine learning models are often subject to legal or policy-based regulations. Some of these regulations require ensuring the validity of the model, i.e., the approximation error being smaller than a threshold. A global metric is generally too insensitive to determine the validity of a specific prediction, whereas evaluating local validity is costly since it requires gathering additional data.We propose learning the model error to acquire a local validity estimate while reducing the amount of required data through active learning. Using model validation benchmarks, we provide empirical evidence that the proposed method can lead to an error model with sufficient discriminative properties using a relatively small amount of data. Furthermore, an increased sensitivity to local changes of the validity bounds compared to alternative approaches is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Benign overfitting in Fixed Dimension via Physics-Informed Learning with Smooth Inductive Bias</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have inspired a surge of research into reconstructing specific quantities of interest from measurements that comply with certain physical laws. These efforts focus on inverse problems that are governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we develop an asymptotic Sobolev norm learning curve for kernel ridge(less) regression when addressing (elliptical) linear inverse problems. Our results show that the PDE operators in the inverse problem can stabilize the variance and even behave benign overfitting for fixed-dimensional problems, exhibiting different behaviors from regression problems. Besides, our investigation also demonstrates the impact of various inductive biases introduced by minimizing different Sobolev norms as a form of implicit regularization. For the regularized least squares estimator, we find that all considered inductive biases can achieve the optimal convergence rate, provided the regularization parameter is appropriately chosen. The convergence rate is actually independent to the choice of (smooth enough) inductive bias for both ridge and ridgeless regression. Surprisingly, our smoothness requirement recovered the condition found in Bayesian setting and extend the conclusion to the minimum norm interpolation estimators.</description>

      <title>On a Novel Application of Wasserstein-Procrustes for Unsupervised Cross-Lingual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.09456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of unsupervised word embeddings, pre-trained on very large monolingual text corpora, is at the core of the ongoing neural revolution in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Initially introduced for English, such pre-trained word embeddings quickly emerged for a number of other languages. Subsequently, there have been a number of attempts to align the embedding spaces across languages, which could enable a number of cross-language NLP applications. Performing the alignment using unsupervised cross-lingual learning (UCL) is especially attractive as it requires little data and often rivals supervised and semi-supervised approaches. Here, we analyze popular methods for UCL and we find that often their objectives are, intrinsically, versions of the Wasserstein-Procrustes problem. Hence, we devise an approach to solve Wasserstein-Procrustes in a direct way, which can be used to refine and to improve popular UCL methods such as iterative closest point (ICP), multilingual unsupervised and supervised embeddings (MUSE) and supervised Procrustes methods. Our evaluation experiments on standard datasets show sizable improvements over these approaches. We believe that our rethinking of the Wasserstein-Procrustes problem could enable further research, thus helping to develop better algorithms for aligning word embeddings across languages. Our code and instructions to reproduce the experiments are available at https://github.com/guillemram97/wp-hungarian.</description>

      <title>FedCVT: Semi-supervised Vertical Federated Learning with Cross-view Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.10838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning allows multiple parties to build machine learning models collaboratively without exposing data. In particular, vertical federated learning (VFL) enables participating parties to build a joint machine learning model based on distributed features of aligned samples. However, VFL requires all parties to share a sufficient amount of aligned samples. In reality, the set of aligned samples may be small, leaving the majority of the non-aligned data unused. In this article, we propose Federated Cross-view Training (FedCVT), a semi-supervised learning approach that improves the performance of the VFL model with limited aligned samples. More specifically, FedCVT estimates representations for missing features, predicts pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples to expand the training set, and trains three classifiers jointly based on different views of the expanded training set to improve the VFL model's performance. FedCVT does not require parties to share their original data and model parameters, thus preserving data privacy. We conduct experiments on NUS-WIDE, Vehicle, and CIFAR10 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that FedCVT significantly outperforms vanilla VFL that only utilizes aligned samples. Finally, we perform ablation studies to investigate the contribution of each component of FedCVT to the performance of FedCVT. Code is available at https://github.com/yankang18/FedCVT</description>

      <title>Plugin Estimation of Smooth Optimal Transport Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.12364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze a number of natural estimators for the optimal transport map between two distributions and show that they are minimax optimal. We adopt the plugin approach: our estimators are simply optimal couplings between measures derived from our observations, appropriately extended so that they define functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$. When the underlying map is assumed to be Lipschitz, we show that computing the optimal coupling between the empirical measures, and extending it using linear smoothers, already gives a minimax optimal estimator. When the underlying map enjoys higher regularity, we show that the optimal coupling between appropriate nonparametric density estimates yields faster rates. Our work also provides new bounds on the risk of corresponding plugin estimators for the quadratic Wasserstein distance, and we show how this problem relates to that of estimating optimal transport maps using stability arguments for smooth and strongly convex Brenier potentials. As an application of our results, we derive central limit theorems for plugin estimators of the squared Wasserstein distance, which are centered at their population counterpart when the underlying distributions have sufficiently smooth densities. In contrast to known central limit theorems for empirical estimators, this result easily lends itself to statistical inference for the quadratic Wasserstein distance.</description>

Abstract: Multi-group agnostic learning is a formal learning criterion that is concerned with the conditional risks of predictors within subgroups of a population. The criterion addresses recent practical concerns such as subgroup fairness and hidden stratification. This paper studies the structure of solutions to the multi-group learning problem, and provides simple and near-optimal algorithms for the learning problem.</description>

      <title>A New Index for Clustering Evaluation Based on Density Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01294v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new index for internal evaluation of clustering is introduced. The index is defined as a mixture of two sub-indices. The first sub-index $ I_a $ is called the Ambiguous Index; the second sub-index $ I_s $ is called the Similarity Index. Calculation of the two sub-indices is based on density estimation to each cluster of a partition of the data. An experiment is conducted to test the performance of the new index, and compared with six other internal clustering evaluation indices -- Calinski-Harabasz index, Silhouette coefficient, Davies-Bouldin index, CDbw, DBCV, and VIASCKDE, on a set of 145 datasets. The result shows the new index significantly improves other internal clustering evaluation indices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between adversarial robustness and differential privacy in high-dimensional algorithmic statistics. We give the first black-box reduction from privacy to robustness which can produce private estimators with optimal tradeoffs among sample complexity, accuracy, and privacy for a wide range of fundamental high-dimensional parameter estimation problems, including mean and covariance estimation. We show that this reduction can be implemented in polynomial time in some important special cases. In particular, using nearly-optimal polynomial-time robust estimators for the mean and covariance of high-dimensional Gaussians which are based on the Sum-of-Squares method, we design the first polynomial-time private estimators for these problems with nearly-optimal samples-accuracy-privacy tradeoffs. Our algorithms are also robust to a nearly optimal fraction of adversarially-corrupted samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06092v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of a fully connected neural network with random Gaussian weights and biases in which the hidden layer widths are proportional to a large constant $n$. Under mild assumptions on the non-linearity, we obtain quantitative bounds on normal approximations valid at large but finite $n$ and any fixed network depth. Our theorems show both for the finite-dimensional distributions and the entire process, that the distance between a random fully connected network (and its derivatives) to the corresponding infinite width Gaussian process scales like $n^{-\gamma}$ for $\gamma&gt;0$, with the exponent depending on the metric used to measure discrepancy. Our bounds are strictly stronger in terms of their dependence on network width than any previously available in the literature; in the one-dimensional case, we also prove that they are optimal, i.e., we establish matching lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Minimax Optimal Q Learning with Nearest Neighbors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing the Markov decision process (MDP) with continuous state spaces is generally challenging. A recent interesting work \cite{shah2018q} solves MDP with bounded continuous state space by a nearest neighbor $Q$ learning approach, which has a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{d+3}(1-\gamma)^{d+7}})$ for $\epsilon$-accurate $Q$ function estimation with discount factor $\gamma$. In this paper, we propose two new nearest neighbor $Q$ learning methods, one for the offline setting and the other for the online setting. We show that the sample complexities of these two methods are $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{d+2}(1-\gamma)^{d+2}})$ and $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{d+2}(1-\gamma)^{d+3}})$ for offline and online methods respectively, which significantly improve over existing results and have minimax optimal dependence over $\epsilon$. We achieve such improvement by utilizing the samples more efficiently. In particular, the method in \cite{shah2018q} clears up all samples after each iteration, thus these samples are somewhat wasted. On the other hand, our offline method does not remove any samples, and our online method only removes samples with time earlier than $\beta t$ at time $t$ with $\beta$ being a tunable parameter, thus our methods significantly reduce the loss of information. Apart from the sample complexity, our methods also have additional advantages of better computational complexity, as well as suitability to unbounded state spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00079v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous literature, backward error analysis was used to find ordinary differential equations (ODEs) approximating the gradient descent trajectory. It was found that finite step sizes implicitly regularize solutions because terms appearing in the ODEs penalize the two-norm of the loss gradients. We prove that the existence of similar implicit regularization in RMSProp and Adam depends on their hyperparameters and the training stage, but with a different "norm" involved: the corresponding ODE terms either penalize the (perturbed) one-norm of the loss gradients or, conversely, impede its reduction (the latter case being typical). We also conduct numerical experiments and discuss how the proven facts can influence generalization.</description>

Abstract: This tutorial serves as an introduction to recently developed non-asymptotic methods in the theory of -- mainly linear -- system identification. We emphasize tools we deem particularly useful for a range of problems in this domain, such as the covering technique, the Hanson-Wright Inequality and the method of self-normalized martingales. We then employ these tools to give streamlined proofs of the performance of various least-squares based estimators for identifying the parameters in autoregressive models. We conclude by sketching out how the ideas presented herein can be extended to certain nonlinear identification problems.</description>

      <title>Choosing a Proxy Metric from Past Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many randomized experiments, the treatment effect of the long-term metric (i.e. the primary outcome of interest) is often difficult or infeasible to measure. Such long-term metrics are often slow to react to changes and sufficiently noisy they are challenging to faithfully estimate in short-horizon experiments. A common alternative is to measure several short-term proxy metrics in the hope they closely track the long-term metric -- so they can be used to effectively guide decision-making in the near-term. We introduce a new statistical framework to both define and construct an optimal proxy metric for use in a homogeneous population of randomized experiments. Our procedure first reduces the construction of an optimal proxy metric in a given experiment to a portfolio optimization problem which depends on the true latent treatment effects and noise level of experiment under consideration. We then denoise the observed treatment effects of the long-term metric and a set of proxies in a historical corpus of randomized experiments to extract estimates of the latent treatment effects for use in the optimization problem. One key insight derived from our approach is that the optimal proxy metric for a given experiment is not apriori fixed; rather it should depend on the sample size (or effective noise level) of the randomized experiment for which it is deployed. To instantiate and evaluate our framework, we employ our methodology in a large corpus of randomized experiments from an industrial recommendation system and construct proxy metrics that perform favorably relative to several baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in statistical methods that exhibit robust performance under distribution changes between training and test data. While most of the related research focuses on point predictions with the squared error loss, this article turns the focus towards probabilistic predictions, which aim to comprehensively quantify the uncertainty of an outcome variable given covariates. Within a causality-inspired framework, we investigate the invariance and robustness of probabilistic predictions with respect to proper scoring rules. We show that arbitrary distribution shifts do not, in general, admit invariant and robust probabilistic predictions, in contrast to the setting of point prediction. We illustrate how to choose evaluation metrics and restrict the class of distribution shifts to allow for identifiability and invariance in the prototypical Gaussian heteroscedastic linear model. Motivated by these findings, we propose a method to yield invariant probabilistic predictions, called IPP, and study the consistency of the underlying parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical performance of our proposed procedure on simulated as well as on single-cell data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the connections between tempering (for Sequential Monte Carlo; SMC) and entropic mirror descent to sample from a target probability distribution whose unnormalized density is known. We establish that tempering SMC corresponds to entropic mirror descent applied to the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and obtain convergence rates for the tempering iterates. Our result motivates the tempering iterates from an optimization point of view, showing that tempering can be seen as a descent scheme of the KL divergence with respect to the Fisher-Rao geometry, in contrast to Langevin dynamics that perform descent of the KL with respect to the Wasserstein-2 geometry. We exploit the connection between tempering and mirror descent iterates to justify common practices in SMC and derive adaptive tempering rules that improve over other alternative benchmarks in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Second-order methods such as KFAC can be useful for neural net training. However, they are often memory-inefficient since their preconditioning Kronecker factors are dense, and numerically unstable in low precision as they require matrix inversion or decomposition. These limitations render such methods unpopular for modern mixed-precision training. We address them by (i) formulating an inverse-free KFAC update and (ii) imposing structures in the Kronecker factors, resulting in structured inverse-free natural gradient descent (SINGD). On modern neural networks, we show that SINGD is memory-efficient and numerically robust, in contrast to KFAC, and often outperforms AdamW even in half precision. Our work closes a gap between first- and second-order methods in modern low-precision training.</description>

      <title>Towards Safe Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization has emerged as a highly effective tool for the safe online optimization of systems, due to its high sample efficiency and noise robustness. To further enhance its efficiency, reduced physical models of the system can be incorporated into the optimization process, accelerating it. These models are able to offer an approximation of the actual system, and evaluating them is significantly cheaper. The similarity between the model and reality is represented by additional hyperparameters, which are learned within the optimization process. Safety is a crucial criterion for online optimization methods such as Bayesian optimization, which has been addressed by recent works that provide safety guarantees under the assumption of known hyperparameters. In practice, however, this does not apply. Therefore, we extend the robust Gaussian process uniform error bounds to meet the multi-task setting, which involves the calculation of a confidence region from the hyperparameter posterior distribution utilizing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Subsequently, the robust safety bounds are employed to facilitate the safe optimization of the system, while incorporating measurements of the models. Simulation results indicate that the optimization can be significantly accelerated for expensive to evaluate functions in comparison to other state-of-the-art safe Bayesian optimization methods, contingent on the fidelity of the models.</description>

      <title>Sketch and shift: a robust decoder for compressive clustering</title>

Abstract: Compressive learning is an emerging approach to drastically reduce the memory footprint of large-scale learning, by first summarizing a large dataset into a low-dimensional sketch vector, and then decoding from this sketch the latent information needed for learning. In light of recent progress on information preservation guarantees for sketches based on random features, a major objective is to design easy-to-tune algorithms (called decoders) to robustly and efficiently extract this information. To address the underlying non-convex optimization problems, various heuristics have been proposed. In the case of compressive clustering, the standard heuristic is CL-OMPR, a variant of sliding Frank-Wolfe. Yet, CL-OMPR is hard to tune, and the examination of its robustness was overlooked. In this work, we undertake a scrutinized examination of CL-OMPR to circumvent its limitations. In particular, we show how this algorithm can fail to recover the clusters even in advantageous scenarios. To gain insight, we show how the deficiencies of this algorithm can be attributed to optimization difficulties related to the structure of a correlation function appearing at core steps of the algorithm. To address these limitations, we propose an alternative decoder offering substantial improvements over CL-OMPR. Its design is notably inspired from the mean shift algorithm, a classic approach to detect the local maxima of kernel density estimators. The proposed algorithm can extract clustering information from a sketch of the MNIST dataset that is 10 times smaller than previously.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for the Pathwise Lasso</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum high-dimensional linear regression algorithm with an $\ell_1$-penalty based on the classical LARS (Least Angle Regression) pathwise algorithm. Similarly to available classical algorithms for Lasso, our quantum algorithm provides the full regularisation path as the penalty term varies, but quadratically faster per iteration under specific conditions. A quadratic speedup on the number of features $d$ is possible by using the quantum minimum-finding routine from D\"urr and Hoyer (arXiv'96) in order to obtain the joining time at each iteration. We then improve upon this simple quantum algorithm and obtain a quadratic speedup both in the number of features $d$ and the number of observations $n$ by using the approximate quantum minimum-finding routine from Chen and de Wolf (ICALP'23). As one of our main contributions, we construct a quantum unitary to approximately compute the joining times to be searched over by the approximate quantum minimum finding. Since the joining times are no longer exactly computed, it is no longer clear that the resulting approximate quantum algorithm obtains a good solution. As our second main contribution, we prove, via an approximate version of the KKT conditions and a duality gap, that the LARS algorithm (and thus our quantum algorithm) is robust to errors. This means that it still outputs a path that minimises the Lasso cost function up to a small error if the joining times are approximately computed. Moreover, we show that, when the observations are sampled from a Gaussian distribution, our quantum algorithm's complexity only depends polylogarithmically on $n$, exponentially better than the classical LARS algorithm, while keeping the quadratic improvement on $d$. Finally, we propose a dequantised algorithm that also retains the polylogarithmic dependence on $n$, albeit with the linear scaling on $d$ from the standard LARS algorithm.</description>

      <title>Sampling and estimation on manifolds using the Langevin diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Error bounds are derived for sampling and estimation using a discretization of an intrinsically defined Langevin diffusion with invariant measure $\text{d}\mu_\phi \propto e^{-\phi} \mathrm{dvol}_g $ on a compact Riemannian manifold. Two estimators of linear functionals of $\mu_\phi $ based on the discretized Markov process are considered: a time-averaging estimator based on a single trajectory and an ensemble-averaging estimator based on multiple independent trajectories. Imposing no restrictions beyond a nominal level of smoothness on $\phi$, first-order error bounds, in discretization step size, on the bias and variance/mean-square error of both estimators are derived. The order of error matches the optimal rate in Euclidean and flat spaces, and leads to a first-order bound on distance between the invariant measure $\mu_\phi$ and a stationary measure of the discretized Markov process. This order is preserved even upon using retractions when exponential maps are unavailable in closed form, thus enhancing practicality of the proposed algorithms. Generality of the proof techniques, which exploit links between two partial differential equations and the semigroup of operators corresponding to the Langevin diffusion, renders them amenable for the study of a more general class of sampling algorithms related to the Langevin diffusion. Conditions for extending analysis to the case of non-compact manifolds are discussed. Numerical illustrations with distributions, log-concave and otherwise, on the manifolds of positive and negative curvature elucidate on the derived bounds and demonstrate practical utility of the sampling algorithm.</description>

      <title>Self-Play Fine-Tuning Converts Weak Language Models to Strong Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harnessing the power of human-annotated data through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is pivotal for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we delve into the prospect of growing a strong LLM out of a weak one without the need for acquiring additional human-annotated data. We propose a new fine-tuning method called Self-Play fIne-tuNing (SPIN), which starts from a supervised fine-tuned model. At the heart of SPIN lies a self-play mechanism, where the LLM refines its capability by playing against instances of itself. More specifically, the LLM generates its own training data from its previous iterations, refining its policy by discerning these self-generated responses from those obtained from human-annotated data. Our method progressively elevates the LLM from a nascent model to a formidable one, unlocking the full potential of human-annotated demonstration data for SFT. Theoretically, we prove that the global optimum to the training objective function of our method is achieved only when the LLM policy aligns with the target data distribution. Empirically, we evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets including the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard, MT-Bench, and datasets from Big-Bench. Our results show that SPIN can significantly improve the LLM's performance across a variety of benchmarks and even outperform models trained through direct preference optimization (DPO) supplemented with extra GPT-4 preference data. This sheds light on the promise of self-play, enabling the achievement of human-level performance in LLMs without the need for expert opponents.

      <title>AFS-BM: Enhancing Model Performance through Adaptive Feature Selection with Binary Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of feature selection in general machine learning (ML) context, which is one of the most critical subjects in the field. Although, there exist many feature selection methods, however, these methods face challenges such as scalability, managing high-dimensional data, dealing with correlated features, adapting to variable feature importance, and integrating domain knowledge. To this end, we introduce the "Adaptive Feature Selection with Binary Masking" (AFS-BM) which remedies these problems. AFS-BM achieves this by joint optimization for simultaneous feature selection and model training. In particular, we do the joint optimization and binary masking to continuously adapt the set of features and model parameters during the training process. This approach leads to significant improvements in model accuracy and a reduction in computational requirements. We provide an extensive set of experiments where we compare AFS-BM with the established feature selection methods using well-known datasets from real-life competitions. Our results show that AFS-BM makes significant improvement in terms of accuracy and requires significantly less computational complexity. This is due to AFS-BM's ability to dynamically adjust to the changing importance of features during the training process, which an important contribution to the field. We openly share our code for the replicability of our results and to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>Two Stones Hit One Bird: Bilevel Positional Encoding for Better Length Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we leverage the intrinsic segmentation of language sequences and design a new positional encoding method called Bilevel Positional Encoding (BiPE). For each position, our BiPE blends an intra-segment encoding and an inter-segment encoding. The intra-segment encoding identifies the locations within a segment and helps the model capture the semantic information therein via absolute positional encoding. The inter-segment encoding specifies the segment index, models the relationships between segments, and aims to improve extrapolation capabilities via relative positional encoding. Theoretical analysis shows this disentanglement of positional information makes learning more effective. The empirical results also show that our BiPE has superior length extrapolation capabilities across a wide range of tasks in diverse text modalities.</description>

      <title>Weakly Convex Regularisers for Inverse Problems: Convergence of Critical Points and Primal-Dual Optimisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational regularisation is the primary method for solving inverse problems, and recently there has been considerable work leveraging deeply learned regularisation for enhanced performance. However, few results exist addressing the convergence of such regularisation, particularly within the context of critical points as opposed to global minimisers. In this paper, we present a generalised formulation of convergent regularisation in terms of critical points, and show that this is achieved by a class of weakly convex regularisers. We prove convergence of the primal-dual hybrid gradient method for the associated variational problem, and, given a Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz condition, an $\mathcal{O}(\log{k}/k)$ ergodic convergence rate. Finally, applying this theory to learned regularisation, we prove universal approximation for input weakly convex neural networks (IWCNN), and show empirically that IWCNNs can lead to improved performance of learned adversarial regularisers for computed tomography (CT) reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Byzantine-Robust Learning: Adapting to Switching Byzantine Workers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Byzantine-robust learning has emerged as a prominent fault-tolerant distributed machine learning framework. However, most techniques focus on the static setting, wherein the identity of Byzantine workers remains unchanged throughout the learning process. This assumption fails to capture real-world dynamic Byzantine behaviors, which may include intermittent malfunctions or targeted, time-limited attacks. Addressing this limitation, we propose DynaBRO -- a new method capable of withstanding any sub-linear number of identity changes across rounds. Specifically, when the number of such changes is $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ (where $T$ is the total number of training rounds), DynaBRO nearly matches the state-of-the-art asymptotic convergence rate of the static setting. Our method utilizes a multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) gradient estimation technique applied at the server to robustly aggregated worker updates. By additionally leveraging an adaptive learning rate, we circumvent the need for prior knowledge of the fraction of Byzantine workers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A dataset is confounded if it is most easily solved via a spurious correlation, which fails to generalize to new data. In this work, we show that, in a continual learning setting where confounders may vary in time across tasks, the challenge of mitigating the effect of confounders far exceeds the standard forgetting problem normally considered. In particular, we provide a formal description of such continual confounders and identify that, in general, spurious correlations are easily ignored when training for all tasks jointly, but it is harder to avoid confounding when they are considered sequentially. These descriptions serve as a basis for constructing a novel CLEVR-based continually confounded dataset, which we term the ConCon dataset. Our evaluations demonstrate that standard continual learning methods fail to ignore the dataset's confounders. Overall, our work highlights the challenges of confounding factors, particularly in continual learning settings, and demonstrates the need for developing continual learning methods to robustly tackle these.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inner products of neural network feature maps arise in a wide variety of machine learning frameworks as a method of modeling relations between inputs. This work studies the approximation properties of inner products of neural networks. It is shown that the inner product of a multi-layer perceptron with itself is a universal approximator for symmetric positive-definite relation functions. In the case of asymmetric relation functions, it is shown that the inner product of two different multi-layer perceptrons is a universal approximator. In both cases, a bound is obtained on the number of neurons required to achieve a given accuracy of approximation. In the symmetric case, the function class can be identified with kernels of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, whereas in the asymmetric case the function class can be identified with kernels of reproducing kernel Banach spaces. Finally, these approximation results are applied to analyzing the attention mechanism underlying Transformers, showing that any retrieval mechanism defined by an abstract preorder can be approximated by attention through its inner product relations. This result uses the Debreu representation theorem in economics to represent preference relations in terms of utility functions.</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise as a technology that can be used to improve government and economic policy-making. This paper proposes a new research agenda towards this end by introducing Social Environment Design, a general framework for the use of AI for automated policy-making that connects with the Reinforcement Learning, EconCS, and Computational Social Choice communities. The framework seeks to capture general economic environments, includes voting on policy objectives, and gives a direction for the systematic analysis of government and economic policy through AI simulation. We highlight key open problems for future research in AI-based policy-making. By solving these challenges, we hope to achieve various social welfare objectives, thereby promoting more ethical and responsible decision making.</description>

Abstract: Imaging is the process of transforming noisy, incomplete data into a space that humans can interpret. NIFTy is a Bayesian framework for imaging and has already successfully been applied to many fields in astrophysics. Previous design decisions held the performance and the development of methods in NIFTy back. We present a rewrite of NIFTy, coined NIFTy.re, which reworks the modeling principle, extends the inference strategies, and outsources much of the heavy lifting to JAX. The rewrite dramatically accelerates models written in NIFTy, lays the foundation for new types of inference machineries, improves maintainability, and enables interoperability between NIFTy and the JAX machine learning ecosystem.</description>

      <title>A Sparsity Principle for Partially Observable Causal Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal representation learning aims at identifying high-level causal variables from perceptual data. Most methods assume that all latent causal variables are captured in the high-dimensional observations. We instead consider a partially observed setting, in which each measurement only provides information about a subset of the underlying causal state. Prior work has studied this setting with multiple domains or views, each depending on a fixed subset of latents. Here, we focus on learning from unpaired observations from a dataset with an instance-dependent partial observability pattern. Our main contribution is to establish two identifiability results for this setting: one for linear mixing functions without parametric assumptions on the underlying causal model, and one for piecewise linear mixing functions with Gaussian latent causal variables. Based on these insights, we propose two methods for estimating the underlying causal variables by enforcing sparsity in the inferred representation. Experiments on different simulated datasets and established benchmarks highlight the effectiveness of our approach in recovering the ground-truth latents.</description>

      <title>KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19756v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes ("neurons"), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges ("weights"). KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.</description>

Abstract: Schr\"odinger bridge is a diffusion process that steers a given distribution to another in a prescribed time while minimizing the effort to do so. It can be seen as the stochastic dynamical version of the optimal mass transport, and has growing applications in generative diffusion models and stochastic optimal control. In this work, we propose a regularized variant of the Schr\"odinger bridge with a quadratic state cost-to-go that incentivizes the optimal sample paths to stay close to a nominal level. Unlike the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge, the regularization induces a state-dependent rate of killing and creation of probability mass, and its solution requires determining the Markov kernel of a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation. We derive this Markov kernel in closed form. Our solution recovers the heat kernel in the vanishing regularization (i.e., diffusion without reaction) limit, thereby recovering the solution of the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge. Our results enable the use of dynamic Sinkhorn recursion for computing the Schr\"odinger bridge with a quadratic state cost-to-go, which would otherwise be challenging to use in this setting. We deduce properties of the new kernel and explain its connections with certain exactly solvable models in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Improving GFlowNets for Text-to-Image Diffusion Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00633</link>

Abstract: Diffusion models have become the de-facto approach for generating visual data, which are trained to match the distribution of the training dataset. In addition, we also want to control generation to fulfill desired properties such as alignment to a text description, which can be specified with a black-box reward function. Prior works fine-tune pretrained diffusion models to achieve this goal through reinforcement learning-based algorithms. Nonetheless, they suffer from issues including slow credit assignment as well as low quality in their generated samples. In this work, we explore techniques that do not directly maximize the reward but rather generate high-reward images with relatively high probability -- a natural scenario for the framework of generative flow networks (GFlowNets). To this end, we propose the Diffusion Alignment with GFlowNet (DAG) algorithm to post-train diffusion models with black-box property functions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion and various reward specifications corroborate that our method could effectively align large-scale text-to-image diffusion models with given reward information.</description>

      <title>A tutorial on fairness in machine learning in healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\textbf{OBJECTIVE}$: Ensuring that machine learning (ML) algorithms are safe and effective within all patient groups, and do not disadvantage particular patients, is essential to clinical decision making and preventing the reinforcement of existing healthcare inequities. The objective of this tutorial is to introduce the medical informatics community to the common notions of fairness within ML, focusing on clinical applications and implementation in practice.
  $\textbf{TARGET AUDIENCE}$: As gaps in fairness arise in a variety of healthcare applications, this tutorial is designed to provide an understanding of fairness, without assuming prior knowledge, to researchers and clinicians who make use of modern clinical data.
  $\textbf{SCOPE}$: We describe the fundamental concepts and methods used to define fairness in ML, including an overview of why models in healthcare may be unfair, a summary and comparison of the metrics used to quantify fairness, and a discussion of some ongoing research. We illustrate some of the fairness methods introduced through a case study of mortality prediction in a publicly available electronic health record dataset. Finally, we provide a user-friendly R package for comprehensive group fairness evaluation, enabling researchers and clinicians to assess fairness in their own ML work.</description>
