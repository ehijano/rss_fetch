      <title>RIS Constructing 6G Near-field Networks: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field propagation, particularly that enabled by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), has emerged as a promising research topic in recent years. However, a comprehensive literature review on RIS-based near-field technologies is still lacking. This article aims to fill this gap by providing a brief overview of near-field concepts and a systematic survey of the state-of-the-art RIS-based near-field technologies. The focus is on three key aspects: the construction of ubiquitous near-field wireless propagation environments using RIS, the enabling of new near-field paradigms for 6G networks through RIS, and the challenges faced by RIS-based near-field technologies. This technical review intends to facilitate the development and innovation of RIS-based near-field technologies.</description>

      <title>Research on the evolution of smart meter technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart meter is not only a device used to measure the amount of electricity, but also a core component of the smart grid, realizing the efficient monitoring, prediction and management of power use. With an insight into the evolution of smart meter technology, I realized that this change didn't happen overnight. It has undergone a long journey from the initial mechanical electricity meters to the electronic electricity meters, and now to the highly intelligent electricity meters. Technological breakthroughs at each stage have laid the foundation for the final form of smart meters. In the era of mechanical watt-hour meters, the measurement of electric energy mainly depends on the rotation and counting of mechanical structures. The accuracy and stability of this method are affected by mechanical wear, environmental interference and other factors, and it is difficult to meet the increasing demand for power management. With the rapid development of electronic technology, the electronic electricity meter came into being. It uses electronic technology to sample and process the current and voltage, which greatly improves the accuracy and stability of the measurement. At the same time, the electronic electricity meter also has the function of remote meter reading and data processing, which has brought great convenience to the power management. However, there still have some limitations, such as the complexity of data processing and the limitation of communication capacity. It is these challenges that drive the creation of smart power meters. smart meters combine advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things, big data and cloud computing to realize the real-time monitoring, analysis and prediction of the use of power.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Heart Failure Risk Estimation based on Short ECG and Sampled Long-Term HRV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases, including Heart Failure (HF), remain a leading global cause of mortality, often evading early detection. In this context, accessible and effective risk assessment is indispensable. Traditional approaches rely on resource-intensive diagnostic tests, typically administered after the onset of symptoms. The widespread availability of electrocardiogram (ECG) technology and the power of Machine Learning are emerging as viable alternatives within smart healthcare. In this paper, we propose several multi-modal approaches that combine 30-second ECG recordings and approximate long-term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data to estimate the risk of HF hospitalization. We introduce two survival models: an XGBoost model with Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) incorporating comprehensive ECG features and a ResNet model that learns from the raw ECG. We extend these with our novel long-term HRVs extracted from the combination of ultra-short-term beat-to-beat measurements taken over the day. To capture their temporal dynamics, we propose a survival model comprising ResNet and Transformer architectures (TFM-ResNet). Our experiments demonstrate high model performance for HF risk assessment with a concordance index of 0.8537 compared to 14 survival models and competitive discrimination power on various external ECG datasets. After transferability tests with Apple Watch data, our approach implemented in the myHeartScore App offers cost-effective and highly accessible HF risk assessment, contributing to its prevention and management.</description>

      <title>Coupled generator decomposition for fusion of electro- and magnetoencephalography data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data fusion modeling can identify common features across diverse data sources while accounting for source-specific variability. Here we introduce the concept of a \textit{coupled generator decomposition} and demonstrate how it generalizes sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) for data fusion. Leveraging data from a multisubject, multimodal (electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG and MEG)) neuroimaging experiment, we demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in identifying common features in response to face perception stimuli, while accommodating modality- and subject-specific variability. Through split-half cross-validation of EEG/MEG trials, we investigate the optimal model order and regularization strengths for models of varying complexity, comparing these to a group-level model assuming shared brain responses to stimuli. Our findings reveal altered $\sim170ms$ fusiform face area activation for scrambled faces, as opposed to real faces, particularly evident in the multimodal, multisubject model. Model parameters were inferred using stochastic optimization in PyTorch, demonstrating comparable performance to conventional quadratic programming inference for SPCA but with considerably faster execution. We provide an easily accessible toolbox for coupled generator decomposition that includes data fusion for SPCA, archetypal analysis and directional archetypal analysis. Overall, our approach offers a promising new avenue for data fusion.</description>

      <title>Secure and Energy-efficient Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-enabled Visible Light Communication via A Multi-objective Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, a unique approach to provide communication service for terrestrial receivers via using unmanned aerial vehicle-enabled visible light communication is investigated. Specifically, we take into account a unmanned aerial vehicle-enabled visible light communication scenario with multiplex transmitters, multiplex receivers, and a single eavesdropper, each of which is equipped with a single photodetector. Then, a unmanned aerial vehicle deployment multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to simultaneously make the optical power received by receiving surface more uniform, minimize the amount of information collected by a eavesdropper, and minimize the energy consumption of unmanned aerial vehicles, while the locations and transmission power of unmanned aerial vehicles are simultaneously optimized under certain constraints. Since the formulated unmanned aerial vehicle deployment multi-objective optimization problem is complex and nonlinear, it is challenging to be tackled by using conventional methods. For the purpose of solving the problem, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition with chaos initiation and crossover mutation is proposed. Simulation outcomes show that the proposed approach is superior to other approaches, and is efficient at improving the security and energy efficiency of visible light communication system.</description>

      <title>UAV Deployment Optimization in UAV-assisted Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the fact that the locations of base stations (BSs) cannot be changed after they are installed, it is very difficult to communicate directly with remote user equipment (UE), which will directly affect the lifespan of the system. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a hopeful solution as mobile relays for fifth-generation wireless communications due to the flexible and cost-effective deployment. However, with the limited onboard energy of UAV and slow progress in energy storage technology, it is a key challenge to achieve the energy-efficient communication. Therefore, in this article, we study a wireless communication network using a UAV as a high-altitude relay, and formulate a UAV relay deployment optimization problem (URDOP) to minimize the energy consumption of system by optimizing the deployment of UAV, including the locations and number of UAV hover points. Since the formulated URDOP is a mixed-integer programming problem, it presents a significant challenge for conventional gradient-based approaches. To this end, we propose a self-adaptive differential evolution with a variable population size (SaDEVPS) algorithm to solve the formulated URDOP. The performance of proposed SaDEVPS is verified through simulations, and the results show that it can successfully decrease the energy consumption of system when compared to other benchmark algorithms across multiple instances.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed and Unsupervised Riemannian Domain Adaptation for Machine Learning on Heterogeneous EEG Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets for supervised machine learning (ML) is challenging due to session, subject, and device variability. ML algorithms typically require identical features at train and test time, complicating analysis due to varying sensor numbers and positions across datasets. Simple channel selection discards valuable data, leading to poorer performance, especially with datasets sharing few channels. To address this, we propose an unsupervised approach leveraging EEG signal physics. We map EEG channels to fixed positions using field interpolation, facilitating source-free domain adaptation. Leveraging Riemannian geometry classification pipelines and transfer learning steps, our method demonstrates robust performance in brain-computer interface (BCI) tasks and potential biomarker applications. Comparative analysis against a statistical-based approach known as Dimensionality Transcending, a signal-based imputation called ComImp, source-dependent methods, as well as common channel selection and spherical spline interpolation, was conducted with leave-one-dataset-out validation on six public BCI datasets for a right-hand/left-hand classification task. Numerical experiments show that in the presence of few shared channels in train and test, the field interpolation consistently outperforms other methods, demonstrating enhanced classification performance across all datasets. When more channels are shared, field interpolation was found to be competitive with other methods and faster to compute than source-dependent methods.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Analysis of Touch-Tone Frequency Recognition in Two-Way Radio Systems for Dialed Telephone Number Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on recognizing dialed numbers in a touch-tone telephone system based on the Dual Tone MultiFrequency (DTMF) signaling technique with analysis of stochastic aspects during the noise and random duration of characters. Each dialed digit's acoustic profile is derived from a composite of two carrier frequencies, distinctly assigned to represent that digit. The identification of each digit is achieved by pinpointing the frequency pair with the highest energy or amplitude in its spectral output, utilizing the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT). This analysis includes simulations that illustrate the effects of introducing stochastic variations during the "Mark" and "Space" intervals of the decoding process, offering insights into the technique's efficacy and the impact of random temporal fluctuations. This will reduce the accuracy of decoder decoding and lower the SNR of the system.</description>

      <title>Agile gesture recognition for low-power applications: customisation for generalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated hand gesture recognition has long been a focal point in the AI community. Traditionally, research in this field has predominantly focused on scenarios with access to a continuous flow of hand's images. This focus has been driven by the widespread use of cameras and the abundant availability of image data. However, there is an increasing demand for gesture recognition technologies that operate on low-power sensor devices. This is due to the rising concerns for data leakage and end-user privacy, as well as the limited battery capacity and the computing power in low-cost devices. Moreover, the challenge in data collection for individually designed hardware also hinders the generalisation of a gesture recognition model.
  In this study, we unveil a novel methodology for pattern recognition systems using adaptive and agile error correction, designed to enhance the performance of legacy gesture recognition models on devices with limited battery capacity and computing power. This system comprises a compact Support Vector Machine as the base model for live gesture recognition. Additionally, it features an adaptive agile error corrector that employs few-shot learning within the feature space induced by high-dimensional kernel mappings. The error corrector can be customised for each user, allowing for dynamic adjustments to the gesture prediction based on their movement patterns while maintaining the agile performance of its base model on a low-cost and low-power micro-controller. This proposed system is distinguished by its compact size, rapid processing speed, and low power consumption, making it ideal for a wide range of embedded systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Techniques for Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition with Data Heterogeneity -- A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is crucial in ubiquitous computing, analysing behaviours through multi-dimensional observations. Despite research progress, HAR confronts challenges, particularly in data distribution assumptions. Most studies often assume uniform data distributions across datasets, contrasting with the varied nature of practical sensor data in human activities. Addressing data heterogeneity issues can improve performance, reduce computational costs, and aid in developing personalized, adaptive models with less annotated data. This review investigates how machine learning addresses data heterogeneity in HAR, by categorizing data heterogeneity types, applying corresponding suitable machine learning methods, summarizing available datasets, and discussing future challenges.</description>

      <title>Cross-user activity recognition via temporal relation optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current research on human activity recognition (HAR) mainly assumes that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution to achieve a generalised model, which means all the data are considered to be independent and identically distributed $\displaystyle (i.i.d.) $. In many real-world applications, this assumption does not hold, and collected training and target testing datasets have non-uniform distribution, such as in the case of cross-user HAR. Domain adaptation is a promising approach for cross-user HAR tasks. Existing domain adaptation works based on the assumption that samples in each domain are $\displaystyle i.i.d. $ and do not consider the knowledge of temporal relation hidden in time series data for aligning data distribution. This strong assumption of $\displaystyle i.i.d. $ may not be suitable for time series-related domain adaptation methods because the samples formed by time series segmentation and feature extraction techniques are only coarse approximations to $\displaystyle i.i.d. $ assumption in each domain. In this paper, we propose the temporal relation optimal transport (TROT) method to utilise temporal relation and relax the $\displaystyle i.i.d. $ assumption for the samples in each domain for accurate and efficient knowledge transfer. We obtain the temporal relation representation and implement temporal relation alignment of activities via the Hidden Markov model (HMM) and optimal transport (OT) techniques. Besides, a new regularisation term that preserves temporal relation order information for an improved optimal transport mapping is proposed to enhance the domain adaptation performance. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on three public activity recognition datasets (i.e. OPPT, PAMAP2 and DSADS), demonstrating that TROT outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Cross-user activity recognition using deep domain adaptation with temporal relation information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a cornerstone of ubiquitous computing, with promising applications in diverse fields such as health monitoring and ambient assisted living. Despite significant advancements, sensor-based HAR methods often operate under the assumption that training and testing data have identical distributions. However, in many real-world scenarios, particularly in sensor-based HAR, this assumption is invalidated by out-of-distribution ($\displaystyle o.o.d.$) challenges, including differences from heterogeneous sensors, change over time, and individual behavioural variability. This paper centres on the latter, exploring the cross-user HAR problem where behavioural variability across individuals results in differing data distributions. To address this challenge, we introduce the Deep Temporal State Domain Adaptation (DTSDA) model, an innovative approach tailored for time series domain adaptation in cross-user HAR. Contrary to the common assumption of sample independence in existing domain adaptation approaches, DTSDA recognizes and harnesses the inherent temporal relations in the data. Therefore, we introduce 'Temporal State', a concept that defined the different sub-activities within an activity, consistent across different users. We ensure these sub-activities follow a logical time sequence through 'Temporal Consistency' property and propose the 'Pseudo Temporal State Labeling' method to identify the user-invariant temporal relations. Moreover, the design principle of DTSDA integrates adversarial learning for better domain adaptation. Comprehensive evaluations on three HAR datasets demonstrate DTSDA's superior performance in cross-user HAR applications by briding individual behavioral variability using temporal relations across sub-activities.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-Enabled Multifunctional Single-Frequency Sensors without External Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IoT sensors are crucial for visualizing multidimensional and multimodal information and enabling future IT applications/services such as cyber-physical space, digital twins, autonomous driving, smart cities, and virtual/augmented reality (VR or AR). However, IoT sensors need to be battery-free to realistically manage and maintain the growing number of available sensing devices. Here, we provide a novel sensor design approach that employs metasurfaces to enable multifunctional sensing without requiring an external power source. Importantly, unlike existing metasurface-based sensors, our metasurfaces can sense multiple physical parameters even at a fixed frequency by breaking classic harmonic oscillations in the time domain, making the proposed sensors viable for usage with limited frequency resources. Moreover, we provide a method for predicting physical parameters using the machine learning-based approach of random forest regression. The sensing performance was confirmed by estimating temperature and light intensity, and excellent determination coefficients larger than 0.96 were achieved. Our study affords new opportunities for sensing multiple physical properties without relying on an external power source or needing multiple frequencies, which markedly simplifies and facilitates the design of next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Transferring BCI models from calibration to control: Observing shifts in EEG features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public Motor Imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI) datasets are being used to develop increasingly good classifiers. However, they usually follow discrete paradigms where participants perform Motor Imagery at regularly timed intervals. It is often unclear what changes may happen in the EEG patterns when users attempt to perform a control task with such a BCI. This may lead to generalisation errors. We demonstrate a new paradigm containing a standard calibration session and a novel BCI control session based on EMG. This allows us to observe similarities in sensorimotor rhythms, and observe the additional preparation effects introduced by the control paradigm. In the Movement Related Cortical Potentials we found large differences between the calibration and control sessions. We demonstrate a CSP-based Machine Learning model trained on the calibration data that can make surprisingly good predictions on the BCI-controlled driving data.</description>

      <title>BRIEDGE: EEG-Adaptive Edge AI for Multi-Brain to Multi-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in EEG-based BCI technologies have revealed the potential of brain-to-robot collaboration through the integration of sensing, computing, communication, and control. In this paper, we present BRIEDGE as an end-to-end system for multi-brain to multi-robot interaction through an EEG-adaptive neural network and an encoding-decoding communication framework, as illustrated in Fig.1. As depicted, the edge mobile server or edge portable server will collect EEG data from the users and utilize the EEG-adaptive neural network to identify the users' intentions. The encoding-decoding communication framework then encodes the EEG-based semantic information and decodes it into commands in the process of data transmission. To better extract the joint features of heterogeneous EEG data as well as enhance classification accuracy, BRIEDGE introduces an informer-based ProbSparse self-attention mechanism. Meanwhile, parallel and secure transmissions for multi-user multi-task scenarios under physical channels are addressed by dynamic autoencoder and autodecoder communications. From mobile computing and edge AI perspectives, model compression schemes composed of pruning, weight sharing, and quantization are also used to deploy lightweight EEG-adaptive models running on both transmitter and receiver sides. Based on the effectiveness of these components, a code map representing various commands enables multiple users to control multiple intelligent agents concurrently. Our experiments in comparison with state-of-the-art works show that BRIEDGE achieves the best classification accuracy of heterogeneous EEG data, and more stable performance under noisy environments.</description>

      <title>HyPer-EP: Meta-Learning Hybrid Personalized Models for Cardiac Electrophysiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized virtual heart models have demonstrated increasing potential for clinical use, although the estimation of their parameters given patient-specific data remain a challenge. Traditional physics-based modeling approaches are computationally costly and often neglect the inherent structural errors in these models due to model simplifications and assumptions. Modern deep learning approaches, on the other hand, rely heavily on data supervision and lacks interpretability. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid modeling framework to describe a personalized cardiac digital twin as a combination of a physics-based known expression augmented by neural network modeling of its unknown gap to reality. We then present a novel meta-learning framework to enable the separate identification of both the physics-based and neural components in the hybrid model. We demonstrate the feasibility and generality of this hybrid modeling framework with two examples of instantiations and their proof-of-concept in synthetic experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Brain-Computer Interfaces, we propose an adaptive method that reaches offline performance level while being usable online without requiring supervision. Interestingly, our method does not require retraining the model, as it consists in using a frozen efficient deep learning backbone while continuously realigning data, both at input and latent spaces, based on streaming observations. We demonstrate its efficiency for Motor Imagery brain decoding from electroencephalography data, considering challenging cross-subject scenarios. For reproducibility, we share the code of our experiments.</description>

      <title>Introducing an ensemble method for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease through the analysis of PET scan images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects cognitive functions such as memory, thinking, and behavior. In this disease, there is a critical phase, mild cognitive impairment, that is really important to be diagnosed early since some patients with progressive MCI will develop the disease. This study delves into the challenging task of classifying Alzheimer's disease into four distinct groups: control normal (CN), progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI), stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This classification is based on a thorough examination of PET scan images obtained from the ADNI dataset, which provides a thorough understanding of the disease's progression. Several deep-learning and traditional machine-learning models have been used to detect Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, three deep-learning models, namely VGG16 and AlexNet, and a custom Convolutional neural network (CNN) with 8-fold cross-validation have been used for classification. Finally, an ensemble technique is used to improve the overall result of these models. The results show that using deep-learning models to tell the difference between MCI patients gives an overall average accuracy of 93.13% and an AUC of 94.4%.</description>

      <title>A Survey of IMU Based Cross-Modal Transfer Learning in Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite living in a multi-sensory world, most AI models are limited to textual and visual understanding of human motion and behavior. In fact, full situational awareness of human motion could best be understood through a combination of sensors. In this survey we investigate how knowledge can be transferred and utilized amongst modalities for Human Activity/Action Recognition (HAR), i.e. cross-modality transfer learning. We motivate the importance and potential of IMU data and its applicability in cross-modality learning as well as the importance of studying the HAR problem. We categorize HAR related tasks by time and abstractness and then compare various types of multimodal HAR datasets. We also distinguish and expound on many related but inconsistently used terms in the literature, such as transfer learning, domain adaptation, representation learning, sensor fusion, and multimodal learning, and describe how cross-modal learning fits with all these concepts. We then review the literature in IMU-based cross-modal transfer for HAR. The two main approaches for cross-modal transfer are instance-based transfer, where instances of one modality are mapped to another (e.g. knowledge is transferred in the input space), or feature-based transfer, where the model relates the modalities in an intermediate latent space (e.g. knowledge is transferred in the feature space). Finally, we discuss future research directions and applications in cross-modal HAR.</description>

      <title>Shape Sensing for Continuum Robotics using Optoelectronic Sensors with Convex Reflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional shape sensing in soft and continuum robotics is a crucial aspect for stable actuation and control in fields such as Minimally Invasive surgery, as the estimation of complex curvatures while using continuum robotic tools is required to manipulate through fragile paths. This challenge has been addressed using a range of different sensing techniques, for example, Fibre Bragg grating (FBG) technology, inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor networks or stretch sensors. Previously, an optics-based method, using optoelectronic sensors was explored, offering a simple and cost-effective solution for shape sensing in a flexible tendon-actuated manipulator in two orientations. This was based on proximity-modulated angle estimation and has been the basis for the shape-sensing method addressed in this paper. The improved and miniaturized technique demonstrated in this paper is based on the use of a spherically shaped reflector with optoelectronic sensors integrated into a tendon actuated robotic manipulator. Upgraded sensing capability is achieved using optimization of the spherical reflector shape in terms of sensor range and resolution, and improved calibration is achieved through the integration of spherical bearings for friction-free motion. Shape estimation is achieved in two orientations upon calibration of sensors, with a maximum Root Mean Square Error (RMS) of 3.37{\deg}.</description>

      <title>What is Wrong with End-to-End Learning for Phase Retrieval?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For nonlinear inverse problems that are prevalent in imaging science, symmetries in the forward model are common. When data-driven deep learning approaches are used to solve such problems, these intrinsic symmetries can cause substantial learning difficulties. In this paper, we explain how such difficulties arise and, more importantly, how to overcome them by preprocessing the training set before any learning, i.e., symmetry breaking. We take far-field phase retrieval (FFPR), which is central to many areas of scientific imaging, as an example and show that symmetric breaking can substantially improve data-driven learning. We also formulate the mathematical principle of symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Application of Principal Component Analysis and Artificial Neural Networks for the Prediction of QoS in FSO Links over South Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Communication in Free Space (FSO) bids more radio bandwidth, operates under a gratis license, and has a lower startup cost as compared to Radio Frequency (RF). Nonetheless, its vulnerability to variations in atmospheric meteorological circumstances is a concern. Ultimately, the purpose of this study is to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to design a QoS prediction model for a terrestrial FSO communication connection. To accomplish the specified goal, meteorological data such as visibility, wind speed, and altitude were collected from the Weather Services in South Africa (SAWS) archive during a ten-year duration at five different locations: George, Johannesburg, Kimberly, Bloemfontein, and Polokwane. The eigenvalues of the first Principal Component (PC1) and the second Principal Component (PC2) in the PCA across the stations Bloemfontein, Johannesburg, Kimberly, George, and Polokwane are 7.624 and 1.020, 7.234, and 0.984, 6.204 and 1.723, 7.354 and 0.876, and 7.104 and 0.865, respectively, demonstrating that, they are kept as QoS variables to train the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model as they provide the most compelling interpretation of the original variable data. The RMSE values of every proposed model across all the study locations are 0.1437, 0.2131, 0.2329, 0.1101, and 0.1977, respectively. Based on the RMSE, the proposed performed better over George. A realistic and accurate predictive model is developed for each of the study locations. Thus, the developed model will serve as a valuable tool for maintaining good QoS in FSO network services and improving telecom businesses in South Africa.</description>

      <title>Human Detection in Realistic Through-the-Wall Environments using Raw Radar ADC Data and Parametric Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radar signal processing algorithm is one of the core components in through-wall radar human detection technology. Traditional algorithms (e.g., DFT and matched filtering) struggle to adaptively handle low signal-to-noise ratio echo signals in challenging and dynamic real-world through-wall application environments, which becomes a major bottleneck in the system. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end through-wall radar human detection network (TWP-CNN), which takes raw radar Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) signals without any preprocessing as input. We replace the conventional radar signal processing flow with the proposed DFT-based adaptive feature extraction (DAFE) module. This module employs learnable parameterized 3D complex convolution layers to extract superior feature representations from ADC signals, which is beyond the limitation of traditional preprocessing methods. Additionally, by embedding phase information from radar data within the network and employing multi-task learning, a more accurate detection is achieved. Finally, due to the absence of through-wall radar datasets containing raw ADC data, we gathered a realistic through-wall (RTW) dataset using our in-house developed through-wall radar system. We trained and validated our proposed method on this dataset to confirm its effectiveness and superiority in real through-wall detection scenarios.</description>

      <title>Rolling bearing fault diagnosis method based on generative adversarial enhanced multi-scale convolutional neural network model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to solve the problem that current convolutional neural networks can not capture the correlation features between the time domain signals of rolling bearings effectively, and the model accuracy is limited by the number and quality of samples, a rolling bearing fault diagnosis method based on generative adversarial enhanced multi-scale convolutional neural network model is proposed. Firstly, Gram angular field coding technique is used to encode the time domain signal of the rolling bearing and generate the feature map to retain the complete information of the vibration signal. Then, the re-sulting data is divided into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. Among them, the training set is input into the gradient penalty Wasserstein distance generation adversarial network to complete the training, and a new sample with similar features to the training sample is obtained, and then the original training set is expanded. Next, multi-scale convolution is used to extract the fault features of the extended training set, and the feature graph is normalized by example to overcome the influence of the difference in feature distribution. Finally, the attention mechanism is applied to the adaptive weighting of normalized features and the extraction of deep features, and the fault diagnosis is completed by the softmax classifier. Compared with ResNet method, the experimental results show that the proposed method has better generalization performance and anti-noise performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding EEG signals is crucial for unraveling human brain and advancing brain-computer interfaces. Traditional machine learning algorithms have been hindered by the high noise levels and inherent inter-person variations in EEG signals. Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown promise, owing to their advanced nonlinear modeling capabilities. However, DNN still faces challenge in decoding EEG samples of unseen individuals. To address this, this paper introduces a novel approach by incorporating the conditional identification information of each individual into the neural network, thereby enhancing model representation through the synergistic interaction of EEG and personal traits. We test our model on the WithMe dataset and demonstrated that the inclusion of these identifiers substantially boosts accuracy for both subjects in the training set and unseen subjects. This enhancement suggests promising potential for improving for EEG interpretability and understanding of relevant identification features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An inertial navigation system (INS) utilizes three orthogonal accelerometers and gyroscopes to determine platform position, velocity, and orientation. There are countless applications for INS, including robotics, autonomous platforms, and the internet of things. Recent research explores the integration of data-driven methods with INS, highlighting significant innovations, improving accuracy and efficiency. Despite the growing interest in this field and the availability of INS datasets, no datasets are available for gyro-free INS (GFINS) and multiple inertial measurement unit (MIMU) architectures. To fill this gap and to stimulate further research in this field, we designed and recorded GFINS and MIMU datasets using 54 inertial sensors grouped in nine inertial measurement units. These sensors can be used to define and evaluate different types of MIMU and GFINS architectures. The inertial sensors were arranged in three different sensor configurations and mounted on a mobile robot and a passenger car. In total, the dataset contains 35 hours of inertial data and corresponding ground truth trajectories. The data and code are freely accessible through our GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Learning to walk on new ground: Calibration-free decoding for c-VEP BCI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores two zero-training methods aimed at enhancing the usability of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) by eliminating the need for a calibration session. We introduce a novel method rooted in the event-related potential (ERP) domain, unsupervised mean maximization (UMM), to the fast code-modulated visual evoked potential (c-VEP) stimulus protocol. We compare UMM to the state-of-the-art c-VEP zero-training method that uses canonical correlation analysis (CCA). The comparison includes instantaneous classification and classification with cumulative learning from previously classified trials for both CCA and UMM. Our study shows the effectiveness of both methods in navigating the complexities of a c-VEP dataset, highlighting their differences and distinct strengths. This research not only provides insights into the practical implementation of calibration-free BCI methods but also paves the way for further exploration and refinement. Ultimately, the fusion of CCA and UMM holds promise for enhancing the accessibility and usability of BCI systems across various application domains and a multitude of stimulus protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider fair network topology inference from nodal observations. Real-world networks often exhibit biased connections based on sensitive nodal attributes. Hence, different subpopulations of nodes may not share or receive information equitably. We thus propose an optimization-based approach to accurately infer networks while discouraging biased edges. To this end, we present bias metrics that measure topological demographic parity to be applied as convex penalties, suitable for most optimization-based graph learning methods. Moreover, we encourage equitable treatment for any number of subpopulations of differing sizes. We validate our method on synthetic and real-world simulations using networks with both biased and unbiased connections.</description>

      <title>Towards Channel-Resilient CSI-Based RF Fingerprinting using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces DeepCRF, a deep learning framework designed for channel state information-based radio frequency fingerprinting (CSI-RFF). The considered CSI-RFF is built on micro-CSI, a recently discovered radio-frequency (RF) fingerprint that manifests as micro-signals appearing on the channel state information (CSI) curves of commercial WiFi devices. Micro-CSI facilitates CSI-RFF which is more streamlined and easily implementable compared to existing schemes that rely on raw I/Q samples. The primary challenge resides in the precise extraction of micro-CSI from the inherently fluctuating CSI measurements, a process critical for reliable RFF. The construction of a framework that is resilient to channel variability is essential for the practical deployment of CSI-RFF techniques. DeepCRF addresses this challenge with a thoughtfully trained convolutional neural network (CNN). This network's performance is significantly enhanced by employing effective and strategic data augmentation techniques, which bolster its ability to generalize to novel, unseen channel conditions. Furthermore, DeepCRF incorporates supervised contrastive learning to enhance its robustness against noises. Our evaluations demonstrate that DeepCRF significantly enhances the accuracy of device identification across previously unencountered channels. It outperforms both the conventional model-based methods and standard CNN that lack our specialized training and enhancement strategies.</description>

      <title>Holography inspired self-controlled reconfigurable intelligent surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among various promising candidate technologies for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications, recent advances in microwave metasurfaces have sparked a new research area of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). By controllably reprogramming the wireless propagation channel, RISs are envisioned to achieve low-cost wireless capacity boosting, coverage extension, and enhanced energy efficiency. To reprogram the channel, each meta-atom on RIS needs an external control signal, which is usually generated by base station (BS). However, BS-controlled RISs require complicated control cables, which hamper their massive deployments. Here, we eliminate the need for BS control by proposing a self-controlled RIS (SC-RIS), which is inspired by the optical holography principle. Different from the existing BS-controlled RISs, each meta-atom of SC-RIS is integrated with an additional power detector for holographic recording. By applying the classical Fourier-transform processing to the measured hologram, SC-RIS is capable of retrieving the user's channel state information required for beamforming, thus enabling autonomous RIS beamforming without control cables. Owing to this WiFi-like plug-and-play capability without the BS control, SC-RISs are expected to enable easy and massive deployments in the future 6G systems.</description>

      <title>Fusion of Active and Passive Measurements for Robust and Scalable Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving reliable and robust positioning of a mobile agent, such as a radio device carried by a person, in scenarios where direct line-of-sight (LOS) links are obstructed or unavailable. The human body is considered as an extended object that scatters, attenuates and blocks the radio signals. We propose a novel particle-based sum-product algorithm (SPA) that fuses active measurements between the agent and anchors with passive measurements from pairs of anchors reflected off the body. We first formulate radio signal models for both active and passive measurements. Then, a joint tracking algorithm that utilizes both active and passive measurements is developed for the extended object. The algorithm exploits the probabilistic data association (PDA) for multiple object-related measurements. The results demonstrate superior accuracy during and after the obstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) situation, outperforming conventional methods that solely rely on active measurements. The proposed joint estimation approach significantly enhances the localization robustness via radio sensing.</description>

      <title>RadioGAT: A Joint Model-based and Data-driven Framework for Multi-band Radiomap Reconstruction via Graph Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-band radiomap reconstruction (MB-RMR) is a key component in wireless communications for tasks such as spectrum management and network planning. However, traditional machine-learning-based MB-RMR methods, which rely heavily on simulated data or complete structured ground truth, face significant deployment challenges. These challenges stem from the differences between simulated and actual data, as well as the scarcity of real-world measurements. To address these challenges, our study presents RadioGAT, a novel framework based on Graph Attention Network (GAT) tailored for MB-RMR within a single area, eliminating the need for multi-region datasets. RadioGAT innovatively merges model-based spatial-spectral correlation encoding with data-driven radiomap generalization, thus minimizing the reliance on extensive data sources. The framework begins by transforming sparse multi-band data into a graph structure through an innovative encoding strategy that leverages radio propagation models to capture the spatial-spectral correlation inherent in the data. This graph-based representation not only simplifies data handling but also enables tailored label sampling during training, significantly enhancing the framework's adaptability for deployment. Subsequently, The GAT is employed to generalize the radiomap information across various frequency bands. Extensive experiments using raytracing datasets based on real-world environments have demonstrated RadioGAT's enhanced accuracy in supervised learning settings and its robustness in semi-supervised scenarios. These results underscore RadioGAT's effectiveness and practicality for MB-RMR in environments with limited data availability.</description>

      <title>Unified Integrated Sensing and Communication Signal Design: A Sphere Packing Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of communication signal sets is fundamentally a sphere packing problem. It aims to identify a set of M points in an N -dimensional space, with the objective of maximizing the separability of points that represent different bits.In contrast, signals used for sensing targets should ideally be asdeterministic as possible. This paper explores the inherent conflict and trade-off between communication and sensing when these functions are combined within the same signal set. We present a unified approach to signal design in the time, frequency, and space domains for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), framing it as a modified sphere packing problem. Through adept formula manipulation, this problem is transformed into a large-scale quadratic constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) challenge. We propose an augmented Lagrangian and dual ascent (ALDA) algorithm for iterative problem-solving. The computational complexity of this approach is analyzed and found to be daunting for large, high-dimensional signal set designs. To address this, we introduce a bit-dimension-power splitting (BDPS) method. This method decomposes the large-scale QCQP into a series of smaller-scale problems that can be solved more efficiently and in parallel, significantly reducing the overall computational load. Extensive simulations have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed signal design methods in the context of ISAC.</description>

      <title>Employing High-Dimensional RIS Information for RIS-aided Localization Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided localization systems have attracted extensive research attention due to their accuracy enhancement capabilities. However, most studies primarily utilized the base stations (BS) received signal, i.e., BS information, for localization algorithm design, neglecting the potential of RIS received signal, i.e., RIS information. Compared with BS information, RIS information offers higher dimension and richer feature set, thereby significantly improving the ability to extract positions of the mobile users (MUs). Addressing this oversight, this paper explores the algorithm design based on the high-dimensional RIS information. Specifically, we first propose a RIS information reconstruction (RIS-IR) algorithm to reconstruct the high-dimensional RIS information from the low-dimensional BS information. The proposed RIS-IR algorithm comprises a data processing module for preprocessing BS information, a convolution neural network (CNN) module for feature extraction, and an output module for outputting the reconstructed RIS information. Then, we propose a transfer learning based fingerprint (TFBF) algorithm that employs the reconstructed high-dimensional RIS information for MU localization. This involves adapting a pre-trained DenseNet-121 model to map the reconstructed RIS signal to the MU's three-dimensional (3D) position. Empirical results affirm that the localization performance is significantly influenced by the high-dimensional RIS information and maintains robustness against unoptimized phase shifts.</description>

      <title>Exploit High-Dimensional RIS Information to Localization: What Is the Impact of Faulty Element?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel localization algorithm using the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) received signal, i.e., RIS information. Compared with BS received signal, i.e., BS information, RIS information offers higher dimension and richer feature set, thereby providing an enhanced capacity to distinguish positions of the mobile users (MUs). Additionally, we address a practical scenario where RIS contains some unknown (number and places) faulty elements that cannot receive signals. Initially, we employ transfer learning to design a two-phase transfer learning (TPTL) algorithm, designed for accurate detection of faulty elements. Then our objective is to regain the information lost from the faulty elements and reconstruct the complete high-dimensional RIS information for localization. To this end, we propose a transfer-enhanced dual-stage (TEDS) algorithm. In \emph{Stage I}, we integrate the CNN and variational autoencoder (VAE) to obtain the RIS information, which in \emph{Stage II}, is input to the transferred DenseNet 121 to estimate the location of the MU. To gain more insight, we propose an alternative algorithm named transfer-enhanced direct fingerprint (TEDF) algorithm which only requires the BS information. The comparison between TEDS and TEDF reveals the effectiveness of faulty element detection and the benefits of utilizing the high-dimensional RIS information for localization. Besides, our empirical results demonstrate that the performance of the localization algorithm is dominated by the high-dimensional RIS information and is robust to unoptimized phase shifts and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).</description>

      <title>Near-field Beam Steering with Planar Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam steering enables manipulation of the electromagnetic radiation patterns in antenna array systems. A methodology for steering beams in the near field of a planar antenna array with known phase wavefront functions towards arbitrary azimuth and elevation angles is described in this paper. Rotation of the phase wavefront function is used while preserving the shape. The phase shifts for antenna element excitation currents are determined based on the distances from antenna elements to the nearest point on the rotated wavefront. Beam steering utilizing a Gaussian and a Bessel beam is studied. Phase distribution examples for various steering directions are considered. For Bessel beam steering, a discussion on the resulting beam shapes and the steering impact on the polarization mismatch is provided. The results show a non-negligible magnitude of the cross-polarization with values depending on the steering direction.</description>

      <title>RKFNet: A Novel Neural Network Aided Robust Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the filtering challenges in linear systems disturbed by non-Gaussian heavy-tailed noise, the robust Kalman filters (RKFs) leveraging diverse heavy-tailed distributions have been introduced. However, the RKFs rely on precise noise models, and large model errors can degrade their filtering performance. Also, the posterior approximation by the employed variational Bayesian (VB) method can further decrease the estimation precision. Here, we introduce an innovative RKF method, the RKFNet, which combines the heavy-tailed-distribution-based RKF framework with the deep learning (DL) technique and eliminates the need for the precise parameters of the heavy-tailed distributions. To reduce the VB approximation error, the mixing-parameter-based function and the scale matrix are estimated by the incorporated neural network structures. Also, the stable training process is achieved by our proposed unsupervised scheduled sampling (USS) method, where a loss function based on the Student's t (ST) distribution is utilised to overcome the disturbance of the noise outliers and the filtering results of the traditional RKFs are employed as reference sequences. Furthermore, the RKFNet is evaluated against various RKFs and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) under three kinds of heavy-tailed measurement noises, and the simulation results showcase its efficacy in terms of estimation accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time Arbitrary Waveform Generation (AWG) is essential in various engineering and research applications, and often requires complex bespoke hardware and software. This paper introduces an AWG framework using an NVIDIA Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and a commercially available high-speed Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) card, both running on a desktop personal computer (PC). The GPU accelerates the "embarrassingly" data parallel additive waveform synthesis framework for AWG, and the DAC reconstructs the generated waveform in the analog domain at high speed. The AWG framework is programmed using the developer-friendly Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) runtime application programming interface from NVIDIA and is readily customizable, and scalable with additional parallel hardware. We present and characterize two different pathways for computing modulated radio-frequency (rf) waveforms: one pathway offers high-complexity simultaneous chirping of 1000 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones for 35 ms at a sampling rate of 560 MB/s, and the other pathway allows simultaneous continuous chirping of 194 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones at 100 MB/s, or 20 individual tones at 560 MB/s. This AWG framework is designed for fast on-the-fly rearrangement of a large stochastically-loaded optical tweezer array of single atoms or molecules into a defect-free array needed for quantum simulation and quantum computation applications.</description>

      <title>RIS-assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems With Two-Timescale Design and Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system is an effective solution to achieve high system capacity with low cost and power consumption. However, existing works of RIS-assisted systems mostly assumed perfect hardware, while the impact of hardware impairments (HWIs) is generally ignored. In this paper, we consider the general Rician fading channel and uplink transmission of the RIS-assisted CF-mMIMO system under transceiver impairments and RIS phase noise. To reduce the feedback overhead and power consumption, we propose a two-timescale transmission scheme to optimize the passive beamformers at RISs with statistical channel state information (CSI), while transmit beamformers at access points (APs) are designed based on instantaneous CSI. Also, the maximum ratio combining (MRC) detection is applied to the central processing unit (CPU). On this basis, we derive the closed-form approximate expression of the achievable rate, based on which the impact of HWIs and the power scaling laws are analyzed to draw useful theoretical insights. To maximize the users' sum rate or minimum rate, we first transform our rate expression into a tractable form, and then optimize the phase shifts of RISs based on an accelerated gradient ascent method. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the correctness of our derived expressions and validate the previous analysis, which provide some guidelines for the practical application of the imperfect RISs in the CF-mMIMO with transceiver HWIs.</description>

      <title>Block Orthogonal Sparse Superposition Codes for $ \sf{L}^3 $ Communications: Low Error Rate, Low Latency, and Low Power Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Block orthogonal sparse superposition (BOSS) code is a class of joint coded modulation methods, which can closely achieve the finite-blocklength capacity with a low-complexity decoder at a few coding rates under Gaussian channels. However, for fading channels, the code performance degrades considerably because coded symbols experience different channel fading effects. In this paper, we put forth novel joint demodulation and decoding methods for BOSS codes under fading channels. For a fast fading channel, we present a minimum mean square error approximate maximum a posteriori (MMSE-A-MAP) algorithm for the joint demodulation and decoding when channel state information is available at the receiver (CSIR). We also propose a joint demodulation and decoding method without using CSIR for a block fading channel scenario. We refer to this as the non-coherent sphere decoding (NSD) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that BOSS codes with MMSE-A-MAP decoding outperform CRC-aided polar codes, while NSD decoding achieves comparable performance to quasi-maximum likelihood decoding with significantly reduced complexity. Both decoding algorithms are suitable for parallelization, satisfying low-latency constraints. Additionally, real-time simulations on a software-defined radio testbed validate the feasibility of using BOSS codes for low-power transmission.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Design of Active STAR-RIS-Aided SWIPT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the downlink transmission of a multi-antenna base station (BS) supported by an active simultaneously transmitting and reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) to serve single-antenna users via simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). In this context, we formulate an energy efficiency maximisation problem that jointly optimises the gain, element selection and phase shift matrices of the active STAR-RIS, the transmit beamforming of the BS and the power splitting ratio of the users. With respect to the highly coupled and non-convex form of this problem, an alternating optimisation solution approach is proposed, using tools from convex optimisation and reinforcement learning. Specifically, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), difference of concave functions (DC), and fractional programming techniques are employed to transform the non-convex optimisation problem into a convex form for optimising the BS beamforming vector and the power splitting ratio of the SWIPT. Then, by integrating meta-learning with the modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and soft actor-critical (SAC) methods, a combinatorial reinforcement learning network is developed to optimise the element selection, gain and phase shift matrices of the active STAR-RIS. Our simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation scheme. Furthermore, our proposed active STAR-RIS-based SWIPT system outperforms its passive counterpart by 57% on average.</description>

      <title>On the Secrecy Enhancement of an Integrated Ground-Aerial Network with a Hybrid FSO/THz Feeder Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High altitude platforms (HAPs)-aided terrestrial-aerial communication technology based on free-space optical (FSO) and Terahertz (THz) feeder links has been attracting notable interest recently due to its great potential in reaching a higher data rate and connectivity. Nonetheless, the presence of harsh vertical propagation environments and potential aerial eavesdroppers are two of the main challenges limiting the reliability and security of such a technology. In this work, a secrecy-enhancing scheme for HAP-aided ground-aerial communication is proposed. The considered network consists of HAP-assisted communication between a ground station and a legitimate user under the threat of an aerial and ground eavesdropper. Thus, the proposed scheme leverages (i) HAP diversity by exploiting the presence of multiple flying HAPs and (ii) the use of a hybrid FSO/THz transmission scheme to offer better resilience against eavesdropping attacks. An analytical secrecy outage probability (SOP) expression is derived for the scheme in consideration. Results manifest the notable gain in security of the proposed scheme with respect to both (i) the single-HAP and (ii) THz feeder-based benchmark ones, where the proposed scheme's SOP is decreased by four orders of magnitude using $4$ HAPs with respect to the first benchmark scheme, while a $5$-dB secrecy gain is manifested with respect to the second benchmark one.</description>

      <title>Site-Specific Beam Alignment in 6G via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beam alignment (BA) in modern millimeter wave standards such as 5G NR and WiGig (802.11ay) is based on exhaustive and/or hierarchical beam searches over pre-defined codebooks of wide and narrow beams. This approach is slow and bandwidth/power-intensive, and is a considerable hindrance to the wide deployment of millimeter wave bands. A new approach is needed as we move towards 6G. BA is a promising use case for deep learning (DL) in the 6G air interface, offering the possibility of automated custom tuning of the BA procedure for each cell based on its unique propagation environment and user equipment (UE) location patterns. We overview and advocate for such an approach in this paper, which we term site-specific beam alignment (SSBA). SSBA largely eliminates wasteful searches and allows UEs to be found much more quickly and reliably, without many of the drawbacks of other machine learning-aided approaches. We first overview and demonstrate new results on SSBA, then identify the key open challenges facing SSBA.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the energy-efficient hybrid beamforming design for a multi-functional integrated sensing, communications, and powering (ISCAP) system. In this system, a base station (BS) with a hybrid analog-digital (HAD) architecture sends unified wireless signals to communicate with multiple information receivers (IRs), sense multiple point targets, and wirelessly charge multiple energy receivers (ERs) at the same time. To facilitate the energy-efficient design, we present a novel HAD architecture for the BS transmitter, which allows dynamic on-off control of its radio frequency (RF) chains and analog phase shifters (PSs) through a switch network. We also consider a practical and comprehensive power consumption model for the BS, by taking into account the power-dependent non-linear power amplifier (PA) efficiency, and the on-off non-transmission power consumption model of RF chains and PSs. We jointly design the hybrid beamforming and dynamic on-off control at the BS, aiming to minimize its total power consumption, while guaranteeing the performance requirements on communication rates, sensing Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB), and harvested power levels. The formulation also takes into consideration the per-antenna transmit power constraint and the constant modulus constraints for the analog beamformer at the BS. The resulting optimization problem for ISCAP is highly non-convex. Please refer to the paper for a complete abstract.</description>

      <title>SignSGD with Federated Voting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed learning is commonly used for accelerating model training by harnessing the computational capabilities of multiple-edge devices. However, in practical applications, the communication delay emerges as a bottleneck due to the substantial information exchange required between workers and a central parameter server. SignSGD with majority voting (signSGD-MV) is an effective distributed learning algorithm that can significantly reduce communication costs by one-bit quantization. However, due to heterogeneous computational capabilities, it fails to converge when the mini-batch sizes differ among workers. To overcome this, we propose a novel signSGD optimizer with \textit{federated voting} (signSGD-FV). The idea of federated voting is to exploit learnable weights to perform weighted majority voting. The server learns the weights assigned to the edge devices in an online fashion based on their computational capabilities. Subsequently, these weights are employed to decode the signs of the aggregated local gradients in such a way to minimize the sign decoding error probability. We provide a unified convergence rate analysis framework applicable to scenarios where the estimated weights are known to the parameter server either perfectly or imperfectly. We demonstrate that the proposed signSGD-FV algorithm has a theoretical convergence guarantee even when edge devices use heterogeneous mini-batch sizes. Experimental results show that signSGD-FV outperforms signSGD-MV, exhibiting a faster convergence rate, especially in heterogeneous mini-batch sizes.</description>

      <title>Accuracy-Aware Cooperative Sensing and Computing for Connected Autonomous Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To maintain high perception performance among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), in this paper, we propose an accuracy-aware and resource-efficient raw-level cooperative sensing and computing scheme among CAVs and road-side infrastructure. The scheme enables fined-grained partial raw sensing data selection, transmission, fusion, and processing in per-object granularity, by exploiting the parallelism among object classification subtasks associated with each object. A supervised learning model is trained to capture the relationship between the object classification accuracy and the data quality of selected object sensing data, facilitating accuracy-aware sensing data selection. We formulate an optimization problem for joint sensing data selection, subtask placement and resource allocation among multiple object classification subtasks, to minimize the total resource cost while satisfying the delay and accuracy requirements. A genetic algorithm based iterative solution is proposed for the optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy awareness and resource efficiency achieved by the proposed cooperative sensing and computing scheme, in comparison with benchmark solutions.</description>

      <title>Single-Carrier Delay-Doppler Domain Equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For doubly-selective channels, delay-Doppler (DD) modulation, mostly known as orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, enables simultaneous compensation of delay and Doppler shifts. However, OTFS modulated signal has high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) because of its precoding operation performed over the DD domain. In order to deal with this problem, we propose a single-carrier transmission with delay-Doppler domain equalization (SC-DDE). In this system, the discretized time-domain SC signal is converted to the DD domain by discrete Zak transform (DZT) at the receiver side, followed by delay-Doppler domain equalization (DDE). Since equalization is performed in the DD domain, the SC-DDE receiver should acquire the channel delay-Doppler response. To this end, we introduce an embedded pilot-aided channel estimation scheme designed for SC-DDE, which does not affect the peak power property of transmitted signals. Through computer simulation, distribution of PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed system are compared with those of the conventional OTFS and SC with frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE). As a result, our proposed SC-DDE significantly outperforms SC-FDE in terms of BER at the expense of additional computational complexity at the receiver. Furthermore, SC-DDE shows much lower PAPR than OTFS even though they achieve comparable coded BER performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To accommodate new applications such as extended reality, fully autonomous vehicular networks and the metaverse, next generation wireless networks are going to be subject to much more stringent performance requirements than the fifth-generation (5G) in terms of data rates, reliability, latency, and connectivity. It is thus necessary to develop next generation advanced transceiver (NGAT) technologies for efficient signal transmission and reception. In this tutorial, we explore the evolution of NGAT from three different perspectives. Specifically, we first provide an overview of new-field NGAT technology, which shifts from conventional far-field channel models to new near-field channel models. Then, three new-form NGAT technologies and their design challenges are presented, including reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, flexible antennas, and holographic multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. Subsequently, we discuss recent advances in semantic-aware NGAT technologies, which can utilize new metrics for advanced transceiver designs. Finally, we point out other promising transceiver technologies for future research.</description>

      <title>Power-Aware Sparse Reflect Beamforming in Active RIS-aided Interference Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has attracted significant attention in wireless communications, due to its reflecting elements (REs) capable of reflecting incident signals with not only phase shifts but also amplitude amplifications. In this paper, we are interested in active RIS-aided interference channels in which $K$ user pairs share the same time and frequency resources with the aid of active RIS. Thanks to the promising amplitude amplification capability, activating a moderate number of REs, rather than all of them, is sufficient for the active RIS to mitigate cross-channel interferences. Motivated by this, we propose a power-aware sparse reflect beamforming design for the active RIS-aided interference channels, which allows the active RIS to flexibly adjust the number of activated REs for the sake of reducing hardware and power costs. Specifically, we establish the power consumption model in which only those activated REs consume the biasing and operation power that supports the amplitude amplification, yielding an $\ell_0$-norm power consumption function. Based on the proposed model, we investigate a sum-rate maximization problem and an active RIS power minimization problem by carefully designing the sparse reflect beamforming vector. To solve these problems, we first replace the nonconvex $\ell_0$-norm function with an iterative reweighted $\ell_1$-norm function. Then, fractional programming is used to solve the sum-rate maximization, while semidefinite programming together with the difference-of-convex algorithm (DCA) is used to solve the active RIS power minimization. Numerical results show that the proposed sparse designs can notably increase the sum rate of user pairs and decrease the power consumption of active RIS in interference channels.</description>

      <title>Safeguarding Next Generation Multiple Access Using Physical Layer Security Techniques: A Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by the ever-increasing requirements of ultra-high spectral efficiency, ultra-low latency, and massive connectivity, the forefront of wireless research calls for the design of advanced next generation multiple access schemes to facilitate provisioning of these stringent demands. This inspires the embrace of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in future wireless communication networks. Nevertheless, the support of massive access via NOMA leads to additional security threats, due to the open nature of the air interface, the broadcast characteristic of radio propagation as well as intertwined relationship among paired NOMA users. To address this specific challenge, the superimposed transmission of NOMA can be explored as new opportunities for security aware design, for example, multiuser interference inherent in NOMA can be constructively engineered to benefit communication secrecy and privacy. The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a comprehensive overview on the state-of-the-art physical layer security techniques that guarantee wireless security and privacy for NOMA networks, along with the opportunities, technical challenges, and future research trends.</description>

      <title>BackCom Assisted Hybrid NOMA Uplink Transmission for Ambient IoT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (H-NOMA) has recently received significant attention as a general framework of multiple access, where both conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and pure NOMA are its special cases. This paper focuses on the application of H-NOMA to ambient Internet of Things (IoT) with energy-constrained devices, where a new backscatter communication (BackCom) assisted H-NOMA uplink scheme is developed. Resource allocation for H-NOMA uplink transmission is also considered, where an overall power minimization problem is formulated. Insightful understandings for the key features of BackCom assisted H-NOMA and its difference from conventional H-NOMA are illustrated by developing analytical results for the two-user special case. For the general multi-user scenario, two algorithms, one based on the branch-bound (BB) principle and the other based on successive convex approximation (SCA), are developed to realize different tradeoffs between the system performance and complexity. The numerical results are also provided to verify the accuracy of the developed analytical results and demonstrate the performance gain of H-NOMA over OMA.</description>

Abstract: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a fundamental tool for signal analysis, widely used across various fields. However, traditional FFT methods encounter challenges in adjusting the frequency bin interval, which may impede accurate spectral analysis. In this study, we propose a method for adjusting the frequency bin interval in FFT by introducing a parameter $\alpha$. We elucidate the underlying principles of the proposed method and discuss its potential applications across various contexts. Our findings suggest that the proposed method offers a promising approach to overcome the limitations of traditional FFT methods and enhance spectral analysis accuracy.</description>

Abstract: This two-part paper studies a point-to-point resonant beam communication (RBCom) system, where two separately deployed retroreflectors are adopted to generate the resonant beam between the transmitter and the receiver, and analyzes the transmission rate of the considered system under both the quasi-static and mobile scenarios. Part I of this paper focuses on the quasi-static scenario where the locations of the transmitter and the receiver are relatively fixed. Specifically, we propose a new information-bearing scheme which adopts a synchronization-based amplitude modulation method to mitigate the echo interference caused by the reflected resonant beam. With this scheme, we show that the quasi-static RBCom channel is equivalent to a Markov channel and can be further simplified as an amplitude-constrained additive white Gaussian noise channel. Moreover, we develop an algorithm that jointly employs the bisection and exhaustive search to maximize its capacity upper and lower bounds. Finally, numerical results validate our analysis. Part II of this paper discusses the performance of the RBCom system under the mobile scenario.</description>

Abstract: This two-part paper focuses on the system design and performance analysis for a point-to-point resonant beam communication (RBCom) system under both the quasi-static and mobile scenarios. Part I of this paper proposes a synchronization-based information transmission scheme and derives the capacity upper and lower bounds for the quasi-static channel case. In Part II, we address the mobile scenario, where the receiver is in relative motion to the transmitter, and derive a mobile RBCom channel model that jointly considers the Doppler effect, channel variation, and echo interference. With the obtained channel model, we prove that the channel gain of the mobile RBCom decreases as the number of transmitted frames increases, and thus show that the considered mobile RBCom terminates after the transmitter sends a certain number of frames without frequency compensation. By deriving an upper bound on the number of successfully transmitted frames, we formulate the throughput maximization problem for the considered mobile RBCom system, and solve it via a sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method. Finally, simulation results validate the analysis of our proposed method in some typical scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Resonant beam communications (RBCom), which adopt oscillating photons between two separate retroreflectors for information transmission, exhibit potential advantages over other types of wireless optical communications (WOC). However, echo interference generated by the modulated beam reflected from the receiver affects the transmission of the desired information. To tackle this challenge, a synchronization-based point-to-point RBCom system is proposed to eliminate the echo interference, and the design for the transmitter and receiver is discussed. Subsequently, the performance of the proposed RBCom is evaluated and compared with that of visible light communications (VLC) and free space optical communications (FOC). Finally, future research directions are outlined and several implementation challenges of RBCom systems are highlighted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As public awareness of environmental protection continues to grow, the trend of integrating more electric vehicles (EVs) into the transportation sector is rising. Unlike conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, EVs can minimize carbon emissions and potentially achieve autonomous driving. However, several obstacles hinder the widespread adoption of EVs, such as their constrained driving range and the extended time required for charging. One alternative solution to address these challenges is implementing dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT), charging EVs in motion on the road. Moreover, charging stations with static wireless power transfer (SWPT) infrastructure can replace existing gas stations, enabling users to charge EVs in parking lots or at home. This paper surveys the communication infrastructure for static and dynamic wireless charging in electric vehicles. It encompasses all communication aspects involved in the wireless charging process. The architecture and communication requirements for static and dynamic wireless charging are presented separately. Additionally, a comprehensive comparison of existing communication standards is provided. The communication with the grid is also explored in detail. The survey gives attention to security and privacy issues arising during communications. In summary, the paper addresses the challenges and outlines upcoming trends in communication for EV wireless charging.</description>

      <title>Proprioception Is All You Need: Terrain Classification for Boreal Forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works in field robotics highlighted the importance of resiliency against different types of terrains. Boreal forests, in particular, are home to many mobility-impeding terrains that should be considered for off-road autonomous navigation. Also, being one of the largest land biomes on Earth, boreal forests are an area where autonomous vehicles are expected to become increasingly common. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing BorealTC, a publicly available dataset for proprioceptive-based terrain classification (TC). Recorded with a Husky A200, our dataset contains 116 min of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), motor current, and wheel odometry data, focusing on typical boreal forest terrains, notably snow, ice, and silty loam. Combining our dataset with another dataset from the state-of-the-art, we evaluate both a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the novel state space model (SSM)-based Mamba architecture on a TC task. Interestingly, we show that while CNN outperforms Mamba on each separate dataset, Mamba achieves greater accuracy when trained on a combination of both. In addition, we demonstrate that Mamba's learning capacity is greater than a CNN for increasing amounts of data. We show that the combination of two TC datasets yields a latent space that can be interpreted with the properties of the terrains. We also discuss the implications of merging datasets on classification. Our source code and dataset are publicly available online: https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/BorealTC.</description>

      <title>Movable-Antenna Position Optimization: A Graph-based Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid antennas (FAs) and movable antennas (MAs) have emerged as promising technologies in wireless communications, which offer the flexibility to improve channel conditions by adjusting transmit/receive antenna positions within a spatial region. In this letter, we focus on an MA-enhanced multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system, aiming to optimize the positions of multiple transmit MAs to maximize the received signal power. Unlike the prior works on continuously searching for the optimal MA positions, we propose to sample the transmit region into discrete points, such that the continuous antenna position optimization problem is transformed to a discrete sampling point selection problem based on the point-wise channel information. However, such a point selection problem is combinatory and challenging to be optimally solved. To tackle this challenge, we ingeniously recast it as an equivalent fixed-hop shortest path problem in graph theory and propose a customized algorithm to solve it optimally in polynomial time. To further reduce the complexity, a linear-time sequential update algorithm is also proposed to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can yield considerable performance gains over the conventional fixed-position antennas with/without antenna selection.</description>

Abstract: Effective learning in neuronal networks requires the adaptation of individual synapses given their relative contribution to solving a task. However, physical neuronal systems -- whether biological or artificial -- are constrained by spatio-temporal locality. How such networks can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In Machine Learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space (BP) and time (BPTT). However, BP(TT) is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatiotemporal (non-)locality, while forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) suffer from prohibitive memory constraints. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of BPTT in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, performing an effective spatiotemporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint states necessary for useful parameter updates.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Sphere Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:1807.03162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a deep learning (DL)-based sphere decoding algorithm is proposed, where the radius of the decoding hypersphere is learned by a deep neural network (DNN). The performance achieved by the proposed algorithm is very close to the optimal maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while the computational complexity, compared to existing sphere decoding variants, is significantly reduced. This improvement is attributed to DNN's ability of intelligently learning the radius of the hypersphere used in decoding. The expected complexity of the proposed DL-based algorithm is analytically derived and compared with existing ones. It is shown that the number of lattice points inside the decoding hypersphere drastically reduces in the DL-based algorithm in both the average and worst-case senses. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is shown through simulation for high-dimensional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, using high-order modulations.</description>

      <title>Iterative execution of discrete and inverse discrete Fourier transforms with applications for signal denoising via sparsification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a family of iterative algorithms that involve the repeated execution of discrete and inverse discrete Fourier transforms. One interesting member of this family is motivated by the discrete Fourier transform uncertainty principle and involves the application of a sparsification operation to both the real domain and frequency domain data with convergence obtained when real domain sparsity hits a stable pattern. This sparsification variant has practical utility for signal denoising, in particular the recovery of a periodic spike signal in the presence of Gaussian noise. General convergence properties and denoising performance relative to existing methods are demonstrated using simulation studies. An R package implementing this technique and related resources can be found at https://hrfrost.host.dartmouth.edu/IterativeFT.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Sense and Avoid for UAVs using Secondary Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A cooperative Sense and Avoid (SAA) algorithm for safe navigation of small-sized UAVs within an airspace is proposed in this paper. The proposed method relies upon cooperation between the UAV and the surrounding transponder-equipped aviation obstacles. To do so, the aviation obstacles share their altitude and identification code with the UAV by using a Mode S operation of the Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) after interrogation. The proposed SAA algorithm benefits from the estimate of the aviation obstacle's elevation angle for ranging. This results in more accurate ranging compared to the round-trip time-based ranging, which is currently used in existing SAA systems. We also propose a low-complexity and accurate radial velocity estimator for the Mode S operation of the SSR which is employed in the proposed SAA system. Furthermore, by considering the Pulse-Position Modulation (PPM) of the transponder reply as a waveform of pulse radar with random pulse repetition intervals, the maximum unambiguous radial velocity is obtained. The proposed SAA is equipped with an intruder identification method that determines the risk level ofthe surrounding transponder-equipped aviation obstacles. Given the estimated parameters, the intruder identification method classifies the aviation obstacles into high-, medium-, and low-risk intruders. The output of the classifier enables the UAV to plan its path or maneuver for safe navigation accordingly. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed estimators are analytically derived, and the effectiveness of our SAA solution is confirmed through simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Joint Ultra-wideband Characterization of Azimuth, Elevation and Time of Arrival with Toric Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analytical framework for the joint characterization of the 3D direction of arrival (DoA), i.e., azimuth and elevation components, and time of arrival (ToA) in multipath environments. The analytical framework is based on the use of nearly frequency-invariant beamformers (FIB) formed by toric arrays. The frequency response of the toric array is expanded as a series of phase modes, which leads to azimuth-time and elevation-time diagrams from which the 3D DoA and the ToA of the incoming waves can be extracted over a wide bandwidth. Firstly, we discuss some practical considerations, advantages and limitations of using the analytical method. Subsequently, we perform a parametric study to analyze the influence of the method parameters on the quality of the estimation. The method is tested in single-path and multipath mm-wave environments over a large bandwidth. The results show that the proposed method improves the quality of the estimation, i.e., decreases the level of the artifacts, compared to other state-of-art FIB approaches based on the use of single/concentric circular and elliptical arrays.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Compensation of Carrier Frequency Offset Impairments in Unique Word OFDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unique Word-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (UW-OFDM) is known to provide various performance benefits over conventional cyclic prefix (CP) based OFDM. Most important, UW-OFDM features excellent spectral sidelobe suppression properties and an outstanding bit error ratio (BER) performance. Carrier frequency offset (CFO) induced impairments denote a challenging task for OFDM systems of any kind. In this work we investigate the CFO effects on UW-OFDM and compare it to conventional multi-carrier and single-carrier systems. Different CFO compensation approaches with different computational complexity are considered throughout this work and assessed against each other. A mean squared error analysis carried out after data estimation reveals a significant higher robustness of UW-OFDM over CP-OFDM against CFO effects. Additionally, the conducted BER simulations generally support this conclusion for various scenarios, ranging from uncoded to coded transmission in a frequency selective environment.</description>

      <title>Assessing cognitive function among older adults using machine learning and wearable device data: a feasibility study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timely implementation of interventions to slow cognitive decline among older adults requires accurate monitoring to detect changes in cognitive function. Data gathered using wearable devices that can continuously monitor factors known to be associated with cognition could be used to train machine learning models and develop wearable-based cognitive monitoring systems. Using data from over 2,400 older adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) we developed prediction models to differentiate older adults with normal cognition from those with poor cognition based on outcomes from three cognitive tests measuring different domains of cognitive function. During repeated cross-validation, CatBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest models performed best when predicting cognition based on processing speed, working memory, and attention (median AUCs &gt;0.82) compared to immediate and delayed recall (median AUCs &gt;0.72) and categorical verbal fluency (median AUC &gt;0.68). Activity and sleep parameters were also more strongly associated with processing speed, working memory, and attention compared to other cognitive subdomains. Our work provides proof of concept that wearable-based cognitive monitoring systems may be a viable alternative to traditional methods for monitoring processing speeds, working memory, and attention. We further identified novel metrics that could be targets in future causal studies seeking to better understand how sleep and activity parameters influence cognitive function among older adults.</description>

      <title>Modeling Sparse Graph Sequences and Signals Using Generalized Graphons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphons are limit objects of sequences of graphs and are used to analyze the behavior of large graphs. Recently, graphon signal processing has been developed to study signal processing on large graphs. A major limitation of this approach is that any sparse sequence of graphs inevitably converges to the zero graphon, rendering the resulting signal processing theory trivial and inadequate for sparse graph sequences. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new signal processing framework that leverages the concept of generalized graphons and introduces the stretched cut distance as a measure to compare these graphons. Our framework focuses on the sampling of graph sequences from generalized graphons and explores the convergence properties of associated operators, spectra, and signals. Our signal processing framework provides a comprehensive approach to analyzing and processing signals on graph sequences, even if they are sparse. Finally, we discuss the practical implications of our theory for real-world large networks through numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework based on differential privacy (DP) for querying electric power measurements to detect system anomalies or bad data. Our DP approach conceals consumption and system matrix data, while simultaneously enabling an untrusted third party to test hypotheses of anomalies, such as the presence of bad data, by releasing a randomized sufficient statistic for hypothesis-testing. We consider a measurement model corrupted by Gaussian noise and a sparse noise vector representing the attack, and we observe that the optimal test statistic is a chi-square random variable. To detect possible attacks, we propose a novel DP chi-square noise mechanism that ensures the test does not reveal private information about power injections or the system matrix. The proposed framework provides a robust solution for detecting bad data while preserving the privacy of sensitive power system data.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Physical Layer Security in Dual-Function Radar-Communication Systems with Hybrid Beamforming Architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate enhancing the physical layer security (PLS) for the dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) system with hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture, where the base station (BS) achieves downlink communication and radar target detection simultaneously. We consider an eavesdropper intercepting the information transmitted from the BS to the downlink communication users with imperfectly known channel state information. Additionally, the location of the radar target is also imperfectly known by the BS. To enhance PLS in the considered DFRC system, we propose a novel HBF architecture, which introduces a new integrated sensing and security (I2S) symbol. The secure HBF design problem for DFRC is formulated by maximizing the minimum legitimate user communication rate subject to radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, eavesdropping rate, hardware and power constraints. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization based method to jointly optimize transmit and receive beamformers. Numerical simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show the superiority of the proposed I2S-aided HBF architecture for achieving DFRC and enhancing PLS.</description>

      <title>Massive Uncoordinated Multiple Access for Beyond 5G</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.00098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing wireless communication systems have been mainly designed to provide substantial gain in terms of data rates. However, 5G and Beyond will depart from this scheme, with the objective not only to provide services with higher data rates. One of the main goals is to support massive machine-type communications (mMTC) in the IoT applications. Supporting massive uplink (UP) communications for devices with sporadic traffic pattern and short-packet size, as it is in many mMTC use cases, is a challenging task, particularly when the control signaling is not negligible in size compared to the payload. Also, channel estimation is challenging for sporadic and short-packet transmission due to the limited number of employed pilots. In this paper, a new UP multiple access (MA) scheme is proposed for mMTC, which can support a large number of uncoordinated IoT devices with short-packet and sporadic traffic. The proposed UP MA scheme removes the overheads associated with the device identifier as well as pilots related to channel estimation. An alternative mechanism for device identification is proposed, where a unique spreading code is dedicated to each IoT device. This unique code is simultaneously used for the spreading purpose and device identification. Two IoT device identification algorithms which employ sparse signal reconstruction methods are proposed to determine the active IoT devices prior to data detection. Specifically, the BIC model order selection method is employed to develop an IoT device identification algorithm for unknown and time-varying probability of device activity. Our proposed MA scheme benefits from a non-coherent multiuser detection algorithm based on machine learning to enable data detection without a priori knowledge on channel state information. The effectiveness of the proposed MA scheme for known and unknown probability of activity is supported by simulation results.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Performance Analysis for Movable Antenna Enabled Wireless Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel antenna architecture called movable antenna (MA) to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Different from conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) that undergo random wireless channel variation, the MAs with the capability of flexible movement can be deployed at positions with more favorable channel conditions to achieve higher spatial diversity gains. To characterize the general multi-path channel in a given region or field where the MAs are deployed, a field-response model is developed by leveraging the amplitude, phase, and angle of arrival/angle of departure (AoA/AoD) information on each of the multiple channel paths under the far-field condition. Based on this model, we then analyze the maximum channel gain achieved by a single receive MA as compared to its FPA counterpart in both deterministic and stochastic channels. First, in the deterministic channel case, we show the periodic behavior of the multi-path channel gain in a given spatial field, which can be exploited for analyzing the maximum channel gain of the MA. Next, in the case of stochastic channels, the expected value of an upper bound on the maximum channel gain of the MA in an infinitely large receive region is derived for different numbers of channel paths. The approximate cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the maximum channel gain is also obtained in closed form, which is useful to evaluate the outage probability of the MA system. Moreover, our results reveal that higher performance gains by the MA over the FPA can be acquired when the number of channel paths increases due to more pronounced small-scale fading effects in the spatial domain. Numerical examples are presented which validate our analytical results and demonstrate that the MA system can reap considerable performance gains over the conventional FPA systems with/without antenna selection (AS).</description>

      <title>Movable-Antenna Enhanced Multiuser Communication via Antenna Position Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) is a promising technology to improve wireless communication performance by varying the antenna position in a given finite area at the transceivers to create more favorable channel conditions. In this paper, we investigate the MA-enhanced multiple-access channel (MAC) for the uplink transmission from multiple users each equipped with a single MA to a base station (BS) with a fixed-position antenna (FPA) array. A field-response based channel model is used to characterize the multi-path channel between the antenna array of the BS and each user's MA with a flexible position. To evaluate the MAC performance gain provided by MAs, we formulate an optimization problem for minimizing the total transmit power of users, subject to a minimum-achievable-rate requirement for each user, where the positions of MAs and the transmit powers of users, as well as the receive combining matrix of the BS are jointly optimized. To solve this non-convex optimization problem involving intricately coupled variables, we develop two algorithms based on zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) combining methods, respectively. Specifically, for each algorithm, the combining matrix of the BS and the total transmit power of users are expressed as a function of the MAs' position vectors, which are then optimized by using the proposed multi-directional descent (MDD) framework. It is shown that the proposed ZF-based and MMSE-based MDD algorithms can converge to high-quality suboptimal solutions with low computational complexities. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solutions for MA-enhanced multiple access systems can significantly decrease the total transmit power of users as compared to conventional FPA systems employing antenna selection under both perfect and imperfect field-response information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the performance of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-inspired multi-cell wideband single-hop backhaul millimeter-wave-in-band-full-duplex (IBFD)-integrated access and backhaul (IAB) networks by using stochastic geometry. We model the wired-connected Next Generation NodeBs (gNBs) as the Mat\'ern hard-core point process (MHCPP) to meet the real-world deployment requirement and reduce the cost caused by wired connection in the network. We first derive association probabilities that reflect how likely the typical user-equipment is served by a gNB or an IAB-node based on the maximum long-term averaged biased-received-desired-signal power criteria. Further, by leveraging the composite Gamma-Lognormal distribution, we derive the closed-form signal to interference plus noise ratio coverage, capacity with outage, and ergodic capacity of the network. In order to avoid underestimating the noise, we consider the sidelobe gain on inter-cell interference links and the analog to digital converter quantization noise. Compared with the half-duplex transmission, numerical results show an enhanced capacity with outage and ergodic capacity provided by IBFD under successful self-interference cancellation. We also study how the power bias and density ratio of the IAB-node to gNB, and the hard-core distance can affect system performances.</description>

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology is a recent development that fully exploits the wireless channel spatial variation in a confined region by enabling local movement of the antenna. Specifically, the positions of antennas at the transmitter and/or receiver can be dynamically changed to obtain better channel conditions for improving the communication performance. In this article, we first provide an overview of the promising applications for MA-aided wireless communication. Then, we present the hardware architecture and channel characterization for MA systems, based on which the variation of the channel gain with respect to the MA's position is illustrated. Furthermore, we analyze the performance advantages of MAs over conventional fixed-position antennas, in terms of signal power improvement, interference mitigation, flexible beamforming, and spatial multiplexing. Finally, we discuss the main design challenges and their potential solutions for MA-aided communication systems.</description>

      <title>Movable-Antenna Array Enhanced Beamforming: Achieving Full Array Gain with Null Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional beamforming with fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays has a fundamental trade-off between maximizing the signal power (array gain) over a desired direction and simultaneously minimizing the interference power over undesired directions. To overcome this limitation, this letter investigates the movable antenna (MA) array enhanced beamforming by exploiting the new degree of freedom (DoF) via antenna position optimization, in addition to the design of antenna weights. We show that by jointly optimizing the antenna positions vector (APV) and antenna weights vector (AWV) of a linear MA array, the full array gain can be achieved over the desired direction while null steering can be realized over all undesired directions, under certain numbers of MAs and null-steering directions. The optimal solutions for AWV and APV are derived in closed form, which reveal that the optimal AWV for MA arrays requires only the signal phase adjustment with a fixed amplitude. Numerical results validate our analytical solutions for MA array beamforming and show their superior performance to the conventional beamforming techniques with FPA arrays.</description>

      <title>Modulation and Estimation with a Helper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of transmitting a parameter value over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is considered, where, in addition to the transmitter and the receiver, there is a helper that observes the noise non-causally and provides a description of limited rate $R_h$ to the transmitter and/or the receiver. We derive upper and lower bounds on the optimal achievable $\alpha$-th moment of the estimation error and show that they coincide for small values of $\alpha$ and for high values of $R_h$. The upper bound relies on a recently proposed channel-coding scheme that effectively conveys $R_h$ bits essentially error-free and the rest of the rate - over the same AWGN channel without help, with the error-free bits being allocated to the most significant bits of the quantized parameter. We then concentrate on the setting with a total transmit energy constraint, for which we derive achievability results for both channel coding and parameter modulation for several scenarios: when the helper assists only the transmitter or only the receiver and knows the noise, and when the helper assists the transmitter and/or the receiver and knows both the noise and the message. In particular, for the message-informed helper that assists both the receiver and the transmitter, it is shown that the error probability in the channel-coding task decays doubly exponentially. Finally, we translate these results to those for continuous-time power-limited AWGN channels with unconstrained bandwidth. As a byproduct, we show that the capacity with a message-informed helper that is available only at the transmitter can exceed the sum of the capacity without help and the help rate $R_h$, when the helper knows only the noise but not the message.</description>

      <title>User Training with Error Augmentation for Electromyogram-based Gesture Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We designed and tested a system for real-time control of a user interface by extracting surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity from eight electrodes in a wrist-band configuration. sEMG data were streamed into a machine-learning algorithm that classified hand gestures in real-time. After an initial model calibration, participants were presented with one of three types of feedback during a human-learning stage: veridical feedback, in which predicted probabilities from the gesture classification algorithm were displayed without alteration, modified feedback, in which we applied a hidden augmentation of error to these probabilities, and no feedback. User performance was then evaluated in a series of minigames, in which subjects were required to use eight gestures to manipulate their game avatar to complete a task. Experimental results indicated that, relative to baseline, the modified feedback condition led to significantly improved accuracy and improved gesture class separation. These findings suggest that real-time feedback in a gamified user interface with manipulation of feedback may enable intuitive, rapid, and accurate task acquisition for sEMG-based gesture recognition applications.</description>

      <title>Computation-Limited Signals: A Channel Capacity Regime Constrained by Computational Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we introduce the computational-limited (comp-limited) signals, a communication capacity regime in which the signal time computational complexity overhead is the key constraint -- rather than power or bandwidth -- to the overall communication capacity. We present the Spectro-Computational (SC) analysis, a novel mathematical framework that enhances classic concepts of information theory -- such as throughput, spectral efficiency and capacity -- to account for the signal processing computational complexity overhead. We consider a specific Shannon regime under which capacity is expected to get arbitrarily large as channel resources grow. Under that regime, we identify the conditions under which the time complexity overhead causes capacity to decrease rather than increasing, thereby creating the case for the comp-limited regime. We also provide examples of the SC analysis and show the OFDM waveform is comp-limited unless the lower-bound computational complexity of the $N$-point DFT problem verifies as $\Omega(N)$, which remains an open challenge.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of the Radio Map Estimation Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15106v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio maps provide radio frequency metrics, such as the received signal strength, at every location of a geographic area. These maps, which are estimated using a set of measurements collected at multiple positions, find a wide range of applications in wireless communications, including the prediction of coverage holes, network planning, resource allocation, and path planning for mobile robots. Although a vast number of estimators have been proposed, the theoretical understanding of the radio map estimation (RME) problem has not been addressed. The present work aims at filling this gap along two directions. First, the complexity of the set of radio map functions is quantified by means of lower and upper bounds on their spatial variability, which offers valuable insight into the required spatial distribution of measurements and the estimators that can be used. Second, the reconstruction error for power maps in free space is upper bounded for three conventional spatial interpolators. The proximity coefficient, which is a decreasing function of the distance from the transmitters to the mapped region, is proposed to quantify the complexity of the RME problem. Numerical experiments assess the tightness of the obtained bounds and the validity of the main takeaways in complex environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent surfaces (ISs) have emerged as a key technology to empower a wide range of appealing applications for wireless networks, due to their low cost, high energy efficiency, flexibility of deployment and capability of constructing favorable wireless channels/radio environments. Moreover, the recent advent of several new IS architectures further expanded their electromagnetic functionalities from passive reflection to active amplification, simultaneous reflection and refraction, as well as holographic beamforming. However, the research on ISs is still in rapid progress and there have been recent technological advances in ISs and their emerging applications that are worthy of a timely review. Thus, we provide in this paper a comprehensive survey on the recent development and advances of ISs aided wireless networks. Specifically, we start with an overview on the anticipated use cases of ISs in future wireless networks such as 6G, followed by a summary of the recent standardization activities related to ISs. Then, the main design issues of the commonly adopted reflection-based IS and their state-of-the-art solutions are presented in detail, including reflection optimization, deployment, signal modulation, wireless sensing, and integrated sensing and communications. Finally, recent progress and new challenges in advanced IS architectures are discussed to inspire futrue research.</description>

      <title>Finite-Precision Arithmetic Transceiver for Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient implementation of massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transceivers is essential for the next-generation wireless networks. To reduce the high computational complexity of the massive MIMO transceiver, in this paper, we propose a new massive MIMO architecture using finite-precision arithmetic. First, we conduct the rounding error analysis and derive the lower bound of the achievable rate for single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) using maximal ratio combining (MRC) and multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems using maximal ratio transmission (MRT) with finite-precision arithmetic. Then, considering the multi-user scenario, the rounding error analysis of zero-forcing (ZF) detection and precoding is derived by using the normal equations (NE) method. The corresponding lower bounds of the achievable sum rate are also derived and asymptotic analyses are presented. Built upon insights from these analyses and lower bounds, we propose a mixed-precision architecture for massive MIMO systems to offset performance gaps due to finite-precision arithmetic. The corresponding analysis of rounding errors and computational costs is obtained. Simulation results validate the derived bounds and underscore the superiority of the proposed mixed-precision architecture to the conventional structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problems of interference prediction and sensing for efficient spectrum access and link adaptation. The considered approach for interference prediction relies on a parametric model. However, we assume that the number of observations available to learn theses parameters is limited. This implies that they should be treated as random variables rather than fixed values. We show how this can impact the spectrum access and link adaptation strategies. We also introduce the notion of "interferer-coherence time" to establish the number of independent interferer state realizations experienced by a codeword. We explain how it can be computed taking into account the model uncertainty and how this impacts the link adaptation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a group of finite sequences and its variants were proposed to use in conducting signal analysis; we called the developed signal analysis methods arbitrary discrete Fourier analysis (ADFA), Mel-scale discrete Fourier analysis (MDFA) and constant Q analysis (CQA). The effectiveness of three signal analysis methods were then validated by testing their performance on a replayed speech detection benchmark (i.e., the ASVspoof 2019 Physical Access) along with a state-of-the-art model. Comparable performance to the best reported systems were shown by the experimental results with three signal analysis methods. Furthermore, the CQA method shown its efficiency with less computation time in compared to the convention method constant Q transform (CQT), which is commonly used in spoofed and fake speech detection and music processing.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Data Consistency with Diffusion Purification for Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained traction as a powerful class of deep generative priors, excelling in a wide range of image restoration tasks due to their exceptional ability to model data distributions. To solve image restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.</description>

      <title>A learning-based solution approach to the application placement problem in mobile edge computing under uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Placing applications in mobile edge computing servers presents a complex challenge involving many servers, users, and their requests. Existing algorithms take a long time to solve high-dimensional problems with significant uncertainty scenarios. Therefore, an efficient approach is required to maximize the quality of service while considering all technical constraints. One of these approaches is machine learning, which emulates optimal solutions for application placement in edge servers. Machine learning models are expected to learn how to allocate user requests to servers based on the spatial positions of users and servers. In this study, the problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming. A sufficient amount of training records is generated by varying parameters such as user locations, their request rates, and solving the optimization model. Then, based on the distance features of each user from the available servers and their request rates, machine learning models generate decision variables for the first stage of the stochastic optimization model, which is the user-to-server request allocation, and are employed as independent decision agents that reliably mimic the optimization model. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) are used in this research to achieve practical decisions from the stochastic optimization models. The performance of each model has shown an execution effectiveness of over 80%. This research aims to provide a more efficient approach for tackling high-dimensional problems and scenarios with uncertainties in mobile edge computing by leveraging machine learning models for optimal decision-making in request allocation to edge servers. These results suggest that machine-learning models can significantly improve solution times compared to conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Semantic-Bit Coexisting Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) is emerging as a key technology for future sixth-generation (6G) systems. Unlike traditional bit-level communication (BitCom), SemCom directly optimizes performance at the semantic level, leading to superior communication efficiency. Nevertheless, the task-oriented nature of SemCom renders it challenging to completely replace BitCom. Consequently, it is desired to consider a semantic-bit coexisting communication system, where a base station (BS) serves SemCom users (sem-users) and BitCom users (bit-users) simultaneously. Such a system faces severe and heterogeneous inter-user interference. In this context, this paper provides a new semantic-bit coexisting communication framework and proposes a spatial beamforming scheme to accommodate both types of users. Specifically, we consider maximizing the semantic rate for semantic users while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for bit-users. Due to the intractability of obtaining the exact closed-form expression of the semantic rate, a data driven method is first applied to attain an approximated expression via data fitting. With the resulting complex transcendental function, majorization minimization (MM) is adopted to convert the original formulated problem into a multiple-ratio problem, which allows fractional programming (FP) to be used to further transform the problem into an inhomogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQP) problem. Solving the problem leads to a semi-closed form solution with undetermined Lagrangian factors that can be updated by a fixed point algorithm. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed beamforming scheme significantly outperforms conventional beamforming algorithms such as zero-forcing (ZF), maximum ratio transmission (MRT), and weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE).</description>

Abstract: Point processes are finding growing applications in numerous fields, such as neuroscience, high frequency finance and social media. So classic problems of classification and clustering are of increasing interest. However, analytic study of misclassification error probability in multi-class classification has barely begun. In this paper, we tackle the multi-class likelihood classification problem for point processes and develop, for the first time, both asymptotic upper and lower bounds on the error rate in terms of computable pair-wise affinities. We apply these general results to classifying renewal processes. Under some technical conditions, we show that the bounds have exponential decay and give explicit associated constants. The results are illustrated with a non-trivial simulation.</description>
