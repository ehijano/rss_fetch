      <title>Upconverting microgauges reveal intraluminal force dynamics in vivo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forces generated by action potentials in muscle cells shuttle blood, food and waste products throughout the luminal structures of the body. Although non-invasive electrophysiological techniques exist, most mechanosensors cannot access luminal structures non-invasively. Here we introduce non-toxic ingestible mechanosensors to enable the quantitative study of luminal forces and apply them to study feeding in living Caenorhabditis elegans roundworms. These optical 'microgauges' comprise NaY0.8Yb0.18Er0.02F4@NaYF4 upconverting nanoparticles embedded in polystyrene microspheres. Combining optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy to study microgauges in vitro, we show that force evokes a linear and hysteresis-free change in the ratio of emitted red to green light. With fluorescence imaging and non-invasive electrophysiology, we show that adult C. elegans generate bite forces during feeding on the order of 10 micronewtons and that the temporal pattern of force generation is aligned with muscle activity in the feeding organ. Moreover, the bite force we measure corresponds to Hertzian contact stresses in the pressure range used to lyse the bacterial food of the worm. Microgauges have the potential to enable quantitative studies that investigate how neuromuscular stresses are affected by aging, genetic mutations and drug treatments in this organ and other luminal organs.</description>

      <title>Effect of modeling subject-specific cortical folds on brain injury risk prediction under blunt impact loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Computational head models are essential tools for studying the risk of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) under different activities and across populations. However, different computational models incorporate varied levels of anatomical details, such as cortical folds. In this study, we aim to determine the effect of modeling cortical folds on mTBI risk assessment.
  Methods: We compared the gyrencephalic (with cortical folds) and lissencephalic (without cortical folds) FE models of 18 subjects aged 9 - 18 years, under a rotational head acceleration event. A rotational acceleration of 10 krad/s$^2$ and 10 ms duration was simulated about each principal head axis. We analyzed different mTBI injury metrics, including maximum principal strain (MPS95), maximum principal strain rate (MPSR95), and cumulative strain damage measure (CSDM15), for the whole brain as well as for specific regions of interest (ROIs).
  Results: Modeling cortical folds consistently predicted higher injury metrics across all individuals and rotational direction, with the bias (mean $\pm$ std. dev.) of $-15.1 \pm 6.5\%$ in MPS95, $-12.9 \pm 5.6\%$ in MPSR95, and $-8.8 \pm 11.09\%$ in CSDM15. We also find that the regions of high strain concentrations vary significantly between the two models, with the DICE metric on peak MPS ranging between $0.07-0.43$ and DICE on CSDM15 ranging between $0.42-0.70$. Modeling cortical folds also affects injury metrics in all ROIs, even the ones that remain geometrically unaltered in the two model types, such as the corpus callosum, cerebellum, and brain stem.
  Conclusions: The study finds that modeling cortical folds significantly alters the region of high brain deformations and the mTBI risk under head rotations.</description>

      <title>Large-scale spatial variable gene atlas for spatial transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial variable genes (SVGs) reveal critical information about tissue architecture, cellular interactions, and disease microenvironments. As spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies proliferate, accurately identifying SVGs across diverse platforms, tissue types, and disease contexts has become both a major opportunity and a significant computational challenge. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of 20 state-of-the-art SVG detection methods using human slides from STimage-1K4M, a large-scale resource of ST data comprising 662 slides from more than 18 tissue types. We evaluate each method across a range of biologically and technically meaningful criteria, including recovery of pathologist-annotated domain-specific markers, cross-slide reproducibility, scalability to high-resolution data, and robustness to technical variation. Our results reveal marked differences in performance depending on tissue type, spatial resolution, and study design. Beyond benchmarking, we construct the first cross-tissue atlas of SVGs, enabling comparative analysis of spatial gene programs across cancer and normal tissues. We observe similarities between pairs of tissues that reflect developmental and functional relationships, such as high overlap between thymus and lymph node, and uncover spatial gene programs associated with metastasis, immune infiltration, and tissue-of-origin identity in cancer. Together, our work defines a framework for evaluating and interpreting spatial gene expression and establishes a reference resource for the ST community.</description>

      <title>Biology-driven assessment of deep learning super-resolution imaging of the porosity network in dentin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models (RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.</description>

      <title>Panoramic Voltage-Sensitive Optical Mapping of Contracting Hearts using Cooperative Multi-View Motion Tracking with 12 to 24 Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voltage-sensitive fluorescence imaging is widely used to image action potential waves in the heart. However, while the electrical waves trigger mechanical contraction, imaging needs to be performed with pharmacologically contraction-inhibited hearts, limiting studies of the coupling between cardiac electrophysiology and tissue mechanics. Here, we introduce a high-resolution multi-camera optical mapping system with which we image action potential waves at high resolutions across the entire ventricular surface of the beating and strongly deforming heart. We imaged intact isolated rabbit hearts inside a soccer-ball shaped imaging chamber facilitating even illumination and panoramic imaging. Using 12 high-speed cameras, ratiometric voltage-sensitive imaging, and three-dimensional (3D) multi-view motion tracking, we reconstructed the entire 3D deforming ventricular surface and performed corresponding voltage-sensitive measurements during sinus rhythm, paced rhythm, and ventricular fibrillation. Our imaging setup defines a new state-of-the-art in the field and can be used to study the heart's electromechanical physiology during health and disease at unprecedented resolutions. For instance, we measured electrical activation times and observed mechanical strain waves following electrical activation fronts during pacing, observed electromechanical vortices during ventricular fibrillation, and measured action potential duration and contractile changes in response to pharmacological blockage of potassium ion channels.</description>
