      <title>THOI: An efficient and accessible library for computing higher-order interactions enhanced by batch-processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems are characterized by nonlinear dynamics, multi-level interactions, and emergent collective behaviors. Traditional analyses that focus solely on pairwise interactions often oversimplify these systems, neglecting the higher-order interactions critical for understanding their full collective dynamics. Recent advances in multivariate information theory provide a principled framework for quantifying these higher-order interactions, capturing key properties such as redundancy, synergy, shared randomness, and collective constraints. However, two major challenges persist: accurately estimating joint entropies and addressing the combinatorial explosion of interacting terms. To overcome these challenges, we introduce THOI (Torch-based High-Order Interactions), a novel, accessible, and efficient Python library for computing high-order interactions in continuous-valued systems. THOI leverages the well-established Gaussian copula method for joint entropy estimation, combined with state-of-the-art batch and parallel processing techniques to optimize performance across CPU, GPU, and TPU environments. Our results demonstrate that THOI significantly outperforms existing tools in terms of speed and scalability. For larger systems, where exhaustive analysis is computationally impractical, THOI integrates optimization strategies that make higher-order interaction analysis feasible. We validate THOI accuracy using synthetic datasets with parametrically controlled interactions and further illustrate its utility by analyzing fMRI data from human subjects in wakeful resting states and under deep anesthesia. Finally, we analyzed over 900 real-world and synthetic datasets, establishing a comprehensive framework for applying higher-order interaction (HOI) analysis in complex systems.</description>

      <title>A Unification of Zeilberger's Algorithm and Its q-Analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt the theory of normal and special polynomials from symbolic integration to the summation setting, and then built up a general framework embracing both the usual shift case and the q-shift case. In the context of this general framework, we develop a unified reduction algorithm, and subsequently a creative telescoping algorithm, applicable to both hypergeometric terms and their q-analogues. Our algorithms allow to split up the usual shift case and the q-shift case only when it is really necessary, and thus instantly reveal the intrinsic differences between these two cases. Computational experiments are also provided.</description>
