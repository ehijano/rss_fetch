      <title>Resolved mass assembly and star formation in Milky Way Progenitors since $z = 5$ from JWST/CANUCS: From clumps and mergers to well-ordered disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a resolved study of $&gt;900$ progenitors of Milky Way Analogs (MWAs) at $0.3&lt;z&lt;5$ selected with abundance matching in the ten fields of the Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). Utilizing 18-21 bands of deep NIRCam, NIRISS, and HST photometry, we create resolved stellar mass maps and star formation rate maps via spectral energy distribution fitting with Dense Basis. We examine their resolved stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR) profiles as a function of galactocentric radius, and find clear evidence for inside-out mass assembly. The total $M_\star$ of the inner 2 kpc regions of the progenitors remain roughly constant ($10^{9.3-9.4}M_\odot$) at $2&lt;z&lt;5$, while the total $M_\star$ of the regions beyond 2 kpc increases by 0.8 dex, from $10^{7.5}M_\odot$ to $10^{8.3}M_\odot$. Additionally, the sSFR of the outer regions increase with decreasing redshift, until $z\sim 2$. The median S\'ersic index of the MWA progenitors stays nearly constant at $n \sim 1$ at $2&lt;z&lt;5$, while the half-mass radii of their stellar mass profiles double. We perform additional morphological measurements on the stellar mass maps via the Gini-M20 plane and asymmetry parameters. They show that the rate of double-peak mergers and disturbances to galaxy structure also increase with redshift, with $\sim50\%$ of galaxies at $4&lt;z&lt;5$ classified as disturbed, and $\sim20\%$ classified as ongoing mergers. Overall, the early evolution of MWAs is revealed as chaotic, with significant mergers and high SFRs. Mass growth is primarily inside-out and galaxies become more disk-like after $z=3$.</description>

      <title>Evidence that pre-processing in filaments drives the anisotropic quenching of satellite galaxies in massive clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a sample of 11 $z\approx0.2-0.5$ ($z_{\text{med.}} = 0.36$) galaxy clusters from the Cluster Lensing And Supernovae survey with Hubble (CLASH) to analyse the angular dependence of satellite galaxy colour $(B-R)$ and passive galaxy fractions ($f_{\text{pass.}}$) with respect to the major axis of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). This phenomenon has been dubbed as \say{anisotropic quenching}, \say{angular conformity} or \say{angular segregation}, and it describes how satellite galaxies along the major axis of the BCG are more likely to be quenched than those along the minor axis. We are the first to measure anisotropic quenching out to $3R_{200}$ ($R_{200\text{, med.}} \approx 933$ \si{\kilo\parsec}) from the cluster centre. A highly significant anisotropic quenching signal is found for satellites with a peak in $(B-R)$ and $f_{\text{pass.}}$ along the major axis. We find that the anisotropic quenching signal is significant out to at least $2.5R_{200}$, and the amplitude of the sinusoidal fit peaks at $\approx1.25R_{200}$. This is the first time the radial peak of the anisotropic quenching signal has been measured directly. Finally, we find that $f_{\text{pass.}}$ is significantly higher along the major axis for fixed values of local surface density. The density drops less rapidly along the major axis and so satellites spend more time being pre-processed here compared to the minor axis. We therefore conclude that pre-processing in large-scale structure, and not active galactic nuclei (AGN) outflows, is the likely cause of the anisotropic quenching signal in massive galaxy clusters, however this may not be the cause in lower mass halos.</description>

      <title>Baryonic Ecosystem in Galaxies (BEINGMgII). Host Galaxies of Ultra-strong MgII Absorbers in Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the galaxies hosting ultra-strong MgII (USMgII) absorbers at small impact parameters of $\sim$2" (5 - 20 kpc), spanning a redshift range of $0.4 \le z \le 1.7$, using deep, high-resolution images from Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Survey and spectra from SDSS survey. From a total of 418 USMgII absorbers with $W_{2796}\ \ge 3 \mathring{A}$, along 412 quasar sightlines, we detect 50 galaxies based on [O II] $\lambda\lambda$3727,3729 nebular emission detected at $\ge 2\sigma$ level. Utilizing the [O II] emission from the stacked spectrum and employing the best-fit galaxy SED template, we further identify 86 galaxies, leading to a total of 136 bona fide USMgII galaxies. With a prerequisite of having a minimum of four HSC passbands available, we find a detection rate of $\sim$38% at an average impact parameter of 11.4 kpc. We find that galaxies hosting USMgII systems are typically star-forming main sequence galaxies, with 21% exhibiting a starburst nature. The non-zero [O II] emission along the `clear' sightlines, with no stellar counterpart, hints that the USMgII absorbers may likely emanate from the unseen faint galaxies near the quasar. The USMgII absorbers preferentially align along the major and minor axes of the galaxy, which suggests that they originate in the disk or large-scale wind. We show that the distribution of $W_{2796}$ as a function of impact parameter indicates a discernible radial dependence for the `disk' and `wind' subsets, with the observed large scatter in $W_{2796}$ potentially attributed to large-scale outflows. The quasar sightline hosting USMgII systems show a factor three higher galaxy surface density at impact parameters of $\lesssim 50$kpc, highlights the multiple pathways giving rise to USMgII absorption.</description>

      <title>Yields from massive stars in binaries. Chemical evolution of the Milky Way disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large fraction of massive stars in the Galaxy reside in binary systems and their evolution is different from that of single stars. The yields of massive stars, which are the main responsible for the production of metals, can be therefore affected by the binary nature of the systems. Recently, Farmer et al. (2023) computed new grids of yields for single and binary-stripped massive stars with solar chemical composition. The main purpose of this paper is to test these yields on the chemical evolution of Galactic stars. To do that, we adopt well-tested chemical evolution models for the Milky Way disk, implementing both yields for single and binary-stripped massive stars. In particular, we assume different percentages of massive binary systems within the initial mass function. We compute the evolution of 22 chemical species starting from $^{4}$He to $^{64}$Zn. Our main results can be summarized as follows: i) when adopting the yields of Farmer et al. (2023), large differences are found relative to the predicted solar abundances by chemical evolution models adopting "standard" massive star yields from the literature for $^{12}$C, $^{14}$N, $^{24}$Mg, $^{39}$K, $^{40}$Ca, $^{55}$Mn and $^{59}$Co. Generally, the yields for single stars reproduce slightly better the observed solar abundances, although for several elements a large fraction of binaries helps in reproducing the observations; ii) different fractions of massive binaries (from 50% to 100%) produce negligible differences in the predicted solar abundances, whereas the differences are more marked between models with and without binary-stripped stellar yields; iii) for the [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relations, the yields including massive stars in binaries produce the best results for $^{52}$Cr, while for $^{12}$C, $^{39}$K, $^{40}$Ca and $^{24}$Mg the best results are obtained with Farmer's yields with no binaries.</description>

      <title>The SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey filamentary source catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalogue of filamentary structures identified in the SARAO (South African Radio Astronomy Observatory) MeerKAT 1.3 GHz Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS). We extract 933 filaments across the survey area, 803 of which (~86%) are associated with extended radio structures (e.g. supernova remnants and HII regions), whilst 130 (~14%) are largely isolated. We classify filaments as thermal or non-thermal via their associated mid-infrared emission and find 77/130 (~59%) of the isolated sources are likely to be non-thermal, and are therefore excellent candidates for the first isolated, non-thermal radio filaments observed outside of the Galactic Centre (GC). Comparing the morphological properties of these non-thermal candidates to the non-thermal filaments observed towards the GC we find the GC filaments are on the whole angularly narrower and shorter than those across the SMGPS, potentially an effect of distance. The SMGPS filaments have flux densities similar to those of the GC, however the distribution of the latter extends to higher flux densities. If the SMGPS filaments were closer than the GC population, it would imply a more energetic population of cosmic ray electrons in the GC. We find the filament position angles in the SMGPS are uniformly distributed, implying that the local magnetic field traced by the filaments does not follow the large-scale Galactic field. Finally, although we have clearly shown that filaments are not unique to the GC, the GC nevertheless has the highest density of filaments in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Probing the gas that builds planets: Results from the JWST MINDS program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared observations with JWST open up a new window into the chemical composition of the gas in the inner disk (&lt;few au) where planets are built. Results from the MIRI GTO program MINDS (PI: Th. Henning, co-PI: I. Kamp) are presented for several disks around T Tauri and lower-mass stars. A large diversity in spectra is found. Some disks are very rich in H2O lines whereas other disks show prominent CO2. The spectra of disks around very low-mass stars (&lt;0.3 MSun, late-M type stars like Trappist-1) are dominated by C2H2 and other hydrocarbon features including those of benzene, suggesting volatile C/O&gt;1. Together these data point to a rich chemistry in the inner regions that is linked to the physical structure of these disks (e.g., dust traps) and that may be affected by processes such as radial drift of icy pebbles from the outer to the inner disk.</description>

      <title>Tracing the earliest stages of star and cluster formation in 19 nearby galaxies with PHANGS-JWST and HST: compact 3.3 $\mu$m PAH emitters and their relation to the optical census of star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The earliest stages of star and cluster formation are hidden within dense cocoons of gas and dust, limiting their detection at optical wavelengths. With the unprecedented infrared capabilities of JWST, we can now observe dust-enshrouded star formation with $\sim$10 pc resolution out to $\sim$20 Mpc. Early findings from PHANGS-JWST suggest that 3.3 $\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission can identify star clusters in their dust-embedded phases. Here, we extend this analysis to 19 galaxies from the PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1 Treasury Survey, providing the first characterization of compact sources exhibiting 3.3$\mu$m PAH emission across a diverse sample of nearby star-forming galaxies. We establish selection criteria, a median color threshold of F300M-F335M=0.67 at F335M=20, and identify of 1816 sources. These sources are predominantly located in dust lanes, spiral arms, rings, and galaxy centers, with $\sim$87% showing concentration indices similar to optically detected star clusters. Comparison with the PHANGS-HST catalogs suggests that PAH emission fades within $\sim$3 Myr. The H$\alpha$ equivalent width of PAH emitters is 1-2.8 times higher than that of young PHANGS-HST clusters, providing evidence that PAH emitters are on average younger. Analysis of the bright portions of luminosity functions (which should not suffer from incompleteness) shows that young dusty clusters may increase the number of optically visible $\leq$ 3 Myr-old clusters in PHANGS-HST by a factor between $\sim$1.8x-8.5x.</description>

      <title>Extended red wings and the visibility of reionization-epoch Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The visibility of the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission from reionization-epoch galaxies depends sensitively on the extent of the intrinsic \lya emission redwards of 1215.67~\AA. The prominent red peak resulting from resonant radiative transfer in the interstellar medium is often modelled as a single Gaussian. We use the \textsc{Azahar} simulation suite of a massive-reionization epoch galaxy to show that a significantly larger fraction of the \lya emission extends to $400$-$800$~km~s$^{-1}$, and thus significantly further to the red than predicted by a Gaussian line profile. A cycle of frequent galaxy mergers strongly modulates the \lya luminosity, the red peak velocity and its extended red wing emerging from the galaxy, which all also strongly vary with viewing angle. The \lya emission also depends sensitively on the implemented feedback, dust and star formation physics. Our simulations including cosmic rays reproduce the observed spectral properties of reionization epoch \lya emitters (LAEs) well if we assume that the \lya emission is affected by very little dust. The visibility of LAEs can be strongly underestimated if the extended red wings of the intrinsic \lya emission are not accounted for. We discuss implications for using the visibility of LAEs to constrain the evolution of the volume-averaged neutral fraction during reionization.</description>

      <title>The Arp 240 Galaxy Merger: A Detailed Look at the Molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt Star Formation Law on Sub-kpc Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt (mK-S) Law has been key for understanding star formation (SF) in galaxies across all redshifts. However, recent sub-kpc observations of nearby galaxies reveal deviations from the nearly unity slope (N) obtained with disk-averaged measurements. We study SF and molecular gas (MG) distribution in the early-stage luminous infrared galaxy merger Arp240 (NGC5257-8). Using VLA radio continuum (RC) and ALMA CO(2-1) observations with a uniform grid analysis, we estimate SF rates and MG surface densities ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ and $\Sigma_{\mathrm{H_2}}$, respectively). In Arp 240, N is sub-linear at 0.52 $\pm$ 0.17. For NGC 5257 and NGC 5258, N is 0.52 $\pm$ 0.16 and 0.75 $\pm$ 0.15, respectively. We identify two SF regimes: high surface brightness (HSB) regions in RC with N $\sim$1, and low surface brightness (LSB) regions with shallow N (ranging 0.15 $\pm$ 0.09 to 0.48 $\pm$ 0.04). Median CO(2-1) linewidth and MG turbulent pressure (P$_{\mathrm{turb}}$) are 25 km s$^{-1}$ and 9 $\times$10$^{5}$ K cm$^{-3}$. No significant correlation was found between $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ and CO(2-1) linewidth. However, $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ correlates with P$_{\mathrm{turb}}$, particularly in HSB regions ($\rho &gt;$0.60). In contrast, SF efficiency moderately anti-correlates with P$_{\mathrm{turb}}$ in LSB regions but shows no correlation in HSB regions. Additionally, we identify regions where peaks in SF and MG are decoupled, yielding a shallow N ($\leq$ 0.28 $\pm$ 0.18). Overall, the range of N reflects distinct physical properties and distribution of both the SF and MG, which can be masked by disk-averaged measurements.</description>

      <title>Why so young? A curious connection between the broadband flux and neutral gas content of AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here a study of the broadband spectral properties of 33 sources detected in HI absorption as part of the ASKAP-FLASH Pilot Surveys. We outline our approach to spectral classification and discuss the correlation seen between spectral shape and the detection of HI absorption. We further consider the implications of the observed correlation on the spatial distribution of the neutral gas, and on the jet-gas interactions. Our results are evaluated in the context of the forthcoming, full ASKAP-FLASH survey and other large, untargeted searches of the radio sky.</description>

      <title>Long-term radio variability of active galactic nuclei at 37 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of analysing the long-term radio variability of active galactic nuclei at 37 GHz using data of 123 sources observed in the Aalto University Mets\"ahovi Radio Observatory. Our aim was to constrain the characteristic timescales of the studied sources and to analyse whether up to 42 years of monitoring was enough to describe their variability behaviour. We used a periodogram to estimate the power spectral density of each source. The power spectral density is used to analyse the power content of a time series in the frequency domain, and it is a powerful tool in describing the variability of active galactic nuclei. We were interested in finding a bend frequency in the power spectrum, that is, a frequency at which the slope $\beta$ of the spectrum changes from a non-zero value to zero. We fitted two models to the periodograms of each source, namely the bending power law and the simple power law. The bend frequency in the bending power law corresponds to a characteristic timescale. We were able to constrain a timescale for 11 out of 123 sources, with an average characteristic timescale x_b = 1300 days and an average power-law slope $\beta$ = 2.3. The results suggest that up to 42 years of observations may not always be enough for obtaining a characteristic timescale in the radio domain. This is likely caused by a combination of both slow variability as well as sampling induced effects. We also compared the obtained timescales to 43 GHz very long baseline interferometry images. The maximum length of time a knot was visible was often close to the obtained characteristic timescale. This suggests a connection between the characteristic timescale and the jet structure.</description>

      <title>Active galactic nucleus time-variability analysis and its caveats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate some of the caveats in common statistical methods used for analysing astronomical variability timescales. We consider these issues specifically in the context of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and use a more practical approach compared to mathematics literature, where the number of formulae may sometimes be overwhelming. We conducted a thorough literature review both on the statistical properties of light-curve data, specifically in the context of sampling effects, as well as on the methods used to analyse them. We simulated a wide range of data to test some of the known issues in AGN variability analysis as well as to investigate previously unknown or undocumented caveats. We discovered problems with some commonly used methods and confirmed how challenging it is to identify timescales from observed data. We find that interpolation of a light curve with biased sampling, specifically with bias towards flaring events, affects its measured power spectral density in a different manner than those of simulated light curves. We also find that an algorithm aiming to match the probability density function of a light curve has often been used incorrectly. These new issues appear to have been mostly overlooked and not necessarily addressed before, especially in astronomy literature.</description>

      <title>The supermassive black hole population from seeding via collisions in Nuclear Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence of nuclear star clusters (NSCs) and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galaxies with stellar masses $\sim 10^{10}~$M$_\odot$, the scaling relations between their properties and properties of the host galaxy (e.g., $M_{NSC}^{stellar}-M_{galaxy}^{stellar}$, $M_{BH}-M_{galaxy}^{stellar}$), and the fact that NSCs seem to take on the role of SMBHs in less massive galaxies and vice versa in the more massive ones, suggest that the origin of NSCs and SMBHs is related. In this study, we implement an 'in-situ' NSC formation scenario, where NSCs are formed in the center of galaxies due to star formation in the accumulated gas. We explore the impact of the free parameter $A_{res}$ which regulates the amount of gas transferred to the NSC reservoir, playing a crucial role in shaping the cluster's growth. Simultaneously, we include a BH seed formation recipe based on stellar collisions within NSCs in the Semi-Analytical Model (SAM) Galacticus to explore the resulting population of SMBHs. We determine the parameter space of the NSCs that form a BH seed and find that in initially more compact NSCs the formation of these BH seeds is more favorable, leading to the formation of light, medium and heavy BH seeds which finally reach masses up to $\sim 10^9$~M$_\odot$ and is comparable with the observed SMBH mass function at masses above $10^8$~M$_\odot$. Additionally, we compare the resulting population of NSCs with a derived NSC mass function from the stellar mass function of galaxies from the GAMA survey at $z&lt;0.06$ finding a well agreement in shape terms. We also find a considerable overlap in the observed scaling relations between the NSC mass, and the host galaxy stellar mass and velocity dispersion which is independent of the value of $A_{res}$. However, the chi-square analysis suggests that the model requires further refinement to achieve better quantitative agreement.</description>

      <title>Andromeda's tenuous veil: extensive nebular emission near (yet far from) M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large, faint nebula was unexpectedly discovered near M31 using narrowband [O III] images. Its apparent size and the lack of a clear counterpart at other wavelengths make it unique and challenging to explain. We aim to determine whether the nebula is extragalactic or located within the Milky Way. This will enable us to constrain its physical properties and assess its nature. To do so, we obtained deep narrowband [O II]3727 and H$\alpha$+[NII] observations with the JAST80 telescope at the Observatorio Astrof\'isico de Javalambre, as well as high-spectral-resolution spectroscopy at four locations within the region of interest using MEGARA at the Gran Telescopio Canarias. We found extended [O II] emission along two near-parallel strands to the [O III], offset by six arcmin. The nebular spectra reveals up to 6 emission lines from [O III]4959,5007, H$\beta$, [N II]6583, and [S II]6716,6731. Their receding velocities are above $-$40 km s$^{-1}$, far from the systemic velocity of M31 ($-$300 km s$^{-1}$). The fluxes and velocities are consistent for the same lines across different regions of the nebula. The nebular properties suggest a location within the Milky Way rather than being physically associated with M31. The most likely scenario is a resolved ionization structure in a Galactic nebula with a separation between [O II] and [O III] of a few parsecs. The observed receding velocities would be unprecedented for an object physically linked to M31 but are common for nearby gas filaments. Their consistency across the nebula would also be unusual if it were larger than a kiloparsec. The analysis of the emission-line ratios, line widths, and morphology suggests the possibility of it being an interstellar gas filament with an additional source of ionization to explain the [O III] emission. However, the complex properties of this object call for further observations to confirm its nature.</description>

      <title>A first measurement of galaxy merger rate increasing in dynamically colder protoclusters at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of galaxy cluster formation likely leaves an imprint on the properties of its individual member galaxies. Understanding this process is essential for uncovering the evolutionary connections between galaxies and cosmic structures. Here we study a sample of ten protoclusters at z~2-3 in different dynamical states that we estimate based on spectroscopic data of their members. We combine the dynamical information with HST imaging to measure galaxy sizes and pair fractions. Our analysis reveals a clear anti-correlation between the velocity dispersion of the protocluster and its galaxy pair fractions (indicative of merger rates). The velocity dispersion also anti-correlates with the dispersion in size among of the member galaxies. These correlations may be explained by protoclusters in colder dynamical states maintaining a velocity dispersion and galaxy number density that boosts galaxy mergers, which in turn contributes to the structural expansion and compaction of galaxies. Our findings offer constraints for cosmological models regarding the evolution of galaxy morphology across different stages in the assembly of protoclusters.</description>

      <title>Early Results from GLASS-JWST. XXV. Electron Density in the Interstellar Medium at $0.7\lesssim z\lesssim 9.3$ with NIRSpec High-resolution Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron density (${n_{\rm e}}$) of the interstellar medium (ISM) in star-forming galaxies is intimately linked to star formation and ionization condition. Using the high-resolution spectra obtained from the JWST NIRSpec micro shutter assembly (MSA) as part of the GLASS-JWST program, we have assembled the largest sample to date (34 galaxies) with individual ${n_{\rm e}}$ measurements derived from the [OII] $\lambda\lambda$3726,29 and/or [SII] $\lambda\lambda$6718,32 doublets at $0.7\lesssim z\lesssim 9.3$. The gravitational lensing magnification by the foreground Abell~2744 cluster allows us to probe ${n_{\rm e}}$ in galaxies with stellar masses ($M_{*}$) down to $\simeq 10^{7.5} M_\odot$ across the entire redshift range. Our analysis reveals that the [OII] flux ratios are marginally anti-correlated with specific star formation rate (sSFR) within a 1-$\sigma$ confidence interval, whereas the [SII] flux ratios show no significant correlation with sSFR. Despite clear correlation between sSFR and redshift within our sample, we find no apparent redshift evolution of ${n_{\rm e}}$ at $z \simeq 1-9$. Our dataset also includes 13 galaxies where ${n_{\rm e}}$ can be measured from both [OII] and [SII]. Contrary to findings at lower redshifts, we observe considerable scatter in ${n_{\rm e}}$ measurements from [OII] and [SII], indicating a complex gaseous environment with significant variations in ${n_{\rm e}}$ in high-redshift galaxies. This work highlights the unique capability of JWST NIRSpec/MSA high-resolution spectroscopy to characterize the detailed physical properties of the ISM in individual high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Observational studies on S-bearing molecules in massive star forming regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We present observational results of H$_{2}$S 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$, H$_{2}$$^{34}$S 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$, H$_{2}$CS 5$_{14}$-4$_{14}$, HCS$^{+}$ 4-3, SiO 4-3, HC$_{3}$N 19-18 and C$^{18}$O 1-0 toward a sample of 51 late-stage massive star-forming regions, to study relationships among H$_{2}$S, H$_{2}$CS, HCS$^{+}$ and SiO in hot cores. Chemical connections of these S-bearing molecules are discussed based on the relations between relative abundances in sources. Results. H$_{2}$S 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$, H$_{2}$$^{34}$S 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$, H$_{2}$CS 5$_{14}$-4$_{14}$, HCS$^{+}$ 4-3 and HC$_{3}$N 19-18 were detected in 50 of the 51 sources, while SiO 4-3 was detected in 46 sources. C$^{18}$O 1-0 was detected in all sources. The Pearson correlation coefficients between H$_{2}$CS and HCS$^+$ normalized by H$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$S are 0.94 and 0.87, respectively, and a tight linear relationship is found between them with slope of 1.00 and 1.09, while they are 0.77 and 0.98 between H$_2$S and H$_2$CS, respectively, and 0.76 and 0.97 between H$_2$S and HCS$^+$. The values of full width at half maxima (FWHM) of them in each source are similar to each other, which indicate that they can trace similar regions. Comparing the observed abundance with model results, there is one possible time (2-3$\times$10$^{5}$ yr) for each source in the model. The abundances of these molecules increase with the increment of SiO abundance in these sources, which implies that shock chemistry may be important for them. Conclusions. Close abundance relation of H$_2$S, H$_2$CS and HCS$^+$ molecules and similar line widths in observational results indicate that these three molecules could be chemically linked, with HCS$^+$ and H$_2$CS the most correlated. The comparison of the observational results with chemical models shows that the abundances can be reproduced for almost all the sources at a specific time. The observational results, including abundances in these sources need to be considered in further modeling H$_{2}$S, H$_{2}$CS and HCS$^{+}$ in hot cores with shock chemistry.</description>

      <title>Lyman Continuum Leakers at $z&gt;3$ in the GOODS-S Field: Mergers Dominated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the ionizing photon escape from galaxies is essential for studying Cosmic Reionization. With a sample of 23 Lyman Continuum (LyC) leakers at $3&lt;z&lt;4.5$ in the GOODS-S field, we investigate their morphologies using high-resolution data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that 20 of the 23 LyC leakers show merging signatures, while the remaining 3 are starbursts. Based on our previous finding that LyC leakers are not necessarily starbursts while some are in the star formation main sequence, we further find that those in the main sequence show merger signatures. Our results suggest that LyC leakers are either starbursts or mergers, both of which can facilitate the LyC photon escape, in addition to generating more LyC photons. Furthermore, we show that high-$z$ LyC leakers are statistically more extended than those selected at low redshift, which exhibits a higher merger fraction as size increases. This is likely due to the observational bias that the spatial resolution limits the detection of high-$z$ compact galaxies, while low redshift LyC leakers are more selected as compact starbursts.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Local Analogs to JWST's Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a new class of high redshift (high-$z$, $z&gt;4$) compact galaxies which are red in the rest-frame optical and blue in the rest-frame UV as V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs), referred to as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). It is very likely that LRDs host obscured broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In the meanwhile, Green pea galaxies (GPs), which are compact dwarf galaxies at low redshift, share various similar properties with high redshift star-forming galaxies. Here we aim to find the connection between the LRDs and GPs hosting broad-line AGNs (BLGPs). With a sample of 19 BLGPs obtained from our previous work, we further identify 7 GPs with V-shaped rest-frame UV-to-optical SEDs that are likely local analogs to LRDs. These V-shaped BLGPs exhibit faint UV absolute magnitudes and sub-Eddington rates similar to those of LRDs. Three of them occupy a similar region as LRDs in the BPT diagram, suggesting they have similar ionization conditions and gas-phase metallicities to LRDs. These similarities suggest that V-shaped BLGPs can be taken as local analogs of high-redshift LRDs. In addition, most (16/19) BLGPs, including 6 V-shaped BLGPs, host over-massive black holes above the local $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{*}$ relation, making it the first sample of galaxies hosting over-massive black holes at $z&lt;0.4$. These findings will help us learn more about the formation and co-evolution of early galaxies and black holes.</description>

      <title>Searching for dual/lensed quasar candidates with spectroscopic surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual and lensed quasars are valuable astrophysical targets in many aspects. Dual quasars, considered as the precursors of supermassive black hole binaries, can provide crucial insights into how black hole mergers drive the growth of supermassive black holes and influence the evolution of galaxies. Lensed quasars, formed by the gravitational deflection of a background quasar's light by a massive foreground object, can address key cosmological questions, particularly in refining measurements of the Hubble constant. Despite their significance, the number of confirmed dual and lensed quasars remains limited. Here in this work, we propose a systematic search for dual/lensed quasars using broad emission line profile diagnostics. Our parent sample consists of spectroscopic quasars from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Early Data Release (DESI EDR) and the SDSS DR17 catalog. We identify 30 lensed quasar candidates with similar broad emission line profiles, as well as 36 dual quasar candidates with different profiles. Cross-matching these 66 targets with the HST archival database, we find four overlapping targets, including three previously reported lensed quasars and one newly identified dual quasar candidate. We estimate the black hole masses for the two cores in the same system. The mass ratios are similar in the lensed quasar scenario but vary widely for dual quasars, consistent with the physical nature of these two types. In particular, we identified a dual quasar candidate with the mass ratio exceeding 100 times. We aim to discover more dual/lensed quasar candidates using our method with the upcoming future spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of galaxies follow scaling relations related to the physics that govern galaxy evolution. Based on these, we can identify galaxies undergoing specific evolutionary processes such as HI-excess galaxies, which have relatively high HI mass compared to their stellar mass. The possible reasons for this could be either recent gas accretion or an inefficient conversion of the HI to molecular gas. Since recent gas accretion is difficult to prove conclusively, we investigated gas conversion by analysing the molecular gas content of five extremely HI rich galaxies from the HIX galaxy sample. For this, we obtained CO observations of the sample galaxies with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). While we find that our sample galaxies have relatively regularly rotating molecular gas disks, their molecular gas fraction is significantly lower than what is expected from scaling relations and the CO gas has relatively high velocity dispersion.</description>

      <title>Survival and synthetic observables of neutral atomic hydrogen in galactic wind simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connecting numerical simulations to observations is essential to understanding the physics of galactic winds. Our Galaxy hosts a large-scale, multi-phase nuclear wind, whose dense gas has been detected using HI and molecular line observations. In this paper, we summarise our recent numerical work devoted to producing synthetic HI observables and measuring the properties of HI gas in galactic wind simulations. We discuss the evolution of radiative cloud systems embedded in star formation-driven galactic winds. Our shock-multicloud models show that multicloud gas streams are able to produce significant fractions of HI gas via recondensation. Our wind-cloud models show that magnetic fields have significant effects on the morphology and spectral signatures of HI gas. Cooling-driven recondensation, hydrodynamic shielding, and magnetic draping promote the survival of dense gas and the development of filamentary outflows. The orientation of magnetic fields also has an effect on synthetic observables, particularly on HI spectral lines. Transverse magnetic fields produce broader spectral lines of HI than aligned magnetic fields. Our models and analysis suggest that the fast-moving HI gas observed in the nuclear wind of our Galaxy may arise from multi-phase flows via recondensation.</description>

      <title>Dust and gas modelling in radiative transfer simulations of disc-dominated galaxies with RADMC-3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bridging theory and observations is a key task to understand galaxy formation and evolution. With the advent of state-of-the-art observational facilities, an accurate modelling of galaxy observables through radiative transfer simulations coupled to hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation must be performed. We present a novel pipeline, dubbed RTGen, based on the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC-3D , and explore the impact of the physical assumptions and modelling of dust and gas phases on the resulting galaxy observables. In particular, we address the impact of the dust abundance, composition, and grain size, as well as model the atomic-to-molecular transition and study the resulting emission from molecular gas. We apply Monte Carlo radiative transfer a posteriori to determine the dust temperature in six different hydrodynamic simulations of isolated galaxies. Afterwards, we apply ray tracing to compute the spectral energy distribution, as well as continuum images and spectral line profiles. We find our pipeline to predict accurate spectral energy distribution distributions of the studied galaxies, as well as continuum and CO luminosity images, in good agreement with literature results from both observations and theoretical studies. In particular, we find the dust modelling to have an important impact on the convergence of the resulting predicted galaxy observables, and that an adequate modelling of dust grains composition and size is required. We conclude that our novel framework is ready to perform high-accuracy studies of the observables of the ISM, reaching few tens percent convergence under the studied baseline configuration. This will enable robust studies of galaxy formation, and in particular of the nature of massive clumps in high-redshift galaxies, through the generation of mock images mimicking observations from state-of-the-art facilities such as JWST and ALMA.</description>

      <title>Channels of Stellar-mass Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the basis of a large collection of detailed 3D core-collapse supernova simulations carried to late times, we identify four channels of stellar mass black hole formation. Our examples for Channel 1 involve the formation of lower-gap and above black holes in energetic asymmetric supernova explosions. Our Channel 2 example involves a modest supernova explosion that may leave behind a lower-gap to $\sim$10 $M_{\odot}$ black hole. The latter may not be easily distinguishable from ``standard" supernovae that birth neutron stars. Our Channel 3 example experiences an aborted core-collapse explosion, more often in the context of a low-metallicity progenitor, whose residue is a black hole with a mass perhaps up to $\sim$40 $M_{\odot}$. The latter may be accompanied by a pulsational-pair instability supernova (PPISN). Channel 4 is the only quiescent or ``silent" scenario for which perhaps $\sim$5 to 15 $M_{\odot}$ black holes are left. Where appropriate, we estimate $^{56}$Ni yields, explosion energies, approximate recoil speeds, and residual black hole masses. The progenitor mass density and binding energy profiles at collapse influence the outcome in a systematic way. The statistics and prevalence of these various channels depend not only on still evolving supernova theory, but on remaining issues with the theory of massive star evolution, binary interaction, wind mass loss, metallicity, and the nuclear equation of state. Importantly, we suggest, but have not proven, that the silent channel for black hole formation may not be the dominant formation modality.</description>

      <title>Reassessing the Cepheid-based distance ladder: implications for the Hubble constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble constant ($H_0$) is a key parameter in cosmology, yet its precise value remains contentious due to discrepancies between early- and late-universe measurement methods, a problem known as the "Hubble tension." In this study, we revisit the Cepheid-based distance ladder calibration, focusing on two potential sources of bias in the period-luminosity relation (PLR): (1) how Milky Way (MW) Cepheids are treated and (2) systematic differences in the periodicities of Cepheids in anchor galaxies versus supernova host galaxies. To address these issues, we adopt two strategies alongside a renewed MW Cepheid calibration. The first strategy involves resampling anchor and host Cepheids from a common periodicity distribution. This approach provides a conservative estimate of $H_0 = (72.18 \pm 1.76) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$. The increased uncertainty reflects the reduced sample size -- about 700 Cepheids per resampling compared to 3200 in the original dataset. This method reduces the Hubble tension from $5.4 \, \sigma$ (as reported by the SH0ES collaboration with $H_0 = (73.17 \pm 0.86) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$) to $2.4 \, \sigma$. The second strategy allows the PLR slope to vary across different periodicity ranges, yielding $H_0 = (72.35 \pm 0.91) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ and the tension reduced to $4.4 \, \sigma$. Both strategies consistently indicate a downward shift of approximately $-1 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ in $H_0$. Our findings underscore the importance of careful consideration of Cepheid population characteristics for precise $H_0$ calibrations.</description>

      <title>Deeply Comprehensive Astrometric, Photometric, and Kinematic Studies of the Three OCSN Open Clusters with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we considered the optical wavelength of Gaia DR3 to analyze poorly studied three newly open star clusters namely OCSN 203, OCSN 213, and OCSN 244 clusters with ASTECA code. Here, we identified candidates of 227, 200, and 551 with highly probable ($P \geq 50\%$) members. Fitting King's profile within RDPs allows us to estimate inner stellar structures like core (0.190 $\le r_{\rm c}$ (pc) $\le$ 1.284) and the limiting (0.327 $\le r_{\rm cl}$ (pc) $\le 1.302$) radii. Constructing CMDs fitted with suitable log age (yr) between (log t; 6.52 - 7.05) and metallicities (Z; 0.01308-0.01413) isochrones. Therefore, the estimated photometric parameters with CMDs, reflect the heliocentric distances are 332 $\pm$ 18, 529 $\pm$ 23, and 506 $\pm$ 23 (pc) for OCSN 203, OCSN 213, and OCSN 244, respectively. Furthermore, the collective mass ($M_{\rm C}$) in solar mass units calculated with MLR as 67 $\pm$ 8.19, 91 $\pm$ 9.54, and 353 $\pm$ 18.79. Additionally, LF determined that the mean absolute magnitudes are 9.54 $\pm$ 3.09, 8.52 $\pm$ 2.92, and 7.60 $\pm$ 2.76 for these clusters, respectively. The overall mass function reflects the slopes ($\alpha$) for Salpeter within the uncertainty are ($\alpha_{OCSN203}$ = 2.41 $\pm$ 0.06), ($\alpha_{OCSN213}$ = 2.13 $\pm$ 0.07), and ($\alpha_{OCSN244}$ = 2.28 $\pm$ 0.07). The results of this study which employed a dynamical analysis over varying timescales indicate that OCSN 203 and OCSN 244 are clusters that have undergone significant relaxation, with a dynamical evolution parameter ($\tau$) that is much greater than one. In contrast, OCSN 213 exhibits characteristics of a non-relaxed cluster. A kinematic analysis of these open clusters was carried out, encompassing aspects of their apex position ($A_o,D_o$) using the AD diagrams. At the end, we found that the three OCSN clusters are young stellar disc members using dynamic orbit parameters.</description>

      <title>Dynamic and Radiative Implications of Jet-Star Interactions in AGN Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interactions between jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their stellar environments significantly influence jet dynamics and emission characteristics. In low-power jets, such as those in Fanaroff-Riley I (FR I) galaxies, the jet-star interactions can notably affect jet deceleration and energy dissipation.
  Recent numerical studies suggest that mass loading from stellar winds is a key factor in decelerating jets, accounting for many observed characteristics in FR I jets. Additionally, a radio-optical positional offset has been observed, with optical emission detected further down the jet than radio emission. This observation may challenge traditional explanations based solely on recollimation shocks and instabilities.
  This work utilizes the radiative transfer code RIPTIDE to generate synthetic synchrotron maps, from a population of re-accelerated electrons, in both radio and optical bands from jet simulations incorporating various mass-loading profiles and distributions of gas and stars within the ambient medium.
  Our findings emphasize the importance of mass entrainment in replicating the extended and diffuse radio/optical emissions observed in FR I jets and explaining the radio-optical offsets. These offsets are influenced by the galaxy's physical properties, the surrounding stellar populations, and observational biases. We successfully reproduce typical radio-optical offsets by considering a mass-load equivalent to $10^{-9}~M_\odot \cdot \rm{yr}^{-1} \cdot \rm{pc}^{-3}$. Overall, our results demonstrate that positive offset measurements are a promising tool for revealing the fundamental properties of galaxies and potentially their stellar populations, particularly in the context of FR I jets.</description>

      <title>CRAFTS for HI cosmology: I. data analysis and preliminary results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results from calibrating the data of the Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey (CRAFTS) for \HI intensity mapping by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST). Using 70 hours of drift-scan observation with the L-band (1.05-1.45GHz) 19-beam receiver, we obtain the data covering $270\,\rm deg^2$ sky area. We employ both the pulsar backend and the spectrum backend to calibrate the spectral time-ordered-data (TOD) before projecting them onto HEALPix maps. We produce calibrated TOD with frequency resolution of 30 kHz and time resolution of 1 s and the map data-cube with frequency resolution of 30kHz and spatial resolution of $2.95\,\rm arcmin^2$. We carefully examine the pointing errors, noise overflow, RFI contamination and their effect on the data quality. The resulting noise level is $\sim$ 5.7 mJy for the calibrated TOD and 1.6 mJy for the map, which is consistent with the theoretical predictions within 5\% at RFI-free channels. We also validate the data by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and find most foreground components are concentrated in the first 30 modes. We identify 447 isolated bright continuum sources in our data matching the NRAO-VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) catalog, with relative flux error of 8.3\% for TOD and 11.9\% for the map-level. We also measure the \HI emission of 90 galaxies with redshift $z&lt;0.07$ and compare with \HI-MaNGA spectra from the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), yielding an overall relative error of the \HI integral flux of 16.7\%. Our results confirm the feasibility of conducting cosmological \HI signal detection with CRAFTS.</description>

      <title>Fast GPU-Powered and Auto-Differentiable Forward Modeling of IFU Data Cubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present RUBIX, a fully tested, well-documented, and modular Open Source tool developed in JAX, designed to forward model IFU cubes of galaxies from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The code automatically parallelizes computations across multiple GPUs, demonstrating performance improvements over state-of-the-art codes by a factor of 600. This optimization reduces compute times from hours to only seconds. RUBIX leverages JAX's auto-differentiation capabilities to enable not only forward modeling but also gradient computations through the entire pipeline paving the way for new methodological approaches such as e.g. gradient-based optimization of astrophysics model parameters. RUBIX is open-source and available on GitHub: https://github.com/ufuk-cakir/rubix.</description>

      <title>On the low-energy limit of stationary and axisymmetric solutions in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the low-energy limit of General Relativity in the presence of stationarity and axial symmetry, coupled to dust. Specifically, we demonstrate that differences between the dynamics of General Relativity and those of Newtonian gravity persist even in the weak-field and slow-motion regime. Notably, these differences are driven by dragging terms that are not necessarily small, as is typically the case in the well-known gravitomagnetic limit. To highlight this distinction, we introduce the concept of strong gravitomagnetism. We provide a pedagogical discussion of how these discrepancies arise and outline a systematic procedure to solve the equations of motion for such systems. Furthermore, we present analytical results for specific cases and also give the general solution for the vacuum case. A particularly notable result is our demonstration of how General Relativity can naturally account for a Tully-Fisher-like relation.</description>

      <title>All Puffed Up: Exploring Ultra-diffuse Galaxy Origins through Galaxy Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new follow-up observations of two ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) selected for their distorted morphologies and tidal features, suggestive of tidal influence. Using Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys F555W and F814W imaging, we identify $8\pm2$ globular clusters (GCs) in KUG 0203-Dw1 and $6\pm2$ in KDG 013, abundances typical for normal dwarf galaxies of similar stellar mass. Jansky Very Large Array data reveal a clear HI detection of KUG 0203-Dw1 with a gas mass estimate of $\log{M_{\rm{HI}}/M_{\odot}}\lesssim 7.4$ and evidence of active stripping by the host, while KDG 013 has no clear gas detection. The UDGs likely originated as normal dwarf galaxies that have been subjected to significant stripping and tidal heating, causing them to become more diffuse. These two UDGs complete a sample of five exhibiting tidal features in the full Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey area (CFHTLS; $\sim150^{2}$ deg). These tidally influenced UDGs exhibit diversse properties; one stands out as a potential result of a dwarf merger, while the remainder suggest tidal heating origins. We also cannot conclusively rule out that these galaxies became UDGs in the field before processing by the group environment, underscoring the need for broader searches of diffuse galaxies to better understand the impact of galaxy interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantitative analysis of the molecular gas morphology in nearby disk galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantitative and statistical analysis of the molecular gas morphology in 73 nearby galaxies using high spatial resolution CO ($J$ = 2-1) data obtained from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) by the PHANGS large program. We applied three model-independent parameters: Concentration ($C$), Asymmetry ($A$), and Clumpiness ($S$) which are commonly used to parameterize the optical and infrared morphology of galaxies. We find a clear apparent correlation between $A$ and $S$, with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of $0.52$ with a $p$-value of $2\times10^{-6}$. This suggests a higher abundance of molecular clumps (i.e. giant molecular cloud associations) in galaxies that display stronger distortion or biased large-scale molecular gas distribution. In addition, the analysis of the $C$ parameter suggests high central molecular concentration in most barred spiral galaxies investigated in this study. Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between the length of the bar structure ($R_\mathrm{bar}/R_{25}$) and the $C$ parameter, with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of $0.63$ with a $p$-value of $3.8 \times 10^{-5}$, suggesting that larger bar structure can facilitate overall molecular gas transport and yield higher central concentration than galaxies with shorter bars. Finally, we offer a possible classification scheme of nearby disk galaxies which is based on the CAS parameters of molecular gas.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES XIII: Strong-lens candidates at all mass scales and their environments from the Hyper-Suprime Cam and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed a systematic search for strong gravitational lenses using Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) data, focusing on galaxy-scale lenses combined with an environment analysis resulting in the identification of lensing clusters. To identify these lens candidates, we exploited our neural network (NN) from HOLISMOKES VI. During our visual grading, we also simultaneously inspected larger stamps (80'' x 80'') to identify large, extended arcs and also classify their overall environment. Here, we also re-inspected our previous lens candidates with i-Kron radii larger than 0.8''. Using the 546 visually identified lens candidates, we further defined various criteria to select the candidates in overdensities. In total, we identified 24 grade A and 138 grade B candidates that exhibit either spatially-resolved multiple images or extended, distorted arcs in the new sample. Furthermore, combining our different techniques to determine overdensities, we identified a total of 231/546 lens candidates by at least one of our three identification methods for overdensities. This new sample contains only 49 group- or cluster-scale re-discoveries, while 43 systems had been identified by all three procedures. Furthermore, we performed a statistical analysis by using the NN from HOLISMOKES IX to model these systems, making this the largest uniformly modeled sample to date. We find a tendency towards larger Einstein radii for galaxy-scale systems in overdense environments. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying NNs to hundreds of million cutouts, while resulting in a sample size that can be visually inspected by humans. These deep learning pipelines, with false-positive rates of ~0.01%, are very powerful tools to identify such rare galaxy-scale strong lensing systems, while also aiding in the discovery of new strong lensing clusters.</description>

      <title>Probing galaxy evolution from $z=0$ to $z\simeq10$ through galaxy scaling relations in three L-Galaxies flavours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive examination of the three latest versions of the L-Galaxies semi-analytic galaxy formation model, focusing on the evolution of galaxy properties across a broad stellar mass range ($10^7\:{\rm M}_{\odot}\lesssim{M_\star}\lesssim10^{12}\:{\rm M}_{\odot}$) from $z=0$ to $z\simeq10$. This study is the first to compare predictions of L-Galaxies with high-redshift observations well outside the original calibration regime, utilising multiband data from surveys such as SDSS, CANDELS, COSMOS, HST, JWST, and ALMA. We assess the models' ability to reproduce various time-dependent galaxy scaling relations for star-forming and quenched galaxies. Key focus areas include global galaxy properties such as stellar mass functions, cosmic star formation rate density, and the evolution of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. Additionally, we examine resolved morphological properties such as the galaxy mass-size relation, alongside core $(R&lt;1\,{\rm{kpc}})$ and effective $(R&lt;R_{\rm{e}})$ stellar-mass surface densities as a function of stellar mass. This analysis reveals that the L-Galaxies models are in qualitatively good agreement with observed global scaling relations up to $z\simeq10$. However, significant discrepancies exist at both low and high redshifts in accurately reproducing the number density, size, and surface density evolution of quenched galaxies. These issues are most pronounced for massive central galaxies, where the simulations underpredict the abundance of quenched systems at $z\geq1.5$, reaching a discrepancy of a factor of 60 by $z\approx3$, with sizes several times larger than observed. Therefore, we propose that the physical prescriptions governing galaxy quenching, such as AGN feedback and processes related to merging, require improvement to be more consistent with observational data.</description>

Abstract: We use a sample of 73 simulated satellite and central dwarf galaxies spanning a stellar mass range of $10^{5.3}-10^{9.1} M_\odot$ to investigate the origin of their stellar age gradients. We find that dwarf galaxies often form their stars "inside-out," i.e., the stars form at successively larger radii over time. However, the oldest stars get reshuffled beyond the star forming radius by fluctuations in the gravitational potential well caused by stellar feedback (the same mechanisms that cause dwarfs to form dark matter cores). The result is that many dwarfs appear to have an "outside-in" age gradient at $z=0$, with younger stellar populations more centrally concentrated. However, for the reshuffled galaxies with the most extended star formation, young stars can form out to the large radii to which the old stars have been reshuffled, erasing the age gradient. We find that major mergers do not play a significant role in setting the age gradients of dwarfs. We find similar age gradient trends in satellites and field dwarfs, suggesting environment plays only a minor role, if any. Finally, we find that the age gradient trends are imprinted on the galaxies at later times, suggesting that the stellar reshuffling dominates after the galaxies have formed 50% of their stellar mass. The later reshuffling is at odds with results from the FIRE-2 simulations. Hence, age gradients offer a test of current star formation and feedback models that can be probed via observations of resolved stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary growth of molecular clouds as traced by their infrared bright fraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how stars form, evolve and impact molecular clouds is key to understanding why star formation is such an inefficient process globally. In this paper, we use the infrared bright fraction, $f_\text{IRB}$ (the fraction of a given molecular cloud that appears bright against the 8 $\mu$m Milky Way background) as a proxy for time evolution to test how cloud properties change as star formation evolves. We apply this metric to 12,000 high-mass star-forming molecular clouds we identify using the Herschel-Hi-GAL survey between $|l|&lt;70^\circ$ on the Milky Way plane. We find clouds are not static while forming stars. Instead, molecular clouds continuously gain mass while star formation progresses. By performing principal component analysis on the cloud properties, we find that they evolve down two paths distinguished by their mass gain. Most clouds (80%) gain four times more mass as a function of $f_\text{IRB}$. The remaining 20% experience an extreme period of growth, growing in mass by a factor of 150 on average and during this period, they initially gain mass fast enough to outpace their star formation. For all clouds, it is only after half their area becomes star forming that mass loss occurs. We expect stellar feedback and potentially galactic shear is responsible. By analysing cloud positions, we suggest that the rate of mass growth may be linked to the larger galactic environment. Altogether, these results have strong implications on how we assess star forming ability on cloud scales when assuming molecular cloud masses are fixed in time.</description>

      <title>Astraeus X: Indications of a top-heavy initial mass function in highly star-forming galaxies from JWST observations at z&gt;10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered an abundance of $z&gt;10$ galaxies bright in the ultraviolet (UV) that has challenged traditional theoretical models at high redshifts. Recently, various new models have emerged to address this discrepancy by refining their description of star formation. Here we investigate whether modifications to the stellar initial mass function (IMF) alone can reproduce the $z&gt;10$ UV luminosity functions (UV LFs) when the star formation rate is used as a proxy for the fraction of massive stars. We incorporate an Evolving IMF into the {\sc astraeus} galaxy evolution and reionisation simulation framework, which becomes increasingly top-heavy as the gas density in a galaxy rises above a given threshold. Our implementation accounts for the IMF's effects on supernova (SN) feedback, metal enrichment, and the UV and ionising emissivities. For this Evolving IMF model, we find that (i) the maximum UV luminosity enhancement is twice as large in massive galaxies ($\Delta M_\mathrm{UV}\simeq2.6$) than those where star formation is strongly limited by SN feedback ($\Delta M_\mathrm{UV}\simeq1.3$); (ii) it successfully reproduces the observed UV LFs at $z=5-15$; (iii) galaxies with top-heavy IMFs exhibit the highest star formation rates, driven by their location in local density peaks, which facilitates higher gas accretion rates; (iv) the $1\sigma$ variances in the UV luminosity are only slightly higher compared to when assuming a Salpeter IMF, but the $2\sigma$ variances are significantly increased by a factor of $1.4-2$ boosting the abundance of UV-bright galaxies at $z&gt;10$; (v) reionisation begins earlier with more extended large ionised regions and fewer smaller ones during its initial stages, though these differences diminish at lower redshifts, leading to a similar end of reionisation at $z\simeq5.6$.}</description>

      <title>Gas Dynamics in the Central Molecular Zone and its connection with the Galactic Bar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The innermost region of the Milky Way harbors the central molecular zone (CMZ). This region contains a large amount of molecular gas but a poor star formation rate considering the densities achieved by the gas in this region. We used the arepo code to perform a hydrodynamic and star formation simulation of the Galaxy, where a Ferrers bar was adiabatically introduced. During the stage of bar imposition, the bar strength excites density waves close to the inner Lindblad resonance guiding material toward the inner Galaxy, driving the formation of a ring that we qualitatively associate with the CMZ. During the simulation, we identified that the ring passes three main phases, namely: formation, instability, and quasi-stationary stages. During the whole evolution, and particularly in the quasi-stationary stage, we observe that the ring is associated with the x2 family of periodic orbits. Additionally, we found that most of the star formation occurs during the ring formation stage, while it drastically decreases in the instability stage. Finally, we found that when the gas has settled in a stable x2 orbit, the star formation takes place mostly after the dense gas passes the apocenter, triggering the conveyor-belt mechanism described in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Chemical enrichment in LINERs from MaNGA. I. Tracing Oxygen and Nitrogen Nuclear Abundances in LINERs with Varied Ionizing Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chemical enrichment in low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) is still an issue with spatial resolution spectroscopic data due to the lack of studies and the uncertainties in the nature of their ionizing source, despite being the most abundant type of active galaxies in the nearby Universe. Considering different scenarios for the ionizing source (hot old stellar populations, active galactic nuclei (AGN) or inefficient accretion disks), we analyze the implications of these assumptions to constrain the chemical content of the gas-phase interstellar medium (ISM). We used a sample of 105 galaxies from Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, whose nuclear central spaxels show LINER-like emission. For each scenario considered, we built a grid of photoionization models (4928 models for each considered ionizing source) which are later used in the open-source code HII-CHI-Mistry, allowing us to estimate chemical abundance ratios such as 12+log(O/H) or log(N/O) and constrain the ionization parameter that characterize the ionized ISM in those galaxies. We obtain that oxygen abundances in the nuclear region of LINER-like galaxies spread over a wide range 8.08 &lt; 12+log(O/H) &lt; 8.89, with a median solar value (in agreement with previous studies) if AGN models are considered. Nevertheless, the derived nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio is much less affected by the assumptions on the ionizing source, and point towards suprasolar values (log(N/O) = -0.69). By comparing the different analyzed scenarios, we show that if hot old stellar populations were responsible of the ionization of the ISM a complex picture (such as outflows and/or inflows scaling with galaxy chemical abundance) would be needed to explain the chemical enrichment history, whereas the assumption of AGN activity is compatible with the standard scenario found in most galaxies.</description>

      <title>Non-linear magnetic buoyancy instability and galactic dynamos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic buoyancy (MBI) and Parker instabilities are strong and generic instabilities expected to occur in most astrophysical systems with sufficiently strong magnetic fields. In galactic and accretion discs, large-scale magnetic fields are thought to result from the mean-field dynamo action, in particular, the $\alpha^2\Omega$. Using non-ideal MHD equations, we model a section of the galactic disc in which the large-scale magnetic field is generated by an imposed $\alpha$-effect and differential rotation. We extend our earlier study of the interplay between magnetic buoyancy and the mean-field dynamo. We add differential rotation which enhances the dynamo and cosmic rays which enhance magnetic buoyancy. We construct a simple 1D model which replicates all significant features of the 3D simulations. We confirm that magnetic buoyancy can lead to oscillatory magnetic fields and discover that it can vary the magnetic field parity between quadrupolar and dipolar, and that inclusion of the differential rotation is responsible for the switch in field parity. Our results suggest that the large-scale magnetic field can have a dipolar parity within a few kiloparsecs of the galactic centre, provided the MBI is significantly stronger the the dynamo. Quadrupolar parity can remain predominant in the outer parts of a galactic disc. Cosmic rays accelerate both the dynamo and the MBI and support oscillatory non-linear states, a spatial magnetic field structure similar to the alternating magnetic field directions observed in some edge-on galaxies.</description>

      <title>Physical characterization of the FeLoBAL outflow in SDSS J0932+0840: Analysis of VLT/UVES observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: The study of quasar outflows is essential in understanding the connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies. We analyze the VLT/UVES spectrum of quasar SDSS J0932+0840 and identify several narrow and broad outflow components in absorption, with multiple ionization species including Fe II, which puts it among a rare class of outflows known as FeLoBALs. Aims: We study one of the outflow components to determine its physical characteristics by determining the total hydrogen column density, ionization parameter and the hydrogen number density. Through these parameters, we aim to obtain the distance of the outflow from the central source, its mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity, and to constrain the contribution of the outflow to AGN feedback. Methods: We obtain the ionic column densities from the absorption troughs in the spectrum, and use photoionization modeling to extract the physical parameters of the outflow, including the total hydrogen column density and ionization parameter. The relative population of the observed excited states of Fe II is used to model the hydrogen number density of the outflow. Results: We use the Fe II excited states to model the electron number density ($n_e$) and hydrogen number density ($n_H$) independently and obtain $n_e$ $\simeq$ $10^{3.4}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $n_H$ $\simeq$ $10^{4.8}$ cm$^{-3}$. Our analysis of the physical structure of the cloud shows that these two results are consistent with each other. This places the outflow system at a distance of $0.7_{-0.4}^{+0.9}$ kpc from the central source, with mass flow rate ($\dot{M}$) of $43^{+65}_{-26}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and kinetic luminosity ($\dot{E_k}$) of $0.7^{+1.1}_{-0.4}$ $\times$ $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$.</description>

Abstract: The study of the entire population of SNRs in a galaxy helps us to understand the underlying stellar populations, the environments, in which the SNRs are evolving, and the stellar feedback on the ISM. The all-sky survey carried out by the extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (Spektr-RG, SRG) has provided us with spatially and spectrally resolved X-ray data of the entire Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and its immediate surroundings in the soft X-ray band down to 0.2 keV. We performed a multiwavelength analysis of previously known SNR candidates and newly detected SNRs and SNR candidates. We applied the Gaussian gradient magnitude (GGM) filter to the eROSITA images of the LMC to highlight the edges of the shocked gas in order to find new SNRs. We compared the X-ray images with those of their optical and radio counterparts to investigate the true nature of the extended emission. We used the Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey (MCELS) for the optical data. For the radio comparison, we used data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) survey of the LMC. Using the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds (VMC) we have investigated the possible progenitors of the new SNRs and SNR candidates in our sample. We present the most updated catalogue of SNRs in the LMC. The eROSITA data have allowed us to confirm 1 of the previous SNR candidates and discover 16 new extended sources. We confirm 3 of them as new SNRs, while we propose the remaining 13 as new X-ray SNR candidates. We also present the first analysis of the follow-up XMM-Newton observation of MCSNR J0456-6533 discovered with eROSITA. Among the new candidates, we propose J0614-7251 (4eRASSU J061438.1-725112) as the first X-ray SNR candidate in the outskirts of the LMC.</description>

      <title>Detection of Diffuse Hot Gas Around the Young, Potential Superstar Cluster H72.97-69.39</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first Chandra X-ray observations of H72.97-69.39, a highly-embedded, potential super-star cluster (SSC) in its infancy located in the star-forming complex N79 of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We detect particularly hard, diffuse X-ray emission that is coincident with the young stellar objects (YSOs) identified with JWST, and the hot gas fills cavities in the dense gas mapped by ALMA. The X-ray spectra are best fit with either a thermal plasma or power-law model, and assuming the former, we show that the X-ray luminosity of L_X = (1.0 +- 0.3)e34 erg/s is a factor of ~20 below the expectation for a fully-confined wind bubble. Our results suggest that stellar wind feedback produces diffuse hot gas in the earliest stages of massive star cluster formation and that wind energy can be lost quickly via either turbulent mixing followed by radiative cooling or by physical leakage.</description>

      <title>Broadband Multi-wavelength Properties of M87 during the 2018 EHT Campaign including a Very High Energy Flaring Episode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nearby elliptical galaxy M87 contains one of the only two supermassive black holes whose emission surrounding the event horizon has been imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). In 2018, more than two dozen multi-wavelength (MWL) facilities (from radio to gamma-ray energies) took part in the second M87 EHT campaign. The goal of this extensive MWL campaign was to better understand the physics of the accreting black hole M87*, the relationship between the inflow and inner jets, and the high-energy particle acceleration. Understanding the complex astrophysics is also a necessary first step towards performing further tests of general relativity. The MWL campaign took place in April 2018, overlapping with the EHT M87* observations. We present a new, contemporaneous spectral energy distribution (SED) ranging from radio to very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays, as well as details of the individual observations and light curves. We also conduct phenomenological modelling to investigate the basic source properties. We present the first VHE gamma-ray flare from M87 detected since 2010. The flux above 350 GeV has more than doubled within a period of about 36 hours. We find that the X-ray flux is enhanced by about a factor of two compared to 2017, while the radio and millimetre core fluxes are consistent between 2017 and 2018. We detect evidence for a monotonically increasing jet position angle that corresponds to variations in the bright spot of the EHT image. Our results show the value of continued MWL monitoring together with precision imaging for addressing the origins of high-energy particle acceleration. While we cannot currently pinpoint the precise location where such acceleration takes place, the new VHE gamma-ray flare already presents a challenge to simple one-zone leptonic emission model approaches, and emphasises the need for combined image and spectral modelling.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Lagrangian Galaxy Bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01951v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding $\textit{galaxy bias}$ -- that is the statistical relation between matter and galaxies -- is of key importance for extracting cosmological information from galaxy surveys. While the bias function $f$ -- that is the probability of forming galaxy in a region with a given density field -- is usually approximated through a parametric expansion, we show here, that it can also be measured directly from simulations in a non-parameteric way. Our measurements show that the Lagrangian bias function is very close to a Gaussian for halo selections of any mass. Therefore, we newly introduce a Gaussian bias model with several intriguing properties: (1) It predicts only strictly positive probabilities $f &gt; 0$ (unlike expansion models), (2) It has a simple analytic renormalized form and (3) It behaves gracefully in many scenarios where the classical expansion converges poorly. We show that the Gaussian bias model describes the galaxy environment distribution $p(\delta | \mathrm{g})$, the scale dependent bias function $f$ and the renormalized bias function $F$ of haloes and galaxies generally equally well or significantly better than a second order expansion with the same number of parameters. We suggest that a Gaussian bias approach may enhance the range of validity of bias schemes where the canonical expansion converges poorly and further, that it may make new applications possible, since it guarantees the positivity of predicted galaxy densities.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark Matter, Core Collapse and the Galaxy-Galaxy Strong Lensing Discrepancy</title>

Abstract: Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters has emerged as a powerful tool to probe the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm of structure formation in the Universe. Despite the remarkable explanatory power of CDM on large scales, tensions with observations on small scales have been reported. Recent studies find that the observational cross-section for Galaxy-Galaxy Strong Lensing (GGSL) in clusters exceeds the CDM prediction by more than an order of magnitude, and persists even after rigorous examination of various possible systematics. We investigate the impact of modifying the internal structure of cluster dark matter sub-halos on GGSL and report that altering the inner density profile, given by $r^{\gamma}$, to steeper slopes with $\gamma &gt; 2.5$ can alleviate the GGSL discrepancy. Deviating from the $\gamma \sim 1.0$ cusps that CDM predicts, these steeper slopes could arise in models of self-interacting dark matter undergoing core collapse. Our results motivate additional study of sub-halo core collapse in dense cluster environments.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Supradense Matter from Dissecting Scaled Stellar Structure Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong-field gravity in General Relativity (GR) realized in neutron stars (NSs) renders the Equation of State (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of supradense neutron star (NS) matter to be essentially nonlinear and refines the upper bound for $\phi\equiv P/\varepsilon$ to be much smaller than the Special Relativity (SR) requirement with linear EOSs, where $P$ and $\varepsilon$ are respectively the pressure and energy density of the system considered. Specifically, a tight bound $\phi\lesssim0.374$ is obtained by anatomizing perturbatively the intrinsic structures of the scaled Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations without using any input nuclear EOS. New insights gained from this novel analysis provide EOS-model independent constraints on properties (e.g., density profiles of the sound speed squared $s^2=\d P/\d\varepsilon$ and trace anomaly $\Delta=1/3-\phi$) of cold supradense matter in NS cores. Using the gravity-matter duality in theories describing NSs, we investigate the impact of gravity on supradense matter EOS in NSs. In particular, we show that the NS mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$, radius $R$ and its compactness $\xi\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ scale with certain combinations of its central pressure and energy density (encapsulating its central EOS). Thus, observational data on these properties of NSs can straightforwardly constrain NS central EOSs without relying on any specific nuclear EOS-model.</description>

      <title>The High-resolution Accretion Disks of Embedded protoStars (HADES) simulations. I. Impact of Protostellar Magnetic Fields on the Accretion Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How embedded, actively accreting low-mass protostars accrete their mass is still greatly debated. Observations are now piecing together the puzzle of embedded protostellar accretion, in particular with new facilities in the near-infrared. However, high-resolution theoretical models are still lacking, with a stark paucity of detailed simulations of these early phases. Here we present high-resolution non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of a Solar mass protostar accreting at rates exceeding 10$^{-6} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We show the results of the accretion flow for four different protostellar magnetic fields, 10 G, 500 G, 1 kG, and 2 kG, combined with a disk magnetic field. For weaker (10 G and 500 G) protostar magnetic fields, accretion occurs via a turbulent boundary layer mode, with disk material impacting across the protostellar surface. In the 500 G model, the presence of a magnetically dominated outflow focuses the accretion towards the equator, slightly enhancing and ordering the accretion. For kG magnetic fields, the disk becomes truncated due to the protostellar dipole and exhibits magnetospheric accretion, with the 2 kG model having accretion bursts induced by the interchange instability. We present bolometric light curves for the models and find that they reproduce observations of Class I protostars from YSOVAR, with high bursts followed by an exponential decay possibly being a signature of instability-driven accretion. Finally, we present the filling fractions of accretion and find that 90\% of the mass is accreted in a surface area fraction of 10-20\%. These simulations will be extended in future work for a broader parameter space, with their high resolution and high temporal spacing able to explore a wide range of interesting protostellar physics.</description>
