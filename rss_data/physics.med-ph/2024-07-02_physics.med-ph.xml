      <title>A Bore-Integrated Patch Antenna Array for Whole-Body Excitation in Ultra-High-Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To develop and evaluate a bore-integrated patch antenna array designed for whole-body excitation in ultra-high-field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with improved transmit efficiency and address the limitations of existing RF coil designs. Methods: The proposed patch antenna array utilizes the MRI bore's RF shield as a functional component to enhance the RF magnetic field ($B_1^+$) distribution. Numerical simulations were conducted to compare the performance of the patch antenna array to bore-integrated stripline and local dipole arrays. A decoupling structure was implemented to minimize coupling between adjacent patch antennas. The performance of the patch array was evaluated experimentally. Results: The proposed patch array provides 3.9 times higher averaged transmit (Tx) efficiency in the CP mode and 3.0 times higher for the phase shimming regime versus the bore-integrated stripline array. Conclusion: Compared to the stripline array, the bore-integrated patch antenna array offers significant improvements in Tx efficiency for whole-body UHF MRI. Significance: The findings support the feasibility of integrating arrays into the RF shield of MRI scanners. This could broaden the clinical use of UHF body MRI technology.</description>

      <title>The relationship between parameters and effects in transcranial ultrasonic stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) is rapidly gaining traction for non-invasive human neuromodulation, with a pressing need to establish protocols that maximise neuromodulatory efficacy. In this review, we aggregate and examine empirical evidence for the relationship between tunable TUS parameters and in vitro and in vivo outcomes. Based on this multiscale approach, TUS researchers can make better informed decisions about optimal parameter settings. Importantly, we also discuss the challenges involved in extrapolating results from prior empirical work to future interventions, including the translation of protocols between models and the complex interaction between TUS protocols and the brain. A synthesis of the empirical evidence suggests that larger effects will be observed at lower frequencies within the sub-MHz range, higher intensities and pressures than commonly administered thus far, and longer pulses and pulse train durations. Nevertheless, we emphasise the need for cautious interpretation of empirical data from different experimental paradigms when basing protocols on prior work as we advance towards refined TUS parameters for human neuromodulation.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Models for High-Quality MR-to-CT Synthesis for Head and Neck Proton Treatment Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent advancements in proton therapy, MR-based treatment planning is gaining momentum to minimize additional radiation exposure compared to traditional CT-based methods. This transition highlights the critical need for accurate MR-to-CT image synthesis, which is essential for precise proton dose calculations. Our research introduces the Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Models (DSBM), an innovative approach for high-quality MR-to-CT synthesis. DSBM learns the nonlinear diffusion processes between MR and CT data distributions. This method improves upon traditional diffusion models by initiating synthesis from the prior distribution rather than the Gaussian distribution, enhancing both generation quality and efficiency. We validated the effectiveness of DSBM on a head and neck cancer dataset, demonstrating its superiority over traditional image synthesis methods through both image-level and dosimetric-level evaluations. The effectiveness of DSBM in MR-based proton treatment planning highlights its potential as a valuable tool in various clinical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Silver-enriched Microdomain Patterns as Advanced Bactericidal Coatings for Polymer-based Medical Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today, it would be difficult for us to live a full life without polymers, especially in medicine, where its applicability is constantly expanding, giving satisfactory results without any harm effects on health. This study focused on the formation of hexagonal domains doped with AgNPs using a KrF excimer laser ({\lambda}=248 nm) on the polyetheretherketone (PEEK) surface that acts as an unfailing source of the antibacterial agent - silver. The hexagonal structure was formed with a grid placed in front of the incident laser beam. Surfaces with immobilized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were observed by AFM and SEM. Changes in surface chemistry were studied by XPS. To determine the concentration of released Ag+ ions, ICP-MS analysis was used. The antibacterial tests proved the antibacterial efficacy of Ag-doped PEEK composites against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus as the most common pathogens. Because AgNPs are also known for their strong toxicity, we also included cytotoxicity tests in this study. The findings presented here contribute to the advancement of materials design in the biomedical field, offering a novel starting point for combating bacterial infections through the innovative integration of AgNPs into inert synthetic polymers.</description>

      <title>Framing image registration as a landmark detection problem for label-noise-aware task representation (HitR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate image registration is pivotal in biomedical image analysis, where selecting suitable registration algorithms demands careful consideration. While numerous algorithms are available, the evaluation metrics to assess their performance have remained relatively static. This study addresses this challenge by introducing a novel evaluation metric termed Landmark Hit Rate (HitR), which focuses on the clinical relevance of image registration accuracy. Unlike traditional metrics such as Target Registration Error, which emphasize subresolution differences, HitR considers whether registration algorithms successfully position landmarks within defined confidence zones. This paradigm shift acknowledges the inherent annotation noise in medical images, allowing for more meaningful assessments. To equip HitR with label-noise-awareness, we propose defining these confidence zones based on an Inter-rater Variance analysis. Consequently, hit rate curves are computed for varying landmark zone sizes, enabling performance measurement for a task-specific level of accuracy. Our approach offers a more realistic and meaningful assessment of image registration algorithms, reflecting their suitability for clinical and biomedical applications.</description>
