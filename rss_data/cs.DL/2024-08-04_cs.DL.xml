      <title>Decoding AI and Human Authorship: Nuances Revealed Through NLP and Statistical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores the nuanced differences in texts produced by AI and those written by humans, aiming to elucidate how language is expressed differently by AI and humans. Through comprehensive statistical data analysis, the study investigates various linguistic traits, patterns of creativity, and potential biases inherent in human-written and AI- generated texts. The significance of this research lies in its contribution to understanding AI's creative capabilities and its impact on literature, communication, and societal frameworks. By examining a meticulously curated dataset comprising 500K essays spanning diverse topics and genres, generated by LLMs, or written by humans, the study uncovers the deeper layers of linguistic expression and provides insights into the cognitive processes underlying both AI and human-driven textual compositions. The analysis revealed that human-authored essays tend to have a higher total word count on average than AI-generated essays but have a shorter average word length compared to AI- generated essays, and while both groups exhibit high levels of fluency, the vocabulary diversity of Human authored content is higher than AI generated content. However, AI- generated essays show a slightly higher level of novelty, suggesting the potential for generating more original content through AI systems. The paper addresses challenges in assessing the language generation capabilities of AI models and emphasizes the importance of datasets that reflect the complexities of human-AI collaborative writing. Through systematic preprocessing and rigorous statistical analysis, this study offers valuable insights into the evolving landscape of AI-generated content and informs future developments in natural language processing (NLP).</description>

      <title>Golden-Retriever: High-Fidelity Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation for Industrial Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Golden-Retriever, designed to efficiently navigate vast industrial knowledge bases, overcoming challenges in traditional LLM fine-tuning and RAG frameworks with domain-specific jargon and context interpretation. Golden-Retriever incorporates a reflection-based question augmentation step before document retrieval, which involves identifying jargon, clarifying its meaning based on context, and augmenting the question accordingly. Specifically, our method extracts and lists all jargon and abbreviations in the input question, determines the context against a pre-defined list, and queries a jargon dictionary for extended definitions and descriptions. This comprehensive augmentation ensures the RAG framework retrieves the most relevant documents by providing clear context and resolving ambiguities, significantly improving retrieval accuracy. Evaluations using three open-source LLMs on a domain-specific question-answer dataset demonstrate Golden-Retriever's superior performance, providing a robust solution for efficiently integrating and querying industrial knowledge bases.</description>

      <title>High-Impact Innovations and Hidden Gender Disparities in Inventor-Evaluator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study of millions of scientific, technological, and artistic innovations and find that the innovation gap faced by women is far from universal. No gap exists for conventional innovations. Rather, the gap is pervasively rooted in innovations that combine ideas in unexpected ways - innovations most critical to scientific breakthroughs. Further, at the USPTO we find that female examiners reject up to 33 percent more unconventional innovations by women inventors than do male examiners, suggesting that gender discrimination weakly explains this innovation gap. Instead, new data indicate that a configuration of institutional practices explains the innovation gap. These practices compromise the expertise women examiners need to accurately assess unconventional innovations and then "over-assign" women examiners to women innovators, undermining women's innovations. These institutional impediments negatively impact innovation rates in science but have the virtue of being more amenable to actionable policy changes than does culturally ingrained gender discrimination.</description>

      <title>Developing Application Profiles for Enhancing Data and Workflows in Cultural Heritage Digitisation Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a result of the proliferation of 3D digitisation in the context of cultural heritage projects, digital assets and digitisation processes - being considered as proper research objects - must prioritise adherence to FAIR principles. Existing standards and ontologies, such as CIDOC CRM, play a crucial role in this regard, but they are often over-engineered for the need of a particular application context, thus making their understanding and adoption difficult. Application profiles of a given standard - defined as sets of ontological entities drawn from one or more semantic artefacts for a particular context or application - are usually proposed as tools for promoting interoperability and reuse while being tied entirely to the particular application context they refer to. In this paper, we present an adaptation and application of an ontology development methodology, i.e. SAMOD, to guide the creation of robust, semantically sound application profiles of large standard models. Using an existing pilot study we have developed in a project dedicated to leveraging virtual technologies to preserve and valorise cultural heritage, we introduce an application profile named CHAD-AP, that we have developed following our customised version of SAMOD. We reflect on the use of SAMOD and similar ontology development methodologies for this purpose, highlighting its strengths and current limitations, future developments, and possible adoption in other similar projects.</description>
