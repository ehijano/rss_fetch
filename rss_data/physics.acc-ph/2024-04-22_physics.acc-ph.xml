      <title>Ultrafast Electron Diffraction with MeV Electron Source from a Laser Wakefield Accelerator</title>

Abstract: MeV ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) is a widely used technology for ultrafast structural dynamic studies of matters in numerous areas. The development of laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) envisions great potential of advanced all-optical electron source based on LWFA in UED applications. We experimentally demonstrated that an LWFA-based device with a miniaturized permanent magnet beamline can generate and manipulate electron beams suitable for UED. In the beam transmission, the LWFA electron beams with intrinsic short duration stretch due to energy spread and then are compressed by a following double bend achromat. The optimized double bend achromat can make the beamline isochronous such that the arrival time jitter induced by the shot-to-shot energy fluctuation can be eliminated, and allow the advantage of the natural laser-beam synchronization for LWFAs to emerge. With the energy filtering, the beam energy spread can be reduced to 3% (FWHM) while a sufficient amount of charge (11.9 fC) per bunch for diffraction is retained. Start-to-end simulations showed that the bunch length reaches ~30 fs (rms) with the same experimental configuration. Clear single-shot and multi-shot diffraction patterns of single-crystalline gold samples are obtained and the derived lattice constant agrees excellently with the real value. Our proof-of-principle experiments open the door to the detection of ultrafast structural dynamics using MeV LWFA beams, and pave the way for the UED applications with sub-10-fs temporal resolution.</description>

      <title>Impact of Beam-Beam Effects on Absolute Luminosity Calibrations at the CERN Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), absolute luminosity calibrations obtained by the van der Meer (vdM) method are affected by the mutual electromagnetic interaction of the two beams. The colliding bunches experience relative orbit shifts, as well as optical distortions akin to the dynamic-$\beta$ effect, that both depend on the transverse beam separation and must therefore be corrected for when deriving the absolute luminosity scale. In the vdM regime, the beam-beam parameter is small enough that the orbit shift can be calculated analytically. The dynamic-$\beta$ corrections to the luminometer calibrations, however, had until the end of Run 2 been estimated in the linear approximation only. In this report, the influence of beam-beam effects on the vdM-based luminosity scale is quantified, together with the associated systematic uncertainties, by means of simulations that fully take into account the non-linearity of the beam-beam force, as well as the resulting non-Gaussian distortions of the transverse beam distributions. Two independent multiparticle simulations, one limited to the weak-strong approximation and one that models strong-strong effects in a self-consistent manner, are found in excellent agreement; both predict a percent-level shift of the absolute pp-luminosity values with respect to those assumed until recently in the physics publications of the LHC experiments. These results also provide guidance regarding further studies aimed at reducing the beam-beam-related systematic uncertainty on beam-beam corrections to absolute luminosity calibrations by the van der Meer method.</description>
