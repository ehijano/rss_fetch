      <title>Experimental Reduced-Rank Mutual Coupling Representation and Estimation for Large RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-consistent optimization of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is thwarted in practice by the difficulty of experimentally estimating the mutual coupling (MC) between RIS elements. For large RISs, experimental MC estimation is fundamentally challenging because of the quadratic scaling of the number of unknowns with the number of RIS elements. In this Letter, we present a generic and flexible reduced-rank MC representation that allows wireless practitioners to choose a trade-off between model complexity and accuracy. We experimentally validate the direct reduced-rank MC estimation for a 100-element RIS in three radio environments (rich scattering, attenuated scattering, free space). We observe a strong environmental dependence of the influence of rank reduction on accuracy. Model-based performance evaluations highlight that the importance of MC awareness in optimization depends strongly on the radio environment and the performance indicator.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength transparent microfluidics for UV-visible spectroscopy and X-ray scattering studies of photoactive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microfluidic devices are increasingly used in synchrotron-based experiments to deliver and probe liquid samples, offering advantages such as minimal sample consumption and reduced radiation damage. Despite their growing use, few devices have been specifically designed for monitoring liquids under photoexcitation, a promising approach for fast structural transitions. Here, a microfluidic device that is transparent to X-rays in one direction, and simulaneously transmits UV and visible light in the perpendicular direction is presented. The device is fabricated using lamination and UV lithography on a dry-film resist, eliminating the need for cleanroom facilities and simplifying production. Its multi-wavelength transparency was validated through UV-visible spectroscopy, where photoexcitation at different wavelengths induced reversible trans-to-cis isomerization of azobenzene and fluoro-azobenzene. X-ray transparency was validated through Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) measurements on hemoglobin and CO-ligated hemoglobin sensitive to quaternary structural changes. These resusts confirm the suitability of the device for resolving protein structures and photoinduced conformational dynamics. The design further supports, as some proof of concept results show, temperature-jump and time resolved pump-probe experiments, providing a versatile platform for studying structural evolution in liquid samples using synchrotron SAXS.</description>

      <title>A validated lumped-element model for bioinspired acoustic flow sensing toward the performance limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow sensing is fundamental to both biological survival and technological innovation. Inspired by biological mechanoreceptors, artificial flow sensors detect subtle fluid motion using slender, viscous-driven structures. Among these, acoustic flow sensors that mimic nature's velocity-sensitive ears have the potential to transform vector sound detection. Yet, despite their potential, understanding of how design parameters determine ultimate sensor performance remains limited. To effectively guide flow sensor design, we develop and experimentally validate a lumped-element model that captures the broadband motion of slender microcantilevers immersed in fluid, combining analytical simplicity with quantitative accuracy. The model predicts flow-induced motion, thermomechanical noise, and the minimum detectable signal level, showing strong agreement with experimental measurements in air over a broad frequency range from 100 Hz to 10,000 Hz. This validated model provides a straightforward theoretical framework for designing high-performance micro- and nanomechanical sensors for flow and vector sound detection.</description>

      <title>Lead-Free Europium Halide Perovskite Nanoplatelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites possess desirable optical, material, and electrical properties which have had substantial impact on next-generation optoelectronics. However, given the toxicity of lead, alternative lead-free perovskite semiconductors are needed. By fully replacing lead with rare-earth elements, one can simultaneously address toxicity concerns and achieve comparable optoelectronic performance. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of two-dimensional europium halide perovskite nanoplatelets governed by the formula $\mathrm{L_{2}EuX_{4}}$ where L is an organic ligand and X is a halide anion. The structure, morphology, and composition of the nanoplatelets are confirmed by XRD, AFM, and XPS. Deep blue-emitting $\mathrm{PEA_{2}EuBr_{4}}$ perovskite nanoplatelets are synthesized in both the solution- and solid-states with photoluminescence emission centered at 446 nm and CIE color coordinates of (0.1515, 0.0327) and (0.1515, 0.0342), respectively. Additionally, near-ultraviolet $\mathrm{PEA_{2}EuCl_{4}}$ perovskite nanoplatelets are synthesized in both the solution- and solid-states with photoluminescence emission centered at 400 nm and 401 nm, respectively. Overall, europium halide perovskite nanoplatelets offer a lead-free alternative for deep blue, violet, and near-ultraviolet light emission $\unicode{x2013}$ charting new pathways for optoelectronics in this energy regime.</description>

      <title>Electrical thermography via centimetre-scale fiber-based distributed temperature sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Raman-based Distributed Temperature Sensor (RDTS) with centimetre-scale resolution for thermographic analysis of electronic circuits. Temperature is measured along a single-mode fiber routed across a custom printed circuit board (PCB) with 1 cm$^2$ heating elements, using optical time-domain reflectometry of Raman signals detected by superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). This approach enables two-dimensional thermal mapping of the PCB under heating configurations with multiple hotspots. A spatial resolution of 3 cm and a temperature accuracy of 2 {\deg}C are achieved with an integration time of 5 minutes. Thermography can be performed down to 77 K, revealing that the PCB thermal resistance decreases by nearly an order of magnitude compared to room temperature, due to enhanced convective cooling in liquid nitrogen. These results establish centimetre-scale RDTS as a robust technique for real-time, spatially resolved thermography of electronic circuits, particularly in regimes where infrared imaging is ineffective, such as at low temperatures or within volumetric electronic architectures.</description>

      <title>Photonic-integrated quantum sensor array for microscale magnetic localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy centres (NVs) are promising solid-state nanoscale quantum sensors for applications ranging from material science to biotechnology. Using multiple sensors simultaneously offers advantages for probing spatiotemporal correlations of fluctuating fields or the dynamics of point defects. In this work, by integrating NVs with foundry silicon-nitride photonic integrated circuits, we realise the scalable operation of eight localised NV sensors in an array, with simultaneous, distinct readout of the individual sensors. Using the eight NV sensors and machine-learning methods for multi-point magnetic field reconstruction, we demonstrate microscale magnetic localisation of a 30 $\mu$m-sized needle tip. Experimentally, the needle tip can be localised with an error below its dimension and tracked dynamically with high fidelity. We further simulate the feasibility of our platform for monitoring the position and orientation of magnetic microrobots designed for biological and clinical purposes. Without the complexity of bulk optics, our photonic-integrated multi-sensor platform presents a step towards real-life biomedical applications under out-of-the-lab conditions.</description>

      <title>Vector magnetometry using cavity-enhanced microwave readout in nitrogen-vacancy diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate $4\pi$-steradian vector magnetic field sensing using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in a single-crystal diamond coupled to a microwave (MW) cavity. The MW cavity enhances the spin-photon coupling which enables efficient, high-contrast spin-state readout via MW interrogation and removes the need for bulky optical collection components. An applied AC bias magnetic field lifts the zero-field degeneracy of the four crystallographic NV orientations, allowing each orientation to be individually addressed and used for vector reconstruction of the magnetic field. The resulting magnetometer has a 40\% contrast (20x higher than typical for optical spin-ensemble readout) and achieves a single-axis sensitivity of 250 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ which is flat from DC to 1 kHz. Noise models of the composite spin-cavity system establish MW amplitude noise as the dominant noise source and predict a thermal noise limit of 2 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Neural Architecture: Online Attosecond X-ray Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of high-repetition-rate x-ray free-electron lasers, such as SLAC's LCLS-II, serve as our canonical example for autonomous controls that necessitate high-throughput diagnostics paired with streaming computational pipelines capable of single-shot analysis with extremely low latency. We present the Deterministic Characterization with an Integrated Parallelizable Hybrid Resolver architecture, a hybrid machine learning framework designed for fast, accurate analysis of XFEL diagnostics using angular streaking-based sinogram images. This architecture integrates convolutional neural networks and bidirectional long short-term memory models to denoise input, identify x-ray sub-spike features, and extract sub-spike relative delays with sub-30 attosecond temporal resolution. Deployed on low-latency hardware, it achieves over 10~kHz throughput with \SI{168.3}{\micro\second} inference latency, indicating scalability to 14~kHz with FPGA integration. By transforming regression tasks into classification problems and leveraging optimized error encoding, we achieve high precision with low-latency performance that is critical for real-time streaming event selection and experimental control feedback signals. This represents a key development in real-time control pipelines for next-generation autonomous science, generally, and high repetition-rate x-ray experiments in particular.</description>

      <title>Electrically-gated laser-induced spin dynamics in magneto-electric iron garnet at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast pump-probe imaging reveals that the efficiency of optical excitation of coherent spins waves in epitaxial iron garnet films can be effectively controlled by an external electric field at room temperature. Although a femtosecond laser pulse alone does not excite any pronounced coherent spin oscillations, an electrical gating with the field of 0.5 MV/m dramatically changes the outcome in a laser-induced launching of spin waves. The effect, demonstrated under room-temperature conditions, is estimated to be orders of magnitude larger than in magnetic van der Waals semiconductors observed at 10 K. This electrical gating of laser-induced spin dynamics enriches opto-magnonics with a new tool and thus opens up a new avenue in fundamental and applied magnonics research.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Key Design Factors for Thermal Comfort in Underground Space Through Global Sensitivity Analysis and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study identified the key design factors related to thermal comfort in naturally ventilated underground spaces under high temperature conditions (outdoor Tmax = 42.9 C) in Fuzhou, China. Fuzhou has a humid subtropical climate and is one of the three hottest cities in China in 2024. Daytime measurements indicated reduced air temperature (AT), mean radiant temperature (MRT), and wind speed (V), together with elevated relative humidity (RH) in the underground space. Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) in the underground was consistently lower during peak hours (08:00-16:00), with the maximum difference in PET between pedestrian and underground levels being 11-11.9 C. Higher pedestrian-level PET at L1 was attributed to reduced greenery and shading, and decrement factors indicated greater thermal dampening at L2 (0.197) than at L1 (0.308). Sensitivity analysis showed that MRT was the most influential factor (S1/ST = 0.59-0.72) for aboveground spaces, followed by AT (0.13-0.26). In contrast, underground PET was mainly affected by metabolic rate (MET) (0.63-0.65), followed by RH (0.14-0.20) and V (0.08-0.18). Partial dependence analysis revealed that a 1 met increase in MET raised PET by 1.6 C, whereas a 1 m/s increase in V reduced PET by 1.5-2.2 C in the underground space. Due to cooler and more stable thermal conditions, underground spaces have higher tolerance for intensive physical activities. By buffering fluctuations in AT and MRT, underground environments can significantly alleviate heat stress and provide passive cooling shelter during daytime heat waves. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence to support underground space design in hot-humid climates and offers insights for sustainable urban heat mitigation.</description>

      <title>A Depinning Model for Josephson Junction Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building more powerful quantum computers requires manufacturing processes with tight tolerances. To improve the tolerances on Josephson junctions, techniques to fine tune their properties after fabrication have been developed. Understanding how tuning techniques may physically modify the tunnel barrier of a Josephson junction is important and will enable these techniques to be optimised. We develop a model of junction tuning based on depinning theory to interpret a phase diagram of tuning rate. We extract the dependence on temperature, time-varying voltages and oscillation frequency. Using depinning theory we are able to show both why time-varying annealing potentials result in controlled junction tuning and how such protocols can be optimised. We examine how tuning changes the electrical breakdown of barriers and discrepancies between modeled and measured higher energy levels of transmon qubits.</description>

      <title>Volumetric axial velocity estimation with XDoppler using row-column arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate volumetric velocity estimation in ultrasound imaging is crucial for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Traditional ultrasound systems, though effective for two-dimensional imaging, face major limitations in 3D imaging due to hardware and computational demands. Row-column addressed (RCA) ultrasound probes offer a promising alternative by reducing hardware complexity, thereby helping bridge the gap between research prototypes and clinical systems. However, this typically comes at the expense of stronger sidelobes compared with fully populated matrix arrays, leading to a decreased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this study, we present a method that exploits the phase information from RCA rows and columns signals to compute a novel velocity estimator based on cross-correlation of orthogonal apertures. This extends the XDoppler scheme, initially developed for power Doppler imaging, to velocity estimation. Our results show that the XDoppler estimator provides accurate measurements of axial velocities (RMSE=9.21%, R2=0.88) and outperforms the traditional phase-shift autocorrelator, while offering a theoretical Nyquist velocity twice as high. In vitro experiments further demonstrate enhanced sensitivity to slow flows (&lt;10mm/s) and reduced bias in flow rate estimation. In vivo data from a carotid artery confirm the reduced sensitivity to aliasing and reveal the ability to track dynamic blood flow velocity changes associated with arterial pulsatility. These findings suggest that the proposed XDoppler estimator could improve volumetric blood velocity imaging with RCA probes.</description>
