      <title>Learning-based Radio Link Failure Prediction Based on Measurement Dataset in Railway Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08851v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a measurement-driven framework is proposed for early radio link failure (RLF) prediction in 5G non-standalone (NSA) railway environments. Using 10 Hz metro-train traces with serving and neighbor-cell indicators, we benchmark six models, namely CNN, LSTM, XGBoost, Anomaly Transformer, PatchTST, and TimesNet, under varied observation windows and prediction horizons. When the observation window is three seconds, TimesNet attains the highest F1 score with a three-second prediction horizon, while CNN provides a favorable accuracy-latency tradeoff with a two-second horizon, enabling proactive actions such as redundancy and adaptive handovers. The results indicate that deep temporal models can anticipate reliability degradations several seconds in advance using lightweight features available on commercial devices, offering a practical path to early-warning control in 5G-based railway systems.</description>

      <title>Content-based Fine-grained Flow Management Supporting Out-of-Path Transparent Add-ons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to realize a mechanism for packet processing in the edge domain while maintaining network transparency, in order to accommodate diverse service requirements in smart communities. Since conventional flow control, which operates on a per-packet basis, lacks flexibility, we propose a content-based fine-grained flow management method that enables control at the level of individual content segments within packets. In addition, we introduce an out-of-path transparent add-on architecture to address the limitations of conventional transparent add-ons, which assume the presence of processing resources on the main path. The proposed system implements one approach for selective content masking and two approaches for out-of-path anonymization. Furthermore, we develop a mechanism for dynamically rewriting Ack and Seq numbers to preserve TCP session integrity. The proposed approaches were implemented and evaluated on Mininet, and the results demonstrate that effective flow management can be achieved with minimal impact on network delay while maintaining network transparency.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Integrated Cloud-Fog-Edge Computing in IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09006v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming industries by connecting billions of devices to collect, process, and share data. However, the massive data volumes and real-time demands of IoT applications strain traditional cloud computing architectures. This paper explores the complementary roles of cloud, fog, and edge computing in enhancing IoT performance, focusing on their ability to reduce latency, improve scalability, and ensure data privacy. We propose a novel framework, the Hierarchical IoT Processing Architecture (HIPA), which dynamically allocates computational tasks across cloud, fog, and edge layers using machine learning. By synthesizing current research and introducing HIPA, this paper highlights how these paradigms can create efficient, secure, and scalable IoT ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Tele-LLM-Hub: Building Context-Aware Multi-Agent LLM Systems for Telecom Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Tele-LLM-Hub, a user friendly low-code solution for rapid prototyping and deployment of context aware multi-agent (MA) Large Language Model (LLM) systems tailored for 5G and beyond. As telecom wireless networks become increasingly complex, intelligent LLM applications must share a domainspecific understanding of network state. We propose TeleMCP, the Telecom Model Context Protocol, to enable structured and context-rich communication between agents in telecom environments. Tele-LLM-Hub actualizes TeleMCP through a low-code interface that supports agent creation, workflow composition, and interaction with software stacks such as srsRAN. Key components include a direct chat interface, a repository of pre-built systems, an Agent Maker leveraging finetuning with our RANSTRUCT framework, and an MA-Maker for composing MA workflows. The goal of Tele-LLM-Hub is to democratize the design of contextaware MA systems and accelerate innovation in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Experimenting with Energy-Awareness in Edge-Cloud Containerized Application Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the role of energy-awareness strategies into the deployment of applications across heterogeneous Edge-Cloud infrastructures. It proposes methods to inject into existing scheduling approaches energy metrics at a computational and network level, to optimize resource allocation and reduce energy consumption. The proposed approach is experimentally evaluated using a real-world testbed based on ARM devices, comparing energy consumption and workload distribution against standard Kubernetes scheduling. Results demonstrate consistent improvements in energy efficiency, particularly under high-load scenarios, highlighting the potential of incorporating energy-awareness into orchestration processes for more sustainable cloud-native computing.</description>

      <title>LLP-V2X: Low Latency-Power Vehicular Networking Towards 6G V2X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trade-off between energy and latency budgets is becoming significant due to the more stringent QoS requirements in 6G vehicular networks. However, comprehensively studying the trade-off between energy and latency budgets for 6G vehicular network with new Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) features is still under-explored. This paper proposes a novel multi-hop, multi-path vehicular networking that jointly optimizes vehicular traffic splitting across candidate routes and per-link transmit power to achieve low-latency and low-power communications. Afterwards, we formalize two complementary problem formulations (minimum latency and minimum power) based on the proposed 6G V2X architecture and provide sufficient conditions. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated via well-designed simulations. Based on these theories, we design algorithm (LLP MHMP Scheduler) that switches on demand between a fixed-power minimum-latency mode and a fixed-latency minimum-power mode.</description>

      <title>Digital Co-Founders: Transforming Imagination into Viable Solo Business via Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how individual entrepreneurs can turn creative ideas into successful solo businesses in an era increasingly shaped by Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. It highlights the key steps that connect personal vision, structured experimentation, and lasting value creation, and shows how AI agents can act as digital co-founders throughout this journey. Building on research in entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation, we present a framework with three key stages: (1) Imagination shaping, where vague goals become clear value propositions, supported by AI agents that help with market scanning, idea refinement, and rapid concept generation; (2) Reality testing, where these ideas are tested through low-cost experiments, structured feedback loops, and efficient execution, with AI agents automating tasks such as prototyping, content creation, customer interaction, and data analysis; and (3) Reality scaling, where successful ideas are transformed into repeatable processes, scalable market strategies, and long-term business models, increasingly operated and optimized by autonomous or semi-autonomous AI workflows. We focus on the specific context of solopreneurship, characterized by limited human resources, complete accountability for decision-making, and a strong association between the founder's identity and the business. The framework clearly identifies key enabling factors such as mental adaptability, effective planning, and successful human-AI collaboration within digital ecosystems. It also thoughtfully addresses ongoing challenges, like uncertainty and cognitive overload, which are heightened by our constant connectivity.</description>

      <title>DRL-Based Beam Positioning for LEO Satellite Constellations with Weighted Least Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning based beam weighting framework that couples a policy network with an augmented weighted least squares (WLS) estimator for accurate and low-complexity positioning in multi-beam LEO constellations. Unlike conventional geometry or CSI-dependent approaches, the policy learns directly from uplink pilot responses and geometry features, enabling robust localization without explicit CSI estimation. An augmented WLS jointly estimates position and receiver clock bias, improving numerical stability under dynamic beam geometry. Across representative scenarios, the proposed method reduces the mean positioning error by 99.3% compared with the geometry-based baseline, achieving 0.395 m RMSE with near real-time inference.</description>

      <title>Meeting Future Mobile Traffic Needs by Peak-Throughput Design of Next-Gen RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growing congestion in current mobile networks necessitates innovative solutions. This paper explores the potential of mmWave 5G networks in urban settings, focusing on Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) and the Smart Radio Environment (SRE). The mmWave traffic will be mainly made of short bursts to transfer large volumes of data and long idle periods where data are processed. This must change the way of designing mobile radio networks. To this extent, we propose network planning models leveraging the maximization of the achievable peak throughput. Results highlight the advantages of this approach during the network planning phase, providing insights into better accommodating the demands of mobile traffic without sacrificing the overall network capacity.</description>

      <title>ASINT: Learning AS-to-Organization Mapping from Internet Metadata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate AS-to-organization mapping underpins Internet measurement and security, yet registries are fragmented, PeeringDB is narrow, and routing views reflect connectivity rather than ownership. We take a pragmatic step: ASINT integrates curated web evidence with retrieval-guided LLM techniques and strict, evidence-cited validation to infer two relations (aliases and directed parent-child) and then revalidates them conservatively. To keep the dataset sustainable, we operate a public dashboard and API where operators can inspect per-ASN evidence and submit feedback that seeds refreshes.
  At scale, ASINT maps 112,172 ASNs into 82,840 organization families and, on overlapping AS sets, yields fewer, larger families with 21-24% more multi-AS groups than prior datasets (i.e., CAIDA AS2Org [11], AS2ORG+ [4], AS-Sibling [10], and Borges [28]). Quality is high in practice: ASINT achieves a precision of 0.9608, a recall of 0.9915 and an accuracy of 0.9752 under manual validation. Public deployment further drew operator-submitted reports for 595 ASNs across 106 organizations, with only 6 errors (99.0% observed clustering accuracy), with feedback coming from network operators across all RIR regions.
  Better organization context improves downstream analyses: +27.5% intra-organization RPKI misconfiguration detections, -9.4% benign hijack alerts, and -5.9% corrections to cases mislabeled as IP leasing.
  We release code, datasets, and the operator platform with APIs; given persistent ambiguity in organizational names and the continual evolution of corporate structures, an operator-in-the-loop process is essential; the platform records per ASN feedback with provenance and incorporates it into periodic refreshes and retraining. The methodology is model-agnostic and stands to improve further as base LLMs advance.</description>

      <title>EFPIX: A zero-trust encrypted flood protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose EFPIX (Encrypted Flood Protocol for Information eXchange), a flood-based relay communication protocol that achieves end-to-end encryption, plausible deniability for users, and untraceable messages while hiding metadata, such as sender and receiver, from those not involved. It also has built-in spam resistance and multiple optional enhancements. It can be used in privacy-critical communication, infrastructure-loss scenarios, space/research/military communication, where central servers are infeasible, or general-purpose messaging.</description>
