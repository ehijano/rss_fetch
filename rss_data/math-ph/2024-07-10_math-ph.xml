      <title>A matrix solution to any polygon equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we construct matrices associated to Pachner $\frac{n-1}{2}$-$\frac{n-1}{2}$ moves for odd $n$ and matrices associated to Pachner $(\frac{n}{2}-1)$-$\frac{n}{2}$ moves for even $n$. The entries of these matrices are rational functions of formal variables in a field. We prove that these matrices satisfy the $n$-gon equation for any $n$.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of domino tilings on a pentagonal domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the six-vertex model at its free-fermion point with domain wall boundary conditions, which is equivalent to random domino tilings of the Aztec diamond. We compute the scaling limit of a particular non-local correlation function, essentially equivalent to the partition function for the domino tilings of a pentagon-shaped domain, obtained by cutting away a triangular region from a corner of the initial Aztec diamond. We observe a third-order phase transition when the geometric parameters of the obtained pentagonal domain are tuned to have the fifth side exactly tangent to the arctic ellipse of the corresponding initial model.</description>

      <title>Investigating dynamics and asymptotic trend to equilibrium in a reactive BGK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate numerically a recent BGK-type model for a multi-component mixture of monatomic gases, undergoing a reversible bimolecular chemical reaction. The model replaces each collisional term of the Boltzmann equation with a relaxation term, thereby describing separately the effects of the mechanical processes and the chemical reaction. Additionally, the model exhibits consistency properties. The correct entropy production is ensured when auxiliary temperatures in the chemical contributions share a common value. We assume isotropic distributions and perform numerical simulations for the macroscopic fields to appraise how the dynamics push the mixture toward thermalization and chemical equilibrium. We show that the hypothesis on the equalization of fictitious species temperatures is justifiable to ensure the monotonicity of the classical $H$-Boltzmann functional. Simulations show that, when initial temperatures are far from equilibrium, the relaxation towards equilibrium occurs at a later stage and the classical $H$-Boltzmann functional is not monotone during the initial transient.</description>

      <title>Formulation and analysis of a DPG discretization for a simplified electrochemical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simplified model consisting on two linear elliptic boundary-value problems that represent a single step and single fixed-point iteration in an electrochemical battery model. The main variables are the concentration and the electric potential, whose equation is assigned a Robin BC with a very important physical interpretation. The solvability of both equations is studied in different funcional settings, to finally prove the well-posedness of a broken mixed variational formulation. The latter formulation opens the opportunity of performing discretization and numerical solution via the Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) method, which guarantees discrete stability thanks to optimal test functions. With only the usual assumptions on the data and the discretization, we show that the method herein proposed is convergent. This analytical effort complements other recent works on batttery multiphysics, that have been more modeling and computing oriented, and establishes the DPG approach as a valuable tool to contribute toward an efficient analysis and design of batteries.</description>

      <title>On the origin of escort distributions for q-entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an argument about the origin of escort distributions used in conjunction with the q-entropy in non-additive thermo-statistics. The origin of the escort distributions is ascribed to the fact that the effective statistical description of the underlying system is provided by the measured Gromov-Hausdorff limit of a sequence of manifolds having a warped product metric structure. We interpret the entropic parameter \ q \ appearing in escort distributions as a "dimension" related to the fibration structure of the underlying phase spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of a fairly large class of boundary conditions for the linearised Einstein equations in the Riemannian setting, ones which generalise the linearised counterpart of boundary conditions proposed by Anderson. Through the prism of the quest to quantise gravitational waves in curved spacetimes, we study their properties from the point of view of ellipticity, gauge invariance, and the existence of a spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Turing patterns on discrete topologies: from networks to higher-order structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nature is a blossoming of regular structures, signature of self-organization of the underlying microscopic interacting agents. Turing theory of pattern formation is one of the most studied mechanisms to address such phenomena and has been applied to a widespread gallery of disciplines. Turing himself used a spatial discretization of the hosting support to eventually deal with a set of ODEs. Such an idea contained the seeds of the theory on discrete support, which has been fully acknowledged with the birth of network science in the early 2000s. This approach allows us to tackle several settings not displaying a trivial continuous embedding, such as multiplex, temporal networks, and, recently, higher-order structures. This line of research has been mostly confined within the network science community, despite its inherent potential to transcend the conventional boundaries of the PDE-based approach to Turing patterns. Moreover, network topology allows for novel dynamics to be generated via a universal formalism that can be readily extended to account for higher-order structures. The interplay between continuous and discrete settings can pave the way for further developments in the field.</description>

      <title>A higher-order generalization of group theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to show that fundamental concepts in higher-order Fourier analysis can be nauturally extended to the non-commutative setting. We generalize Gowers norms to arbitrary compact non-commutative groups. On the structural side, we show that nilspace theory (the algebraic part of higher-order Fourier analysis) can be naturally extended to include all non-commutative groups. To this end, we introduce generalized nilspaces called "groupspaces" and demonstrate that they possess properties very similar to nilspaces. We study $k$-th order generalizations of groups that are special groupspaces called {\it k-step} groupspaces. One step groupspaces are groups. We show that $k$-step groupspaces admit the structure of an iterated principal bundle with structure groups $G_1,G_2,\dots,G_k$. A similar, but somewhat more technical statement holds for general groupspaces, with possibly infinitely many structure groups. Structure groups of groupspaces are in some sense analogous to higher homotopy groups. In particular we use a version of the Eckmann-Hilton argument from homotopy theory to show that $G_i$ is abelian for $i\geq 2$. Groupspaces also show some similarities with $n$-groups from higher category theory (also used in physics) but the exact relationship between these concepts is a subject of future research.</description>

      <title>Approximate Unitary $k$-Designs from Shallow, Low-Communication Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random unitaries are useful in quantum information and related fields but hard to generate with limited resources. An approximate unitary $k$-design is an ensemble of unitaries and measure over which the average is close to a Haar (uniformly) random ensemble up to the first $k$ moments. A particularly strong notion of approximation bounds the distance from Haar randomness in relative error: the approximate design can be written as a convex combination involving an exact design and vice versa. We construct multiplicative-error approximate unitary $k$-design ensembles for which communication between subsystems is $O(1)$ in the system size. These constructions use the alternating projection method to analyze overlapping Haar twirls, giving a bound on the convergence speed to the full twirl with respect to the $2$-norm. Using the von Neumann subalgebra indices to replace system dimension, the 2-norm distance converts to relative error without introducing any additional dependence on system size. Via recursion on these constructions, we construct a scheme yielding relative error designs in $O \big ( (k \log k + \log m + \log(1/\epsilon) ) k\, \text{polylog}(k) \big )$ depth, where $m$ is the dimension of the complete system and $\epsilon$ the approximation error. This sublinear depth construction answers one variant of [Harrow and Mehraban 2023, Open Problem 1]. Moreover, entanglement generated by the sublinear depth scheme follows area laws on spatial lattices up to corrections logarithmic in the full system size.</description>

      <title>Bound States in Continuum via Singular Transfer Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, bound states in continuum (BICs) have gained significant value for practitioners in both theoretical and applied photonics. This paper focuses on devices that utilize non-homogeneous thin patterned laminae. The properties, design principles, and behavior of BICs for this class of devices are frequently explained through a variety of models, ranging from numerical or semi-analytical solutions for the Maxwell equations to heuristic approaches that rely on fitting functions to provide phenomenological descriptions. The field of devices under study has given less attention to approaches that integrate exact analytical solutions of the transfer matrix with numerical data. In this vein, this paper aims to adopt an approach where exact analytical formulas, detailed in our previous manuscript arXiv:2303.06765 (2023), are translated into equations to explore the origins and properties of the bound states in continuum, as well as their practical implementation. The geometric parameters of the device and its operating frequency band emerge from the null space of the transfer matrix.</description>

      <title>Almost optimal upper bound for the ground state energy of a dilute Fermi gas via cluster expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an upper bound on the energy density of the dilute spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Fermi gas capturing the leading correction to the kinetic energy $8\pi a \rho_\uparrow\rho_\downarrow$ with an error of size smaller than $a\rho^{2}(a^3\rho)^{1/3-\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, where $a$ denotes the scattering length of the interaction. The result is valid for a large class of interactions including interactions with a hard core. A central ingredient in the proof is a rigorous version of a fermionic cluster expansion adapted from the formal expansion of Gaudin, Gillespie and Ripka (Nucl. Phys. A, 176.2 (1971), pp. 237--260).</description>

      <title>Quantum Fluctuations of Many-Body Dynamics around the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of a gas of $N$ bosons in the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii regime (in which particles are initially trapped in a volume of order one and interact through a repulsive potential with scattering length of the order $1/N$). We construct a quasi-free approximation of the many-body dynamics, whose distance to the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation converges to zero, as $N \to \infty$, in the $L^2 (\mathbb{R}^{3N})$-norm. To achieve this goal, we let the Bose-Einstein condensate evolve according to a time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. After factoring out the microscopic correlation structure, the evolution of the orthogonal excitations of the condensate is governed instead by a Bogoliubov dynamics, with a time-dependent generator quadratic in creation and annihilation operators. As an application, we show a central limit theorem for fluctuations of bounded observables around their expectation with respect to the Gross-Pitaevskii dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We construct a double null coordinate system $(u,v,\theta_\star,\phi_\star)$ for Kerr-Newman-de Sitter spacetimes and prove that the two-spheres given by the intersection of the hypersurfaces $u=\mbox{constant}$ and $v=\mbox{constant}$ are $C^\infty$ in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates (including at the "poles"). The null coordinates allow one to immediately extend some results previously proven for Kerr. As an example, we illustrate how Sbierski's result, for the wave equation on the black hole interior, for Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and Kerr spacetimes, applies to Kerr-Newman-de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: We study linear inhomogeneous kinetic equations with an external confining potential and a collision operator admitting several local conservation laws (local density, momentum and energy). We classify all special macroscopic modes (stationary solutions and time-periodic solutions). We also prove the convergence of all solutions of the evolution equation to such non-trivial modes, with a quantitative exponential rate. This is the first hypocoercivity result with multiple special macroscopic modes with constructive estimates depending on the geometry of the potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.12644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we will analyze a quantum deformation of cubic string field theory. This will be done by first constructing a quantum deformation of string theory, in a covariant gauge, and then using the quantum deformed stringy theory to construct a quantum deformation of string field theory. This quantum deformed string field will then be used to contract a quantum deformed version of cubic string field theory. We will explicitly demonstrate that the axioms of cubic string field theory hold even after quantum deformation. Finally, we will analyze the effect of the quantum deformation of string field theory on the string vertices.</description>

      <title>Interference aided finite resonant response in an undamped forced oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04125v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply perturbative techniques to a driven undamped sinusoidal oscillator at resonance. The angular displacement, $\theta$, obeys the dynamics $\Ddot{\theta} + \omega^{2} \sin{\theta} = H\cos{\omega t}$. The linearized approximation gives a divergent response (at long times) but the nonlinear terms make the response finite. We address the nonlinearity-induced finiteness in two ways by separately treating the short and long time scales. At long times, we use the traditional perturbative techniques to extract two drive dependent behaviours - one, the amplitude of oscillation scales as $(H/\omega^{2})^{1/3}$ and, two, the time period of the slow mode varies as $(H/\omega^{2})^{-2/3}$. For the early time behaviour, on the other hand, we devise an alternate perturbative expansion where the successive terms get larger with the order of evaluation but have alternating signs. The alternating signs (phase differences) between these terms leads to adestructive interference like effect. A careful consideration of this destructive interference like effect between successive terms leads to a finite response which describes the initial behaviour of the amplitude of the response reasonably correctly. We further note that for larger drive values, the system seems to undergo a first order transitional behaviour with a sudden jump in the largest Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <title>Finite Markov chains and multiple orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00182v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates stochastic finite matrices and the corresponding finite Markov chains constructed using recurrence matrices for general families of orthogonal polynomials and multiple orthogonal polynomials. The paper explores the spectral theory of transition matrices, utilizing both orthogonal and multiple orthogonal polynomials. Several properties are derived, including classes, periodicity, recurrence, stationary states, ergodicity, expected recurrence times, time-reversed chains, and reversibility. Furthermore, the paper uncovers factorization in terms of pure birth and pure death processes. The case study focuses on hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials, where all the computations can be carried out effectively. Particularly within the Askey scheme, all descendants under Hahn (excluding Bessel), such as Hahn, Jacobi, Meixner, Kravchuk, Laguerre, Charlier, and Hermite, present interesting examples of recurrent reversible birth and death finite Markov chains. Additionally, the paper considers multiple orthogonal polynomials, including multiple Hahn, Jacobi-Pi\~neiro, Laguerre of the first kind, and Meixner of the second kind, along with their hypergeometric representations and derives the corresponding recurrent finite Markov chains and time-reversed chains.</description>

      <title>On B type family of Dubrovin-Frobenius manifolds and their integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to D.Zuo and an unpulished work of M.Bertola, there is a two--index series of Dubrovin--Frobenius manifold structures associated to a B type Coxeter group. We study the relations between these structures for the different values of these indices. We show that part of the data of such Dubrovin--Frobenius manifold indexed by $(k,l)$ can be recovered by the $(k+r,l+r)$ Dubrovin--Frobenius manifold. Continuing the program of arXiv:2007.11974 we associate an infinite system of commuting PDEs to these Dubrovin--Frobenius manifolds and show that these PDEs extend the dispersionless BKP hierarchy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem for the Einstein-Boltzmann system with soft potentials in a cosmological setting. We assume the Bianchi I symmetry to describe a spatially homogeneous, but anisotropic universe and consider a cosmological constant $ \Lambda &gt; 0 $ to describe an accelerated expansion of the universe. For the Boltzmann equation we introduce a new weight function and apply the method of Illner and Shinbrot to obtain the future global existence of spatially homogeneous, small solutions. For the Einstein equations we assume that the initial value of the Hubble variable is close to $ ( \Lambda / 3 )^{ 1 / 2 } $. We obtain the future global existence and asymptotic behavior of spatially homogeneous solutions to the Einstein-Boltzmann system with soft potentials.</description>

      <title>Reality conditions for the KdV equation and exact quasi-periodic solutions in finite phase spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10859v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper reality conditions for quasi-periodic solutions of the KdV equation are determined completely. As a result, solutions in the form of non-linear waves can be plotted and investigated.
  The full scope of obtaining finite-gap solutions of the KdV equation is presented. It is proven that the multiply periodic $\wp_{1,1}$-function on the Jacobian variety of a hyperelliptic curve of arbitrary genus serves as the finite-gap solution, the genus coincides with the number of gaps. The subspace of the Jacobian variety where $\wp_{1,1}$, as well as other $\wp$-functions, are bounded and real-valued is found in any genus. This result covers every finite phase space of the KdV hierarchy, and can be extended to other completely integrable equations. A method of effective computation of this type of solutions is suggested, and illustrated in genera $2$ and $3$.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian for 1/1 Rotational Secondary Resonances, and Application to Small Satellites of Saturn and Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the dynamics of rotation of the small satellites Methone and Aegaeon and revisit previous works on the rotation of Prometheus, Metis, and Amalthea. In all cases, the surfaces of section computed with the standard spin-orbit model reveal that the synchronous regime with small amplitude of libration shares another large domain in the phase space. We reproduce and apply the hamiltonian theory given in Wisdom (2004) to analytically characterize the detected structure as being a secondary resonance where the period of oscillation of the physical libration is similar to the orbital period of the satellite. We also show that the amplitude of libration around the secondary resonance is always larger than in the case of the other mode. Since the current rotational states of these sorts of satellites should be synchronous, our results can be considered in evolutionary studies of their rotation.</description>

      <title>A sufficient condition for inviscid shear instability: Hurdle theorem and its application to alternating jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple method to identify unstable parameter regions in general inviscid unidirectional shear flow stability problems. The theory is applicable to a wide range of basic flows, including those that are non-monotonic. We illustrate the method using a model of Jupiter's alternating jet streams based on the quasi-geostrophic equation. The main result is that the flow is unstable if there is an interval in the flow domain for which the reciprocal Rossby Mach number (a quantity defined in terms of the zonal flow and potential vorticity distribution), surpasses a certain threshold or `hurdle'. The hurdle height approaches unity when we can take the hurdle width to greatly the atmosphere's intrinsic deformation length, as holds on gas giants. In this case, the Kelvin-Arnol'd sufficient condition of stability accurately detects instability. These results improve the theoretical framework for explaining the stable maintenance of Jupiter and Saturn's jets over decadal timescales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical Maxwell's electromagnetism, monopole term of the electric field is proportional to $r^{-2}$, while higher order multipole terms, sourced by anisotropic sources, fall-off faster. However, in nonlinear electromagnetism even a spherically symmetric field has multipole-like contributions. We prove that the leading subdominant term of the electric field, defined by nonlinear electromagnetic Lagrangian obeying Maxwellian weak field limit, in a static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat spacetime, is of the order $O(r^{-6})$ as $r \to \infty$. Moreover, using Lagrange inversion theorem and Fa\`a di Bruno's formula, we derive the series expansion of the electric field from the Taylor series of an analytic electromagnetic Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom in modified Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I discuss the issue of degrees of freedom in modified teleparallel gravity. These theories do have an extra structure on top of the usual (pseudo)Riemannian manifold, that of a flat parallel transport. This structure is absolutely abstract and unpredictable (pure gauge) in GR-equivalent models, however it becomes physical upon modifications. The problem is that, in the most popular models, this local symmetry is broken but not stably so, hence the infamous strong coupling issues. The Hamiltonian analyses become complicated and with contradictory results. A funny point is that what we see in available linear perturbation treatments of $f(T)$ gravity is much closer to the analysis with less dynamical degrees of freedom which has got a well-known mistake in it, while the more accurate work predicts much more of dynamics than what has ever been seen up to now. I discuss possible reasons behind this puzzle, and also argue in favour of studying the most general New GR models which are commonly ignored due to suspicion of ghosts.</description>

      <title>Existence, Uniqueness and Asymptotic Dynamics of Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations With Quasi-Periodic Initial Data: I. The Standard NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first part of a two-paper series studying nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with quasi-periodic initial data. In this paper, we consider the standard nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Under the assumption that the Fourier coefficients of the initial data obey a power-law upper bound, we establish local existence of a solution that retains quasi-periodicity in space with a slightly weaker Fourier decay. Moreover, the solution is shown to be unique within this class of quasi-periodic functions. In addition, for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with small nonlinearity, within the time scale, as the small parameter of nonlinearity tends to zero, we prove that the nonlinear solution converges asymptotically to the linear solution with respect to both the sup-norm $\|\cdot\|_{L_x^\infty(\mathbb R)}$ and the Sobolev-norm $\|\cdot\|_{H^s_x(\mathbb R)}$.
  The proof proceeds via a consideration of an associated infinite system of coupled ordinary differential equations for the Fourier coefficients and a combinatorial analysis of the resulting tree expansion of the coefficients. For this purpose, we introduce a Feynman diagram for the Picard iteration and $\ast^{[\cdot]}$ to denote the complex conjugate label.</description>

      <title>Finite-size spectrum of the staggered six-vertex model with antidiagonal boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The finite-size spectrum of the critical staggered six-vertex model with antidiagonal boundary conditions is studied. Similar to the case of periodic boundary conditions, we identify three different phases. In two of those, the underlying conformal field theory can be identified to be related to the twisted $U(1)$ Kac-Moody algebra. In contrast, the finite size scaling in the third regime, whose critical behaviour with the (quasi-)periodic BCs is related to the 2d black hole CFTs possessing a non-compact degree of freedom, is more subtle. Here with antidiagonal BCs imposed, the corrections to the scaling of the ground state grow logarithmically with the system size, while the energy gaps appear to close logarithmically. Moreover, we obtain an explicit formula for the Q-operator which is useful for numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>The density conjecture for activated random walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld developed their theory of self-organized criticality in the late 1980s to explain why many real-life processes exhibit signs of critical behavior despite the absence of a tuning parameter. A decade later, Dickman, Mu\~noz, Vespignani, and Zapperi explained self-organized criticality as an external force pushing a hidden parameter toward the critical value of a traditional absorbing-state phase transition. As evidence, they observed empirically that for various sandpile models, the particle density in a finite box under driven-dissipative dynamics converges to the critical density of an infinite-volume version of the model. We give the first proof of this well-known density conjecture in any setting by establishing it for activated random walk in one dimension. We prove that two other natural versions of the model have the same critical value, further establishing activated random walk as a universal model of self-organized criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a gapped spin-$S$ chain with antiferromagnetic (AFM) order exhibits in the thermodynamic limit exponentially localized fractional $\pm \frac{S}{2}$ edge modes when the system possesses U(1) symmetry. We show this for integrable and non integrable spin chains both analytically and numerically. Through exact analytical solutions, we show that an AFM spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain with {\it explicitly} broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and an integrable AFM spin-$1$ chain with {\it spontaneously} broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry have $\pm \frac{1}{4}$ and $\pm \frac{1}{2}$ fractionalized edge modes, respectively. Furthermore, employing the density matrix renormalization group technique, we extend this analysis to {\it generic} $XXZ-S$ chains with $S\leq 3$ and demonstrate that these fractional spins are robust quantum observables, substantiated by the observation of a variance of the associated fractional spin operators that is consistent with a vanishing functional form in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, we find that the edge modes are robust to disorder that couples to the N\'eel order parameter.</description>

Abstract: A fundamental step towards studying string theory vacua, and, ultimately, their stability, is that of understanding the underlying mathematical structure of the QFT resulting from its dimensional reduction on Calabi-Yau (CY) manifolds, the latter being complex manifolds admitting a category theory description. The present work aims at addressing this question in the case of lower-dimensional gravitating systems, and supersymmetric quiver gauge theories, highlighting the role played by dualities and categorical structures towards studying analytical structures of amplitudes.

      <description>arXiv:2406.16327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We connect the indications of 2D CFT for branes in non-supersymmetric strings to actual spacetime profiles, taking the bulk tadpole potentials into account. We find exact solutions for the uncharged branes that spread in the internal intervals of Dudas-Mourad vacua for non-tachyonic orientifolds and heterotic strings. These solutions involve suitable dressings of the uncharged branes of the nine-dimensional tadpole-free theory. Similar exact results for uncharged branes that are transverse to the internal space, or for charged branes, appear more challenging. Nevertheless, we identify their large-distance behavior, which is determined by linearized equations, and show that it is compatible with the CFT analysis in all expected cases. We also draw some indications on the leading back-reaction of the form-fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, for one-dimensional discrete Schr\"odinger operators, stability of Anderson localization under a class of rank one perturbations implies absence of intervals in spectra. The argument is based on well-known result of Gordon and del Rio--Makarov--Simon, combined with a way to consider perturbations whose ranges are not necessarily cyclic. The main application of the results is showing that a class of quasiperiodic operators with sawtooth-like potentials, for which such a version of stable localization is known, has Cantor spectra. We also obtain several results on gap filling under rank one perturbations for some general (not necessarily monotone) classes of quasiperiodic operators with discontinuous potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The successful application of $\alpha$-induction to the conformal field theory has given rise to many amazing results. For example, the classification of conformal nets in the discrete series. In this paper, however, we study $\alpha$-induction of graded local conformal nets. The main difference lies between locality in the conformal net cases and graded locality in the graded local conformal net cases. We show that the inclusions of graded local conformal nets give braided subfactors. We check that the $\alpha$-induction is still valid in terms of graded local conformal nets. Moreover, the simple current extension originally defined in terms of conformal nets still works for graded local conformal nets. Consequently, we give a shorter proof of classification of $N=2$ superconformal nets in the discrete series according to Gannon's list.</description>

Abstract: Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes are a promising candidate for implementing fault tolerant quantum computation in quantum harmonic oscillator systems such as superconducting resonators, optical photons and trapped ions, and in recent years theoretical and experimental evidence for their utility has steadily grown. It is known that logical Clifford operations on GKP codes can be implemented fault tolerantly using only Gaussian operations, and several theoretical investigations have illuminated their general structure. In this work, we explain how GKP Clifford gates arise as symplectic automorphisms of the corresponding GKP lattice and show how they are identified with the mapping class group of suitable genus $n$ surfaces. This correspondence introduces a topological interpretation of fault tolerance for GKP codes and motivates the connection between GKP codes (lattices), their Clifford gates, and algebraic curves, which we explore in depth. For a single-mode GKP code, we identify the space of all GKP codes with the moduli space of elliptic curves, given by the three sphere with a trefoil knot removed, and explain how logical degrees of freedom arise from the choice of a level structure on the corresponding curves. We discuss how the implementation of Clifford gates corresponds to homotopically nontrivial loops on the space of all GKP codes and show that the modular Rademacher function describes a topological invariant for certain Clifford gates implemented by such loops. Finally, we construct a universal family of GKP codes and show how it gives rise to an explicit construction of fiber bundle fault tolerance as proposed by Gottesman and Zhang for the GKP code. On our path towards understanding this correspondence, we introduce a general algebraic geometric perspective on GKP codes and their moduli spaces, which uncovers a map towards many possible routes of future research.</description>
