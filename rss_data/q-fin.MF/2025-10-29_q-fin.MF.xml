      <title>Extended HJB Equation for Mean-Variance Stopping Problem: Vanishing Regularization Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the time-inconsistent MV optimal stopping problem via a game-theoretic approach to find equilibrium strategies. To overcome the mathematical intractability of direct equilibrium analysis, we propose a vanishing regularization method: first, we introduce an entropy-based regularization term to the MV objective, modeling mixed-strategy stopping times using the intensity of a Cox process. For this regularized problem, we derive a coupled extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation system, prove a verification theorem linking its solutions to equilibrium intensities, and establish the existence of classical solutions for small time horizons via a contraction mapping argument. By letting the regularization term tend to zero, we formally recover a system of parabolic variational inequalities that characterizes equilibrium stopping times for the original MV problem. This system includes an additional key quadratic term--a distinction from classical optimal stopping, where stopping conditions depend only on comparing the value function to the instantaneous reward.</description>

      <title>The Omniscient, yet Lazy, Investor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formalize the paradox of an omniscient yet lazy investor - a perfectly informed agent who trades infrequently due to execution or computational frictions. Starting from a deterministic geometric construction, we derive a closed-form expected profit function linking trading frequency, execution cost, and path roughness. We prove existence and uniqueness of the optimal trading frequency and show that this optimum can be interpreted through the fractal dimension of the price path. A stochastic extension under fractional Brownian motion provides analytical expressions for the optimal interval and comparative statics with respect to the Hurst exponent. Empirical illustrations on equity data confirm the theoretical scaling behavior.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger bridge for generative AI: Soft-constrained formulation and convergence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling, fine-tuning, and transfer learning.</description>
