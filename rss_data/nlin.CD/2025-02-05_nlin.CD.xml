      <title>Topological variability modes of the wind-driven ocean circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wind-driven ocean circulation comprises the oceanic currents that are visible at the surface. In this paper, we use algebraic topology concepts and methods to study a highly simplified model of the evolution of this circulation subject to periodic winds. The low-order spectral model corresponds to a midlatitude ocean basin. For steady forcing, the model's intrinsic oscillations undergo a bifurcation from small-amplitude harmonic ones to relaxation oscillations (ROs) of high amplitude as the forcing increases. The ROs, in turn, give rise to chaotic behavior under periodic forcing. Topological invariants help identify distinct flow regimes that ensemble simulations visit under the action of the underlying deterministic rule in such a nonautonomous framework. We introduce topological variability modes of this idealized ocean circulation, based on the previously defined invariants.</description>

      <title>Data-driven prediction of reversal of large-scale circulation in turbulent convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale circulation (LSC) quasi-stably emerges in the turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection, and intermittently reverses its rotational direction in two-dimensional turbulent convection. In this paper, direct numerical simulations of the intermittent reversals of the LSC in a two-dimensional square domain are performed, and the time series of the total angular momentum indicating the rotational direction of the LSC is predicted by reservoir computing whose input consists of the shear rates and temperatures at six locations on the sidewalls. The total angular momentum in the simulation after times shorter than half the typical duration of the quasi-stable states is successfully reproduced by the locally-measurable quantities on the sidewalls because the secondary rolls accompanied by the boundary flow characterize the reversal of the LSC. The successful prediction by such sparse input derived from local measurements on the sidewalls demonstrates that the reservoir computing prediction of the reversal is feasible in laboratory experiments and industrial applications. On the other hand, long-term prediction often provides the total angular momentum opposite in sign to the one in the simulations in the late parts of long quasi-stable states. The statistical independence of each reversal implies that the prediction after the reversal is difficult or even impossible, and the training data in the late part in the long quasi-stable state, which rarely appears, is contaminated by the statistically-independent angular momentum in the subsequent quasi-stable state.</description>

      <title>Mathematically established chaos and forecast of statistics with recurrent patterns in Taylor-Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition to chaos in the subcritical regime of counter-rotating Taylor-Couette flow is investigated using a minimal periodic domain capable of sustaining coherent structures. Following a Feigenbaum cascade, the dynamics are found to be remarkably well approximated by a simple discrete map that admits rigorous proof of its chaotic nature. The chaotic set that arises for the map features densely distributed periodic points that are in one-to-one correspondence with unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) of the Navier-Stokes system. This supports the increasingly accepted view that UPOs may serve as the backbone of turbulence and, indeed, we demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct every statistical property of chaotic fluid flow from UPOs.</description>

      <title>Improved detection of chaos with Lagrangian descriptors using differential algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lagrangian descriptors (LDs) based on the arc length of orbits previously demonstrated their utility in delineating structures governing the dynamics. Recently, a chaos indicator based on the second derivatives of the LDs, referred to as $\vert\vert \Delta \rm{LD} \vert\vert$, has been introduced to distinguish regular and chaotic trajectories. Thus far, the derivatives are numerically approximated using finite differences on fine meshes of initial conditions. In this paper, we instead use the differential algebra (DA) framework as a form of automatic differentiation to introduce and compute $\vert\vert \Delta \rm{LD} \vert\vert$ up to machine precision. We discuss and exemplify benefits of this framework, such as the determination of reliable thresholds to distinguish ordered from chaotic trajectories. Our extensive parametric study quantitatively assesses the accuracy and sensitivity of both the finite differences and differential arithmetic approaches by focusing on paradigmatic discrete models of Hamiltonian chaos, namely the Chirikov's standard map and coupled $4$-dimensional variants. Our results demonstrate that finite difference techniques for $\vert\vert \Delta \rm{LD} \vert\vert$ might lead to significant misclassification rate, up to $20\%$ when the phase space supports thin resonant webs, due to the difficulty to determine appropriate thresholds. On the contrary, $\vert\vert \Delta \rm{LD} \vert\vert$ computed through DA arithmetic leads to clear bimodal distributions which in turn lead to robust thresholds. As a consequence, the DA framework reveals as sensitive as established first order tangent map based indicators, independently of the underlying dynamical regime. Finally, the benefits of the DA framework are also highlighted for non-uniform depleted meshes of initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Universal correlations in chaotic many-body quantum states: Fock-space formulation of Berrys random wave model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The apparent randomness of chaotic eigenstates in interacting quantum systems hides subtle correlations dynamically imposed by their finite energy per particle. These correlations are revealed when Berrys approach for chaotic eigenfunctions in single-particle systems is lifted into many-body space. We achieve this by a many-body semiclassics analysis, appropriate for the mesoscopic regime of large but finite number of particles. We then identify the universality of both the cross-correlations and the Gaussian distribution of expansion coefficients as the signatures of chaotic eigenstates. Combined, these two aspects imprint a distinctive backbone to the morphology of eigenstates that we check against extensive quantum simulations. The universality of eigenstate correlations for fixed energy density is then a further signature of many-body quantum chaos that, while consistent with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, lies beyond random matrix theory.</description>
