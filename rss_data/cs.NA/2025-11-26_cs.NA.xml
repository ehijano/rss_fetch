      <title>The Ginzburg-Landau equations: Vortex states and numerical multiscale approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review article, we provide an overview of recent advances in the numerical approximation of minimizers of the Ginzburg-Landau energy in multiscale spaces. Such minimizers represent the most stable states of type-II superconductors and, for large material parameters $\kappa$, capture the formation of lattices of quantized vortices. As the vortex cores shrink with increasing $\kappa$, while their number grows, it is essential to understand how $\kappa$ should couple to the mesh size in order to correctly resolve the vortex patterns in numerical simulations. We summarize and discuss recent developments based on LOD (Localized Orthogonal Decomposition) multiscale methods and review the corresponding error estimates that explicitly reflect the $\kappa$-dependence and the observed superconvergence. In addition, we include several minor refinements and extensions of existing results by incorporating techniques from recent contributions to the field. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to illustrate and support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Provably fully discrete energy-stable and asymptotic-preserving scheme for barotropic Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop structure-preserving finite volume schemes for the barotropic Euler equations in the low Mach number regime. Our primary focus lies in ensuring both the asymptotic-preserving (AP) property and the discrete entropy stability. We construct an implicit-explicit (IMEX) method with suitable acoustic/advection splitting including implicit numerical diffusion that is independent of the Mach number. We prove the positivity of density, the entropy stability, and the asymptotic consistency of the fully discrete numerical method rigorously. Numerical experiments for benchmark problems validate the structure-preserving properties of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Designing Preconditioners for SGD: Local Conditioning, Noise Floors, and Basin Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) often slows in the late stage of training due to anisotropic curvature and gradient noise. We analyze preconditioned SGD in the geometry induced by a symmetric positive definite matrix $\mathbf{M}$, deriving bounds in which both the convergence rate and the stochastic noise floor are governed by $\mathbf{M}$-dependent quantities: the rate through an effective condition number in the $\mathbf{M}$-metric, and the floor through the product of that condition number and the preconditioned noise level. For nonconvex objectives, we establish a preconditioner-dependent basin-stability guarantee: when smoothness and basin size are measured in the $\mathbf{M}$-norm, the probability that the iterates remain in a well-behaved local region admits an explicit lower bound. This perspective is particularly relevant in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), where achieving small training loss under stochastic updates is closely tied to physical fidelity, numerical stability, and constraint satisfaction. The framework applies to both diagonal/adaptive and curvature-aware preconditioners and yields a simple design principle: choose $\mathbf{M}$ to improve local conditioning while attenuating noise. Experiments on a quadratic diagnostic and three SciML benchmarks validate the predicted rate-floor behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19724v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient inversion of matrix polynomials is a critical challenge in computational mathematics. We design a procedure to determine the inverse of matrices polynomial of multidimensional Laplace matrices. The method is based on eigenvector and eigenvalue expansions. The method is consistent with previous expressions of the inverse discretized Laplacian in one spatial dimension \citep{Vermolen_2022}. Several examples are given.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Methods for wave propagation in materials with sign-changing coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a mathematical perspective, the extraordinary properties of metamaterials are often reflected in the coefficients of the governing partial differential equations (PDEs). These coefficients may fall outside the assumptions of classical theory, particularly when the effective dielectric permittivity and/or magnetic permeability are negative. This situation can transform a coercive operator into a non-coercive one, potentially leading to ill-posedness. In this paper, we utilize the Constraint Energy Minimizing Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (CEM-GMsFEM), specifically designed for time-harmonic electromagnetic wave problems, where the construction of auxiliary spaces in the original CEM-GMsFEM is tailored to accommodate the sign-changing setting. Based on the framework of \texttt{T}-coercivity theory and resolution conditions, we establish the inf-sup stability and provide an a priori error estimate for the proposed method. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in handling such sophisticated coefficient profiles.</description>

      <title>Parallel simulation and adaptive mesh refinement for 3D elastostatic contact mechanics problems between deformable bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel implementation of numerical adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)strategies for solving 3D elastostatic contact mechanics problems is an essential step toward complex simulations that exceed current performance levels. This paper introduces a scalable, robust, and efficient algorithm to deal with 2D and 3D elastostatics contact problems between deformable bodies in a finite element framework. The proposed solution combines a treatment of the contact problem by a node-to-node pairing algorithm with a penalization technique and a non-conforming h-adaptive refinement of quadrilateral/hexahedral meshes based on an estimate-mark-refine approach in a parallel framework. One of the special features of our parallel strategy is that contact paired nodes are hosted by the same MPI tasks, which reduces the number of exchanges between processes for building the contact operator. The mesh partitioning introduced in this paper respects this rule and is based on an equidistribution of elements over processes, without any other constraints. In order to preserve the domain curvature while hierarchical mesh refinement, super-parametric elements are used. This functionality enables the contact zone to be well detected during the AMR process, even for an initial coarse mesh and low-order discretization schemes. The efficiency of our contact-AMR-HPC strategy is assessed on 2D and 3D Hertzian contact problems. Different AMR detection criteria are considered. Various convergence analyses are conducted. Parallel performances up to 1024 cores are illustrated. Furthermore, memory footprint and preconditionners performance are analyzed.</description>

      <title>High order tracer variance stable transport with low order energy conserving dynamics for the thermal shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high order discontinuous Galerkin method for the material transport of thermodynamic tracers is coupled to a low order mixed finite element solver in the context of the thermal shallow water equations. The coupling preserves the energy conserving structure of the low order dynamics solver, while the high order material transport scheme is provably tracer variance conserving, or damping with the inclusion of upwinding. The two methods are coupled via the multigrid hierarchy of the low order dynamics solver, with the basis functions of the high order transport being collocated at the Gauss-Legendre quadrature points with the low order dynamics on the finest scale multigrid mesh.
  Standard test cases are presented to verify the consistency and conservation properties of the method. While the overall scheme is limited by the formal order of accuracy of the low order dynamics, the use of high order, tracer variance conserving transport is shown to preserve richer turbulent solutions without compromising model stability compared to a purely low order method.</description>

      <title>A finite element method for a non-Newtonian dilute polymer fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the discretisation of a uniaxial (rank-one) reduction of the Oldroyd-B model for dilute polymer solutions, in which the conformation tensor is represented as $\sig = \vec b \otimes \vec b$. Building on structural analogies with MHD, we formulate a finite element framework compatible with the de Rham complex, so that the discrete velocity is exactly divergence-free. The spatial discretisation combines an interior-penalty treatment of viscosity with upwind transport to control stress layers and we prove inf-sup conditions on the mixed pairs. For time-stepping, we design an IMEX scheme that is linear at each step and show well-posedness of the fully discrete problem together with a discrete energy law mirroring the continuum dissipation. Numerical experiments on canonical benchmarks (lid-driven cavity, pipe-with-cavity and $4{:}1$ planar contraction) demonstrate accuracy and robustness for moderate-to-high Weissenberg numbers, capturing sharp stress gradients and corner singularities while retaining the efficiency gains of the uniaxial model. The results indicate that de Rham-compatible discretisations coupled with energy-stable IMEX time integration provide a reliable pathway for viscoelastic computations at elevated elasticity.</description>

      <title>Enriched Galerkin Method for Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an enriched Galerkin (EG) finite element method for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. The method augments continuous piecewise linear velocity spaces with elementwise bubble functions, yielding a locally conservative velocity approximation while retaining the efficiency of low-order continuous elements. The viscous term is discretized using a symmetric interior penalty formulation, and the divergence constraint is imposed through a stable pressure space. To enhance the robustness of the velocity approximation with respect to the pressure, a reconstruction operator is introduced in the convective and coupling terms, resulting in a pressure-robust scheme whose accuracy does not deteriorate for small viscosities. Both Picard and Newton linearizations are formulated in a fully discrete manner, and the corresponding linear systems are assembled efficiently at each iteration. Optimal a~priori error estimates are established for the velocity in the mesh-dependent energy norm and for the pressure in the $L^2$ norm. Two representative numerical experiments are presented: a smooth manufactured solution and the lid-driven cavity flow. The numerical results confirm the theoretical convergence rates, demonstrating first-order convergence of the velocity in the energy norm, second-order convergence in the $L^2$ norm, and first-order convergence of the pressure. The proposed EG scheme accurately captures characteristic flow structures, illustrating its effectiveness and robustness for incompressible flow simulation.</description>

      <title>Extension and neural operator approximation of the electrical impedance tomography inverse map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of noise-robust neural operator approximation for the solution map of Calder\'on's inverse conductivity problem. In this continuum model of electrical impedance tomography (EIT), the boundary measurements are realized as a noisy perturbation of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map's integral kernel. The theoretical analysis proceeds by extending the domain of the inversion operator to a Hilbert space of kernel functions. The resulting extension shares the same stability properties as the original inverse map from kernels to conductivities, but is now amenable to neural operator approximation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Fourier neural operators excel at reconstructing infinite-dimensional piecewise constant and lognormal conductivities in noisy setups both within and beyond the theory's assumptions. The methodology developed in this paper for EIT exemplifies a broader strategy for addressing nonlinear inverse problems with a noise-aware operator learning framework.</description>

      <title>Efficient thermal simulation in metal additive manufacturing via semi-analytical isogeometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal modeling of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is challenging due to steep, rapidly moving thermal gradients induced by the laser, which are difficult to resolve accurately with conventional Finite Element Methods. Highly refined, dynamically adaptive spatial discretization is typically required, leading to prohibitive computational costs. Semi-analytical approaches mitigate this by decomposing the temperature field into an analytical point-source solution and a complementary numerical field that enforces boundary conditions. However, state-of-the-art implementations either necessitate extensive mesh refinement near boundaries or rely on restrictive image source techniques, limiting their efficiency and applicability to complex geometries. This study presents a novel reformulation of the semi-analytical framework using Isogeometric Analysis. The laser heat input is captured by the analytical point-source solution, while the complementary correction field, which imposes boundary conditions, is solved using a spline-based IGA discretization. The governing heat equation for the correction field is cast in a weak form, discretized with NURBS basis functions, and advanced in time using an implicit $\theta$-scheme. This approach leverages IGA's key advantages: exact geometry representation, higher-order continuity, and superior accuracy per degree of freedom. These features unlock efficient thermal modeling of realistic parts with complex contours. Our strategy eliminates the need for scan-wise remeshing and robustly handles intricate geometric features like sharp corners and varying cross-sections. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed semi-analytical IGA method delivers accurate temperature predictions and achieves substantial computational efficiency gains compared to standard FEM, establishing it as a powerful new tool for high-fidelity thermal simulation in LPBF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20529v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that we can carry over the strategy of Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC) to Summation-by-Parts (SBP) Finite Difference (FD) methods to achieve divergence- and curl-free discretizations. This is not obvious at first sight, as for SBP-FD no basis functions are known, but only values and derivatives at points. The key is a remarkable analytic relationship that enables us to construct compatible operators using integral and nodal degrees of freedom. Pre-existing SBP-FD matrix operators can then be used to obtain nodal values from the integral degrees of freedom to derive a scheme with the desired properties.</description>

Abstract: We derive a reformulation of the linearized Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) equations as a Hodge-Dirac wave system with the divdiv complex, addressing challenges in numerical relativity such as gauge fixing, constraint propagation, and tensor symmetries. The differential and algebraic structures of the divdiv complex ensure the well-posedness of the formulation and facilitate structure-preserving discretization via finite element exterior calculus. We establish the well-posedness of this Hodge-Dirac wave equation and develop a discretization scheme applicable to both conforming and non-conforming discrete complexes, deriving error estimates under minimal assumptions.</description>

      <title>Operator Learning at Machine Precision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural operator learning methods have garnered significant attention in scientific computing for their ability to approximate infinite-dimensional operators. However, increasing their complexity often fails to substantially improve their accuracy, leaving them on par with much simpler approaches such as kernel methods and more traditional reduced-order models. In this article, we set out to address this shortcoming and introduce CHONKNORIS (Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), an operator learning paradigm that can achieve machine precision. CHONKNORIS draws on numerical analysis: many nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems are solvable by Newton-type methods. Rather than regressing the solution operator itself, our method regresses the Cholesky factors of the elliptic operator associated with Tikhonov-regularized Newton--Kantorovich updates. The resulting unrolled iteration yields a neural architecture whose machine-precision behavior follows from achieving a contractive map, requiring far lower accuracy than end-to-end approximation of the solution operator. We benchmark CHONKNORIS on a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems, including a nonlinear elliptic equation, Burgers' equation, a nonlinear Darcy flow problem, the Calder\'{o}n problem, an inverse wave scattering problem, and a problem from seismic imaging. We also present theoretical guarantees for the convergence of CHONKNORIS in terms of the accuracy of the emulated Cholesky factors. Additionally, we introduce a foundation model variant, FONKNORIS (Foundation Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), which aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS experts for diverse PDEs to emulate the solution map of a novel nonlinear PDE. Our FONKNORIS model is able to accurately solve unseen nonlinear PDEs such as the Klein--Gordon and Sine--Gordon equations.</description>

      <title>Modified Equations for Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we extend the recently introduced theory of stochastic modified equations (SMEs) for stochastic gradient optimization algorithms.
  In Ch. 3 we study time-inhomogeneous SDEs driven by Brownian motion. For certain SDEs we prove a 1st and 2nd-order weak approximation properties, and we compute their linear error terms explicitly, under certain regularity conditions. In Ch. 4 we instantiate our results for SGD, working out the example of linear regression explicitly. We use this example to compare the linear error terms of gradient flow and two commonly used 1st-order SMEs for SGD in Ch. 5.
  In the second part of the thesis we introduce and study a novel diffusion approximation for SGD without replacement (SGDo) in the finite-data setting. In Ch. 6 we motivate and define the notion of an epoched Brownian motion (EBM). We argue that Young differential equations (YDEs) driven by EBMs serve as continuous-time models for SGDo for any shuffling scheme whose induced permutations converge to a det. permuton. Further, we prove a.s. convergence for these YDEs in the strongly convex setting. Moreover, we compute an upper asymptotic bound on the convergence rate which is as sharp as, or better than previous results for SGDo. In Ch. 7 we study scaling limits of families of random walks (RW) that share the same increments up to a random permutation. We show weak convergence under the assumption that the sequence of permutations converges to a det. (higher-dimensional) permuton. This permuton determines the covariance function of the limiting Gaussian process. Conversely, we show that every Gaussian process with a covariance function determined by a permuton in this way arises as a weak scaling limit of families of RW with shared increments. Finally, we apply our weak convergence theory to show that EBMs arise as scaling limits of RW with finitely many distinct increments.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Learning of Whittle indices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present BLINQ, a new model-based algorithm that learns the Whittle indices of an indexable, communicating and unichain Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our approach relies on building an empirical estimate of the MDP and then computing its Whittle indices using an extended version of a state-of-the-art existing algorithm. We provide a proof of convergence to the Whittle indices we want to learn as well as a bound on the time needed to learn them with arbitrary precision. Moreover, we investigate its computational complexity. Our numerical experiments suggest that BLINQ significantly outperforms existing Q-learning approaches in terms of the number of samples needed to get an accurate approximation. In addition, it has a total computational cost even lower than Q-learning for any reasonably high number of samples. These observations persist even when the Q-learning algorithms are speeded up using pre-trained neural networks to predict Q-values.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence rate of the positivity-preserving logarithmic truncated EM method for multi-dimensional stochastic differential equations with positive solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a combination of the logarithmic transformation with the truncated Euler-Maruyama (TEM) scheme, the positivity-preserving logarithmic truncated Euler-Maruyama (LTEM) scheme has been generally developed for scalar stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with positive solutions. A subsequent question arises: can this method be extended to effectively solve general multidimensional SDEs with positive solutions? The answer to this question is affirmative. In this paper, we construct the positivity-preserving LTEM scheme to solve this type of system and demonstrate the suboptimal strong convergence rate of this scheme. On the other hand, when the underlying system degenerates into a scalar equation, the latest LTEM scheme analyzed by Tang &amp; Mao (2024) is applicable to scalar SDEs with weak conditions, but its strong convergence rate is suboptimal. Based on this, we will theoretically demonstrate the optimal convergence rate of the LTEM method without infinitesimal factors in the scalar case. The proof strategy exactly improves its convergence rate from suboptimal to optimal. Finally, numerical examples are provided to validate the effectiveness and positivity-preserving of the LTEM method.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous recovery of a corroded boundary and admittance using the Kohn-Vogelius method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of identifying an unknown portion $\Gamma$ of the boundary of a $d$-dimensional ($d \in \{1, 2\}$) domain $\Omega$ and its associated Robin admittance coefficient, using two sets of boundary Cauchy data $(f, g)$--representing boundary temperature and heat flux--measured on the accessible portion $\Sigma$ of the boundary. Identifiability results \cite{Bacchelli2009,PaganiPierotti2009} indicate that a single measurement on $\Sigma$ is insufficient to uniquely determine both $\Gamma$ and $\alpha$, but two independent inputs yielding distinct solutions ensure the uniqueness of the pair $\Gamma$ and $\alpha$. In this paper, we propose a cost function based on the energy-gap of two auxiliary problems. We derive the variational derivatives of this objective functional with respect to both the Robin boundary $\Gamma$ and the admittance coefficient $\alpha$. These derivatives are utilized to develop a nonlinear gradient-based iterative scheme for the simultaneous numerical reconstruction of $\Gamma$ and $\alpha$. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Dynamic analysis of free-free Timoshenko beams on elastic foundation under transverse transient ground deformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Underground infrastructure such as pipelines and tunnels can be vulnerable to transient ground deformation (TGD) generated by earthquakes, traffic, and other vibration sources. Current design methods rely on simplified analytical models that idealize soil movement as a traveling sinusoidal wave, neglecting system inertia and relative soil-structure displacement. As shown in this study, such assumptions may be inadequate for large-diameter buried pipelines and tunnels, where accurate dynamic analysis under axial and transverse TGD is required. This paper introduces a new semi-analytical model for the dynamic response of buried Timoshenko beams on Winkler foundation subjected to transverse TGD. A closed-form solution of the governing differential equation shows that the vibration spectrum is divided into four parts, separated by three transition frequencies that depend on the system's mechanical and geometric properties. These transitions govern changes in modal behavior and significantly influence dynamic amplification. The model is verified through a case study of a buried 107 cm (42 in) steel water pipeline with varying lengths and operating conditions. Analytical predictions show excellent agreement with finite-element modal and dynamic analyses. Additional validation using high-resolution free-vibration measurements and multi-point shaking-table experiments further confirms the accuracy and robustness of the formulation. Frequency-response analysis highlights conditions under which dynamic amplification becomes significant, particularly when forcing frequencies approach the system's fundamental frequency, which may lie within the range of dominant seismic frequencies. The proposed methodology provides a rigorous analytical framework for understanding the key factors governing the dynamic behavior of buried beams under diverse sources of ground vibration.</description>

      <title>Parallel-in-Time Solution of Allen-Cahn Equations by Integrating Operator Learning into the Parareal Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While recent advances in deep learning have shown promising efficiency gains in solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs), matching the accuracy of conventional numerical solvers still remains a challenge. One strategy to improve the accuracy of deep learning-based solutions for time-dependent PDEs is to use the learned solution as the coarse propagator in the Parareal method and a traditional numerical method as the fine solver. However, successful integration of deep learning into the Parareal method requires consistency between the coarse and fine solvers, particularly for PDEs exhibiting rapid changes such as sharp transitions. To ensure such consistency, we propose to use the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the fully discrete time-stepping operator defined by the traditional numerical scheme used as the fine solver. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in solving the classical and mass-conservative Allen-Cahn (AC) equations. Through iterative updates in the Parareal algorithm, our approach achieves a significant computational speedup compared to traditional fine solvers while converging to high-accuracy solutions. Our results highlight that the proposed Parareal algorithm effectively accelerates simulations, particularly when implemented on multiple GPUs, and converges to the desired accuracy in only a few iterations. Another advantage of our method is that the CNNs model is trained on trajectories-based on random initial conditions, such that the trained model can be used to solve the AC equations with various initial conditions without re-training. This work demonstrates the potential of integrating neural network methods into the parallel-in-time frameworks for efficient and accurate simulations of time-dependent PDEs.</description>

      <title>Elasto-plastic cell-based smoothed finite element method solving geotechnical problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work develops an elasto-plastic cell-based smoothed finite element method (CSFEM) for geotechnical analysis. The formulation incorporates a smoothed strain field into the standard elasto-plastic framework based on the Mohr-Coulomb criterion and is implemented in ABAQUS through a user-defined element (UEL). A UEL-UMAT data-transfer strategy is introduced to enable post-processing of stress and strain in ABAQUS. The method is assessed using several benchmark problems, including three classical examples, a tunnel excavation, and a slope stability analysis. The results show that the CSFEM achieves accuracy comparable to or slightly better than the conventional FEM and matches analytical or reference solutions for the examined cases. These findings indicate that the proposed CSFEM provides a practical and robust alternative for routine elasto-plastic analyses in geotechnical engineering.</description>

Abstract: Many stochastic differential equations in various applications like coupled neuronal oscillators are driven by time-periodic forces. In this paper, we extend several data-driven computational tools from autonomous Fokker-Planck equation to the time-periodic setting. This allows us to efficiently compute the time-periodic invariant probability measure using either grid-base method or artificial neural network solver, and estimate the speed of convergence towards the time-periodic invariant probability measure. We analyze the convergence of our algorithms and test their performances with several numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: We describe an algorithm to numerically evaluate Riemann theta functions in any dimension in quasi-linear time in terms of the required precision, uniformly on reduced input. This algorithm is implemented in the FLINT number theory library and vastly outperforms existing software. As an application, we evaluate the theta constants attached to certain special abelian varieties of dimension 6 to construct explicit polynomials of degree 65 over $\mathbb{Q}$ with conjectural Galois group $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{64})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of optimization problems characterized by a weighted finite-sum objective function subject to box constraints is considered. We propose a novel stochastic optimization method, named AS-BOX (\text{A}ddi\-ti\-onal \text{S}ampling for \text{BOX} constraints), that combines projected gradient directions with adaptive variable sample size strategies and nonmonotone line search. The method dynamically adjusts the batch size based on progress with respect to the additional sampling function and on structural consistency of the projected direction, enabling practical adaptivity of AS-BOX, while ensuring theoretical support. We establish almost sure convergence under standard assumptions and provide complexity bounds. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and competitiveness of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Latent-Variable Formulation of the Poisson Canonical Polyadic Tensor Model: Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish parameter inference for the Poisson canonical polyadic (PCP) model of tensor count data through a latent-variable formulation. Our approach exploits the property that any random tensor that follows the PCP model can be derived by marginalizing an unobservable random tensor of one dimension larger. The loglikelihood of this larger dimensional tensor, referred to as the "complete" loglikelihood, is comprised of multiple loglikelihoods corresponding to rank one PCP models. Using this methodology, we first demonstrate that several existing algorithms for fitting non-negative matrix and tensor factorizations are Expectation-Maximization algorithms. Next, we derive the observed and expected Fisher information matrices for the PCP model by leveraging its latent-variable formulation. The Fisher information provides us crucial insights into the well-posedness of the tensor model, such as the role that the rank of parameter tensor plays in identifiability and indeterminacy. For the special case of PCP models with rank one parameter tensors, we demonstrate that these results are greatly simplified.</description>
