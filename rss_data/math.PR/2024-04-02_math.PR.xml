      <title>On the Small Jumps of L\'evy Processes and the Multivariate Dickman Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Dickman approximation to the small jumps of multivariate L\'evy processes and related stochastic integral processes. Further, we show that the multivariate Dickman distribution is the unique distribution satisfying a certain stability property and that a related stochastic process is self-similar. Along the way we develop applications to non-Gaussian OU-Processes, to the class of generalized multivariate gamma distributions, and to the popular Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard stochastic volatility model.</description>

      <title>Some super-Poincar\'e inequalities for gaussian-like measures on stratified Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the $U$-bound program initiated in [J. Funct. Anal. 258, 814-851 (2010)] and prove super-Poincar\'e inequalities for a class of probability measures defined on stratified Lie groups and in terms of their homogeneous norms with explicit estimates, the main ingredient in the proof being a Hardy-type inequality. In doing so, we recover and extend some previous results from the probabilistic viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Entropy-regularized optimal transport over networks with incomplete marginals information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in this paper optimal mass transport over a strongly connected, directed graph on a given discrete time interval. Differently from previous literature, we do not assume full knowledge of the initial and final goods distribution over the network nodes. In spite of the meager information, we show that it is possible to characterize the most likely flow in two important cases: The first one is when the initial and/or final distribution is only known on proper subsets of the nodes. The second case is when only some moments of the marginal distributions are known. As an important by-product, we determine the most likely initial and final marginals on the whole state space.</description>

      <title>Total progeny in almost critical multi-type Galton-Watson processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider multi-type Galton-Watson branching processes, where the Perron root ($\rho$) of the first moments matrix approaches unity. Specifically, we examine the random vector representing the number of individuals preceding generation $n$, often referred to as the total progeny. By conditioning on non-extinction or extinction at current time, and properly normalizing it, we derive the asymptotic distribution for this vector. Similar theorem is derived for process with immigration. The key determinant of this distributions is the limit of $n(\rho-1)$ as $n$ tends to infinity and $\rho$ approaches 1.</description>

      <title>The Gaussian free-field as a stream function: continuum version of the scale-by-scale homogenization result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note is about a drift-diffusion process $X$ with a time-independent, divergence-free drift $b$, where $b$ is a smooth Gaussian field that decorrelates over large scales. In two space dimensions, this just fails to fall into the standard theory of stochastic homogenization, and leads to a borderline super-diffusive behavior. In a previous paper by Chatzigeorgiou, Morfe, Otto, and Wang (2022), precise asymptotics of the annealed second moments of $X$ were derived by characterizing the asymptotics of the effective diffusivity $\lambda_L$ in terms of an artificially introduced large-scale cut-off $L$. The latter was carried out by a scale-by-scale homogenization, and implemented by monitoring the corrector $\phi_L$ for geometrically increasing cut-off scales $L^+=ML$. In fact, proxies $(\tilde\phi_L,\tilde\sigma_L)$ for the corrector and flux corrector were introduced incrementally and the residuum $f_L$ estimated.
  In this short supplementary note, we reproduce the arguments of the above paper in the continuum setting of $M\downarrow 1$. This has the advantage that the definition of the proxies $(\tilde\phi_L,\tilde\sigma_L)$ becomes more transparent -- it is given by a simple It\^{o} SDE with $\ln L$ acting as a time variable. It also has the advantage that the residuum $f_L$, which is a martingale, can be efficiently and precisely estimated by It\^{o} calculus. This relies on the characterization of the quadratic variation of the (infinite-dimensional) Gaussian driver.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusive central limit theorem for a Brownian particle in a critically-correlated incompressible random drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the long-time behavior of a diffusion process on $\mathbb{R}^d$ advected by a stationary random vector field which is assumed to be divergence-free, dihedrally symmetric in law and have a log-correlated potential. A special case includes $\nabla^\perp$ of the Gaussian free field in two dimensions. We show the variance of the diffusion process at a large time $t$ behaves like $2 c_* t (\log t)^{1/2}$, in a quenched sense and with a precisely determined, universal prefactor constant $c_*&gt;0$. We also prove a quenched invariance principle under this superdiffusive scaling. The proof is based on a rigorous renormalization group argument in which we inductively analyze coarse-grained diffusivities, scale-by-scale. Our analysis leads to sharp homogenization and large-scale regularity estimates on the infinitesimal generator, which are subsequently transferred into quantitative information on the process.</description>

      <title>Strong law of large numbers for $m$-dependent and stationary random variables under sub-linear expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The arm of this paper is to establish the strong law of large numbers (SLLN) of $m$-dependent random variables under the framework of sub-linear expectations. We establish the SLLN for a sequence of independent, but not necessarily identically distributed random variables. The study further extends the SLLN to $m$-dependent and stationary sequence of random variables with the condition $C_{\mathbb V}(|X_1|)&lt;\infty$ which is the sufficient and necessary condition of SLLN in the case of independent and identically distributed random variables.</description>

      <title>Least Non-Zero Singular Value and the Distribution of Eigenvectors of non-Hermitian Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a tail bound for the least non-zero singular value of $A-z$ when $A$ is a random matrix and $z$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ in a neighbourhood of a given point $z_0$ in the bulk of the spectrum. The argument relies on a resolvent comparison and a tail bound for Gauss-divisible matrices. The latter can be obtained by the method of partial Schur decomposition. Using this bound we prove that any finite collection of components of a right eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue uniformly sampled from a neighbourhood of a point in the bulk is Gaussian. A byproduct of the calculation is an asymptotic formula for the odd moments of the absolute value of the characteristic polynomial of real Gauss-divisible matrices.</description>

      <title>Partial Backorder Inventory System: Asymptotic Optimality and Demand Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a stochastic inventory system which accounts for the limited patience of backlogged customers. While limited patience is a feature that is closer to the nature of unmet demand, our model also unifies the classic backlogging and lost-sales inventory systems which are special cases of the one we propose. We establish the uniform (asymptotic) optimality of the base-stock policy when both demand and patience distributions are known. When the backlogged demands become unobservable, we introduce a novel policy family that operates without backlogged demands information, and prove that it can approach the cost efficiency of the optimal policy in the system when the demand and patience distributions are known. Finally, we consider an online inventory control problem in which backlogged demand is unobservable and demand and patience distributions are also not known, and develop a UCB-type algorithm that yields a near-optimal policy. The regret bounds given by the algorithm are provably tight within the planning horizon, and are comparable to the state-of-the-art results in the literature, even in the face of partial and biased observations and weaker system ergodicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the notion of the influence of a set of variables on a Boolean function, which was recently introduced by Tal. We show that for an arbitrary fixed $d$, every Boolean function $f$ on $n$ variables admits a $d$-set of influence at least $\frac{1}{10} \mathbf{W}^{\geq d}(f) (\frac{\log n}{n})^d$, which is a direct generalisation of the Kahn-Kalai-Linial theorem. We give an example demonstrating essential sharpness of this result. Further, we generalise a related theorem of Oleszkiewicz regarding influences of pairs of variables.</description>

      <title>Information divergences and likelihood ratios of Poisson processes and point patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article develops an analytical framework for studying information divergences and likelihood ratios associated with Poisson processes and point patterns on general measurable spaces. The main results include explicit analytical formulas for Kullback-Leibler divergences, R\'enyi divergences, Hellinger distances, and likelihood ratios of the laws of Poisson point patterns in terms of their intensity measures. The general results yield similar formulas for inhomogeneous Poisson processes, compound Poisson processes, as well as spatial and marked Poisson point patterns. Additional results include simple characterisations of absolute continuity, mutual singularity, and the existence of common dominating measures. The analytical toolbox is based on Tsallis divergences of sigma-finite measures on abstract measurable spaces. The treatment is purely information-theoretic and free of any topological assumptions.</description>

      <title>Cell Escape Probabilities for Markov Processes on a Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic equations describe physical processes in a high-dimensional phase space and are often simulated using Markov process-based Monte Carlo routines. The quantities of interest are typically defined on the lower-dimensional position space and estimated on a grid (histogram). In several applications, such as the construction of diffusion Monte Carlo-like techniques and variance prediction for particle tracing Monte Carlo methods, the cell escape probabilities, i.e., the probabilities with which particles escape a grid cell during one step of the Markov process, are of interest. In this paper, we derive formulas to calculate the cell escape probabilities for common mesh elements in one, two, and three dimensions. Deterministic calculation of cell escape probabilities in higher dimensions becomes expensive and prone to quadrature errors due to the involved high-dimensional integrals. We therefore also introduce a stochastic Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate the escape probabilities, which is more robust at the cost of a statistical error. The code used to perform the numerical experiments and accompanying GeoGebra tutorials are openly available at https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/numa/public/escape-probabilities-markov-processes.</description>

      <title>Adversarially-Robust Inference on Trees via Belief Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the problem of posterior inference on tree-structured graphical models in the presence of a malicious adversary who can corrupt some observed nodes. In the well-studied broadcasting on trees model, corresponding to the ferromagnetic Ising model on a $d$-regular tree with zero external field, when a natural signal-to-noise ratio exceeds one (the celebrated Kesten-Stigum threshold), the posterior distribution of the root given the leaves is bounded away from $\mathrm{Ber}(1/2)$, and carries nontrivial information about the sign of the root. This posterior distribution can be computed exactly via dynamic programming, also known as belief propagation.
  We first confirm a folklore belief that a malicious adversary who can corrupt an inverse-polynomial fraction of the leaves of their choosing makes this inference impossible. Our main result is that accurate posterior inference about the root vertex given the leaves is possible when the adversary is constrained to make corruptions at a $\rho$-fraction of randomly-chosen leaf vertices, so long as the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds $O(\log d)$ and $\rho \leq c \varepsilon$ for some universal $c &gt; 0$. Since inference becomes information-theoretically impossible when $\rho \gg \varepsilon$, this amounts to an information-theoretically optimal fraction of corruptions, up to a constant multiplicative factor. Furthermore, we show that the canonical belief propagation algorithm performs this inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel model-selection method for dynamic real-life networks. Our approach involves training a classifier on a large body of synthetic network data. The data is generated by simulating nine state-of-the-art random graph models for dynamic networks, with parameter range chosen to ensure exponential growth of the network size in time. We design a conceptually novel type of dynamic features that count new links received by a group of vertices in a particular time interval. The proposed features are easy to compute, analytically tractable, and interpretable. Our approach achieves a near-perfect classification of synthetic networks, exceeding the state-of-the-art by a large margin. Applying our classification method to real-world citation networks gives credibility to the claims in the literature that models with preferential attachment, fitness and aging fit real-world citation networks best, although sometimes, the predicted model does not involve vertex fitness.</description>

      <title>Impact of heterogeneity on infection probability: Insights from single-hit dose-response models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of infection of a host is complex, influenced by factors such as microbial variation within and between hosts as well as differences in dose across hosts. This study uses dose-response and microbial growth models to delve into the impact of these factors on infection probability. It is rigorously demonstrated that within-host heterogeneity in microbial infectivity enhances the probability of infection. The effect of infectivity and dose variation between hosts is studied in terms of the expected value of the probability of infection. General analytical findings, derived under the assumption of small infectivity, reveal that both types of heterogeneity reduce the expected infection probability. Interestingly, this trend appears consistent across specific dose-response models, suggesting a limited role for the small infectivity condition. Additionally, the vital dynamics behind heterogeneous infectivity are investigated with a microbial growth model which enhances the biological significance of single-hit dose-response models. Testing these mathematical predictions inspire new and challenging laboratory experiments that could deepen our understanding of infections.</description>

      <title>A note on faces of convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the core of convex analysis, we find the concept of a face of a convex set, which was systematically studied by R. T. Rockafellar. With the exception of the one-point faces known as extreme points, faces received little attention in the theory of infinite-dimensional convexity, perhaps due to their lack of relative interior points. Circumventing this peculiarity, M. E. Shirokov and the present author explored faces generated by points. These faces possess relative interior points and they can serve as building blocks for general faces. Here we deepen this approach, taking into account ideas by E. M. Alfsen and L. E. Dubins. We also indicate possible application in probability theory.</description>

      <title>Hitting probabilities for fast stochastic search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many physical phenomena are modeled as stochastic searchers looking for targets. In these models, the probability that a searcher finds a particular target, its so-called hitting probability, is often of considerable interest. In this work we determine hitting probabilities for stochastic search processes conditioned on being faster than a random short time. Such times have been used to model stochastic resetting or stochastic inactivation. These results apply to any search process, diffusive or otherwise, whose unconditional short-time behavior can be adequately approximated, which we characterize for broad classes of stochastic search. We illustrate these results in several examples and show that the conditional hitting probabilities depend predominantly on the relative geodesic lengths between the initial position of the searcher and the targets. Finally, we apply these results to a canonical evidence accumulation model for decision making.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.14715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence and uniqueness of a quasi-stationary distribution for three stochastic processes derived from the model of Muller's ratchet. This model was invented with the aim of evaluating the limitations of an asexual reproduction mode in preventing the accumulation of deleterious mutations through natural selection alone. The main considered model is non-classical, as it is a stochastic diffusion evolving on an irregular set of infinite dimension with hard killing on an hyperplane. We are nonetheless able to prove exponential convergence in total variation to the quasi-stationary distribution even in this case. The parameters in this last convergence result are directly related to the core parameters of Muller's ratchet. The speed of convergence to the quasi-stationary distribution is deduced both for the infinite dimensional model and for approximations with a large yet finite number of potential mutations. Likewise, we give uniform moment estimates of the empirical distribution of mutations in the population under quasi-stationarity.</description>

      <title>Existence of weak solutions to stochastic heat equations driven by truncated $\alpha$-stable white noises with non-Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of stochastic heat equations driven by truncated $\alpha$-stable white noises for $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$ with noise coefficients that are continuous but not necessarily Lipschitz and satisfy globally linear growth conditions. We prove the existence of weak solution, taking values in two different spaces, to such an equation using a weak convergence argument on solutions to the approximating stochastic heat equations. For $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$ the weak solution is a measure-valued c\`{a}dl\`{a}g process. However, for $1&lt;\alpha&lt;5/3$ the weak solution is a c\`{a}dl\`{a}g process taking function values, and in this case we further show that for $0&lt;p&lt;5/3$ the uniform $p$-th moment for $L^p$-norm of the weak solution is finite, and that the weak solution is uniformly stochastic continuous in $L^p$ sense and satisfies a flow property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14818v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a class of non-linear stochastic heat equations driven by $\alpha$-stable white noises for $\alpha\in(1,2)$ with Lipschitz coefficients, we first show the existence and pathwise uniqueness of $L^p$-valued c\`{a}dl\`{a}g solutions to such a equation for $p\in(\alpha,2]$ by considering a sequence of approximating stochastic heat equations driven by truncated
  $\alpha$-stable white noises obtained by removing the big jumps from the original $\alpha$-stable white noises.
  If the $\alpha$-stable white noise is spectrally one-sided, under additional monotonicity assumption on noise coefficients, we prove a comparison theorem on the $L^2$-valued c\`{a}dl\`{a}g solutions of such a equation. As a consequence, the non-negativity of the $L^2$-valued c\`{a}dl\`{a}g solution is established for the above stochastic heat equation with non-negative initial function.</description>

      <title>Mean-field interacting multi-type birth-death processes with a view to applications in phylodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-type birth-death processes underlie approaches for inferring evolutionary dynamics from phylogenetic trees across biological scales, ranging from deep-time species macroevolution to rapid viral evolution and somatic cellular proliferation. A limitation of current phylogenetic birth-death models is that they require restrictive linearity assumptions that yield tractable message-passing likelihoods, but that also preclude interactions between individuals. Many fundamental evolutionary processes -- such as environmental carrying capacity or frequency-dependent selection -- entail interactions, and may strongly influence the dynamics in some systems. Here, we introduce a multi-type birth-death process in mean-field interaction with an ensemble of replicas of the focal process. We prove that, under quite general conditions, the ensemble's stochastically evolving interaction field converges to a deterministic trajectory in the limit of an infinite ensemble. In this limit, the replicas effectively decouple, and self-consistent interactions appear as nonlinearities in the infinitesimal generator of the focal process. We investigate a special case that is rich enough to model both carrying capacity and frequency-dependent selection while yielding tractable message-passing likelihoods in the context of a phylogenetic birth-death model.</description>

      <title>Averaging for stochastic perturbations of integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07040v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with averaging theorems for $\epsilon$-small stochastic perturbations of integrable equations in $\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{T}^n =\{(I,\varphi)\}$ $$ \dot I(t) =0,\quad \dot \varphi(t) = \theta(I),
  \qquad (1)$$ and in $\mathbb{R}^{2n} = \{v=(\mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n), \; \mathbf{v}_j \in \mathbb{R}^2\}$, $$ \dot{\mathbf{v}}_k(t) =W_k(I) \mathbf{v}_k^\bot, \quad k=1, \dots, n,
  \qquad (2) $$ where $I=(I_1, \dots, I_n)$ is the vector of actions, $I_j = \frac12 \| \mathbf{v}_j\|^2$. The vector-functions $\theta$ and $W$ are locally Lipschitz and non-degenerate. Perturbations of these equations are assumed to be locally Lipschitz and such that some few first moments of the norms of their solutions are bounded uniformly in $\epsilon$, for $0\le t\le \epsilon^{-1} T$. For $I$-components of solutions for perturbations of (1) we establish their convergence in law to solutions of the corresponding averaged $I$-equations, when $0\le \tau := \epsilon t\le T$ and $\epsilon\to0$. Then we show that if the system of averaged $I$-equations is mixing, then the convergence is uniform in the slow time $\tau=\epsilon t\ge0$. Next using these results, for $\epsilon$-perturbed equations of (2) we construct well posed {\it effective stochastic equations} for $v(\tau)\in \mathbb{R}^{2n}$ (independent from $\epsilon$) such that when $\epsilon\to0$, actions of solutions of the perturbed equations of (2) with $t:= \tau/\epsilon$ converge in distribution to actions of solutions for the effective equations. Again, if the effective system is mixing, this convergence is uniform in the slow time $\tau \ge0$. We provide easy sufficient conditions on the perturbed equations which ensure that our results apply to their solutions.</description>

      <title>The random field Ising chain domain-wall structure in the large interaction limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the configurations of the nearest neighbor Ising ferromagnetic chain with IID centered and square integrable external random field in the limit in which the pairwise interaction tends to infinity. The available free energy estimates for this model show a strong form of disorder relevance, i.e., a strong effect of disorder on the free energy behavior, and our aim is to make explicit how the disorder affects the spin configurations. We give a quantitative estimate that shows that the infinite volume spin configurations are close to one explicit disorder dependent configuration when the interaction is large. Our results confirm predictions on this model obtained in D. S. Fisher, P. Le Doussal and C. Monthus (Phys. Rev. E 2001) by applying the renormalization group method introduced by D. S. Fisher (Phys. Rev. B 1995).</description>

Abstract: We consider real, Gauss-divisible matrices $A_{t}=A+\sqrt{t}B$, where $B$ is from the real Ginibre ensemble. We prove that the bulk correlation functions converge to a universal limit for $t=O(N^{-1/3+\epsilon})$ if $A$ satisfies certain local laws. If $A=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}(\xi_{jk})_{j,k=1}^{N}$ with $\xi_{jk}$ independent and identically distributed real random variables having zero mean, unit variance and finite moments, the Gaussian component can be removed using local laws proven by Bourgade--Yau--Yin, Alt--Erd\H{o}s--Kr\"{u}ger and Cipolloni--Erd\H{o}s--Schr\"{o}der and the four moment theorem of Tao--Vu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the accumulated spectrogram associated to a locally trace class orthogonal projection operator and to a bounded set using the polar decomposition of its restriction on that set and prove a convergence theorem for accumulated spectrograms along an exhaustion in the case when the corresponding determinantal point process is hyperuniform. We prove that a radial determinantal point process on Rd is always hyperuniform along the exhaustion formed by the dilations of a bounded open set, and as a consequence, we obtain that dilations of the corresponding accumulated spectrogram converge to the indicator function of the considered set, establishing thus a universal phenomenon. Our result is a generalisation of a theorem by Abreu-Gr\"ochenig-Romero in [1] concerning time-frequency localization operators.</description>

Abstract: We prove Poisson limit laws for open billiards where the holes are on the boundaries of billiard tables (rather than some abstract holes in the phase space of a billiard). Such holes are of the main interest for billiard systems, especially for applications. Sinai billiards with or without a finite horizon, diamond billiards, and semi-dispersing billiards, as well as focusing billiards with slow decay of correlations, are considered.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a large causal polytree from a relatively small i.i.d. sample. This is motivated by the problem of determining causal structure when the number of variables is very large compared to the sample size, such as in gene regulatory networks. We give an algorithm that recovers the tree with high accuracy in such settings. The algorithm works under essentially no distributional or modeling assumptions other than some mild non-degeneracy conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider rather general and broad class of Markov chains, Ito chains, that look like Euler-Maryama discretization of some Stochastic Differential Equation. The chain we study is a unified framework for theoretical analysis. It comes with almost arbitrary isotropic and state-dependent noise instead of normal and state-independent one as in most related papers. Moreover, in our chain the drift and diffusion coefficient can be inexact in order to cover wide range of applications as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics, sampling, Stochastic Gradient Descent or Stochastic Gradient Boosting. We prove the bound in $W_{2}$-distance between the laws of our Ito chain and corresponding differential equation. These results improve or cover most of the known estimates. And for some particular cases, our analysis is the first.</description>

      <title>Modeling Shortest Paths in Polymeric Networks using Spatial Branching Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have established a connection between the macroscopic mechanical response of polymeric materials and the statistics of the shortest path (SP) length between distant nodes in the polymer network. Since these statistics can be costly to compute and difficult to study theoretically, we introduce a branching random walk (BRW) model to describe the SP statistics from the coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations of polymer networks. We postulate that the first passage time (FPT) of the BRW to a given termination site can be used to approximate the statistics of the SP between distant nodes in the polymer network. We develop a theoretical framework for studying the FPT of spatial branching processes and obtain an analytical expression for estimating the FPT distribution as a function of the cross-link density. We demonstrate by extensive numerical calculations that the distribution of the FPT of the BRW model agrees well with the SP distribution from the CGMD simulations. The theoretical estimate and the corresponding numerical implementations of BRW provide an efficient way of approximating the SP distribution in a polymer network. Our results have the physical meaning that by accounting for the realistic topology of polymer networks, extensive bond-breaking is expected to occur at a much smaller stretch than that expected from idealized models assuming periodic network structures. Our work presents the first analysis of polymer networks as a BRW and sets the framework for developing a generalizable spatial branching model for studying the macroscopic evolution of polymeric systems.</description>

      <title>The twin peaks of learning neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works demonstrated the existence of a double-descent phenomenon for the generalization error of neural networks, where highly overparameterized models escape overfitting and achieve good test performance, at odds with the standard bias-variance trade-off described by statistical learning theory. In the present work, we explore a link between this phenomenon and the increase of complexity and sensitivity of the function represented by neural networks. In particular, we study the Boolean mean dimension (BMD), a metric developed in the context of Boolean function analysis. Focusing on a simple teacher-student setting for the random feature model, we derive a theoretical analysis based on the replica method that yields an interpretable expression for the BMD, in the high dimensional regime where the number of data points, the number of features, and the input size grow to infinity. We find that, as the degree of overparameterization of the network is increased, the BMD reaches an evident peak at the interpolation threshold, in correspondence with the generalization error peak, and then slowly approaches a low asymptotic value. The same phenomenology is then traced in numerical experiments with different model classes and training setups. Moreover, we find empirically that adversarially initialized models tend to show higher BMD values, and that models that are more robust to adversarial attacks exhibit a lower BMD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The double Pareto distribution is a heavy-tailed distribution with a power-law tail, that is generated via geometric Brownian motion with an exponentially distributed observation time. In this study, we examine a modified model wherein the exponential distribution of the observation time is replaced with a continuous uniform distribution. The probability density, complementary cumulative distribution, and moments of this model are exactly calculated. Furthermore, the validity of the analytical calculations is discussed in comparison with numerical simulations of stochastic processes.</description>
