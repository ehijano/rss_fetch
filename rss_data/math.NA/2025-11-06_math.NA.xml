      <title>Long-term behaviour of symmetric partitioned linear multistep methods II. Invariants error analysis for some nonlinear dispersive wave models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the use of partitioned linear multistep methods (PLMM) as time integrators for the numerical approximation of some partial differential equations (pdes) is studied. We consider the periodic initial-value problem of two nonlinear dispersive wave models as case studies. From the spatial discretization with pseudospectral methods, the theory developed for PLMMs by the authors in a previous companion paper is applied to analyze the time integration with PLMMs of the semidiscrete equations when approximating solitary wave solutions. The results are illustrated with some numerical experiments. In addition, a computational study is performed in an exploratory fashion to analyze the extension of the results to the approximation of more general localized solutions.</description>

      <title>Read Between the Hyperplanes: On Spectral Projection and Sampling Approaches to Randomized Kaczmarz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among recent developments centered around Randomized Kaczmarz (RK), a row-sampling iterative projection method for large-scale linear systems, several adaptions to the method have inspired faster convergence. Focusing solely on ill-conditioned and overdetermined linear systems, we highlight inter-row relationships that can be leveraged to guide directionally aware projections. In particular, we find that improved convergence rates can be made by (i) projecting onto pairwise row differences, (ii) sampling from partitioned clusters of nearly orthogonal rows, or (iii) more frequently sampling spectrally-diverse rows.</description>

      <title>Parametric Hierarchical Matrix Approximations to Kernel Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel matrices are ubiquitous in computational mathematics, often arising from applications in machine learning and scientific computing. In two or three spatial or feature dimensions, such problems can be approximated efficiently by a class of matrices known as hierarchical matrices. A hierarchical matrix consists of a hierarchy of small near-field blocks (or sub-matrices) stored in a dense format and large far-field blocks approximated by low-rank matrices. Standard methods for forming hierarchical matrices do not account for the fact that kernel matrices depend on specific hyperparameters; for example, in the context of Gaussian processes, hyperparameters must be optimized over a fixed parameter space. We introduce a new class of hierarchical matrices, namely, parametric (parameter-dependent) hierarchical matrices. Members of this new class are parametric $\mathcal{H}$-matrices and parametric $\mathcal{H}^{2}$-matrices. The construction of a parametric hierarchical matrix follows an offline-online paradigm. In the offline stage, the near-field and far-field blocks are approximated by using polynomial approximation and tensor compression. In the online stage, for a particular hyperparameter, the parametric hierarchical matrix is instantiated efficiently as a standard hierarchical matrix. The asymptotic costs for storage and computation in the offline stage are comparable to the corresponding standard approaches of forming a hierarchical matrix. However, the online stage of our approach requires no new kernel evaluations, and the far-field blocks can be computed more efficiently than standard approaches. {Numerical experiments show over $100\times$ speedups compared with existing techniques.}</description>

      <title>Efficient linear schemes for a penalized ternary Cahn-Hilliard system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce novel numerical schemes for a penalized version of the ternary Cahn-Hilliard system for the purpose of creating accurate and efficient numerical schemes of interfacial dynamics with three components as well as some results extending these ideas to systems with four or more components. The first scheme is linear, decoupled, first order accurate, and unconditionally energy stable. Next, we present a second scheme which is a conditionally energy stable modification of the first scheme, but has greatly reduced computational cost. Finally, we present a third scheme which is linear and second order accurate but the unknowns are coupled. Moreover, we present several numerical simulations in two and three dimensions to give a comprehensive overview of each scheme and the cost-benefit analysis associated with designing a method for energy-stability, efficiency, and accuracy.</description>

      <title>The isogeometric boundary element algorithm for solving the plane strain problem of an elastic matrix containing an open material surface of arbitrary shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents the Isogeometric Boundary Element Method (IGABEM) algorithm for solving the plane strain problem of an isotropic linearly elastic matrix containing an open material surface of arbitrary shape. Theoretical developments are based on the use of the Gurtin-Murdoch model of material surfaces. The governing equations and the boundary conditions for the problem are reviewed, and analytical integral representations for the elastic fields everywhere in the material system are presented in terms of unknown traction jumps across the surface. To find the jumps, the problem is reduced to a system of singular boundary integral equations in terms of two unknown scalar components of the surface stress tensor. The system is solved numerically using the developed IGABEM algorithm in which NURBS are used to approximate the unknowns. The main steps of the algorithm are discussed and convergence studies are performed. The algorithm is validated using two benchmark problems involving the matrix subjected to a uniform far-field load and containing a surface along (i) a straight segment and (ii) a circular arc. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the influence of governing parameters with a focus on the influence of curvature variation.</description>

      <title>Computing the nearest $\Omega$-admissible descriptor dissipative Hamiltonian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given set $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{C}$, a matrix pair $(E,A)$ is called $\Omega$-admissible if it is regular, impulse-free and its eigenvalues lie inside the region $\Omega$. In this paper, we provide a dissipative Hamiltonian characterization for the matrix pairs that are $\Omega$-admissible where $\Omega$ is an LMI region. We then use these results for solving the nearest $\Omega$-admissible matrix pair problem: Given a matrix pair $(E,A)$, find the nearest $\Omega$-admissible pair $(\tilde E, \tilde A)$ to the given pair $(E,A)$. We illustrate our results on several data sets and compare with the state of the art.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Split-Step Pad\'e Method for Guided Wave Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a Fourier-based, split-step Pad\'e (SSP) method for solving the parabolic wave equation with applications in guided wave propagation in ocean acoustics is presented. Traditional SSP implementations rely in finite-difference discretizations of the depth-dependent differential operator. This approach limits accuracy in coarse discretizations as well as computational efficiency in dense discretizations since it does not significantly benefit from parallelization. In contrast, our proposed method replaces finite differences with a spectral representation using the discrete sine transform (DST). This enables an exact treatment of the vertical operator under homogeneous boundary conditions. For non-constant sound speed, we use a Neumann series expansion to treat inhomogeneities as perturbations. Numerical experiments demonstrate the method's accuracy in range-independent media and rage-dependent scenarios, including propagation in deep ocean with Munk profile and in the presence of a parametrized synoptic eddy. Compared to finite-difference SSP methods, the Fourier-based approach achieves higher accuracy with fewer depth discretization points and avoids the resolution bottleneck associated with sharp field features, making it well-suited for large-scale, high-frequency wave propagation problems in ocean environments.</description>

      <title>A New Algorithm for Computing the Stabilizing Solution of General Periodic Time-Varying Stochastic Game-Theoretic Riccati Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new algorithm for a broad class of periodic time-varying Stochastic Game-Theoretic Riccati Differential Equations arising in Zero-Sum Linear-Quadratic Stochastic Differential Games. The algorithm is constructed via dual-layer matrix-valued functions iteration sequences, which reformulate the original problem into a set of interconnected bilevel subproblems. By sequentially computing the maximal periodic solutions to the Riccati differential equations associated with each subproblem, we derive the stabilizing periodic solutions for the original problem and rigorously prove the algorithm's convergence. Numerical experiments verifies algorithm effectiveness and stability. This study provides a unified numerical framework for solving a wider range of periodic time-varying Stochastic Game-Theoretic Riccati Differential Equations.</description>

      <title>Model order reduction via Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lie groups and their actions are ubiquitous in the description of physical systems, and we explore implications in the setting of model order reduction (MOR). We present a novel framework of MOR via Lie groups, called MORLie, in which high-dimensional dynamical systems on manifolds are approximated by low-dimensional dynamical systems on Lie groups. In comparison to other Lie group methods we are able to attack non-equivariant dynamics, which are frequent in practical applications, and we provide new non-intrusive MOR methods based on the presented geometric formulation. We also highlight numerically that MORLie has a lower error bound than the Kolmogorov $N$-width, which limits linear-subspace methods. The method is applied to various examples: 1. MOR of a simplified deforming body modeled by a noisy point cloud data following a sheering motion, where MORLie outperforms a naive POD approach in terms of accuracy and dimensionality reduction. 2. Reconstructing liver motion during respiration with data from edge detection in ultrasound scans, where MORLie reaches performance approaching the state of the art, while reducing the training time from hours on a computing cluster to minutes on a mobile workstation. 3. An analytic example showing that the method of freezing is analytically recovered as a special case, showing the generality of the geometric framework.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Randomized Tensor Train Rounding using Khatri-Rao Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximating a tensor in the tensor train (TT) format has many important applications in scientific computing. Rounding a TT tensor involves further compressing a tensor that is already in the TT format. This paper proposes new randomized algorithms for TT-rounding that uses sketches based on Khatri-Rao products (KRP). When the TT-ranks are known in advance, the proposed methods are comparable in cost to the sketches that used a sketching matrix in the TT-format~\cite{al2023randomized}. However, the use of KRP sketches enables adaptive algorithms to round the tensor in the TT-format within a fixed user-specified tolerance. An important component of the adaptivity is the estimation of error using KRP sketching, for which we develop theoretical guarantees. We report numerical experiments on synthetic tensors, parametric low-rank kernel approximations, and the solution of parametric partial differential equations. The numerical experiments show that we obtain speed-ups of up to $50\times$ compared to deterministic TT-rounding. Both the computational cost analysis and numerical experiments verify that the adaptive algorithms are competitive with the fixed rank algorithms, suggesting the adaptivity introduces only a low overhead.</description>

      <title>SIMD-vectorized implicit symplectic integrators can outperform explicit ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this work is to present a SIMD-vectorized implementation of the symplectic 16th-order 8-stage implicit Runge-Kutta integrator based on collocation with Gauss-Legendre nodes (IRKGL16-SIMD), and to show that it can outperform state-of-the-art symplectic explicit integrators for high-precision numerical integrations (in double-precision floating-point arithmetic) of non-stiff Hamiltonian ODE systems. Our IRKGL16-SIMD integrator leverages Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) based parallelism (in a way that is transparent to the user) to significantly enhance the performance of the sequential IRKGL16 implementation. We present numerical experiments comparing IRKGL16-SIMD with state-of-the-art high-order explicit symplectic methods for the numerical integration of several Hamiltonian systems in double-precision floating-point arithmetic.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study dyadic coarsening operators in univariate spline spaces and in tensor-product spline spaces over uniform grids. Our construction is strongly motivated by the work of Bartels, Golub, and Samavati (2006), Some observations on local least squares, BIT, 46(3):455--477. The proposed operators are local in nature and yield approximations to a given spline that are comparable to the global L2-best approximation, while being significantly faster to compute and computationally inexpensive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microgrids offer a promising paradigm for integrating distributed energy resources, bolstering energy resilience, and reducing the impact of blackouts. However, their inherent decentralization and dynamic operation present substantial energy management complexities. These complexities, including balancing supply and demand, ensuring system stability, and minimizing operational costs, often necessitate solving computationally intractable NP-hard Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problems. Traditional MINLP solvers struggle with the scalability and feasibility guarantees required for these challenges. To address this, this paper tackles the problem of resource allocation and radial configuration design for microgrid power distribution and proposes and abstracted problem which is solved by introducing a permutation-based iterative search method over the recently introduced FORWARD method to efficiently identify feasible, near-optimal radial network structures while inherently respecting physical constraints. Furthermore, this paper investigates the integration of the proposed method as a warm-start strategy for benchmark MINLP solvers offering a scalable solution for comprehensive microgrid design.</description>

      <title>A Plug-and-Play Framework for Volumetric Light-Sheet Image Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiac contraction is a rapid, coordinated process that unfolds across three-dimensional tissue on millisecond timescales. Traditional optical imaging is often inadequate for capturing dynamic cellular structure in the beating heart because of a fundamental trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-performance computational imaging framework that integrates Compressive Sensing (CS) with Light-Sheet Microscopy (LSM) for efficient, low-phototoxic cardiac imaging. The system performs compressed acquisition of fluorescence signals via random binary mask coding using a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD). We propose a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework, solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which flexibly incorporates advanced denoisers, including Tikhonov, Total Variation (TV), and BM3D. To preserve structural continuity in dynamic imaging, we further introduce temporal regularization enforcing smoothness between adjacent z-slices. Experimental results on zebrafish heart imaging under high compression ratios demonstrate that the proposed method successfully reconstructs cellular structures with excellent denoising performance and image clarity, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm in real-world high-speed, low-light biological imaging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Stabilization of Nitsche's Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weak imposition of essential boundary conditions is an integral aspect of unfitted finite element methods, where the physical boundary does not in general coincide with the computational domain. In this regard, the symmetric Nitsche's method is a powerful technique that preserves the symmetry and variational consistency of the unmodified weak formulation. The stabilization parameter in Nitsche's method plays a crucial role in the stability of the resultant formulation, whose estimation is computationally intensive and dependent on the particular cut configuration using the conventional eigenvalue-based approach. In this work, we employ as model problem the finite cell method in which the need for the generation of a boundary-conforming mesh is circumvented by embedding the physical domain in a, typically regular, background mesh. We propose a data-driven estimate based on machine learning methods for the estimation of the stabilization parameter in Nitsche's method that offers an efficient constant-complexity alternative to the eigenvalue-based approach independent of the cut configuration. It is shown, using numerical benchmarks, that the proposed method can estimate the stabilization parameter accurately and is by far more computationally efficient. The data-driven estimate can be integrated into existing numerical codes with minimal modifications and thanks to the wide adoption of accelerators such as GPUs by machine learning frameworks, can be used with virtually no extra implementation cost on GPU devices, further increasing the potential for computational gains over the conventional eigenvalue-based estimate. The proposed model is tested on both Intel CPU as well as NVIDIA GPU hardware, showing that while it is already many times more efficient on the CPU compared to the eigenvalue-based estimate, its efficiency margin is even larger on modern GPU devices.</description>

      <title>Sample-based almost-sure quasi-optimal approximation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06674v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of approximating an unknown function from point evaluations. When obtaining these point evaluations is costly, minimising the required sample size becomes crucial, and it is unreasonable to reserve a sufficiently large test sample for estimating the approximation accuracy. Therefore, an approximation with a certified quasi-optimality factor is required. This article shows that such an approximation can be obtained when the sought function lies in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and is to be approximated in a finite-dimensional linear subspace $\mathcal{V}_d$. However, selecting the sample points to minimise the quasi-optimality factor requires optimising over an infinite set of points and computing exact inner products in RKHS, which is often infeasible in practice. Extending results from optimal sampling for $L^2$ approximation, the present paper proves that random points, drawn independently from the Christoffel sampling distribution associated with $\mathcal{V}_d$, can yield a controllable quasi-optimality factor with high probability. Inspired by this result, a novel sampling scheme, coined subspace-informed volume sampling, is introduced and evaluated in numerical experiments, where it outperforms classical i.i.d. Christoffel sampling and continuous volume sampling. To reduce the size of such a random sample, an additional greedy subsampling scheme with provable suboptimality bounds is introduced. Our presentation is of independent interest to the inverse problems community, as it offers a simpler interpretation of the parametrised background data weak (PBDW) method.</description>

      <title>A bi-fidelity method for the uncertain Vlasov-Poisson system near quasineutrality in an asymptotic-preserving particle-in-cell framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Vlasov-Poisson system with massless electrons (VPME) near quasineutrality and with uncertainties. Based on the idea of reformulation on the Poisson equation by [P. Degond et.al., $\textit{Journal of Computational Physics}$, 229 (16), 2010, pp. 5630--5652], we first consider the deterministic problem and develop an efficient asymptotic-preserving particle-in-cell (AP-PIC) method to capture the quasineutral limit numerically, without resolving the discretizations subject to the small Debye length in plasma. The main challenge and difference compared to previous related works is that we consider the nonlinear Poisson in the VPME system which contains $e^{\phi}$ (with $\phi$ being the electric potential) and provide an explicit scheme. In the second part, we extend to study the uncertainty quantification (UQ) problem and develop an efficient bi-fidelity method for solving the VPME system with multidimensional random parameters, by choosing the Euler-Poisson equation as the low-fidelity model. Several numerical experiments are shown to demonstrate the asymptotic-preserving property of our deterministic solver and the effectiveness of our bi-fidelity method for solving the model with random uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Discrete Poincar\'e inequalities: a review on proofs, equivalent formulations, and behavior of constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate discrete Poincar\'e inequalities on piecewise polynomial subspaces of the Sobolev spaces H(curl) and H(div) in three space dimensions. We characterize the dependence of the constants on the continuous-level constants, the shape regularity and cardinality of the underlying tetrahedral mesh, and the polynomial degree. One important focus is on meshes being local patches (stars) of tetrahedra from a larger tetrahedral mesh. We also review various equivalent results to the discrete Poincar\'e inequalities, namely stability of discrete constrained minimization problems, discrete inf-sup conditions, bounds on operator norms of piecewise polynomial vector potential operators (Poincar\'e maps), and existence of graph-stable commuting projections.</description>

      <title>The Fourier spectral approach to the spatial discretization of quasilinear hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the rigorous justification of the spatial discretization by means of Fourier spectral methods of quasilinear first-order hyperbolic systems. We provide uniform stability estimates that grant spectral convergence of the (spatially) semi-discretized solutions towards the corresponding continuous solution provided that the underlying system satisfies some suitable structural assumptions. We consider a setting with sharp low-pass filters and a setting with smooth low-pass filters and argue that - at least theoretically - smooth low-pass filters are operable on a larger class of systems. While our theoretical results are supported with numerical evidence, we also pinpoint some behavior of the numerical method that currently has no theoretical explanation.</description>

      <title>An efficient asymptotic preserving Monte Carlo method for frequency-dependent radiative transfer equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an efficient asymptotic-preserving (AP) Monte Carlo (MC) method for frequency-dependent radiative transfer equations (RTEs), which is based on the AP-MC method proposed for the gray RTEs in \cite{shi2023efficient}. We follow the characteristics-based approach by Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2023asymptotic} to get a reformulated model, which couples a low dimension convection-diffusion-type equation for macroscopic quantities with a high dimension transport equation for the radiative intensity.
  To recover the correct free streaming limit due to frequency-dependency, we propose a correction to the reformulated macroscopic equation.
  The macroscopic system is solved using a hybrid method:
  convective fluxes are handled by a particle-based MC method, while diffusive fluxes are treated implicitly with central difference.
  To address the nonlinear coupling between radiative intensity and the Planck function across multiple frequency groups, we adopt a Picard iteration with a predictor-corrector procedure, which decouples a global nonlinear system into a linear system restricted to spatial dimension (independent of frequency) with scalar algebraic nonlinear equations.
  Once the macroscopic update is done, the transport equation, with a known emission source provided by the macroscopic variables, is efficiently solved using an implicit MC method. This approach enables larger time steps independent of the speed of light and also the frequency across a wide range, significantly enhancing computational efficiency, especially for frequency-dependent RTEs.
  Formal AP analysis in the diffusive scaling is established. Numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the high efficiency and AP property of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this survey, we provide an in-depth investigation of exponential Runge-Kutta methods for the numerical integration of initial-value problems. These methods offer a valuable synthesis between classical Runge-Kutta methods, introduced more than a century ago, and exponential integrators, which date back to the 1960s. This manuscript presents both a historical analysis of the development of these methods up to the present day and several examples aimed at making the topic accessible to a broad audience.</description>

      <title>Finite element methods for electroneutral multicomponent electrolyte flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a broad family of high-order finite element algorithms for simulating the flow of electroneutral electrolytes. The governing partial differential equations that we solve are the electroneutral Navier-Stokes-Onsager-Stefan-Maxwell (NSOSM) equations, which model momentum transport, multicomponent diffusion and electrical effects within the electrolyte. Our algorithms can be applied in the steady and transient settings, in two and three spatial dimensions, and under a variety of boundary conditions. Moreover, we allow for the material parameters (e.g. viscosity, diffusivities, thermodynamic factors and density) to be solution-dependent and thermodynamically non-ideal. The flexibility of our approach requires us to address subtleties that arise in the governing equations due to the interplay between boundary conditions and the equation of state. We demonstrate the algorithms in various physical configurations, including (i) electrolyte flow around a microfluidic rotating disk electrode and (ii) the flow in a Hull cell of a cosolvent electrolyte mixture used in lithium-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Approximation of Weak Solutions to Time Dependent Maxwell's Equations with $L^2$-Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Maxwell's equations in conducting media with perfectly conducting boundary conditions on Lipschitz domains, allowing rough material coefficients and $L^2$-data. Our first contribution is a direct proof of well-posedness of the first-order weak formulation, including solution existence and uniqueness, an energy identity, and continuous dependence on the data. The argument uses interior-in-time mollification to show uniqueness while avoiding reflection techniques. Existence is via the well-known Galerkin method (cf.~Duvaut and Lions \cite[Eqns.~(4.31)--(4.32), p.~346; Thm.~4.1]{GDuvaut_JLLions_1976a}). For completeness, and to make the paper self-contained, a complete proof has been provided.
  Our second contribution is a structure-preserving semi-discrete finite element method based on the N\'ed\'elec/Raviart--Thomas de Rham complex. The scheme preserves a discrete Gauss law for all times and satisfies a continuous-in-time energy identity with stability for nonnegative conductivity. With a divergence-free initialization of the magnetic field (via potential reconstruction or constrained $L^2$ projection), we prove convergence of the semi-discrete solutions to the unique weak solution as the mesh is refined. The analysis mostly relies on projector consistency, weak-* compactness in time-bounded $L^2$ spaces, and identification of time derivatives in dual spaces.</description>

      <title>Numerical Spectrum Linking: Identification of Governing PDE via Koopman-Chebyshev Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numerical framework is proposed for identifying partial differential equations (PDEs) governing dynamical systems directly from their observation data using Chebyshev polynomial approximation. In contrast to data-driven approaches such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which approximate the Koopman operator without a clear connection to differential operators, the proposed method constructs finite-dimensional Koopman matrices by projecting the dynamics onto a Chebyshev basis, thereby capturing both differential and nonlinear terms. This establishes a numerical link between the Koopman and differential operators. Numerical experiments on benchmark dynamical systems confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the approach, underscoring its potential for interpretable operator learning. The framework also lays a foundation for future integration with symbolic regression, enabling the construction of explicit mathematical models directly from data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kemeny's constant measures the efficiency of a Markov chain in traversing its states. We investigate whether structure-preserving perturbations to the transition probabilities of a reversible Markov chain can improve its connectivity while maintaining a fixed stationary distribution. Although the minimum achievable value for Kemeny's constant can be estimated, the required perturbations may be infeasible. We reformulate the problem as an optimization task, focusing on solution existence and efficient algorithms, with an emphasis to the problem of minimizing Kemeny's constant under sparsity constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the discretization, convergence, and numerical implementation of recent reformulations of the quadratic porous medium equation (multidimensional and anisotropic) and Burgers' equation (one-dimensional, with optional viscosity), as forward in time variants of the Benamou-Brenier formulation of optimal transport. This approach turns those evolution problems into global optimization problems in time and space, of which we introduce a discretization, one of whose originalities lies in the harmonic interpolation of the densities involved. We prove that the resulting schemes are unconditionally stable w.r.t. the space and time steps, and we establish a quadratic convergence rate for the dual PDE solution, under suitable assumptions. We also show that the schemes can be efficiently solved numerically using a proximal splitting method and a global space-time fast Fourier transform, and we illustrate our results with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Individualizing Glioma Radiotherapy Planning by Optimization of Data and Physics-Informed Discrete Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05063v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain tumor growth is unique to each glioma patient and extends beyond what is visible in imaging scans, infiltrating surrounding brain tissue. Understanding these hidden patient-specific progressions is essential for effective therapies. Current treatment plans for brain tumors, such as radiotherapy, typically involve delineating a uniform margin around the visible tumor on pre-treatment scans to target this invisible tumor growth. This "one size fits all" approach is derived from population studies and often fails to account for the nuances of individual patient conditions. We present the GliODIL framework, which infers the full spatial distribution of tumor cell concentration from available multi-modal imaging, leveraging a Fisher-Kolmogorov type physics model to describe tumor growth. This is achieved through the newly introduced method of Optimizing the Discrete Loss, where both data and physics-based constraints are softly assimilated into the solution. Our test dataset comprises 152 glioblastoma patients with pre-treatment imaging and post-treatment follow-ups for tumor recurrence monitoring. By blending data-driven techniques with physics-based constraints, GliODIL enhances recurrence prediction in radiotherapy planning, challenging traditional uniform margins and strict adherence to the Fisher-Kolmogorov partial differential equation model, which is adapted for complex cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove existence and uniqueness of a bounded viscosity solution for the Cauchy problem of degenerate parabolic equations with variable exponent coefficients. We construct the solution directly using the stochastic representation, then verify it satisfies the Cauchy problem. The corresponding SDE, on the other hand, allows the drift and diffusion coefficients to respond nonlinearly to the current state through the state-dependent variable exponents, and thus, extends the expressive power of classical SDEs to better capture complex dynamics. To validate our theoretical framework, we conduct comprehensive numerical experiments comparing finite difference solutions (Crank-Nicolson on logarithmic grids) with Monte Carlo simulations of the SDE.</description>

      <title>In Situ Training of Implicit Neural Compressors for Scientific Simulations via Sketch-Based Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Focusing on implicit neural representations, we present a novel in situ training protocol that employs limited memory buffers of full and sketched data samples, where the sketched data are leveraged to prevent catastrophic forgetting. The theoretical motivation for our use of sketching as a regularizer is presented via a simple Johnson-Lindenstrauss-informed result. While our methods may be of wider interest in the field of continual learning, we specifically target in situ neural compression using implicit neural representation-based hypernetworks. We evaluate our method on a variety of complex simulation data in two and three dimensions, over long time horizons, and across unstructured grids and non-Cartesian geometries. On these tasks, we show strong reconstruction performance at high compression rates. Most importantly, we demonstrate that sketching enables the presented in situ scheme to approximately match the performance of the equivalent offline method.</description>

      <title>An accelerated primal-dual flow for linearly constrained multiobjective optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a continuous-time primal-dual approach for linearly constrained multiobjective optimization problems. A novel dynamical model, called accelerated multiobjective primal-dual flow, is presented with a second-order equation for the primal variable and a first-order equation for the dual variable. It can be viewed as an extension of the accelerated primal-dual flow by Luo [arXiv:2109.12604, 2021] for the single objective case. To facilitate the convergence rate analysis, we introduce a new merit function, which motivates the use of the feasibility violation and the objective gap to measure the weakly Pareto optimality. By using a proper Lyapunov function, we establish the exponential decay rate in the continuous level. After that, we consider an implicit-explicit scheme, which yields an accelerated multiobjective primal-dual method with a quadratic subproblem, and prove the sublinear rates of the feasibility violation and the objective gap, under the convex case and the strongly convex case, respectively. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.</description>
