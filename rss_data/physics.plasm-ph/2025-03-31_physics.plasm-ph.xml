      <title>Quasi-monoenergetic multi-GeV electron acceleration in a plasma waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-plasma accelerators present a promising alternative to conventional accelerators. To fully exploit the extreme amplitudes of the plasma fields and produce high-quality beams, precise control over electron injection into the accelerating structure is required, along with effective laser pulse guiding to extend the acceleration length. Recent studies have demonstrated efficient guiding and acceleration using hydrodynamic optically field-ionized (OFI) plasma channels. This guiding technique has also been combined with controlled electron injection to produce high-quality electron beams at the GeV level using a 50 TW laser. The present work extends these results to higher laser energies, demonstrating the generation of quasi-monoenergetic electron beams with peak energies exceeding 2 GeV, for a PW-class laser.</description>

      <title>A Numerically Accessible, High Precision Approximation of Landau Damping in Real Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear Landau damping tests of plasma codes are limited to density decay rate comparisons between approximations to the correct decay rate, obtained from the dielectric function, and simulated data. In this paper, we present a surprisingly simple numerical method for calculating the exact solution of the linearised Vlasov equation in the time domain, which allows for direct testing of simulated data. Specifically, when applied to the conventional evaluation of decay rates, the precision of our method is not restricted by any approximation. In addition, the method enables testing the complete distribution function as simulated by kinetic plasma codes. For illustration, we calculate the density and distribution function response to an initial density perturbation.</description>

      <title>Gas puff imaging of plasma turbulence in the magnetic island scrape-off layer of W7-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The turbulence characteristics of the scrape-off-layer (SOL) plasma in the W7-X stellarator are investigated using a gas-puff-imaging (GPI) diagnostic, newly installed and operated during the OP 2.1 campaign. The SOL plasma on W7-X features a set of island divertors for heat and particle exhaust and provides a unique environment for studying SOL turbulence and transport. This paper focuses on the O-point region of the magnetic island divertor SOL in the standard magnetic configuration. Fourier and cross-correlation analyses show that turbulence flows are predominantly in the poloidal direction (i.e., direction tangent to the last closed flux surface) with significantly weaker radial motion. This suggests dominant ExB convection and suppressed filamentary transport compared to those observed in the far scrape-off-layer region of tokamaks, as further supported by high-resolution skewness and kurtosis data that show the absence of intermittent, bursty filamentary events. Additionally, a relationship between the radial profile of the connection length and the sheared poloidal flow structure is reported, suggesting a possible linkage among magnetic topology, turbulence dynamics, and turbulence generation.</description>

      <title>Leaky surface plasmon-based wakefield acceleration in nanostructured carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metallic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can provide ultra-dense, homogeneous plasma capable of sustaining resonant plasma waves-known as plasmons-with ultra-high field amplitudes. These waves can be efficiently driven by either high-intensity laser pulses or high-density relativistic charged particle beams. In this study, we use numerical simulations to propose that electrons and positrons can be accelerated in wakefields generated by the leaky electromagnetic field of surface plasmons. These plasmons are excited when a high-intensity optical laser pulse propagates paraxially through a cylindrical vacuum channel structured within a CNT forest. The wakefield is stably sustained by a non-evanescent longitudinal field with $\si{TV/m}$-level amplitudes. This mechanism differs significantly from the plasma wakefield generation in uniform gaseous plasmas. Traveling at the speed of light in vacuum, with phase-matched focusing fields, the wakefield acceleration is highly efficient for both electron and positron beams. We also examine two potential electron injection mechanisms: edge injection and self-injection. Both mechanisms are feasible with current laser facilities, paving the way for experimental realization. Beyond presenting a promising pathway toward ultra-compact, high-energy solid-state plasma particle accelerators, this work also expands the potential of high-energy plasmonics.</description>

      <title>ANEMONE: a fully three-dimensional solid-state electro-aerodynamic propulsion system simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid-state electro-aerodynamic propulsion systems are devices that utilize atmospheric pressure corona discharge and have been actively researched in recent years as a means of achieving silent drones. However, these systems contain multiple, widely disparate time and spatial scales. Therefore, the governing equations of the systems, a three-component plasma fluid model that considers the presence of electrons, positive ions, and negative ions, constitute a stiff non-linear system of partial differential equations, challenging to solve. Here, we have developed an ANEMONE simulator capable of numerically estimating the corona inception voltage and energy conversion efficiency in three-dimensional solid-state electro-aerodynamic propulsion systems. Specifically, on the basis of the governing equations, we adopted the method of characteristics and the perturbation method to obtain the sub-problems. Furthermore, we have successfully obtained the integral equations, making the sub-problems easier to solve. Finally, we validated the prediction results based on the theoretical results in a previous study. Remarkably, ANEMONE is the first simulator in the world which predicted the two representative performance of fully three-dimensional propulsion systems.</description>
