      <title>Flexible arrangement of two Bennett tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In analogy to flexible bipyramids, also known as Bricard octahedra, we study flexible couplings of two Bennett mechanisms. The resulting flexible bi-Bennett structures can be used as building blocks of flexible tubes with quadrilateral cross-section that possess skew faces. We present three 4-dimensional families of flexible arranged Bennett tubes and discuss some of their properties as well as their relation to flexible bipyramids and biprisms, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Robust Approach to Detect Intersections between Triangles with Different Numerical Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection and classification of intersections between triangles are crucial tasks in a wide range of applications within Computer Graphics and Geometry Processing, including mesh Arrangements, mesh Booleans, and generic mesh processing and fixing tasks. Existing methods are hard-coded and deeply integrated into specific algorithms, and significant efforts are usually required to integrate them into new pipelines or to extend them to different numerical representations. This paper presents a versatile and exhaustive algorithm to identify and classify intersections between triangles with either floating points, rational numbers, or implicit representations. The proposed tool is implemented as a C++ templated and header-only code that is generic and easy to integrate into further algorithms requiring the triangle-triangle intersection detection step. The developed tool has been tested and compared with a state-of-the-art approach, and it is shared with the Geometry Processing community with an Open Source license.</description>

      <title>Computing optimal trajectories for a tethered pursuer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a trajectory planning problem for a marsupial robotics system consisting of a ground robot, a drone, and a taut tether of bounded length connecting the two robots. This problem can be framed within the context of a pursuit-evasion game. Using a geometric modeling approach, we present an optimal algorithm to compute a minimum-link path for the pursuer (ground robot), given the known path of the evader (drone). Furthermore, we address and solve three related geometric optimization problems, leveraging the intrinsic connections between them.</description>
