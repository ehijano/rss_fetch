      <title>Genealogy in critical generations of a diffusive random walk in random environment on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the range $R^{(n)}$, the tree made up of visited vertices by a diffusive null-recurrent randomly biased walk $\mathbb{X}$ on a Galton-Watson tree $\mathbb{T}$ up to the $n$-th return time to its root and we consider the following genealogy problem: pick two vertices uniformly at random in a generation of order $n$ in the tree $R^{(n)}$. Where does the coalescence occur? it turns out that the coalescence happens either in the recent past or in the remote past.</description>

      <title>On the Global solution and Invariance of stochastic constrained Modified Swift-Hohenberg Equation on a Hilbert manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the stochastic generalization of the projected deterministic constrained modified Swift-Hohenberg equation. Specifically, we will investigate a nonlinear parabolic equation in which the first-order time derivative (heat) operates on a Hilbert Manifold and is involved by Stratonovich-type Wiener noise. This paper will prove wellposedness, a global solution for the stochastic evolution equation.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional non-Markovian backward stochastic differential equations of interactively quadratic generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a general solvability of multi-dimensional non-Markovian backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with interactively quadratic generators. Some general structures of the generator $g$ are posed for both local and global existence and uniqueness results on BSDEs, which admit a general growth of the generator $g$ in the state variable $y$, and a quadratic growth of the $i$th component $g^i$ both in the $j$th row $z^j$ of the state variable $z$ for $j\neq i$ (by which we mean the ``{\it interactively quadratic}" growth) and in the $i$th row $z^i$ of $z$. We first establish an existence and uniqueness result on local bounded solutions and then several existence and uniqueness results on global bounded and unbounded solutions. They improve several existing works in the non-Markovian setting, and also incorporate some interesting examples, one of which is a partial answer to the problem posed in \citet{Jackson2023SPA}. A comprehensive study on the bounded solution of one-dimensional quadratic BSDEs with unbounded stochastic parameters is provided for deriving our main results.</description>

      <title>A Hopf-like formula for mean-field spin glass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mean-field spin glass models with general vector spins and convex covariance function. For those models, it is known that the limit of the free energy can be written as the supremum of a functional, this is the celebrated Parisi formula.
  In this paper, we observe that the Parisi functional extends into a concave and Lipschitz functional on the set of signed measures. We use this fact and Fenchel-Moreau duality to derive an un-inverted version of the Parisi formula. Namely, we show that the limit of the free energy can be written as the infimum of a functional related to the Parisi functional.
  This un-inverted formula can be interpreted as a Hopf-like formula for some Hamilton-Jacobi equation in Wasserstein space.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem for a random walk on Galton-Watson trees with random conductances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a central limit theorem for random walk on a Galton-Watson tree, when the edges of the tree are assigned randomly uniformly elliptic conductances. When a positive fraction of edges is assigned a small conductance $\varepsilon$, we study the behavior of the limiting variance as $\varepsilon\to 0$. Provided that the tree formed by larger conductances is supercritical, the variance is nonvanishing as $\varepsilon\to 0$, which implies that the slowdown induced by the $\varepsilon$-edges is not too strong. The proof utilizes a specific regeneration structure, which leads to escape estimates uniform in $\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>On the shape of the connected components of the complement of two-dimensional Brownian random interlacements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the limiting shape of the connected components of the vacant set of two-dimensional Brownian random interlacements: we prove that the connected component around $x$ is close in distribution to a rescaled \emph{Brownian amoeba} in the regime when the distance from $x\in\mathbb{C}$ to the closest trajectory is small (which, in particular, includes the cases $x\to\infty$ with fixed intensity parameter $\alpha$, and $\alpha\to\infty$ with fixed $x$). We also obtain a new family of martingales built on the conditioned Brownian motion, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A phase transition in sampling from Restricted Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann Machines are a class of undirected graphical models that play a key role in deep learning and unsupervised learning. In this study, we prove a phase transition phenomenon in the mixing time of the Gibbs sampler for a one-parameter Restricted Boltzmann Machine. Specifically, the mixing time varies logarithmically, polynomially, and exponentially with the number of vertices depending on whether the parameter $c$ is above, equal to, or below a critical value $c_\star\approx-5.87$. A key insight from our analysis is the link between the Gibbs sampler and a dynamical system, which we utilize to quantify the former based on the behavior of the latter. To study the critical case $c= c_\star$, we develop a new isoperimetric inequality for the sampler's stationary distribution by showing that the distribution is nearly log-concave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimation algebras have been extensively studied in Euclidean space, where finite-dimensional estimation algebras form the foundation of the Kalman and Benes filters, and have contributed to the discovery of many other finite-dimensional filters. This work extends the theory of estimation algebras to filtering problems on Riemannian manifolds in continuous time. Our main result demonstrates that, with non-constant observation functions, the estimation algebra associated with the system on closed Riemannian manifolds is infinite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>The velocity jump Langevin process and its splitting scheme: long time convergence and numerical accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Langevin dynamics is a diffusion process extensively used, in particular in molecular dynamics simu-lations, to sample Gibbs measures. Some alternatives based on (piecewise deterministic) kinetic velocity jumpprocesses have gained interest over the last decade. One interest of the latter is the possibility to split forces(at the continuous-time level), reducing the numerical cost for sampling the trajectory. Motivated by this, anumerical scheme based on hybrid dynamics combining velocity jumps and Langevin diffusion, numericallymore efficient than their classical Langevin counterparts, has been introduced for computational chemistry in [42]. The present work is devoted to the numerical analysis of this scheme. Our main results are, first, theexponential ergodicity of the continuous-time velocity jump Langevin process, second, a Talay-Tubaro expan-sion of the invariant measure of the numerical scheme, showing in particular that the scheme is of weak order2 in the step-size and, third, a bound on the quadratic risk of the corresponding practical MCMC estimator(possibly with Richardson extrapolation). With respect to previous works on the Langevin diffusion, newdifficulties arise from the jump operator, which is non-local.</description>

      <title>The $\rho$-Loewner Energy: Large Deviations, Minimizers, and Alternative Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the $\rho$-Loewner energy, a variant of the Loewner energy with a force point on the boundary of the domain. We prove a large deviation principle for SLE$_\kappa(\rho)$, as $\kappa \to 0+$ and $\rho&gt;-2$ is fixed, with the $\rho$-Loewner energy as the rate function in both radial and chordal settings. The unique minimizer of the $\rho$-Loewner energy is the SLE$_0(\rho)$ curve. We show that it exhibits three phases as $\rho$ varies and give a flow-line representation. We also define a whole-plane variant for which we explicitly describe the trace. We further obtain alternative formulas for the $\rho$-Loewner energy in the reference point hitting phase, $\rho &gt; -2$. In the radial setting we give an equivalent description in terms of the Dirichlet energy of $\log|h'|$, where $h$ is a conformal map onto the complement of the curve, plus a point contribution from the tip of the curve. In the chordal setting, we derive a similar formula under the assumption that the chord ends in the $\rho$-Loewner energy optimal way. Finally, we express the $\rho$-Loewner energy in terms of $\zeta$-regularized determinants of Laplacians.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel estimates for stable-driven SDEs with distributional drift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the formal SDE dX t = b(t, X t)dt + dZ t , X 0 = x $\in$ R d , (E) where b $\in$ L r ([0, T ], B $\beta$ p,q (R d , R d)) is a time-inhomogeneous Besov drift and Z t is a symmetric d-dimensional $\alpha$-stable process, $\alpha$ $\in$ (1, 2), whose spectral measure is absolutely continuous w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure on the sphere. Above, L r and B $\beta$ p,q respectively denote Lebesgue and Besov spaces. We show that, when $\beta$ &gt; (1--$\alpha$+ $\alpha$/r + d/p)/2 , the martingale solution associated with the formal generator of (E) admits a density which enjoys two-sided heat kernel bounds as well as gradient estimates w.r.t. the backward variable. Our proof relies on a suitable mollification of the singular drift aimed at using Duhamel expansion. We then use a normalization method combined with Besov space properties (thermic characterization, duality and product rules) to derive estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smale's Seventh Problem asks for an efficient algorithm to generate a configuration of $n$ points on the sphere that nearly minimizes the logarithmic energy. As a candidate starting configuration for this problem, Armentano, Beltr\'an and Shub considered the set of points given by the stereographic projection of the roots of the random elliptic polynomial of degree $n$ and computed the expected logarithmic energy. We study the fluctuations of the logarithmic energy associated to this random configuration and prove a central limit theorem. Our approach shows that all cumulants of the logarithmic energy are asymptotically linear in $n$, and hence the energy is well-concentrated on the scale of $\sqrt{n}$.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the size of the convex hull of planar Brownian motion and related inverse processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish bounds on expected values of various geometric quantities that describe the size of the convex hull spanned by a path of the standard planar Brownian motion. Expected values of the perimeter and the area of the Brownian convex hull are known explicitly, and satisfactory bounds on the expected value of its diameter can be found in the literature as well. In this work we investigate circumradius and inradius of the Brownian convex hull and obtain lower and upper bounds on their expected values. Our other goal is to find bounds on the related inverse processes (that correspond to the perimeter, area, diameter, circumradius and inradius of the convex hull) which provide us with some information on the speed of growth of the size of the Brownian convex hull.</description>

Abstract: We consider the number of crossings in a random embedding of a graph, $G$, with vertices in convex position. We give explicit formulas for the mean and variance of the number of crossings as a function of various subgraph counts of $G$. Using Stein's method and size-bias coupling, we establish an upper bound on the Kolmogorov distance between the distribution of the number of crossings and a standard normal random variable. We also consider the case where $G$ is a random graph and obtain a Kolmogorov bound between the distribution of crossings and a Gaussian mixture distribution. As applications, we obtain central limit theorems with convergence rates for the number of crossings in random embeddings of matchings, path graphs, cycle graphs, disjoint union of triangles, random $d$-regular graphs, and mixtures of random graphs.</description>

      <title>Scaling Limit of Kuramoto Model on Random Geometric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Kuramoto model on a graph with nodes given by $n$ i.i.d. points uniformly distributed on the $d$ dimensional torus. Two nodes are declared neighbors if they are at distance less than $\epsilon$. We prove a scaling limit for this model in compact time intervals as $n\to\infty$ and $\epsilon \to 0$ such that $\epsilon^{d+2}n/\log n \to \infty$. The limiting object is given by the heat equation. On the one hand this shows that the nonlinearity given by the sine function disappears under this scaling and on the other hand, provides evidence that stable equilibria of the Kuramoto model on these graphs are, as $n\to\infty$, in correspondence with those of the heat equation, which are explicit and given by twisted states. In view of this, we conjecture the existence of twisted stable equilibria with high probability as $n\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of the Nodal Number in the Two-Energy Planar Berry Random Wave Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuations of the nodal number (count of the phase singularities) in a natural extension of the well-known complex planar Berry Random Wave Model - Berry (2002) - obtained by considering two independent real Berry Random Waves, with distinct energies $E_1, E_2 \to \infty$ (at possibly $\neq$ speeds). Our framework relaxes the conditions used in Nourdin, Peccati and Rossi (2019) where the energies were assumed to be identical ($E_1 \equiv E_2$). We establish the asymptotic equivalence of the nodal number with its 4-th chaotic projection and prove quantitative Central Limit Theorems (CLTs) in the 1-Wasserstein distance for the univariate and multivariate scenarios. We provide a corresponding qualitative theorem on the convergence to the White Noise in a sense of random distributions. We compute the exact formula for the asymptotic variance of the nodal number with exact constants depending on the choice of the subsequence. We provide a simple and complete characterisation of this dependency through introduction of the three asymptotic parameters: $r^{log}$, $r$, $r^{exp}$. The corresponding claims in the one-energy model were established in Nourdin, Peccati and Rossi (2019), Peccati and Vidotto (2020), Notarnicola, Peccati and Vidotto (2023), and we recover them as a special case of our results. Moreover, we establish full-correlations with polyspectra, which are analogues of the full-correlation with tri-spectrum that was previously observed for the nodal length in Vidotto (2021).</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness of the generalised Dean-Kawasaki Equation with correlated noise on bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the notion of stochastic kinetic solutions introduced in arXiv:2108.08858 to establish the well-posedness of stochastic kinetic solutions of generalized Dean-Kawasaki equations with correlated noise on bounded, $C^2$-domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The results apply to a wide class of non-negative boundary data, which is based on certain a priori estimates for the solutions, that encompasses all non-negative constant functions including zero and all smooth functions bounded away from zero.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the distribution of the product of two correlated normal random variables with non-zero means and arbitrary variances is infinitely divisible. We also obtain exact formulas for the probability density function of the sum of independent copies of such random variables.</description>

      <title>The diameter of randomly twisted hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $n$-dimensional random twisted hypercube $\mathbf{G}_n$ is constructed recursively by taking two instances of $\mathbf{G}_{n-1}$, with any joint distribution, and adding a random perfect matching between their vertex sets. Benjamini, Dikstein, Gross, and Zhukovskii showed that its diameter is $O(n\log \log \log n/\log \log n)$ with high probability and at least ${(n - 1)/ \log_2 n}$. We improve their upper bound by showing that $$\operatorname{diam}(\mathbf{G}_n) = \big(1 + o(1)\big) \frac{n}{\log_2 n}$$ with high probability.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimal Control Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02027v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic optimal control, which has the goal of driving the behavior of noisy systems, is broadly applicable in science, engineering and artificial intelligence. Our work introduces Stochastic Optimal Control Matching (SOCM), a novel Iterative Diffusion Optimization (IDO) technique for stochastic optimal control that stems from the same philosophy as the conditional score matching loss for diffusion models. That is, the control is learned via a least squares problem by trying to fit a matching vector field. The training loss, which is closely connected to the cross-entropy loss, is optimized with respect to both the control function and a family of reparameterization matrices which appear in the matching vector field. The optimization with respect to the reparameterization matrices aims at minimizing the variance of the matching vector field. Experimentally, our algorithm achieves lower error than all the existing IDO techniques for stochastic optimal control for three out of four control problems, in some cases by an order of magnitude. The key idea underlying SOCM is the path-wise reparameterization trick, a novel technique that may be of independent interest. Code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/SOC-matching</description>

      <title>Spatial Form Factor for Point Patterns: Homogeneous Poisson Point Process and Coulomb Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a spatial form factor (SFF) for the characterization of spatial patterns associated with point processes. Specifically, the SFF is defined in terms of the averaged even Fourier transform of the distance between any pair of points. We focus on homogeneous Poisson point processes and derive the explicit expression for the SFF in $d$-spatial dimensions. The SFF can then be found in terms of the even Fourier transform of the probability distribution for the distance between two independent and uniformly distributed random points on a $d$-dimensional ball, arising in the ball line picking problem. The relation between the SFF and the set of $n$-order spacing distributions is further established. The SFF is analyzed in detail for $d=1,2,3$ and in the infinite-dimensional case, as well as for the $d$-dimensional Coulomb gas, as an interacting point process. We also introduce a generalization of the SFF applicable to arbitrary sets in a metric space.</description>
