      <title>Tree rearrangement graphs admit paths of decreasing Robinson-Foulds distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree rearrangements such as Nearest Neighbor Interchange (NNI) and Subtree Prune and Regraft (SPR) are commonly used to explore phylogenetic treespace. Computing distances based on them, however, is often intractable, so the efficiently computable Robinson-Foulds (RF) distance is used in practice. We investigate how the RF distance behaves along paths in the NNI and SPR graphs, where trees are nodes, edges represent single rearrangements. We show that any two trees are connected by a path along which the RF distance to the target decreases monotonically in the NNI graph and strictly in the SPR graph; we also exhibit trees for which no strictly decreasing NNI path exists.</description>

      <title>Phylogenetics in a warm place: computational aspects of the Tropical Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees provide a fundamental representation of evolutionary relationships, yet the combinatorial explosion of possible tree topologies renders inference computationally challenging. Classical approaches to characterizing tree space, such as the Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann (BHV) space, offer elegant geometric structure but suffer from statistical and computational limitations. An alternative perspective arises from tropical geometry, the tropical Grassmannian tropGr(2,n), introduced by Speyer and Sturmfels, which coincides with phylogenetic tree space. In this paper, we review the structure of the tropical Grassmannian and present algorithmic methods for its computational study, including procedures for sampling from the tropical Grassmannian. Our aim is to make these concepts accessible to evolutionary biologists and computational scientists, and to motivate new research directions at the interface of algebraic geometry and phylogenetic inference.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous fragmentation of empty sites promotes cooperation in phenotypically diverse populations with tag-mediated interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Habitat loss and fragmentation have often been viewed as major threats to species interaction and global biodiversity conservation. However, habitat degradation can also give rise to positive ecological and behavioral responses, challenging the notion that its consequences are entirely detrimental. While controlling for the degree of total habitat loss, we studied the influence of habitat fragmentation and phenotypic diversity on the evolution of tag-based cooperation in structured populations with multiple strategies. We developed a spatially explicit agent-based model with empty sites in which phenotypically diverse artificial decision makers engaged into pairwise Snowdrift-game interactions and imitated strategies of their opponent co-players. We systematically varied the number of phenotypic features in the population, the clustering degree of empty sites unsuitable for habitation, as well as the cost-to-benefit ratio $r$, and we measured the resulting equilibrium densities of conditional and unconditional strategies. Our Monte Carlo simulations revealed a complex interplay between the three investigated factors, such that higher phenotypic diversity in combination with lower $r$ and low to intermediate clustering degrees of empty sites markedly suppressed ethnocentric cooperation but simultaneously boosted unconditional, pure altruism. This dominance of unconditional cooperation was remarkably robust to variation in the initial conditions, suggesting that heterogeneous fragmentation of empty sites in moderately degraded habitats can function as a potent cooperation-promoting mechanism even in the presence of initially more favorable strategies. Our study showcases anti-fragility of cooperators in spatially fragmented but phenotypically diverse populations, as they were also able to benefit from harsh environmental conditions emerging in sparsely connected habitat remnants.</description>

      <title>Exact inference via quasi-conjugacy in two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet hidden Markov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nonparametric model for time-evolving, unobserved probability distributions from discrete-time data consisting of unlabelled partitions. The latent process is a two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion, and observations arise via exchangeable sampling. Applications include social and genetic data where only aggregate clustering summaries are observed. To address the intractable likelihood, we develop a tractable inferential framework that avoids label enumeration and direct simulation of the latent state. We exploit a duality between the diffusion and a pure-death process on partitions, together with coagulation operators that encode the effect of new data. These yield closed-form, recursive updates for forward and backward inference. We compute exact posterior distributions of the latent state at arbitrary times and predictive distributions of future or interpolated partitions. This enables online and offline inference and forecasting with full uncertainty quantification, bypassing MCMC and sequential Monte Carlo. Compared to particle filtering, our method achieves higher accuracy, lower variance, and substantial computational gains. We illustrate the methodology with synthetic experiments and a social network application, recovering interpretable patterns in time-varying heterozygosity.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Weighted Contact Networks: Spectral Reduction and Global Stability in a Markovian SIR Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new network-based SIR epidemic model in which transmission is modulated by a curvature-weighted contact matrix that encodes structural and geometric features of the underlying graph. The formulation encompasses both adjacency-driven and Markovian mixing, allowing heterogeneous interactions to be shaped by curvature-sensitive topological properties. We prove that the basic reproduction number satisfies \[ R_0=\frac{\beta}{\gamma}\lambda_{\max}(M), \] where $M$ is the curvature-weighted transmission operator. Using Perron--Frobenius theory together with linear and nonlinear Lyapunov functionals, we establish: (i) global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium when $R_0&lt;1$, and (ii) existence and global asymptotic stability of a unique endemic equilibrium when $R_0&gt;1$. Our results show that curvature acts as a geometric regularizer of connectivity, lowering spectral radii, raising effective epidemic thresholds, and organizing the long-term dynamics through monotone contraction toward the endemic state. This framework generalizes classical network epidemiology by integrating geometric information directly into transmission operators, providing a rigorous foundation for epidemic dynamics on structurally heterogeneous networks.</description>
