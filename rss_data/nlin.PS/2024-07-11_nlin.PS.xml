      <title>On examining the predictive capabilities of two variants of PINN in validating localised wave solutions in the generalized nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel neural network structure called Strongly Constrained Theory-Guided Neural Network (SCTgNN), to investigate the behaviours of the localized solutions of the generalized nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation. This equation comprises four physically significant nonlinear evolution equations, namely, (i) NLS equation, Hirota equation Lakshmanan-Porsezian-Daniel (LPD) equation and fifth-order NLS equation. The generalized NLS equation demonstrates nonlinear effects up to quintic order, indicating rich and complex dynamics in various fields of physics. By combining concepts from the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and Theory-Guided Neural Network (TgNN) models, SCTgNN aims to enhance our understanding of complex phenomena, particularly within nonlinear systems that defy conventional patterns. To begin, we employ the TgNN method to predict the behaviours of localized waves, including solitons, rogue waves, and breathers, within the generalized NLS equation. We then use SCTgNN to predict the aforementioned localized solutions and calculate the mean square errors in both SCTgNN and TgNN in predicting these three localized solutions. Our findings reveal that both models excel in understanding complex behaviours and provide predictions across a wide variety of situations.</description>

      <title>Turing patterns on discrete topologies: from networks to higher-order structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nature is a blossoming of regular structures, signature of self-organization of the underlying microscopic interacting agents. Turing theory of pattern formation is one of the most studied mechanisms to address such phenomena and has been applied to a widespread gallery of disciplines. Turing himself used a spatial discretization of the hosting support to eventually deal with a set of ODEs. Such an idea contained the seeds of the theory on discrete support, which has been fully acknowledged with the birth of network science in the early 2000s. This approach allows us to tackle several settings not displaying a trivial continuous embedding, such as multiplex, temporal networks, and, recently, higher-order structures. This line of research has been mostly confined within the network science community, despite its inherent potential to transcend the conventional boundaries of the PDE-based approach to Turing patterns. Moreover, network topology allows for novel dynamics to be generated via a universal formalism that can be readily extended to account for higher-order structures. The interplay between continuous and discrete settings can pave the way for further developments in the field.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of quasi-one-dimensional quantum droplets in Bose-Bose mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of quasi-one-dimensional quantum droplets of Bose-Einstein condensates are investigated analytically and numerically, taking into account the contribution of quantum fluctuations. Through the development of a variational approach employing the super-Gaussian function, we identify stationary parameters for the quantum droplets. The frequency of breathing mode oscillations in these quantum droplets is estimated. Moreover, the study reveals that periodic modulation in time of the atomic scattering length induces resonance oscillations in quantum droplet parameters or the emission of linear waves, contingent on the amplitude of the external modulation. A similar analysis is conducted for the Lee-Huang-Yang fluid, confined in a parabolic potential. Theoretical predictions are corroborated through direct numerical simulations of the governing extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Additionally, we study the collision dynamics of quasi-one-dimensional quantum droplets.</description>

      <title>An epidemical model with nonlocal spatial infections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SIR model is one of the most prototypical compartmental models in epidemiology. Generalizing this ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework into a spatially distributed partial differential equation (PDE) model is a considerable challenge. In the present work, we extend a recently proposed model based on nearest-neighbor spatial interactions by one of the authors in~\cite{vaziry2022modelling} towards a nonlocal, nonlinear PDE variant of the SIR prototype. We then seek to develop a set of tools that provide insights for this PDE framework. Stationary states and their stability analysis offer a perspective on the early spatial growth of the infection. Evolutionary computational dynamics enable visualization of the spatio-temporal progression of infection and recovery, allowing for an appreciation of the effect of varying parameters of the nonlocal kernel, such as, e.g., its width parameter. These features are explored in both one- and two-dimensional settings. At a model-reduction level, we develop a sequence of interpretable moment-based diagnostics to observe how these reflect the total number of infections, the epidemic's epicenter, and its spread. Finally, we propose a data-driven methodology based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to identify approximate closed-form dynamical equations for such quantities. These approaches may pave the way for further spatio-temporal studies, enabling the quantification of epidemics.</description>

      <title>A review on the Vortex and Coherent Structures in Dusty Plasma Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dusty plasma is an admixture of electrons, ions, and massive charged solid particles of sub-micron to micron-sized in the background of neutral gas. The dust grain medium exhibits fluid (liquid) as well as solid-like characteristics at different background plasma conditions. It supports various linear and non-linear dynamical structures because of the external perturbation and internal instabilities. The vortical or coherent structure in the dusty plasma medium is a kind of self-sustained dynamical structure that is formed either by instabilities or external forcing. In this review article, the author discusses the past theoretical, experimental, and computational investigations on vortical and coherent structures in unmagnetized as well as in magnetized dusty plasma. The possible mechanisms to form vortices in dust grain medium are discussed in detail. The studies on the evolution of vortices and their correlation with turbulence are also reviewed.</description>
