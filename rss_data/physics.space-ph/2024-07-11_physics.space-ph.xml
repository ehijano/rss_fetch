      <title>Improving the Automated Coronal Jet Identification with U-NET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal jets are one of the most common eruptive activities in the solar atmosphere. They are related to rich physics processes, including but not limited to magnetic reconnection, flaring, instabilities, and plasma heating. Automated identification of off-limb coronal jets has been difficult due to their abundant nature, complex appearance, and relatively small size compared to other features in the corona. In this paper, we present an automated coronal jet identification algorithm (AJIA) that utilizes true and fake jets previously detected by a laborious semi-automated jet detection algorithm (SAJIA, Liu et al. 2023) as the input of an image segmentation neural network U-NET. It is found that AJIA could achieve a much higher (0.81) detecting precision than SAJIA (0.34), meanwhile giving the possibility of whether each pixel in an input image belongs to a jet. We demonstrate that with the aid of artificial neural networks, AJIA could enable fast, accurate, and real-time coronal jet identification from SDO/AIA 304 \AA observations, which are essential in studying the collective and long-term behavior of coronal jets and their relation with the solar activity cycles.</description>

      <title>Observing Solar Coronal Mass Ejections from Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution to the panel discussion of the IAU Symposium 388 "Solar and Stellar Coronal Mass Ejections", I concentrate on white-light observations of solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from space and specifically address the following aspects: i) history of observations, ii) available catalogs of CMEs, iii) achievements of space observations of CMEs, iv) future of CME observation, and v) challenges and future directions.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Solitary Electrostatic Structures in Collisionless Plasma: Phase-Space Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of isolated plasma potential structures sustained by a deficit of phase-space density on trapped orbits, commonly known as electron or ion holes, is reviewed. The principles of their equilibria are explained and illustrated, and contrasted with solitons. A literature review mostly prior to 2016 highlights the key historical developments of the field. Progress since, especially in hole acceleration, stability, and multi-dimensional effects, is summarized in more detail.</description>

      <title>Role of FLR effects in magnetopause equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Earth magnetopause, when sufficiently plane and stationary at a local scale, can be considered as a "quasi-tangential" discontinuity, since the normal component of the magnetic field Bn is typically very small but not zero. Contrary to observations, the "Classic Theory of Discontinuities" (CTD) predicts that rotational and compressional jumps should be mutually exclusive in the general case Bn n.e.t. 0, but allows only one exception: the tangential discontinuity provided that Bn is strictly zero. Here we show that Finite Larmor Radius (FLR) effects play an important role in the quasi-tangential case, whenever the ion Larmor radius is not fully negligible with respect to the magnetopause thickness. By including FLR effects, the results suggest that a rotational discontinuity undergoes a change comparable to the change of a Shear Alfven into a Kinetic Alfven wave when considering linear modes. For this new kind of discontinuity, the co-existence of rotational and compressional variations at the magnetopause does no more imply that this boundary is a strict tangential discontinuity, even in 1D-like regions far from X-lines if any. This result may lead to important consequences concerning the oldest and most basic questions of magnetospheric physics: how can the magnetopause be open, where and when? The role of FLR being established theoretically, the paper then shows that it can be proved experimentally. We make use of MMS data and process them with the most recent available 4 spacecraft tools. First, we present the different processing techniques that we use to estimate spatial derivatives, such as grad(B) and div(P), and the magnetopause normal direction. We point out why this normal direction must be determined with extremely high accuracy to make the conclusions unambiguous. The results obtained by these techniques are presented in a detailed case study and on a statistical basis.</description>
