      <title>Polynomials of small slice rank and strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates defining equations for secant varieties of the variety of reducible polynomials, which geometrically encode the notions of strength and slice rank of homogeneous polynomials. We present three main results. First, we reinterpret Ruppert's classical equations for reducible ternary forms in the language of representation theory and we extend them to an arbitrary number of variables. Second, we construct new determinantal equations for polynomials of small strength based on syzygies of their partial derivatives. Finally, we establish a reduction theorem for cubic forms, proving that slice rank two is determined by generic linear sections in $14$ variables; this gives one of the few explicit upper bounds for defining equations for the image of a polynomial map in the framework of noetherianity for polynomial functors.</description>

      <title>Balloon Animal Maps with Applications to the Cohomology of Hypertoric Hitchin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we introduce the notion of a balloon animal map between broken toric varieties and construct several long exact sequences in cohomology related to them. We give a new proof of the deletion-contraction relation on hypertoric Hitchin systems of Dansco-Mcbreen-Shende and present some refinements of it. The end result is a formula for the Poincar\'e polynomial of any hypertoric Hitchin system associated to a graph with first Betti number 2 along with a recipe to calculate the Poincar\'e polynomial of any hypertoric Hitchin system, given knowledge of a finite number of base cases.</description>

      <title>Torsor Neron models of hyperkahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact hyperkahler manifold equipped with a Lagrangian fibration $\pi:\; M \to X$, and $M'$ the smooth locus of $\pi$. We prove that over a complement to a codimension $\geq 2$ subset in $X$, the projection $\pi:\; M' \to X$ has a natural structure of a torsor over an abelian group bundle, which can be understood as a complex analytic variant of the N\'eron model construction. This gives an independent proof of a result by Y.-J. Kim.</description>

      <title>Augmentations, reduced ideal point gluings and compact type degenerations of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we demonstrate some unexpected properties that simple gluings of the simplest derived categories may have. We consider two special cases: the first is an augmented curve, i.e., the gluing of the derived categories of a point and a curve with the gluing bimodule given by the structure sheaf of the curve; the second is an ideal point gluing of curves, i.e., the gluing of the derived categories of two curves with the gluing bimodule given by the ideal sheaf of a point in the product of the curves. We construct unexpected exceptional objects contained in these categories and discuss their orthogonal complements.
  We also show that the simplest example of compact type degeneration of curves, a flat family of curves with a smooth general fiber and a 1-nodal reducible central fiber, gives rise to a smooth and proper family of triangulated categories with the general fiber an augmented curve and the central fiber the orthogonal complement of the exotic exceptional object in the ideal point gluing of curves, called the reduced ideal point gluing of curves.</description>

      <title>Self-intersection of the Torelli map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Torelli map $t\colon \mathcal{M}^{ct}_g \to \mathcal{A}_g$ is far from an immersion for $g\geq 3$: the self-fiber product of the Torelli map for $g\geq 3$ has several components with nontrivial intersections. We give a stratification of the self-fiber product for arbitrary genus and describe how components in the fiber product intersect. In genus $4$, the Torelli fiber product is nonreduced, which we prove by analyzing the expansion of the period map near a nodal curve. We use the geometry of the Torelli fiber product to: Calculate the class of the pullback to $\mathcal{M}^{ct}_4$ of the Torelli cycle $t_*[\mathcal{M}^{ct}_4]$ on $\mathcal{A}_4$; Find the class $t_*[\overline{\mathcal{M}}_4]$ for suitable toroidal compactifications $\overline{\mathcal{A}}_4$; Calculate the class $t^*t_*[\mathcal{M}^{ct}_5]|_{\mathcal{M}_5}$. In the first appendix, we write down a calculation for finding the Chern classes of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$. In the second, we give a formula for a coefficient occurring in an intersection of excess dimension.</description>

      <title>Frobenius manifold for the nodal quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the Weierstrass elliptic function, we study the associated Frobenius structure, incorporating the perspective of derived categories, particularly that of homological mirror symmetry. Given a deformation of the Weierstrass elliptic function, we construct a primitive form normalized to be compatible with the period map for integral cycles, and obtain a Frobenius structure whose Frobenius potential is defined over the rational numbers. We also construct a Frobenius structure using elliptic Weyl group invariants (as opposed to Jacobi group invariants), and establish an isomorphism between these two Frobenius structures. We further examine the relationship between the degree of the Lyashko--Looijenga map modulo the modular group and the number of full exceptional collections up to the braid group action and translations, as well as the associated Gamma-integral structure.</description>

      <title>Signature 0 toric varieties, wall crossings, and cross polytope-like structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the structure of simplicial locally convex fans associated to even-dimensional complete toric varieties with signature 0. They belong to the set of such toric varieties whose even degree Betti numbers yield a gamma vector equal to 0. The gamma vector is an invariant of palindromic polynomials whose nonnegativity lies between unimodality and real-rootedness. It is expected that the cases where the gamma vector is 0 form ``building blocks'' among those where it is nonnegative. This means minimality with respect to a certain restricted class of blowups. However, this equality to 0 case is currently poorly understood.
  For such toric varieties, we address this situation using wall crossings. The links of the fan come from a repeated suspension of the maximal linear subspace in its realization in the ambient space of the fan. Conversely, the centers of these links containing any particular line form a cone or a repeated suspension of one. The intersection patterns between these ``anchoring'' linear subspaces come from how far certain submodularity inequalities are from equality and parity conditions on their dimensions. This involves linear dependence and containment relations between them. We obtain these relations by viewing the vanishing of certain mixed volumes from the perspective of the exponents. Finally, these wall crossings yield a simple method of generating induced 4-cycles expected to cover the minimal objects described above.</description>

      <title>Universal Gr\"obner Bases of (Universal) Multiview Ideals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiview ideals arise from the geometry of image formation in pinhole cameras, and universal multiview ideals are their analogs for unknown cameras. We prove that a natural collection of polynomials form a universal Gr\"obner basis for both types of ideals using a criterion introduced by Huang and Larson, and include a proof of their criterion in our setting. Symmetry reduction and induction enable the method to be deployed on an infinite family of ideals. We also give an explicit description of the matroids on which the methodology depends, in the context of multiview ideals.</description>

Abstract: In the 1950s and 1960s Tate proved some duality theorems in the Galois cohomology of finite modules and abelian varieties. As for most of Tate's work this has had a profound influence on mathematics with many applications and further developments. In this article, I discuss Tate's theorems and some of these developments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13073v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of dualizing complexes and balanced dualizing complexes over $\mathbb{Z}$-algebras. We prove that a noetherian connected $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra $A$ admits a balanced dualizing complex if and only if $A$ satisfies Artin-Zhang's $\chi$-condition, has finite local cohomology dimension, and possesses symmetric derived torsion as a bigraded $A$-$A$-bimodule. As an application of our study of dualizing complexes, we show that any smooth noncommutative projective scheme associated to a $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra with a balanced dualizing complex admits a Serre functor.</description>

Abstract: We characterize the integral Hasse principle for an infinite family of spherical stacky curves with genus $g\in [2/3,1)$ that are defined using generalized Fermat equations, extending a result of Darmon and Granville. We then apply our methods to find that a positive proportion of curves in our family satisfy the integral Hasse principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.01564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this revised version (August 2025), we add a survey of \infty-categorical (co)limits and a replacement lemma for higher functoriality (Lem. 1.4.5), a framework for explicit models of punctured tubular neighborhoods ({\S}3.4), and a new theory of orientation classes for line bundles and Thom spaces of virtual bundles over singular curves ({\S}5.1, 5.2). Building on this, we make explicit the normalization of the resulting isomorphisms, reformulate our main theorem (Th. 5.3.3) to incorporate orientation classes, and show how these choices yield quadratic Mumford matrices computed via Smith form over the Grothendieck-Witt ring of the base field. The appendices are expanded to give a better account of the notion of orientation classes, and to describe trace computations on Chow-Witt groups over possibly non-perfect fields. We warmly thank the referee for insightful comments that motivated us to make our approach much more precise and comprehensive.</description>

Abstract: We prove a rigidity theorem for morphisms from products of open subschemes of the projective line into solvable groups not containing a copy of $\Ga$ (for example, wound unipotent groups). As a consequence, we deduce several structural results about unirational group schemes, including that unirationality for group schemes descends through separable extensions. We also apply the main result to prove that permawound unipotent groups are unirational and -- when wound -- commutative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13661v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a form of d\'{e}vissage for generation in derived categories of Noetherian schemes. First, we extend a result of Takahashi from the affine context to the global setting, showing that the bounded derived category is classically generated by a perfect complex together with structure sheaves of closed subschemes supported on the singular locus. Second, we make an observation for how generation behaves under the derived pushforward of a proper surjective morphism between Noetherian schemes. These results enable us to explicitly identify strong generators for projective schemes with isolated singularities and for singular varieties over a perfect field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define special objects, Ulrich objects, on a derived category of polarized smooth projective variety as a generalization of Ulrich bundles to the derived category. These are defined by the cohomological conditions that are the same form as a cohomological criterion determining Ulrichness for sheaves. This paper gives a characterization of the Ulrich object similar to the one in [ES03]. As an application, we have provided a new approach to the Eisenbud-Schreyer question by using the notions of the generator of the derived category. We also have given an example of Ulrich objects that are not sheaf by Yoneda extensions.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a mixed characteristic analog of log canonical centers in characteristic $0$ and centers of $F$-purity in positive characteristic, which we call centers of perfectoid purity. We show that their existence detects (the failure of) normality of the ring. We also show the existence of a special center of perfectoid purity that detects the perfectoid purity of $R$, analogously to the splitting prime of Aberbach and Enescu, and investigate its behavior under \'etale morphisms.</description>

      <title>Complete quasimaps to $\mathsf{Bl}_{\mathbb{P}^s}(\mathbb{P}^r)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a moduli space of ``complete quasimaps'' to $\mathsf{Bl}_{\mathbb{P}^s}(\mathbb{P}^r)$. The construction, following previous work for curves on projective spaces, essentially proceeds by blowing up Ciocan-Fontanine--Kim's space of quasimaps at loci where sections of line bundles are linearly dependent. We conjecture that tautological intersection numbers on these moduli spaces give enumerative counts of curves of fixed complex structure on $X$ subject to general incidence conditions, in contrast with traditional compactifications of the moduli spaces of maps. A result of Farkas guarantees that these spaces are pure of expected dimension. The conjecture is proven in dimension 2, where the main input is a Brill-Noether theorem for general curves on toric surfaces.</description>

      <title>Equivariant automorphism group and real forms of complexity-one varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group over a perfect field. We study the representability of the equivariant automorphism group of G-varieties. For a broad class of complexity-one G-varieties, we show that this group is representable by a group scheme locally of finite type when the base field has characteristic zero. We also establish representability by a linear algebraic group in the case of almost homogeneous G-varieties of arbitrary complexity. Finally, using an exact sequence description of the equivariant automorphism group, we deduce that complexity-one G-varieties with representable equivariant automorphism group admit only finitely many real forms.</description>

      <title>The role of primes of good reduction in the Brauer--Manin obstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the role of primes of good reduction in the existence of the Brauer--Manin obstruction to weak approximation for varieties defined over number fields. Following Bright and Newton, we give some necessaries conditions on the ramification index that the prime ideal of the number field should satisfy in order to be involved in the Brauer--Manin obstruction to weak approximation. To support the results, many examples of transcendental Brauer--Manin obstruction to weak approximation on K3 surfaces are given.</description>
