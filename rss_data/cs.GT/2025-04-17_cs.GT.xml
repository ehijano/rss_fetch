      <title>Enhancing Decentralization in Blockchain Decision-Making Through Quadratic Voting and Its Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the application of Quadratic Voting (QV) and its generalization to improve decentralization and effectiveness in blockchain governance systems. The conducted research identified three main types of quadratic (square root) voting. Two of them pertain to voting with a split stake, and one involves voting without splitting. In split stakes, Type 1 QV applies the square root to the total stake before distributing it among preferences, while Type 2 QV distributes the stake first and then applies the square root. In unsplit stakes (Type 3 QV), the square root of the total stake is allocated entirely to each preference. The presented formal proofs confirm that Types 2 and 3 QV, along with generalized models, enhance decentralization as measured by the Gini and Nakamoto coefficients. A pivotal discovery is the existence of a threshold stakeholder whose relative voting ratio increases under QV compared to linear voting, while smaller stakeholders also gain influence. The generalized QV model allows flexible adjustment of this threshold, enabling tailored decentralization levels. Maintaining fairness, QV ensures that stakeholders with higher stakes retain a proportionally greater voting ratio while redistributing influence to prevent excessive concentration. It is shown that to preserve fairness and robustness, QV must be implemented alongside privacy-preserving cryptographic voting protocols, as voters casting their ballots last could otherwise manipulate outcomes. The generalized QV model, proposed in this paper, enables algorithmic parametrization to achieve desired levels of decentralization for specific use cases. This flexibility makes it applicable across diverse domains, including user interaction with cryptocurrency platforms, facilitating community events and educational initiatives, and supporting charitable activities through decentralized decision-making.</description>

      <title>Attack-Defense Trees with Offensive and Defensive Attributes (with Appendix)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective risk management in cybersecurity requires a thorough understanding of the interplay between attacker capabilities and defense strategies. Attack-Defense Trees (ADTs) are a commonly used methodology for representing this interplay; however, previous work in this domain has only focused on analyzing metrics such as cost, damage, or time from the perspective of the attacker. This approach provides an incomplete view of the system, as it neglects to model defender attributes: in real-world scenarios, defenders have finite resources for countermeasures and are similarly constrained. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that incorporates defense metrics into ADTs, and we present efficient algorithms for computing the Pareto front between defense and attack metrics. Our methods encode both attacker and defender metrics as semirings, allowing our methods to be used for many metrics such as cost, damage, and skill. We analyze tree-structured ADTs using a bottom-up approach and general ADTs by translating them into binary decision diagrams. Experiments on randomly generated ADTS demonstrate that both approaches effectively handle ADTs with several hundred nodes.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Contextual Market Equilibrium Computation through Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Market equilibrium is one of the most fundamental solution concepts in economics and social optimization analysis. Existing works on market equilibrium computation primarily focus on settings with relatively few buyers. Motivated by this, our paper investigates the computation of market equilibrium in scenarios with a large-scale buyer population, where buyers and goods are represented by their contexts. Building on this realistic and generalized contextual market model, we introduce MarketFCNet, a deep learning-based method for approximating market equilibrium. We start by parameterizing the allocation of each good to each buyer using a neural network, which depends solely on the context of the buyer and the good. Next, we propose an efficient method to unbiasedly estimate the loss function of the training algorithm, enabling us to optimize the network parameters through gradient. To evaluate the approximated solution, we propose a metric called Nash Gap, which quantifies the deviation of the given allocation and price pair from the market equilibrium. Experimental results indicate that MarketFCNet delivers competitive performance and significantly lower running times compared to existing methods as the market scale expands, demonstrating the potential of deep learning-based methods to accelerate the approximation of large-scale contextual market equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Nash equilibria in scalar discrete-time linear quadratic games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An open problem in linear quadratic (LQ) games has been characterizing the Nash equilibria. This problem has renewed relevance given the surge of work on understanding the convergence of learning algorithms in dynamic games. This paper investigates scalar discrete-time infinite-horizon LQ games with two agents. Even in this arguably simple setting, there are no results for finding $\textit{all}$ Nash equilibria. By analyzing the best response map, we formulate a polynomial system of equations characterizing the linear feedback Nash equilibria. This enables us to bring in tools from algebraic geometry, particularly the Gr\"obner basis, to study the roots of this polynomial system. Consequently, we can not only compute all Nash equilibria numerically, but we can also characterize their number with explicit conditions. For instance, we prove that the LQ games under consideration admit at most three Nash equilibria. We further provide sufficient conditions for the existence of at most two Nash equilibria and sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the tightness of our bounds and showcase the increased complexity in settings with more than two agents.</description>

      <title>Elastic Restaking Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many blockchain-based decentralized services require their validators (operators) to deposit stake (collateral), which is forfeited (slashed) if they misbehave. Restaking networks let validators secure multiple services by reusing stake. These networks have quickly gained traction, leveraging over~\$20 billion in stake. However, restaking introduces a new attack vector where validators can coordinate to misbehave across multiple services simultaneously, extracting digital assets while forfeiting their stake only once.
  Previous work focused either on preventing coordinated misbehavior or on protecting services if all other services are Byzantine and might unjustly cause slashing due to bugs or malice. The first model overlooks how a single Byzantine service can collapse the network, while the second ignores shared-stake benefits.
  To bridge the gap, we analyze the system as a strategic game of coordinated misbehavior, when a given fraction of the services are Byzantine. We introduce elastic restaking networks, where validators can allocate portions of their stake that may cumulatively exceed their total stake, and when allocations are lost, the remaining stake stretches to cover remaining allocations. We show that elastic networks exhibit superior robustness compared to previous approaches, and demonstrate a synergistic effect where an elastic restaking network enhances its blockchain's security, contrary to community concerns of an opposite effect in existing networks. We then design incentives for tuning validators' allocations.
  Our elastic restaking system and incentive design have immediate practical implications for deployed restaking networks.</description>

      <title>On the completeness of several fortification-interdiction games in the Polynomial Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fortification-interdiction games are tri-level adversarial games where two opponents act in succession to protect, disrupt and simply use an infrastructure for a specific purpose. Many such games have been formulated and tackled in the literature through specific algorithmic methods, however very few investigations exist on the completeness of such fortification problems in order to locate them rigorously in the polynomial hierarchy. We clarify the completeness status of several well-known fortification problems, such as the Tri-level Interdiction Knapsack Problem with unit fortification and attack weights, the Max-flow Interdiction Problem and Shortest Path Interdiction Problem with Fortification, the Multi-level Critical Node Problem with unit weights, as well as a well-studied electric grid defence planning problem. For all of these problems, we prove their completeness either for the $\Sigma^p_2$ or the $\Sigma^p_3$ class of the polynomial hierarchy. We also prove that the Multi-level Fortification-Interdiction Knapsack Problem with an arbitrary number of protection and interdiction rounds and unit fortification and attack weights is complete for any level of the polynomial hierarchy, therefore providing a useful basis for further attempts at proving the completeness of protection-interdiction games at any level of said hierarchy.</description>
