      <title>Revisiting the Nandakumar-Ramana Rao Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reprove the generalized Nandakumar-Ramana Rao conjecture for the prime case using representation ring-graded Bredon cohomology. Our approach relies solely on the $RO(C_p)$-graded cohomology of configuration spaces, viewed as a module over the $RO(C_p)$-graded Bredon cohomology of a point.</description>

      <title>How to Build Anomalous (3+1)d Topological Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for constructing (3+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) that realize specified anomalies of finite symmetries, as encountered in gauge theories with fermions or fermionic lattice systems. Our approach generalizes the Wang-Wen-Witten symmetry-extension construction to the fermionic setting, building on two recent advances in the study of fermionic TQFTs and related homotopy theory. The first is the categorical classification of anomalous TQFTs in (3+1)d. The second, which we develop further in a planned sequel to this paper, is a hastened Adams spectral sequence for computing supercohomology groups, closely paralleling techniques from cobordism theory. By integrating supercohomology and cobordism methods within the recently developed categorical framework of fusion 2-categories, we provide a concrete and systematic route to constructing fermionic TQFTs with specified anomalies, thereby establishing a conceptual bridge between anomaly realization, cobordism, and higher-categorical structures.</description>

      <title>Intermediate subgroups of braid groups are not bi-orderable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be the disk or a compact, connected surface without boundary different from the sphere $S^2$ and the real projective plane $\mathbb{R}P^2$, and let $N$ be a compact, connected surface (possibly with boundary). It is known that the pure braid groups $P_n(M)$ of $M$ are bi-orderable, and, for $n\geq 3$, that the full braid groups $B_n(M)$ of $M$ are not bi-orderable. The main purpose of this article is to show that for all $n \geq 3$, any subgroup $H$ of $B_n(N)$ that satisfies $P_n(N) \subsetneq H \subset B_n(N)$ is not bi-orderable.</description>

      <title>The Singularity Theory of Concurrent Programs: A Topological Characterization and Detection of Deadlocks and Livelocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel paradigm for the analysis and verification of concurrent programs -- the Singularity Theory. We model the execution space of a concurrent program as a branched topological space, where program states are points and state transitions are paths. Within this framework, we characterize deadlocks as attractors and livelocks as non-contractible loops in the execution space. By employing tools from algebraic topology, particularly homotopy and homology groups, we define a series of concurrent topological invariants to systematically detect and classify these concurrent "singularities" without exhaustively traversing all states. This work aims to establish a geometric and topological foundation for concurrent program verification, transcending the limitations of traditional model checking.</description>

      <title>Topological index formula in physical waves: spectral flow, Chern index and topological contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a family of pseudodifferential operators (quantum Hamiltonians) on $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n};\mathbb{C}^{d})$ whose spectrum exhibits two energy bands exchanging a finite number of eigenvalues. We show that this number coincides with the Chern index of a vector bundle associated to the principal symbol (the classical Hamiltonian). This result provides a simple yet illustrative instance of the Atiyah Singer index formula, with applications in areas such as molecular physics, plasma physics or geophysics. We also discuss the phenomenon of topological contact without exchange between energy bands, a feature that cannot be detected by the Chern index or K theory, but rather reflects subtle torsion effects in the homotopy groups of spheres.</description>

      <title>Apocalypsis and Apocalyptic Events: The Morphogenetic Ontology of Synchronized Catastrophes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25431v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I formalize the ontology of apocalyptic events as synchronized morphogenetic manifolds within the framework of Thom's catastrophe theory. Local catastrophes (folds, cusps, umbilici) are extended to higher-order systemic collapses through the synchronization of multiple morphogenetic manifolds. The resulting construct is the Apocalypsis: a topological meta-singularity generated by the alignment of local singularities into a global structure of collapse. The mathematical formalization of Apocalyptic events and Apocalypsis integrates dynamical systems theory, topological stability, and probabilistic dependence structures using Archimedean copulas that capture nonlinear interrelations among coupled subsystems. The Inevitability Theorem demonstrates the existence, genericity, and almost-sure occurrence of Apocalypsis under stochastic coupling.</description>

      <title>Derived induction theory for the K-theory of modular group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an induction theorem for the higher algebraic K-groups of group algebras $kG$ of finite groups $G$ over characteristic $p$ finite fields $k$. For a certain class of finite groups, which we call $p$-isolated, this reduces calculations to calculations for their $p$-subgroups. We do so by showing that the stable module categories of $kH$ as $H$ ranges over subgroups of $G$ assemble into a categorical Green functor, which results in a spectral Green functor structure on K-theory. By general induction theory, this reduces proving a spectrum-level induction statement to proving an induction statement on $\pi_0$ Green functors, which we accomplish using modular representation theory. For $p$-isolated groups with Sylow $p$-subgroups of order $p$, we produce explicit new calculations of K-groups.</description>

      <title>Multi-parameter Module Approximation: an efficient and interpretable invariant for multi-parameter persistence modules with guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02026v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a new parameterized family of topological descriptors, taking the form of candidate decompositions, for multi-parameter persistence modules, and we identify a subfamily of these descriptors, that we call approximate decompositions, that are controllable approximations, in the sense that they preserve diagonal barcodes. Then, we introduce MMA (Multipersistence Module Approximation): an algorithm based on matching functions for computing instances of candidate decompositions with some precision parameter {\delta} &gt; 0. By design, MMA can handle an arbitrary number of filtrations, and has bounded complexity and running time. Moreover, we prove the robustess of MMA: when computed with so-called compatible matching functions, we show that MMA produces approximate decompositions (and we prove that such matching functions exist for n = 2 filtrations). Next, we restrict the focus on modules that can be decomposed into interval summands. In that case, compatible matching functions always exist, and we show that, for small enough {\delta}, the approximate decompositions obtained with such compatible matching functions by MMA have an approximation error (in terms of the standard interleaving and bottleneck distances) that is bounded by {\delta}, and that reaches zero for an even smaller, positive precision. Finally, we present empirical evidence validating that MMA has state-of-the-art performance and running time on several data sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the A(1)-homotopy of the topological cyclic homology of the connective real K-theory spectrum ko. The answer has an associated graded that is a free F_2[v_2^4]-module of rank 52, on explicit generators in stems -1 \le * \le 30. The calculation is achieved by using prismatic and syntomic cohomology of ko as introduced by Hahn-Raksit-Wilson, extending work of Bhatt-Morrow-Scholze from the case of classical commutative rings to E_\infty rings. A new feature in our case is that there are nonzero differentials in the motivic spectral sequence from syntomic cohomology to topological cyclic homology.</description>

      <title>An $\infty$-Category of 2-Segal Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algebra objects in $\infty$-categories of spans admit a description in terms of $2$-Segal objects. We introduce a notion of span between $2$-Segal objects and extend this correspondence to an equivalence of $\infty$-categories. Additionally, for every $\infty$-category with finite limits $\mathcal{C}$, we introduce a notion of a birelative $2$-Segal object in $\mathcal{C}$ and establish a similar equivalence with the $\infty$-category of bimodule objects in spans. Examples of these concepts arise from algebraic and hermitian K-theory through the corresponding Waldhausen $S_{\bullet}$-construction. Apart from their categorical relevance, these concepts can be used to construct homotopy coherent representations of Hall algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By the introduction of locally constant prefactorization algebras at a fixed scale, we show a mathematical incarnation of the fact that observables at a given scale of a topological field theory propagate to every scale over euclidean spaces. The key is that these prefactorization algebras over $\mathbb{R}^n$ are equivalent to algebras over the little $n$-disc operad. For topological field theories with defects, we get analogous results by replacing $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the spaces modelling corners $\mathbb{R}^p\times\mathbb{R}^{q}_{\geq 0}$. As a toy example in $1d$, we quantize, once more, constant Poisson structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16259v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the vanishing of bounded cohomology with separable dual coefficients for many groups of interest in geometry, dynamics, and algebra. These include compactly supported structure-preserving diffeomorphism groups of certain manifolds; the group of interval exchange transformations of the half line; piecewise linear and piecewise projective groups of the line, giving strong answers to questions of Calegari and Navas; direct limit linear groups of relevance in algebraic $K$-theory, thereby answering a question by Kastenholz and Sroka and a question of two of the authors and L{\"o}h; and certain subgroups of big mapping class groups, such as the stable braid group and the stable mapping class group, proving a conjecture of Bowden. Moreover, we prove that in the recently introduced framework of enumerated groups, the generic group has vanishing bounded cohomology with separable dual coefficients. At the heart of our approach is an elementary algebraic criterion called the commuting cyclic conjugates condition that is readily verifiable for the aforementioned large classes of groups.</description>

      <title>On modular invariants of the truncated polynomial ring in rank four</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11464v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the rank-4 case of the conjecture of Ha-Hai-Nghia for the invariant subspace of the truncated polynomial ring $\mathcal{Q}_m(n)=\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dots,x_n]/(x_1^{q^m},\dots,x_n^{q^m}),$ under a new, explicit technical hypothesis. Our argument extends the determinant calculus for the delta operator by deriving crucial rank-4 identities governing its interaction with the Dickson algebra. We show that the proof of the conjecture reduces to a specific vanishing property, for which we introduce a sufficient condition, the "matching hypothesis" ($\mathrm{H_{match}}$), relating the degree structures of Dickson invariants. This condition is justified by theoretical arguments and verified computationally in many cases. Combining this approach with the normalized derivation approach from our prior work, we establish the conjecture. As a result, the Lewis-Reiner-Stanton Conjecture is also confirmed for rank four under the given hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Comparison of motives with rational coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17194v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of rational motives admits several models, including those of Morel, Beilinson, Ayoub, and Voevodsky. An open question has been the equivalence of Voevodsky's Nisnevich-based $\mathrm{DM}(S, \mathbb{Q})$ with the others, which was only known over restricted base schemes.
  This paper resolves this question. We prove that all major variants of rational motives are equivalent over an arbitrary base scheme $S$, removing all previous restrictions.
  Our main technical result is a stable motivic equivalence between the free $\mathbb{Q}$-linear spectrum $\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb{S}]$ and the motivic rational Eilenberg MacLane spectrum $\mathbf{H}\mathbb{Q}$. This equivalence is established by reducing the problem to an unstable comparison of rationalized homotopy quotients and coarse symmetric powers, using a rational motivic Whitehead theorem we develop.
  As a byproduct, we confirm rational variant of Voevodsky's conjecture that the formation of $\mathbf{H}\mathbb{Q}$ is stable under arbitrary base change.</description>
