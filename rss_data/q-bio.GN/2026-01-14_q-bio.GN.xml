      <title>Engineering Spatial and Molecular Features from Cellular Niches to Inform Predictions of Inflammatory Bowel Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentiating between the two main subtypes of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): Crohns disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is a persistent clinical challenge due to overlapping presentations. This study introduces a novel computational framework that employs spatial transcriptomics (ST) to create an explainable machine learning model for IBD classification. We analyzed ST data from the colonic mucosa of healthy controls (HC), UC, and CD patients. Using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), we first identified four recurring cellular niches, representing distinct functional microenvironments within the tissue. From these niches, we systematically engineered 44 features capturing three key aspects of tissue pathology: niche composition, neighborhood enrichment, and niche-gene signals. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier trained on these features achieved an accuracy of $0.774 \pm 0.161$ for the more challenging three-class problem (HC, UC, and CD) and $0.916 \pm 0.118$ in the two-class problem of distinguishing IBD from healthy tissue. Crucially, model explainability analysis revealed that disruptions in the spatial organization of niches were the strongest predictors of general inflammation, while the classification between UC and CD relied on specific niche-gene expression signatures. This work provides a robust, proof-of-concept pipeline that transforms descriptive spatial data into an accurate and explainable predictive tool, offering not only a potential new diagnostic paradigm but also deeper insights into the distinct biological mechanisms that drive IBD subtypes.</description>

      <title>LCPan: efficient variation graph construction using Locally Consistent Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and consistent string processing is critical in the exponentially growing genomic data era. Locally Consistent Parsing (LCP) addresses this need by partitioning an input genome string into short, exactly matching substrings (e.g., "cores"), ensuring consistency across partitions. Labeling the cores of an input string consistently not only provides a compact representation of the input but also enables the reapplication of LCP to refine the cores over multiple iterations, providing a progressively longer and more informative set of substrings for downstream analyses.
  We present the first iterative implementation of LCP with Lcptools and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying cores with minimal collisions. Experimental results show that the number of cores at the i^th iteration is O(n/c^i) for c ~ 2.34, while the average length and the average distance between consecutive cores are O(c^i). Compared to the popular sketching techniques, LCP produces significantly fewer cores, enabling a more compact representation and faster analyses. To demonstrate the advantages of LCP in genomic string processing in terms of computation and memory efficiency, we also introduce LCPan, an efficient variation graph constructor. We show that LCPan generates variation graphs &gt;10x faster than vg, while using &gt;13x less memory.</description>
