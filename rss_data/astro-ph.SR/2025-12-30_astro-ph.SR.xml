      <title>On the origin of sinusoidal brightness variations in F to O-type stars through radial velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar variability may originate from various phenomena such as binarity, pulsations, or rotation. These mechanisms can induce flux variations of similar magnitudes, shapes, and periods. We aim to determine mechanisms responsible for the sinusoidal variations in main-sequence stars hotter than 6500 K. We conducted our analysis using TESS long-cadence data complemented with high-resolution spectra from three spectrographs. From the initial sample of almost 46000 objects, we selected 35 targets for spectroscopic follow-up. Comparison of light curves and radial velocity curves allowed for robust classification of these targets. Among the 35 selected objects, 18 displayed variability, suggesting the presence of a companion (including the discovery of 7 new binary systems and 1 candidate for a triple-star system), 1 was identified as a new pulsator, 9 as new candidates for spotted stars, and 7 objects had uncertain classification. Our analysis shows that at least half of randomly selected stars with sinusoidal brightness variations are binaries. The presented results illustrate the need for an individual approach to stellar classification, especially in cases where the photometric data alone is insufficient for determining the underlying phenomena behind the observed variations.</description>

      <title>Simulations of facular magnetic fields on cool stars I: Main sequence stars with solar metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar convection in the presence of magnetic field affects the emergent intensity, as well as the structure and evolution of cool main-sequence dwarfs. We aim to understand the effect of faculae-like field strengths on near-surface stellar convection using 3D radiative MHD simulations of near-surface magneto-convection. We compare simulations of F, G, K and M main-sequence stars with a small-scale dynamo (SSD) to faculae-like spatially averaged field strengths (from 100 to 500 G). We focus on the effect of imposed magnetic field on the thermodynamic stratification and velocities, along with the bolometric intensity and surface field strength. Imposed magnetic fields result in reduced average density and gas pressure near the surface compared to the SSD simulations. The temperature stratification also shows a dip at and just below the stellar surface. The changes in average bolometric intensity are within a percent, with different trends with field strength for different stellar types. In addition, the convective velocities are reduced. The magnitude of changes in thermodynamic quantities are related to field strength as well as the stellar $T_{\rm eff}$. Faculae-strength magnetic fields modify the near surface convection by reducing gas pressure and density as well as suppressing convection in regions with strong field concentrations. The strength of these effects depends on the stellar type.</description>

      <title>Impacts of the $^{16}$O($^{16}$O, n)$^{31}$S reaction rate on the evolution and nucleosynthesis in Pop III massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first present a systematic investigation into the effect of the $^{16}$O($^{16}$O, n)$^{31}$S reaction rate on the evolution and nucleosynthesis of Population III (Pop III) stars. We simulate the evolution of a 15 M$_\odot$ Pop III star from the zero-age main sequence through to core collapse, while varying the $^{16}$O($^{16}$O, n)$^{31}$S reaction rate by factors of 0.1, 1, and 10. Our results demonstrate that increasing this reaction rate prompts earlier onset and extended duration of core oxygen burning at lower temperatures and densities. A higher reaction rate also increases neutron excess in OSi-rich layers, thereby promoting the synthesis of neutron-rich isotopes, particularly $^{31}$P and $^{39}$K. Most notably, the K yield is enhanced by a factor of 6.4. For a tenfold enhancement of the $^{16}$O($^{16}$O, n)$^{31}$S rate, the predicted [K/Ca] and [K/Fe] values from presupernova models reach 0.29 and 0.22 dex, respectively-values that are consistent with the most recent observational data for extremely metal-poor stars. These findings hold promise as a potential new solution to the problem of potassium underproduction and offer a valuable theoretical reference and motivation for subsequent measurements of oxygen fusion reaction rate.</description>

      <title>On Systematic Errors in Cross-Identification of Binary Stars in Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Gaia DR3 data, binary star catalogs have been created containing information on a total of more than 2.6 million pairs. This increases by more than an order of magnitude the ensemble of binary stars with known characteristics, which previously numbered about 140 thousand pairs. To perform statistical analysis of the complete ensemble of binary stars, including both previously known and newly discovered pairs, cross-identification by coordinates was carried out between the most complete pre-Gaia publication compilative binary star catalog ILB and data from binary star catalogs based on Gaia DR3 results. An analysis of the results of this identification was performed, showing the dependence of its characteristics both on the data from the source catalogs and on coordinates. It is shown that in dense stellar fields, particularly in the Galactic disk, an increase in the fraction of false positive identifications can be expected. At the same time, for systems with large proper motion, there is a high probability of a false negative outcome. Possible modifications to the identification method are proposed to reduce the role of the described systematic errors and increase the reliability of its results.</description>

      <title>The 24 Aqr triple system: A closer look at its unique high-eccentricity hierarchical architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As its periastron passage occurred during the third quarter of 2020, system 24 Aqr is of particular significance. New visual solutions for the latest speckle interferometry observations collected by the Lowell Discovery Telescope (LTD) with its new QWSSI speckle camera are presented here. A variety of techniques were used to analyze the system, including ORBITX code for orbital solution, Al-Wardat's method for analyzing multiple stellar systems, and Edwards' method for analyzing visual and spectroscopic binaries. We derive precise masses and the complete set of its fundamental parameters for the three components, and we introduce a new orbital solution, and a new dynamical parallax, which is very close to the measured value given by Hipparcos 2007 and from that of Gaia DR2. In the next section, we discuss the possibility of a coplanar orbit. In conclusion, we demonstrate that we need a 65-m telescope to resolve the inner binary visually, although an array of telescopes could be used instead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) exhibits an unusual, tightly collimated dust feature in the sunward hemisphere which has been widely described as an anti-tail. At the same time, precise constraints on the nucleus size have been derived from a combination of high-resolution imaging and non-gravitational dynamics. In this work I present a unified analysis that combines existing constraints on the nucleus radius with new ground-based RGB imaging of the dust anti-tail obtained with a 0.25 m telescope at the Toni Scarmato Astronomical Observatory (MPC L92).</description>

      <title>Lithium abundance and stellar rotation in the Galactic halo and thick disc: Contribution from low-mass giant field stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar evolution of lithium-rich (Li-rich) giant stars at very low metallicities remains largely unexplored to date. Using two recent large LAMOST catalogues of field, low-mass giant stars (both Li-rich and Li-poor) with metallicities from -4.0 to -1.0, we studied the conditions for Li enrichment and the distribution of stellar rotations in the Galactic halo and thick disc. Due to the scarcity of stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -3.0, only three Li-rich RGB stars are known in this regime. The observational appearance of giants across the horizontal branch (HB) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stages (with Li abundances up to 6.15 dex) has been detected for metallicities &gt; -2.5. Among these stars, we detected IR excesses indicative of giant stars losing mass, showing a recent episodic Li-enrichment process related to the Cameron-Fowler mechanism for the formation of new 7Li. Because stars with IR excesses are distributed across most metallicity values, we suggest this mechanism is at work throughout an important part of the Galaxy's evolutionary history. Based on these IR excesses, we identified three Li thresholds: about 1.5 dex for RGB stars, about 0.5 dex for HB stars, and about -0.5 dex for AGB stars, establishing a new criterion to characterise Li-rich giants. We carried out a study of stellar rotations in metal-poor giant stars, revealing that a plateau appears for velocities greater than 40 km/s up to near 90 km/s, with Li abundances from 1.02 to 1.82 dex. Among Li-rich giants with v sin i &gt; 40 km/s, increasing rotation is observed as metallicity decreases from -1.0 to -2.5. The presence of RGB and HB Li-rich giants with rotations up to 90 km/s suggests that stellar models must account for extended 3He reservoir lifetimes as a source of 7Li. The velocity around 40 km/s appears to be a new critical value.</description>

      <title>Heavy dark matter in rapidly evolving massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of heavy dark matter (DM) captured in massive stars via scattering(s) with the star constituents. We focus on the first stars and use stellar evolution simulations to track down how DM capture evolves over time from the zero-age main sequence to the late metal-rich stages of stellar evolution. During the early hydrogen-helium-dominated phase, the capture process is well described by scattering with two targets. As a star evolves, metal production leads to the formation of a dense core surrounded by a lighter envelope. The core significantly enhances the capture of ultra-heavy DM; in this case, three distinct nuclear species are required to accurately describe multiple-scattering capture. We use the Eddington inversion method to obtain a realistic DM velocity distribution, better suited when the star is near the center of a halo, than the widely used Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. We find that heavy DM would be able to thermalize and achieve capture-annihilation equilibrium within a massive star's lifetime for regions of the parameter space not excluded by direct detection. For non-annihilating DM, because of the high amount of targets available for capture and despite massive stars being short-lived, it would even be possible for DM to achieve self-gravitation and collapse to a black hole, which eventually could swallow the star from within before the expected end of the star's life, for non-excluded regions of the parameter space. Our results highlight the dependence of DM capture on the stellar evolutionary stage, composition, and halo location, demonstrating that accurate modeling of massive stars is essential for constraining heavy DM with primordial stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Why Machine Learning Models Systematically Underestimate Extreme Values II: How to Fix It with LatentNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attenuation bias -- the systematic underestimation of regression coefficients due to measurement errors in input variables -- affects astronomical data-driven models. For linear regression, this problem was solved by treating the true input values as latent variables to be estimated alongside model parameters. In this paper, we show that neural networks suffer from the same attenuation bias and that the latent variable solution generalizes directly to neural networks. We introduce LatentNN, a method that jointly optimizes network parameters and latent input values by maximizing the joint likelihood of observing both inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the correction on one-dimensional regression, multivariate inputs with correlated features, and stellar spectroscopy applications. LatentNN reduces attenuation bias across a range of signal-to-noise ratios where standard neural networks show large bias. This provides a framework for improved neural network inference in the low signal-to-noise regime characteristic of astronomical data. This bias correction is most effective when measurement errors are less than roughly half the intrinsic data range; in the regime of very low signal-to-noise and few informative features. Code is available at https://github.com/tingyuansen/LatentNN.</description>

      <title>The Dependence of the Extinction Coefficient on Reddening for Galactic Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cepheids are fundamental distance indicators, playing a crucial role not only in the cosmic distance ladder but also in mapping the structure, kinematics, and extinction properties of the Milky Way. Using high-precision photometry and parallaxes from $Gaia$, we identify a significant anti-correlation between the $G$-band extinction coefficient and reddening for Galactic Cepheids, quantified as $R_G = 1.921 \pm 0.060 - (0.107 \pm 0.022)\,E(G_{\mathrm{BP}} - G_{\mathrm{RP}})$. We propose that this anti-correlation is partly driven by the pronounced non-linear effects inherent to the broad $Gaia$ bands, while the remaining part arise from the $R_V$ variations caused by diverse interstellar medium. Adopting a fixed $R_G$ would not only lead to an overestimation of the metallicity dependence of Cepheid luminosities, but also systematically underestimate the distances to highly reddened Cepheids. Moreover, the strong reddening dependence of $R_G$ makes Wesenheit function based on it unsuitable for highly reddened Cepheids, since the definition of Wesenheit magnitudes requires a fixed extinction coefficient. In contrast, infrared-based distances, being less affected by non-linear effects and insensitive to $R_V$, provide the most reliable Cepheid distances at present. This work emphasizes the importance of accurately determining $R_V$ for Galactic Cepheids and accounting for non-linear effects in distance measurements, particularly in the optical bands.</description>

      <title>Predicting the detection yields of giant planets and brown dwarfs with CSST astrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST), which will begin its scientific operations around 2027, is going to survey the sky area of the median-to-high Galactic latitude and median-to-high ecliptic latitude. The high astrometric precision of the CSST Survey Camera for faint objects enables the detection of a number of giant planets and brown dwarfs around M-dwarfs and brown dwarfs via differential astrometry in its optical survey. In this paper, we predict the number of giant planets and brown dwarfs around stars and brown dwarfs detectable with CSST astrometry. We generate synthetic samples of CSST stellar and substellar sources, and carry out companion injection-recovery simulations in the samples using different occurrence rates for FGK-dwarfs, M-dwarfs, and brown dwarfs. We calculate companion yields based on CSST astrometric precision. Our analysis reveals that over its 10-year mission, the CSST Survey Camera could barely discover giant planets and low-mass BDs around FGK-dwarfs, but is projected to detect 20 - 170 giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs around M-dwarfs within 300 pc, and 300 - 570 brown dwarf binaries within 600 pc. Therefore, CSST astrometry is likely to significantly increase the current sample of substellar companions around M-dwarfs and brown dwarfs. This sample will deepen our understanding of planet formation and evolution around low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.</description>

Abstract: This work analyzes four Sun-like double-lined spectroscopic binary (SB2) systems by combining visual and spectroscopic observational data with Al-Wardat's atmospheric modeling method to accurately determine their fundamental parameters. For each system, we determine stellar masses, orbital parallaxes, effective temperatures, spectral types, semimajor axes, and eccentricities with high precision, resolving discrepancies between astrometric and spectroscopic measurements. Moreover, we assess the potential for stable planetary orbits in these systems. We also calculate habitable zones around these binaries based on the orbital evolution of planetary orbits. These systems may represent promising targets for future extrasolar planet searches around Sun-like stars due to their robust physical and orbital parameters that can be used to determine planetary habitability and stability.</description>

Abstract: Latitude distribution of stellar magnetic activity is not well constrained by observations, despite its importance for a better understanding of stellar dynamos. We aim to obtain an accurate reconstruction of the surface spot distribution on the young, rapidly rotating K2 star PW And by combining spectroscopic and photometric diagnostics. In particular, we seek to assess how the inclusion of continuous high-precision TESS photometry in parallel with high-resolution spectroscopy improves latitude recovery of starspots, especially at low latitudes and in the southern hemisphere, which are poorly constrained by Doppler imaging (DI) alone. We explore the spatial origins of the observed white-light flares. We performed simultaneous Doppler imaging and light curve inversion (DI+LCI) using contemporaneous high-resolution GAOES-RV spectra from the 3.8 m Seimei telescope (R~65000) and high-precision TESS light curves. Surface reconstructions employ the SpotDIPy code to model both line profiles and continuum brightness variations. We compare DI+LCI maps with DI-only solutions, conduct artificial-spot simulations to evaluate the effects of latitude, phase coverage, and S/N on reconstruction reliability. We also investigate the spatial correlation between the DI+LCI reconstructed map and flares detected in the TESS data. The DI+LCI reconstruction reveals significant spot features at mid-to-low latitudes, equatorial regions, and even in the southern hemisphere. Simulations show that DI+LCI provides more accurate reconstructions than DI-only, especially under conditions of incomplete phase coverage and low S/N, by better recovering both spot latitudes and filling factors. A comparison between the DI+LCI map and the TESS flare timings also suggests potential association between flare occurrence and reconstructed spot longitudes.</description>

      <title>A joint JWST and HST view of Omega Centauri: Multiple stellar populations and their kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine F115W and F277W images collected with the Near Infrared Camera of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with multi-band, multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of Omega Centauri to investigate its multiple stellar populations and internal kinematics. Our study focuses on a region spanning $\sim$0.9 to $\sim$2.3 half-light radii from the cluster center, largely unexplored by HST and JWST. Using chromosome maps, we identify the principal populations along the upper main sequence and among M-dwarfs, distinguishing lower-stream (LS) stars, chemically akin to first-generation globular cluster stars with similar metallicities, and upper-stream (US) stars, enriched in helium and nitrogen but oxygen-poor. Both streams also host subpopulations with varying metallicities. We find radially anisotropic motions, with US stars exhibiting significantly stronger anisotropy than LS stars. Subdividing the US into extreme and intermediate light-element populations reveals a gradient in anisotropy, with intermediate stars lying between the LS and extreme US populations. However, metal-rich and metal-poor stars within each stream show moderate kinematic differences. The LS stars show higher angular momentum and dispersion compared to US stars, and also exhibit stronger systemic rotation and tangential proper-motion skewness, further highlighting their kinematic divergence. Finally, leveraging a mass range of $\sim$0.15 - 0.7 solar masses, we detect a low degree of energy equipartition for all cluster stars, which decreases with radial distance from the cluster center.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Velocity-Space Signature of Ion Cyclotron Damping Using Liouville Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ion cyclotron damping is a key mechanism for the dissipation of electromagnetic wave energy in weakly collisional plasmas. This study presents a combined approach using Liouville mapping and the field-particle correlation technique to investigate qualitatively and quantitatively the velocity-space signature of ion cyclotron damping. Liouville mapping offers a computationally efficient way to predict perturbations to the particle velocity distribution function using single-particle trajectories in prescribed electromagnetic fields. One may apply the field-particle correlation technique to these perturbed velocity distributions to reveal the unique velocity-space signatures of the secular energy transfer rate associated with specific wave-particle interactions. We validate this method by reproducing known Landau damping signatures for kinetic Alfv\'en waves, and then we apply this method to ion cyclotron waves where ion cyclotron damping dominates. The resulting velocity-space signature reveals distinct energization features of ion cyclotron damping : (i) a quadrupolar pattern in the perpendicular $(v_x, v_y)$ plane; and (ii) a localized energization near the $n = 1$ resonant velocity in gyrotropic $(v_\parallel, v_\perp)$ velocity-space. The quantitative patterns remain unchanged as the ion plasma beta $\beta_i$ is varied, ultimately showing minimal $v_\perp$ dependence on $\beta_i$ of the velocity-space signature at the $n = 1$ resonant velocity. This work provides a systematic study of how the ion cyclotron damping signature varies with $\beta_i$, offering a practical foundation to identify ion cyclotron damping using kinetic simulation data or spacecraft data.</description>

      <title>Alpha effect and dynamo in density-stratified turbulence with large-scale shear: applications to protoplanetary discs and astrophysical clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A joint effect of the density-stratified turbulence (or inhomogeneous turbulence) and a large-scale shear for arbitrary Mach numbers results in the $\alpha$ effect and mean-field dynamo action. These effects also produce the effective pumping velocity of a large-scale magnetic field. Compressibility of the turbulent velocity field (i.e., finite Mach number effects) does not affect the contributions to the $\alpha$ tensor caused by the joint effect of inhomogeneity of turbulence and a large-scale shear. The isotropic part of the $\alpha$ tensor is independent of the exponent of the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum. There is also an additional contribution to the effective pumping velocity of the mean magnetic field that is proportional to the product of the fluid density gradient and the divergence of the mean fluid velocity caused, e.g., by collapsing (or expanding) astrophysical clouds. Applications of these effects to protoplanetary discs, proto-galactic and proto-stellar clouds are discussed.</description>

      <title>Electron Inertia and Magnetic Reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14400v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect in the evolution of a magnetic field $\vec{B}$, the field lines of $\vec{B}$ reconnect, but the lines of a related field $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ do not. $\vec{\mathcal{B}} \equiv \vec{B} + \vec{\nabla}\times \left( (c/\omega_{pe})^2\mu_0\vec{j} \right)$ with $\omega_{pe}$ the plasma frequency and $\vec{j}$ the current density. Although a full four-dimensional relativistic calculation of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ has been made, studies of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ have been focused on systems that depend on only two spatial coordinates. Three results are given: (1) A relatively simple demonstration in three dimensional space that the lines of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ do not reconnect when electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect. (2) The guiding center motion of charged particles is modified by a term that is proportional to $(c/\omega_{pe})^2$, which is smaller than the drifts proportional to the gyroradius unless the current density is extremely large. (3) In three dimensional space, the evolution velocity of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ is characteristically chaotic, which means neighboring streamlines separate exponentially on a timescale $\tau_u$. $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ undergoes large scale reconnection on a timescale that is only an order of magnitude or two longer than $\tau_u$ unless all diffusive non-ideal effects, such as resistivity, are absolutely zero.</description>

      <title>The Formation of Electron-capture Supernovae: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is generally believed that the electron-capture reactions happen when the oxygen-neon (ONe) cores grow in masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit, leading to the formation of neutron stars (NSs) via electron-capture supernovae (EC-SNe). EC-SNe are predicted to be the most likely short-lived and faint optical transients, and a small ejecta mass is expected during the collapse. This kind of SNe provide an alternative channel for producing isolated NSs and NS systems, especially for the formation of X-ray binaries and double NSs. Although EC-SNe were proposed ~45 yr ago, there are still some uncertainties for the origin of EC-SNe. In this article, we review recent studies on the two classic progenitor channels of EC-SNe, i.e., the single star channel and the binary star channel. In the single star channel, EC-SNe can happen in super asymptotic giant branch stars or He stars, whereas in the binary star channel EC-SNe can occur in He stars in binaries (involving He star+MS systems and NS+He star systems) or accretion-induced collapse in white dwarf binaries (involving the single-degenerate scenario and the double-degenerate scenario). Recent progress on the two progenitor channels is discussed, including the initial parameter range for EC-SNe, the evolutionary paths to EC-SNe, related objects and some observational constraints, etc. We also make some discussions on the possible candidates for EC-SNe in this article, and the impacts of EC-SNe on some research fields, e.g., the properties of NSs, double NS population and chemical products, etc. We also discuss the differences between EC-SNe and ultra-stripped SNe in this article. Research on EC-SNe is at a pivotal stage, with key theoretical uncertainties and observational challenges requiring integrated modeling and multi-wavelength observations for robust identification.</description>
