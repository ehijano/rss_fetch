      <title>Exact Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors for Some n-Dimensional Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on previous work that provided analytical solutions to generalised matrix eigenvalue problems arising from numerical discretisations, this paper develops exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a broader class of $n$-dimensional matrices, focusing on non-symmetric and non-persymmetric matrices. These matrices arise in one-dimensional Laplacian eigenvalue problems with mixed boundary conditions and in a few quantum mechanics applications where standard Toeplitz-plus-Hankel matrix forms do not suffice. By extending analytical methodologies to these broader matrix categories, the study not only widens the scope of applicable matrices but also enhances computational methodologies, leading to potentially more accurate and efficient solutions in physics and engineering simulations.</description>

      <title>New matrices for spectral hypergraph theory, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of a hypergraph explored through the spectrum of its unified matrix was made by the authors in [26]. In this paper, we introduce three different hypergraph matrices: unified Laplacian matrix, unified signless Laplacian matrix, and unified normalized Laplacian matrix, all defined using the unified matrix. We show that these three matrices of a hypergraph are respectively identical to the Laplacian matrix, signless Laplacian matrix, and normalized Laplacian matrix of the associated graph. This allows us to use the spectra of these hypergraph matrices as a means to connect the structural properties of the hypergraph with those of the associated graph. Additionally, we introduce certain hypergraph structures and invariants during this process, and relate them to the eigenvalues of these three matrices.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical measure of the spherical harmonics by Bourgain on $\mathbb{S}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bourgain used the Rudin-Shapiro sequences to construct a basis of uniformly bounded holomorphic functions on the unit sphere in $\mathbb{C}^2$. They are also spherical harmonics (i.e., Laplacian eigenfunctions) on $\mathbb{S}^3 \subset \mathbb{R}^4$. In this paper, we prove that these functions tend to be equidistributed on $\mathbb{S}^3$, based on an estimate of the auto-correlation of the Rudin-Shapiro sequences. Moreover, we identify the semiclassical measure associated to these spherical harmonics by the singular measure supported on the family of Clifford tori in $\mathbb{S}^3$. In particular, this demonstrates a new localization pattern in the study of Laplacian eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Conic programming to understand sums of squares of eigenvalues of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a conjecture by Wocjan, Elphick and Anekstein (2018) which upper bounds the sum of the squares of the positive (or negative) eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of a graph by an expression that behaves monotonically in terms of the vector chromatic number. One of our lemmas is a strengthening of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for Hermitian matrices when one of the matrices is positive semidefinite.
  A related conjecture due to Bollob\'as and Nikiforov (2007) replaces the vector chromatic number by the clique number and sums over the first two eigenvalues only. We prove a version of this conjecture with weaker constants. An important consequence of our work is a proof that for any fixed $r$, computing a rank $r$ optimum solution to the vector chromatic number semidefinite programming is NP-hard.
  We also present a vertex weighted version of some of our results, and we show how it leads quite naturally to the known vertex-weighted version of the Motzkin-Straus quadratic optimization formulation for the clique number.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of the resolvent difference for singularly perturbed operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain order sharp spectral estimates for the difference of resolvents of singularly perturbed elliptic operators $\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{V}_1$ and $\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{V}_2$ in a domain $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^\mathbf{N}$ with perturbations $\mathbf{V}_1, \mathbf{V}_2$ generated by $V_1\mu,V_2\mu,$ where $\mu$ is a measure singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure and satisfying two-sided or one-sided conditions of Ahlfors type, while $V_1,V_2$ are weight functions subject to some integral conditions. As an important special case, spectral estimates for the difference of resolvents of two Robin realizations of the operator $\mathbf{A}$ with different weight functions are obtained. For the case when the support of the measure is a compact Lipschitz hypersurface in $\Omega$ or, more generally, a rectifiable set of Hau{\ss}dorff dimension $d=\mathbf{N}-1$, the Weyl type asymptotics for eigenvalues is justified.</description>
