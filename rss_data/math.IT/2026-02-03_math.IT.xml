      <title>Information Propagation and Encoding in Solids: A Quantitative Approach Towards Mechanical Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineered systems typically separate mechanical function from information processing, whereas biological systems can exploit physical structure as a medium for information processing and computation. Motivated by this contrast, recent work in mechanics has explored embedding information-processing capabilities directly into mechanical structures. However, quantitative frameworks for evaluating such capabilities remain limited. Here we address a foundational question: how does information propagate through a solid body? Using elastic bodies as a model system, we apply information-theoretic tools to treat an elastic domain as an information encoder and quantify how information transmits from applied loads to discrete sensor locations. We further connect these measures to familiar mechanical phenomena, including Saint-Venant's effect and principal stress lines. Moving toward design, we show how geometry and architected materials can tune transmission, enabling elastic domains to either transmit or block information. Overall, this work advances quantifiable metrics and benchmark tasks for mechanical intelligence, supporting comparable designs of mechanically embodied information processing.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Command and Control Transmission for Multi-UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have played an important role in the low-altitude economy and have been used in various applications. However, with the increasing number of UAVs and explosive wireless data, the existing bit-oriented communication network has approached the Shannon capacity, which cannot satisfy the quality of service (QoS) with ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) requirements for command and control (C\&amp;C) transmission in bit-oriented UAV communication networks. To address this issue, we propose a novel semantic-aware C\&amp;C transmission for multi-UAVs under limited wireless resources. Specifically, we leverage semantic similarity to measure the variation in C\&amp;C messages for each UAV over continuous transmission time intervals (TTIs) and capture the correlation of C\&amp;C messages among UAVs, enabling multicast transmission. Based on the semantic similarity and the importance of UAV commands, we design a trigger function to quantify the QoS of UAVs. Then, to maximize the long-term QoS and exploit multicast opportunities of C\&amp;C messages induced by semantic similarity, we develop a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to jointly determine the transmission mode (unicast/multicast/idle) and the allocation of limited resource blocks (RBs) between a base station (BS) and UAVs. Experimental results show that our proposed semantic-aware framework significantly increases transmission efficiency and improves effectiveness compared with bit-oriented UAV transmission.</description>

      <title>The structure and enumeration of periodic binary sequences with high nonlinear complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear complexity, as an important measure for assessing the randomness of sequences, is defined as the length of the shortest feedback shift registers that can generate a given sequence. In this paper, the structure of n-periodic binary sequences with nonlinear complexity larger than or equal to 3n/4 is characterized. Based on their structure, an exact enumeration formula for the number of such periodic sequences is determined.</description>

      <title>On the Palindromic/Reverse-Complement Duplication Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in in-vivo DNA storage, we study codes for correcting duplications. A reverse-complement duplication of length $k$ is the insertion of the reversed and complemented copy of a substring of length $k$ adjacent to its original position, while a palindromic duplication only inserts the reversed copy without complementation. We first construct an explicit code with a single redundant symbol capable of correcting an arbitrary number of reverse-complement duplications (respectively, palindromic duplications), provided that all duplications have length $k \ge 3\lceil \log_q n \rceil$ and are disjoint. Next, we derive a Gilbert-Varshamov bound for codes that can correct a reverse-complement duplication (respectively, palindromic duplication) of arbitrary length, showing that the optimal redundancy is upper bounded by $2\log_q n + \log_q\log_q n + O(1)$. Finally, for $q \ge 4$, we present two explicit constructions of codes that can correct $t$ length-one reverse-complement duplications. The first construction achieves a redundancy of $2t\log_q n + O(\log_q\log_q n)$ with encoding complexity $O(n)$ and decoding complexity $O\big(n(\log_2 n)^4\big)$. The second construction achieves an improved redundancy of $(2t-1)\log_q n + O(\log_q\log_q n)$, but with encoding and decoding complexities of $O\big(n \cdot \mathrm{poly}(\log_2 n)\big)$.</description>

      <title>A class of pseudorandom sequences From Function Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the constructions of pseudorandom sequences over the cyclic elliptic function fields by Hu \textit{et al.} in \text{[IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 53(7), 2007]} and the constructions of low-correlation, large linear span binary sequences from function fields by Xing \textit{et al.} in \text{[IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 49(6), 2003]}, we utilize the bound derived by Weil \text{[Basic Number Theory, Grund. der Math. Wiss.,
  Bd 144]} and Deligne \text{[ Lecture Notes in Mathematics, vol. 569 (Springer, Berlin, 1977)]} for the exponential sums over the general algebraic function fields and study the periods, linear complexities, linear complexity profiles, distributions of $r-$patterns, period correlation and nonlinear complexities for a class of $p-$ary sequences that generalize the constructions in \text{[IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 49(6), 2003]} and [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 53(7), 2007].</description>

      <title>Reducing ORBGRAND Latency via Partial Gaussian Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) is a universal framework for decoding all block codes by testing candidate error patterns (EPs). Ordered Reliability Bits GRAND (ORBGRAND) facilitates parallel implementation of GRAND by exploiting log-likelihood ratio (LLR) rankings but still suffers from high tail latency under unfavorable channel conditions, limiting its use in real-time systems.
  We propose an elimination-aided ORBGRAND scheme that reduces decoding latency by integrating the Rank of the Most Reliable Erroneous (RMRE) bit with a partial Gaussian-elimination (GE) filtering mechanism. The scheme groups and jointly verifies EPs that share the same RMRE, and once a valid EP is identified, the ORBGRAND search is resumed. By leveraging prior GE steps to filter out unnecessary guesses, this approach significantly reduces the number of EPs to be tested, thereby lowering both average and worst-case latency while maintaining error-correction performance.
  Simulation results show that compared to the original ORBGRAND, the elimination-aided ORBGRAND filters out more than 50\% of EPs and correspondingly reduce overall computational complexity, all with no loss in block error rate. This demonstrates that this approach is suitable for ultra-reliable low-latency communication scenarios.</description>

      <title>L-Moment-Based LOS and NLOS Channel Characterization via Four-parameter Kappa Distribution for AoA BLE CTE Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) CTE transmissions provide in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples whose empirical statistics are strongly governed by the propagation regime. in particular, the distributions differ markedly between line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. In NLOS, multipath-induced distortions typically degrade Angle-of-Arrivial (AoA) estimation accuracy. Existing BLE direction finding datasets rarely provide tightly controlled, IQ-level paired LOS and NLOS measurements with rigorous statistical validation, and commonly used flat-fading models can be inadequate for cluttered indoor environments exhibiting heavy-tailed power distributions. To address these limitations, we conduct a paired-geometry BLE AoA measurement campaign using an off-the-shelf module, collecting 132000 labeled CTE packets under matched anchor-tag conditions. A robust preprocessing stage removes anomalous CTEs using combined univariate and multivariate criteria. Feature-wise hypothesis tests on IQ-derived power features confirm strong LOS and NLOS separability. All mean differences are statistically significant; additionally, 92 percent of feature-wise variance differences are significant. We further compute L-moment ratios (LMRs) and analyze them in the L-moment Ratio Diagram (LMRD), showing that NLOS subsets exhibit markedly heavier tails and stronger asymmetry than LOS. Kappa-family distributions fitted from LMRs provide substantially improved dual scored L--moment goodness-of-fit (GoF), Specifically, for NLOS, which is the smallest discrepancy in the LMRD and a near-zero standardized L-kurtosis deviation. As a practice, we apply a self-supervised clustering to L-moment statistics, achieving a more separable representation, compared to product moments.</description>

      <title>MDS matrices from skew polynomials with automorphisms and derivations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) matrices play a central role in coding theory and symmetric-key cryptography due to their optimal diffusion properties. In this paper, we present a construction of MDS matrices using skew polynomial rings \( \mathbb{F}_q[X;\theta,\delta] \), where \( \theta \) is an automorphism and \( \delta \) is a \( \theta\)-derivation on \( \mathbb{F}_q \). We introduce the notion of \( \delta_{\theta} \)-circulant matrices and study their structural properties. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived under which these matrices are involutory and satisfy the MDS property. The resulting $\delta_\theta$-circulant matrix can be viewed as a generalization of classical constructions obtained in the absence of $\theta$-derivations. One of the main contribution of this work is the construction of quasi recursive MDS matrices. In the setting of the skew polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}_q[X;\theta]$, we construct quasi recursive MDS matrices associated with companion matrices.
  These matrices are shown to be involutory, yielding a strict improvement over the quasi-involutory constructions previously reported in the literature. Several illustrative results and examples are also provided.</description>

      <title>Design of Root Protograph LDPC Codes Simultaneously Achieving Full Diversity and High Coding Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel design framework for protograph-based LDPC codes that simultaneously achieves full diversity in block-fading channels (BFCs) and nearcapacity performance in additive white Gaussian noise channels (AWGNCs). By leveraging a Boolean approximation-based analysis--Diversity Evolution (DivE)--we derive structural constraints for generalized rootchecks that guarantee full diversity. Based on these constraints, we propose a protograph template tailored for two-block BFCs. Furthermore, we employ a genetic algorithm guided by density evolution to optimize the protograph edges within this template for superior AWGNC performance. The resulting codes effectively bridge the gap between diversityoriented and capacity-oriented designs, exhibiting robust performance across both channel environments.</description>

      <title>On the Fragility of AI-Based Channel Decoders under Small Channel Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to AI-based error correction decoders that report empirical performance improvements over traditional belief-propagation (BP) decoding on AWGN channels. While such gains are promising, a fundamental question remains: where do these improvements come from, and what cost is paid to achieve them? In this work, we study this question through the lens of robustness to distributional shifts at the channel output. We evaluate both input-dependent adversarial perturbations (FGM and projected gradient methods under $\ell_2$ constraints) and universal adversarial perturbations that apply a single norm-bounded shift to all received vectors. Our results show that recent AI decoders, including ECCT and CrossMPT, could suffer significant performance degradation under such perturbations, despite superior nominal performance under i.i.d. AWGN. Moreover, adversarial perturbations transfer relatively strongly between AI decoders but weakly to BP-based decoders, and universal perturbations are substantially more harmful than random perturbations of equal norm. These numerical findings suggest a potential robustness cost and higher sensitivity to channel distribution underlying recent AI decoding gains.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Aligned Pruning for Universal Error-Correcting Code Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the Foundation Error Correction Code Transformer (FECCT) has emerged as a promising universal channel decoder, achieving competitive decoding performance across diverse code families by relying on a single shared model backbone, optionally followed by code-specific retraining. Despite this flexibility, the high computational complexity and large parameter footprint of transformer-based decoders present substantial obstacles to practical deployment. To address these challenges, we investigate structured pruning for FECCT and propose Spectral-Aligned Pruning (SAP), a structure-aware framework that enables cross-code reuse of structured pruning masks across codes by leveraging the spectrum of the corresponding bipartite graph. After pruning, SAP performs per-code recovery via parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA), enabling a shared pruned backbone while storing only small code-specific adapter parameters. Experiments across diverse codes show that SAP achieves decoding performance comparable to dedicated per-code pruning, while enabling substantial reductions in computational cost and model memory footprint through kernel-level structured pruning.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Multi-Agent Continual Learning for Stacked Intelligent Metasurface-Assisted Secure Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), composed of multiple layers of reconfigurable transmissive metasurfaces, are gaining prominence as a transformative technology for future wireless communication security. This paper investigates the integration of SIM into multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to enhance physical layer security. A novel system architecture is proposed, wherein each base station (BS) antenna transmits a dedicated single-user stream, while a multi-layer SIM executes wave-based beamforming in the electromagnetic domain, thereby avoiding the need for complex baseband digital precoding and significantly reducing hardware overhead. To maximize the weighted sum secrecy rate (WSSR), we formulate a joint precoding optimization problem over BS power allocation and SIM phase shifts, which is high-dimensional and non-convex due to the complexity of the objective function and the coupling among optimization variables. To address this, we propose a manifold-enhanced heterogeneous multi-agent continual learning (MHACL) framework that incorporates gradient representation and dual-scale policy optimization to achieve robust performance in dynamic environments with high demands for secure communication. Furthermore, we develop SIM-MHACL (SIMHACL), a low-complexity learning template that embeds phase coordination into a product manifold structure, reducing the exponential search space to linear complexity while maintaining physical feasibility. Simulation results validate that the proposed framework achieves millisecond-level per-iteratio ntraining in SIM-assisted systems, significantly outperforming various baseline schemes, with SIMHACL achieving comparable WSSR to MHACL while reducing computation time by 30\%.</description>

      <title>Decoding Golay Codes and their Related Lattices: A PAC Code Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a decoding method of Golay codes from the perspective of Polarization Adjusted Convolutional (PAC) codes. By invoking Forney's cubing construction of Golay codes and their generators $G^*(8,7)/(8,4)$, we found different construction methods of Golay codes from PAC codes, which result in an efficient parallel list decoding algorithm with near-maximum likelihood performance. Compared with existing methods, our method can get rid of index permutation and codeword puncturing. Using the new decoding method, some related lattices, such as Leech lattice $\Lambda_{24}$ and its principal sublattice $H_{24}$, can be also decoded efficiently.</description>

      <title>Performance Guarantees of Cellular Networks with Hardcore Regulation and Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing performance guarantees is one of the {critical} objectives of {recent and future} communication networks, toward which regulations, {i.e., constraints on key system parameters,} have played an indispensable role. This is the case for large wireless communication networks, where spatial regulations (e.g., constraints on intercell distance) have recently been shown, through a spatial network calculus, to be essential for establishing provable wireless link-level guarantees. In this work, we focus on performance guarantees for {the downlink of} cellular networks where we impose a hardcore (spatial) regulation on base station (BS) locations and evaluate {how BS scheduling (which controls which BSs can transmit at a given time) impacts performance}. Hardcore regulation is the simplest form of spatial regulation that enforces a minimal distance between any pair of transmitters in the network. Within this framework of spatial network calculus, we first provide an upper bound on the power of total interference for a spatially regulated cellular network, and then, identify the regimes where scheduling BSs yields {better} link-level rate guarantees compared to scenarios where base stations are always active. The hexagonal cellular network is analyzed as a special case. The results offer insights into what spatial regulations are needed, when to choose scheduling, and how to potentially reduce the network power consumption {to provide a certain target performance guarantee}.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Knowledge Base Resizing for Rate-Adaptive Digital Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital semantic communication systems, which often leverage the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) framework, are pivotal for future wireless networks. In a VQ-VAE-based semantic communication system, the transmission rate is directly governed by the size of a discrete codebook known as knowledge base (KB). However, the KB size is a fixed hyperparameter, meaning that adapting the rate requires training and storing a separate model for each desired size -- a practice that is too computationally and storage-prohibitive to achieve truly granular rate control. To address this, we introduce a principled, zero-shot KB resizing method that enables on-the-fly rate adaptation without any retraining. Our approach establishes a global importance ranking for all vectors within a single, large parent KB by uncovering its inherent semantic hierarchy. This is achieved via a three-step framework: 1) embedding KB vectors into hyperbolic space to reveal their hierarchical relationships; 2) constructing a master semantic tree using a minimum spanning tree algorithm; 3) enabling instant resizing by iteratively pruning the least important leaf nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our method achieves reconstruction quality nearly identical to that of dedicated KBs trained from scratch, while demanding only a fraction of the computational budget. Moreover, our approach exhibits superior robustness at very low rates, where conventional KBs suffer from catastrophic failure. Our work resolves a fundamental limitation of VQ-VAE-based semantic communication systems, offering a practical and efficient path toward flexible and rate-adaptive semantic communication.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Coded-Sliding Beam Training and QoS-Constrained Sum-Rate Maximization for SIM-Assisted Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) provide a cost-effective and scalable solution for large-scale antenna communications.However, efficient channel state information acquisition and phase shift optimization remain critical challenges. In this paper, we develop a unified framework of low-complexity algorithms for SIM-assisted communication systems to address these issues. Specifically, we propose a generalized two-step codebook construction (TSCC) method that leverages two-dimensional angular-domain decoupling to transform planar array beamformer design into two independent one-dimensional linear array beamformer design problems, efficiently solved via the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm and our proposed majorization-minimization-based proximal distance (PDMM) algorithm. We further develop a two-stage coded-sliding beam training (TSCSBT) method for low-overhead and high-accuracy beam training, where error-correcting codes are embedded in the first-stage training to enhance robustness against noise, and sliding sampling is subsequently performed around the matched angular samples to improve angular resolution. The proposed framework is further extended to multi-path user channels. Finally, a variable decoupling-based block successive upper bound minimization (VD-BSUM) algorithm is proposed to directly solve the QoS-constrained sum-rate maximization problem through closed-form iterative updates with substantially reduced computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in achieving precise beam pattern realization, improved beam training accuracy and angular resolution, and enhanced sum-rate performance.</description>

      <title>Preemptive Scheduling for Age of Job Minimization in Task-Specific Machine Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a time-slotted job-assignment system consisting of a central server, $N$ task-specific networks of machines, and multiple users. Each network specializes in executing a distinct type of task. Users stochastically generate jobs of various types and forward them to the central server, which routes each job to the appropriate network of machines. Due to resource constraints, the server cannot serve all users' jobs simultaneously, which motivates the design of scheduling policies with possible preemption. To evaluate scheduling performance, we introduce a novel timeliness metric, the age of job, inspired by the well-known metric, the age of information. We study the problem of minimizing the long-term weighted average age of job. We first propose a max-weight policy by minimizing the one-step Lyapunov drift and then derive the Whittle index (WI) policy when the job completion times of the networks of machines follow geometric distributions. For general job completion time distributions, we introduce a Whittle index with max-weight fallback (WIMWF) policy. We also investigate the Net-gain maximization (NGM) policy. Numerically, we show that the proposed WIMWF policy achieves the best performance in the general job completion time setting. We also observe a scaling trend: two different max-weight policies can outperform the NGM policy in small systems, whereas the NGM policy improves as we scale the system size and becomes asymptotically better than max-weight policies. For geometric service times, the WI policy yields the lowest age across all considered system sizes.</description>

      <title>Age-Aware Edge-Blind Federated Learning via Over-the-Air Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study federated learning (FL) over wireless fading channels where multiple devices simultaneously send their model updates. We propose an efficient \emph{age-aware edge-blind over-the-air FL} approach that does not require channel state information (CSI) at the devices. Instead, the parameter server (PS) uses multiple antennas and applies maximum-ratio combining (MRC) based on its estimated sum of the channel gains to detect the parameter updates. A key challenge is that the number of orthogonal subcarriers is limited; thus, transmitting many parameters requires multiple Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols, which increases latency. To address this, the PS selects only a small subset of model coordinates each round using \emph{AgeTop-\(k\)}, which first picks the largest-magnitude entries and then chooses the \(k\) coordinates with the longest waiting times since they were last selected. This ensures that all selected parameters fit into a single OFDM symbol, reducing latency. We provide a convergence bound that highlights the advantages of using a higher number of antenna array elements and demonstrates a key trade-off: increasing \(k\) decreases compression error at the cost of increasing the effect of channel noise. Experimental results show that (i) more PS antennas greatly improve accuracy and convergence speed; (ii) AgeTop-\(k\) outperforms random selection under relatively good channel conditions; and (iii) the optimum \(k\) depends on the channel, with smaller \(k\) being better in noisy settings.</description>

      <title>Secure Multi-User Linearly-Separable Distributed Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of the new multi-user linearly-separable distributed computing framework, has recently revealed how a parallel treatment of users can yield large parallelization gains with relatively low computation and communication costs. These gains stem from a new approach that converts the computing problem into a sparse matrix factorization problem; a matrix $F$ that describes the users' requests, is decomposed as \(F = DE\), where a \(\gamma\)-sparse \(E\) defines the task allocation across $N$ servers, and a \(\delta\)-sparse \(D\) defines the connectivity between \(N\) servers and \(K\) users as well as the decoding process. While this approach provides near-optimal performance, its linear nature has raised data secrecy concerns.
  We here adopt an information-theoretic secrecy framework, seeking guarantees that each user can learn nothing more than its own requested function. In this context, our main result provides two necessary and sufficient secrecy criteria; (i) for each user \(k\) who observes $\alpha_k$ server responses, the common randomness visible to that user must span a subspace of dimension exactly $\alpha_k-1$,
  and (ii) for each user, removing from \(\mathbf{D}\) the columns corresponding to the servers it observes must leave a matrix of rank at least \(K-1\). With these conditions in place, we design a general scheme -- that applies to finite and non-finite fields alike -- which is based on appending to \(\mathbf{E}\) a basis of \(\mathrm{Null}(\mathbf{D})\) and by carefully injecting shared randomness. In many cases, this entails no additional costs. The scheme, while maintaining performance, guarantees perfect information-theoretic secrecy in the case of finite fields, while in the real case, the conditions yield an explicit mutual-information bound that can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the variance of Gaussian common randomness.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Loss Curve: Scaling Laws, Active Learning, and the Limits of Learning from Exact Posteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How close are neural networks to the best they could possibly do? Standard benchmarks cannot answer this because they lack access to the true posterior p(y|x). We use class-conditional normalizing flows as oracles that make exact posteriors tractable on realistic images (AFHQ, ImageNet). This enables five lines of investigation. Scaling laws: Prediction error decomposes into irreducible aleatoric uncertainty and reducible epistemic error; the epistemic component follows a power law in dataset size, continuing to shrink even when total loss plateaus. Limits of learning: The aleatoric floor is exactly measurable, and architectures differ markedly in how they approach it: ResNets exhibit clean power-law scaling while Vision Transformers stall in low-data regimes. Soft labels: Oracle posteriors contain learnable structure beyond class labels: training with exact posteriors outperforms hard labels and yields near-perfect calibration. Distribution shift: The oracle computes exact KL divergence of controlled perturbations, revealing that shift type matters more than shift magnitude: class imbalance barely affects accuracy at divergence values where input noise causes catastrophic degradation. Active learning: Exact epistemic uncertainty distinguishes genuinely informative samples from inherently ambiguous ones, improving sample efficiency. Our framework reveals that standard metrics hide ongoing learning, mask architectural differences, and cannot diagnose the nature of distribution shift.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Peripheral Surface Information Entropy from Globular Protein-Peptide Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting favorable protein-peptide binding events remains a central challenge in biophysics, with continued uncertainty surrounding how nonlocal effects shape the global energy landscape. Here, we introduce peripheral surface information (PSI) entropy, a quantitative measure of the statistical variability in apolar and charged non-interacting surface (NIS) proportions across conformational ensembles. Using energy-directed molecular docking via HADDOCK3 and explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations, it is demonstrated that favorable binding partners exhibit emergent, low-entropy N-states (discrete macrostates in NIS state space) indicative of preferential apolar/charged surface configurations. Across dozens of peptides and multiple receptor systems (WW, PDZ, and MDM2 domains), dominant N-states persisted under varied docking parameters and initial conditions. An experimental meta-ensemble of WW domains from 36 high-resolution structures confirmed the presence of dominant NIS modes independent of in silico methodology, suggesting an evolutionary selection pressure toward specific NIS fingerprints. These findings establish PSI entropy as a thermoinformatic descriptor that encodes favorable binding constraints into unique statistical signatures of the NIS.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Zeroth-Order Mirror Descent via Vector Fields with A Posteriori Certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a deterministic zeroth-order mirror descent framework by replacing gradients with a general vector field, yielding a vector-field-driven mirror update that preserves Bregman geometry while accommodating derivative-free oracles. Our analysis provides a unified evaluation template for last-iterate function values under a relative-smoothness-type inequality, with an emphasis on trajectory-wise (a posteriori) certification: whenever a verifiable inequality holds along the realized iterates, we obtain explicit last-iterate guarantees. The framework subsumes a broad class of information-geometric algorithms, including generalized Blahut-Arimoto-type updates, by expressing their dynamics through suitable choices of the vector field. We then instantiate the theory with deterministic central finite differences in moderate dimension, where constructing the vector field via deterministic central finite differences requires 2d off-center function values (and one reusable center value), i.e., 2d+1 evaluations in total, where d is the number of input real numbers. In this deterministic finite-difference setting, the key interface property is not classical convexity alone but a punctured-neighborhood generalized star-convexity condition that isolates an explicit resolution-dependent error floor. Establishing this property for the finite-difference vector field reduces to a robust conic dominance design problem; we give an explicit scaling rule ensuring the required uniform dominance on a circular cone. Together, these results expose a hidden geometric structure linking Bregman telescoping identities, deterministic certification, and robust conic geometry in zeroth-order mirror descent.</description>

      <title>Hallucination is a Consequence of Space-Optimality: A Rate-Distortion Theorem for Membership Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models often hallucinate with high confidence on "random facts" that lack inferable patterns. We formalize the memorization of such facts as a membership testing problem, unifying the discrete error metrics of Bloom filters with the continuous log-loss of LLMs. By analyzing this problem in the regime where facts are sparse in the universe of plausible claims, we establish a rate-distortion theorem: the optimal memory efficiency is characterized by the minimum KL divergence between score distributions on facts and non-facts. This theoretical framework provides a distinctive explanation for hallucination: even with optimal training, perfect data, and a simplified "closed world" setting, the information-theoretically optimal strategy under limited capacity is not to abstain or forget, but to assign high confidence to some non-facts, resulting in hallucination. We validate this theory empirically on synthetic data, showing that hallucinations persist as a natural consequence of lossy compression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spectral moments of the Bures-Hall random matrices ensemble. The main result establishes a recurrence relation for the $k$-th spectral moment valid for a real-valued $k$, in contrast to prevailing results in the literature of different ensembles of assuming an integer $k$. The key to establish the recurrence relation is the obtained Christoffel-Darboux formulas of correlation kernels of the ensemble that avoid tedious summations. As an application of our spectral moment results, we re-derive the formulas of average von Neumann entropy and quantum purity of Bures-Hall ensemble conjectured by Ayana Sarkar and Santosh Kumar. This work is dedicated to the memory of Santosh Kumar.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent Chain-of-Thought (Latent CoT) models promise efficient reasoning via continuous representations, yet exhibit puzzling performance inconsistencies: excelling at exploration (ProsQA: 97.0%) but failing at computation (GSM8K: 34.1%). We reveal that this trade-off is governed by decisional certainty. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We theoretically characterize the fundamental Exploration-Execution Trade-off, proving that high certainty enables precise execution but inhibits exploration, while low certainty facilitates search but causes error accumulation. (2) We introduce the Symbolic Index--quantifying decisional commitment--as the core mechanism governing this trade-off and establish its causal relationship with both execution stability and exploration capability. (3) We prove that curriculum learning is theoretically necessary, as direct training provably fails due to distributional mismatch. Our framework shifts the design paradigm from binary architectural choices toward adaptive systems that dynamically regulate decisional certainty based on task demands.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Privacy and Stability with Generalization Guarantees in Quantum Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified information-theoretic framework to analyze the generalization performance of differentially private (DP) quantum learning algorithms. By leveraging the connection between privacy and algorithmic stability, we establish that $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-Quantum Differential Privacy (QDP) imposes a strong constraint on the mutual information between the training data and the algorithm's output. We derive a rigorous, mechanism-agnostic upper bound on this mutual information for learning algorithms satisfying a 1-neighbor privacy constraint. Furthermore, we connect this stability guarantee to generalization, proving that the expected generalization error of any $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-QDP learning algorithm is bounded by the square root of the privacy-induced stability term. Finally, we extend our framework to the setting of an untrusted Data Processor, introducing the concept of Information-Theoretic Admissibility (ITA) to characterize the fundamental limits of privacy in scenarios where the learning map itself must remain oblivious to the specific dataset instance.</description>

      <title>Approximating Univariate Factored Distributions via Message-Passing Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) commonly arise in communication systems, particularly in bilinear joint estimation and detection problems. Although the product of GMMs is still a GMM, as the number of factors increases, the number of components in the resulting product GMM grows exponentially. To obtain a tractable approximation for a univariate factored probability density function (PDF), such as a product of GMMs, we investigate iterative message-passing algorithms. Based on Belief Propagation (BP), we propose a Variable Duplication and Gaussian Belief Propagation (VDBP)-based algorithm. The key idea of VDBP is to construct a multivariate measurement model whose marginal posterior is equal to the given univariate factored PDF. We then apply Gaussian BP (GaBP) to transform the global inference problem into local ones. Expectation propagation (EP) is another branch of message passing algorithms. In addition to converting the global approximation problem into local ones, it features a projection operation that ensures the intermediate functions (messages) belong to a desired family. Due to this projection, EP can be used to approximate the factored PDF directly. However, even if every factor is integrable, the division operation in EP may still cause the algorithm to fail when the mean and variance of a non-integrable belief are required. Therefore, this paper proposes two methods that combine EP with our previously proposed techniques for handling non-integrable beliefs to approximate univariate factored distributions.</description>

Abstract: We construct locally recoverable codes with hierarchy from surfaces in $\mathbb{A}^3$ admitting a fibration by curves of Artin-Schreier or Kummer type. We derive the parameters of our codes by leveraging the geometry and arithmetic of the fibration, which is obtained by projection onto one of the coordinates. As a byproduct, we obtain estimates for (and in one case an explicit count of) the number of rational points in certain families of surfaces.</description>

      <title>Minimax optimal differentially private synthetic data for smooth queries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially private synthetic data enables the sharing and analysis of sensitive datasets while providing rigorous privacy guarantees for individual contributors. A central challenge is to achieve strong utility guarantees for meaningful downstream analysis. Many existing methods ensure uniform accuracy over broad query classes, such as all Lipschitz functions, but this level of generality often leads to suboptimal rates for statistics of practical interest. Since many common data analysis queries exhibit smoothness beyond what worst-case Lipschitz bounds capture, we ask whether exploiting this additional structure can yield improved utility.
  We study the problem of generating $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private synthetic data from a dataset of size $n$ supported on the hypercube $[-1,1]^d$, with utility guarantees uniformly for all smooth queries having bounded derivatives up to order $k$. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a minimax error rate of $n^{-\min \{1, \frac{k}{d}\}}$, up to a $\log(n)$ factor. This characterization uncovers a phase transition at $k=d$. Our results generalize the Chebyshev moment matching framework of (Musco et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2016) and strictly improve the error rates for $k$-smooth queries established in (Wang et al., 2016). Moreover, we establish the first minimax lower bound for the utility of $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private synthetic data with respect to $k$-smooth queries, extending the Wasserstein lower bound for $\varepsilon$-differential privacy in (Boedihardjo et al., 2024).</description>

      <title>Bandwidth-Efficient Multi-Agent Communication through Information Bottleneck and Vector Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning systems deployed in real-world robotics applications face severe communication constraints that significantly impact coordination effectiveness. We present a framework that combines information bottleneck theory with vector quantization to enable selective, bandwidth-efficient communication in multi-agent environments. Our approach learns to compress and discretize communication messages while preserving task-critical information through principled information-theoretic optimization. We introduce a gated communication mechanism that dynamically determines when communication is necessary based on environmental context and agent states. Experimental evaluation on challenging coordination tasks demonstrates that our method achieves 181.8% performance improvement over no-communication baselines while reducing bandwidth usage by 41.4%. Comprehensive Pareto frontier analysis shows dominance across the entire success-bandwidth spectrum with area-under-curve of 0.198 vs 0.142 for next-best methods. Our approach significantly outperforms existing communication strategies and establishes a theoretically grounded framework for deploying multi-agent systems in bandwidth-constrained environments such as robotic swarms, autonomous vehicle fleets, and distributed sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Functions: Optimal Sampling and Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider approximation or recovery of functions based on a finite number of function evaluations. This is a well-studied problem in optimal recovery, machine learning, and numerical analysis in general, but many fundamental insights were obtained only recently. We discuss different aspects of the information-theoretic limit that appears because of the limited amount of data available, as well as algorithms and sampling strategies that come as close to it as possible.
  We also discuss (optimal) sampling in a broader sense, allowing other types of measurements that may be nonlinear, adaptive and random, and present several relations between the different settings in the spirit of information-based complexity. We hope that this article provides both, a basic introduction to the subject and a contemporary summary of the current state of research.</description>

      <title>The Maximum von Neumann Entropy Principle: Theory and Applications in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Von Neumann entropy (VNE) is a fundamental quantity in quantum information theory and has recently been adopted in machine learning as a spectral measure of diversity for kernel matrices and kernel covariance operators. While maximizing VNE under constraints is well known in quantum settings, a principled analogue of the classical maximum entropy framework, particularly its decision theoretic and game theoretic interpretation, has not been explicitly developed for VNE in data driven contexts. In this paper, we extend the minimax formulation of the maximum entropy principle due to Gr\"unwald and Dawid to the setting of von Neumann entropy, providing a game-theoretic justification for VNE maximization over density matrices and trace-normalized positive semidefinite operators. This perspective yields a robust interpretation of maximum VNE solutions under partial information and clarifies their role as least committed inferences in spectral domains. We then illustrate how the resulting Maximum VNE principle applies to modern machine learning problems by considering two representative applications, selecting a kernel representation from multiple normalized embeddings via kernel-based VNE maximization, and completing kernel matrices from partially observed entries. These examples demonstrate how the proposed framework offers a unifying information-theoretic foundation for VNE-based methods in kernel learning.</description>

      <title>A Novel ISAC Waveform Based on Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing with FMCW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose the orthogonal delay-Doppler (DD) division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation with frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) (ODDM-FMCW) waveform to enable integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with a low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). We first propose a square-root-Nyquist-filtered FMCW (SRN-FMCW) waveform to address limitations of conventional linear FMCW waveforms in ISAC systems. To better integrate with ODDM, we generate SRN-FMCW by embedding symbols in the DD domain, referred to as a DD-SRN-FMCW frame. A DD chirp compression receiver is designed to obtain the channel response efficiently. Next, we construct the proposed ODDM-FMCW waveform for ISAC by superimposing a DD-SRN-FMCW frame onto an ODDM data frame. A comprehensive performance analysis of the ODDM-FMCW waveform is presented, covering peak-to-average power ratio, spectrum, ambiguity function, and Cramer-Rao bound for delay and Doppler estimation. Numerical results show that the proposed ODDM-FMCW waveform delivers excellent ISAC performance in terms of root mean square error for sensing and bit error rate for communications.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Federated Learning with SignSGD: A Highly Communication-Efficient Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) has emerged as a key architecture for large-scale wireless and Internet of Things systems, where devices communicate with nearby edge servers before reaching the cloud. In these environments, uplink bandwidth and latency impose strict communication limits, thereby making aggressive gradient compression essential. One-bit methods such as sign-based stochastic gradient descent (SignSGD) offer an attractive solution in flat federated settings, but existing theory and algorithms do not naturally extend to hierarchical settings. In particular, the interaction between majority-vote aggregation at the edge layer and model aggregation at the cloud layer, and its impact on end-to-end performance, remains unknown. To bridge this gap, we propose a highly communication-efficient sign-based HFL framework and develop its corresponding formulation for nonconvex learning, where devices send only signed stochastic gradients, edge servers combine them through majority-vote, and the cloud periodically averages the obtained edge models, while utilizing downlink quantization to broadcast the global model. We introduce the resulting scalable HFL algorithm, HierSignSGD, and provide the convergence analysis for SignSGD in a hierarchical setting. Our core technical contribution is a characterization of how biased sign compression, two-level aggregation intervals, and inter-cluster heterogeneity collectively affect convergence. Numerical experiments under homogeneous and heterogeneous data splits show that HierSignSGD, despite employing extreme compression, achieves accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision stochastic gradient descent while reducing communication cost in the process, and remains robust under aggressive downlink sparsification.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Continuous-Time Control and Filtering Limitations by the I-MMSE Relationships</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.00995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While information theory has been introduced to characterize the fundamental limitations of control and filtering for a few decades, the existing information-theoretic methods are indirect and cumbersome for analyzing the limitations of continuous-time systems. To answer this challenge, we lift the information-theoretic analysis to continuous function spaces by the I-MMSE relationships. Continuous-time control and filtering systems are modeled into the additive Gaussian channels with and without feedback, and the total information rate is identified as a control and filtering trade-off metric and calculated from the estimation error of channel inputs. Fundamental constraints for this trade-off metric are first derived in a general setup and then used to capture the limitations of various control and filtering systems subject to linear and nonlinear plant models. For linear scenarios, we show that the total information rate quantifies the performance limits, such as the minimum entropy cost and the lowest achievable mean-square estimation error, in the time domain. For nonlinear systems, we provide a direct method to calculate and interpret the total information rate and its lower bound by the Stratonovich-Kushner equation.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Data Significance in Remote Estimation of Discrete-State Markov Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider semantics-aware remote estimation of a discrete-state Markov source with both normal (low-priority) and alarm (high-priority) states. Erroneously announcing a normal state at the destination when the source is actually in an alarm state (i.e., missed alarm) incurs a significantly higher cost than falsely announcing an alarm state when the source is in a normal state (i.e., false alarm). Moreover, consecutive estimation errors may cause significant lasting impacts, such as maintenance costs and misoperations. Motivated by this, we introduce two new metrics, the Age of Missed Alarm (AoMA) and the Age of False Alarm (AoFA), to capture the lasting impacts incurred by different estimation errors. Notably, these two age processes evolve interdependently and distinguish between different error types. Our goal is to design a transmission policy that achieves an optimized trade-off between lasting impact and communication cost. The problem is formulated as a countably infinite-state Markov decision process (MDP) with an unbounded cost function. We show the existence of a simple switching policy with distinct thresholds for each age process and derive closed-form expressions for its performance. For symmetric and non-prioritized sources, we show that the optimal policy reduces to a threshold policy with identical thresholds. For numerical tractability, we propose a finite-state approximate MDP and prove that it converges exponentially fast to the original MDP in the truncation size. Finally, we develop an efficient search algorithm to compute the optimal switching policy and validate our theoretical findings with numerical results.</description>

      <title>SCAN-BEST: Sub-6GHz-Aided Near-field Beam Selection with Formal Reliability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13801v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems adopt larger antenna arrays, near-field propagation becomes increasingly prominent, especially for users close to the transmitter. Traditional far-field beam training methods become inadequate, while near-field training faces the challenge of large codebooks due to the need to resolve both angular and distance domains. To reduce in-band training overhead, prior work has proposed to leverage the spatial-temporal congruence between sub-6 GHz (sub-6G) and mmWave channels to predict the best mmWave beam within a near-field codebook from sub-6G channel estimates. To cope with the uncertainty caused by sub-6G/mmWave differences, we introduce a novel Sub-6G Channel Aided Near-field BEam SelecTion (SCAN-BEST) framework that wraps around any beam predictor to produce candidate beam subset with formal suboptimality guarantees. The proposed SCAN-BEST builds on conformal risk control (CRC), and is calibrated offline using limited calibration data. Its performance guarantees apply even in the presence of statistical shifts between calibration and deployment. Numerical results validate the theoretical properties and efficiency of SCAN-BEST.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming Optimization for MIMO ISAC based on Prior Distribution Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) with transceiver hybrid analog-digital arrays transmits dual-functional signals to communicate with a multi-antenna user and simultaneously sense the unknown and random location information of a target based on the reflected echo signals and the prior distribution information on the target's location. Under transceiver hybrid arrays, we characterize the sensing performance by deriving the posterior Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (PCRB) of the mean-squared error which is a function of the transmit hybrid beamforming and receive analog beamforming. We study joint transmit hybrid beamforming and receive analog beamforming optimization to minimize the PCRB subject to a communication rate requirement. We first consider a sensing-only system and derive the optimal solution to each element in the transmit/receive analog beamforming matrices that minimizes the PCRB in closed form. Then, we develop an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm. Next, we study a narrowband MIMO ISAC system and devise an efficient AO-based hybrid beamforming algorithm by leveraging weighted minimum mean-squared error and feasible point pursuit successive convex approximation methods. Furthermore, we extend the results for narrowband systems to a MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) ISAC system. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid beamforming designs. It is revealed that the number of receive RF chains has more significant impact on the sensing performance than its transmit counterpart. Under a given budget on the total number of transmit/receive RF chains at the BS, the optimal number of transmit RF chains increases as the communication rate target increases due to the non-trivial PCRB-rate trade-off.</description>

Abstract: The Low-Power Wake-Up Signal (LP-WUS) and Low-Power Synchronization Signal (LP-SS), introduced in 3GPP 5G-Advanced Release 19, mark an important advancement toward power-efficient IoT communications. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the LP-WUS procedures in the RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE states and summarizes the key physical-layer design aspects. The LP-WUS is intended to be detected by a low-power energy detector (ED), allowing the main radio (MR) to remain switched off, thereby enabling substantial power savings compared to conventional 5G paging mechanisms. As such, LP-WUS is considered the baseline for 6G WUS design. Furthermore, different receiver architectures are evaluated, highlighting the inherent trade-offs between power-saving gains and coverage performance.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on communication, radar search, and tracking task scheduling in multi-cell integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks under quality-of-service constraints. We propose a medium access control framework that multiplexes these tasks while optimizing radar scan patterns through an interference-aware scheduling algorithm. Specifically, the proposed framework employs time-domain task scheduling and beam selection, formulated as an assignment problem, to mitigate inter-task and inter-cell interference, respectively. Simulations show that our solution guarantees target communication throughput, sensing target detection probability, and sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio with improved resource efficiency over baseline schemes, highlighting the benefits of coordinated scheduling in multi-cell ISAC.</description>

      <title>FedLoDrop: Federated LoRA with Dropout for Generalized LLM Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning (FT) large language models (LLMs) is crucial for adapting general-purpose models to specific tasks, enhancing accuracy and relevance with minimal resources. To further enhance generalization ability while reducing training costs, this paper proposes Federated LoRA with Dropout (FedLoDrop), a new framework that applies dropout to the rows and columns of the trainable matrix in Federated LoRA. A generalization error bound and convergence analysis under sparsity regularization are obtained, which elucidate the fundamental trade-off between underfitting and overfitting. The error bound reveals that a higher dropout rate increases model sparsity, thereby lowering the upper bound of pointwise hypothesis stability (PHS). While this reduces the gap between empirical and generalization errors, it also incurs a higher empirical error, which, together with the gap, determines the overall generalization error. On the other hand, though dropout reduces communication costs, deploying FedLoDrop at the network edge still faces challenges due to limited network resources. To address this issue, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the upper bound of the generalization error, by jointly optimizing the dropout rate and resource allocation subject to the latency and per-device energy consumption constraints. To solve this problem, a branch-and-bound (B\&amp;B)-based method is proposed to obtain its globally optimal solution. Moreover, to reduce the high computational complexity of the B\&amp;B-based method, a penalized successive convex approximation (P-SCA)-based algorithm is proposed to efficiently obtain its high-quality suboptimal solution. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating overfitting and improving the generalization capability.</description>

      <title>Movable Signals with Dual-Polarized Fixed Intelligent Surfaces: Beyond Diagonal Reflection Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates wireless systems aided by dual-polarized intelligent surfaces. We compare reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which adjust their reflection matrices, with movable signals operating with fixed intelligent surface (FIS), which adjust the signal frequency while the surface properties remain fixed. For both RIS and FIS, we consider surfaces with a diagonal reflection matrix, named diagonal RIS/FIS, and surfaces with a reflection matrix not limited to being diagonal, named beyond-diagonal RIS/FIS. Movable signals with FIS always outperform RIS, achieving at least a fourfold gain. When transmitter and receiver polarizations differ, beyond-diagonal FIS further enhances performance.</description>

      <title>Multi-party Purity Distillation and Instrument Simulation in the One-Shot Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.12586v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of distributed multi-party purity distillation (PD) involving three parties in the one-shot regime. By obtaining a one-shot inner bound for the distributed instrument simulation problem that naturally generalizes to the best known asymptotic inner bound, and combining with a recent one-shot single party local purity concentration protocol, we design a one-shot multi-party PD protocol, analyze performance and derive a new inner bound. The derived inner bound naturally generalizes to the best known asymptotic inner bound.</description>

      <title>Spatiospectral localization within the ball -- studies on the influence of the spectral shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03543v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Slepian spatiospectral localization problem within subdomains of the $d$-dimensional ball. Opposed to the more classical setups of the Euclidean space or the sphere, the ball lacks a standard or universally accepted definition of bandwidth. Here, we consider a Fourier-Jacobi function system, decoupling the spherical and radial contributions via spherical harmonics and Jacobi polynomials. Special cases of this setup are of interest for various inverse problems in geophysics and medical imaging, since they relate to the underlying non-uniqueness, as well as in optics, where they represent the widely used Zernike polynomials. Bandwidth can be prescribed separately for the spherical and the radial contributions, where the particular choice of coupling between the two contributions determines the spectral shape, i.e., the overall notion of bandlimit. Understanding the effects of the spectral shape on the eigenvalue distribution of the Slepian spatiospectral localization problem can provide hints on particularly suitable notions of bandwidth for different applications. We provide rigorous asymptotic results for the spectral shape being defined via the overall polynomial degree as well as for being defined via sequential limits for the spherical and radial contributions. For various other spectral shapes, we provide numerical illustrations of the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution. Furthermore, we demonstrate a direct connection of the spectral shape to common indexing schemes for Zernike polynomials.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit and Pinching Beamforming for Pinching Antenna Systems (PASS): Optimization-Based or Learning-Based?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08637v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel pinching antenna system (PASS)-enabled downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) framework is proposed. PASS consists of multiple waveguides spanning over thousands of wavelength, which equip numerous low-cost dielectric particles, named pinching antennas (PAs), to radiate signals into free space. The positions of PAs can be reconfigured to change both the large-scale path losses and phases of signals, thus facilitating the novel pinching beamforming design. A sum rate maximization problem is formulated, which jointly optimizes the transmit and pinching beamforming to adaptively achieve constructive signal enhancement and destructive interference mitigation. To solve this highly coupled and nonconvex problem, both optimization-based and learning-based methods are proposed. 1) For the optimization-based method, a majorization-minimization and penalty dual decomposition (MM-PDD) algorithm is developed, which handles the nonconvex complex exponential component using a Lipschitz surrogate function and then invokes PDD for problem decoupling. 2) For the learning-based method, a novel Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-guided dual learning (KDL) approach is proposed, which enables KKT solutions to be reconstructed in a data-driven manner by learning dual variables. Following this idea, a KDL-Transformer algorithm is developed, which captures both inter-PA/inter-user dependencies and channel-state-information (CSI)-beamforming dependencies by attention mechanisms. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) The proposed PASS framework significantly outperforms conventional massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system even with a few PAs. ii) The proposed KDL-Transformer can improve over 20% system performance than MM-PDD algorithm, while achieving a millisecond-level response on modern GPUs.</description>

      <title>The Nuclear Route: Sharp Asymptotics of ERM in Overparameterized Quadratic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the high-dimensional asymptotics of empirical risk minimization (ERM) in over-parametrized two-layer neural networks with quadratic activations trained on synthetic data. We derive sharp asymptotics for both training and test errors by mapping the $\ell_2$-regularized learning problem to a convex matrix sensing task with nuclear norm penalization. This reveals that capacity control in such networks emerges from a low-rank structure in the learned feature maps. Our results characterize the global minima of the loss and yield precise generalization thresholds, showing how the width of the target function governs learnability. This analysis bridges and extends ideas from spin-glass methods, matrix factorization, and convex optimization and emphasizes the deep link between low-rank matrix sensing and learning in quadratic neural networks.</description>

      <title>Bayes optimal learning of attention-indexed models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the attention-indexed model (AIM), a theoretical framework for analyzing learning in deep attention layers. Inspired by multi-index models, AIM captures how token-level outputs emerge from layered bilinear interactions over high-dimensional embeddings. Unlike prior tractable attention models, AIM allows full-width key and query matrices, aligning more closely with practical transformers. Using tools from statistical mechanics and random matrix theory, we derive closed-form predictions for Bayes-optimal generalization error and identify sharp phase transitions as a function of sample complexity, model width, and sequence length. We propose a matching approximate message passing algorithm and show that gradient descent can reach optimal performance. AIM offers a solvable playground for understanding learning in self-attention layers, that are key components of modern architectures.</description>

      <title>Single-Head Attention in High Dimensions: A Theory of Generalization, Weights Spectra, and Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trained attention layers exhibit striking and reproducible spectral structure of the weights, including low-rank collapse, bulk deformation, and isolated spectral outliers, yet the origin of these phenomena and their implications for generalization remain poorly understood. We study empirical risk minimization in a single-head tied-attention layer trained on synthetic high-dimensional sequence tasks generated from the attention-indexed model. Using tools from random matrix theory, spin-glass theory, and approximate message passing, we obtain an exact high-dimensional characterization of training and test error, interpolation and recovery thresholds, and the spectrum of the key and query matrices. Our theory predicts the full singular-value distribution of the trained query-key map, including low-rank structure and isolated spectral outliers, in qualitative agreement with observations in more realistic transformers. Finally, for targets with power-law spectra, we show that learning proceeds through sequential spectral recovery, leading to the emergence of power-law scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Isogeny Graphs in Superposition and Quantum Onion Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Onion routing provides anonymity by layering encryption so that no relay can link sender to destination. A quantum analogue faces a core obstacle: layered quantum encryption generally requires symmetric encryption schemes, whereas classically one would rely on public-key encryption. We propose a symmetric-encryption-based quantum onion routing (QOR) scheme by instantiating each layer with the abelian ideal class group action from the Theory of Complex Multiplication. Session keys are established locally via a Diffie-Hellman key exchange between neighbors in the chain of communication. Furthermore, we propose a novel ''non-local'' key exchange between the sender and receiver. The underlying problem remains hard even for quantum adversaries and underpins the security of current post-quantum schemes. We connect our construction to isogeny graphs and their association schemes, using the Bose-Mesner algebra to formalize commutativity and guide implementation. We give two implementation paths: (i) a universal quantum oracle evaluating the class group action with polynomially many quantum resources, and (ii) an intrinsically quantum approach via continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs), outlined here and developed in a companion paper. A small Qiskit example illustrates the mechanics (by design, not the efficiency) of the QOR.</description>

      <title>Increasing Data Rate through Shaping on Wireless Channels Subject to Mobility and Delay Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter describes how to improve performance of cellular systems by combining non-equiprobable signaling (shaping) with low-density parity check (LDPC) coding for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system. We focus on improving performance at the cell edge, where the 5G standard specifies a suite of LDPC codes with different rates that are applied to 4-QAM. We employ the method of shaping on rings which adds to the transmission rate as it shapes the input distribution. We double the size of the $4$-QAM constellation by introducing a second shell of signal points, and we implement non-equiprobable signaling through a shaping code which selects the high energy shell less frequently than the low energy shell. We describe how to combine coding and shaping by integrating shaping into the calculation of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) necessary for decoding LDPC codes. We employ rate $1/2$ LDPC coding and select the rate of the shaping code to match that of rate $3/4$ LDPC coding using $4$-QAM. We present simulation results for a representative Veh-A channel showing gains of $4$ dB at a bit error rate (BER) of $10^{-3}$. When we choose an LDPC code from the 5G suite to match the BER performance of rate $1/2$ LDPC coding with shaping we show that transmission rate can be improved by $20 $%.</description>

      <title>The augmented NLP bound for maximum-entropy remote sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The maximum-entropy remote sampling problem (MERSP) is to select a subset of s random variables from a set of n random variables, so as to maximize the information concerning a set of target random variables that are not directly observable. We assume throughout that the set of all of these random variables follows a joint Gaussian distribution, and that we have the covariance matrix available. Finally, we measure information using Shannon's differential entropy.
  The main approach for exact solution of moderate-sized instances of MERSP has been branch-and-bound, and so previous work concentrated on upper bounds. Prior to our work, there were two upper-bounding methods for MERSP: the so-called NLP bound and the spectral bound, both introduced 25 years ago. We are able now to establish domination results between these two upper bounds. We propose an ``augmented NLP bound'' based on a subtle convex relaxation. We provide theoretical guarantees, giving sufficient conditions under which the augmented NLP bound strictly dominates the ordinary NLP bound. In addition, the augmented NLP formulation allows us to derive upper bounds for rank-deficient covariance matrices when they satisfy a technical condition. This is in contrast to the earlier work on the ordinary NLP bound that worked with only positive definite covariance matrices. Finally, we introduce a novel and very effective diagonal-scaling technique for MERSP, employing a positive vector of parameters. Numerical experiments on benchmark instances demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in advancing the state of the art for calculating upper bounds on MERSP.</description>
