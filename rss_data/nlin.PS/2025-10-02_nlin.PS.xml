      <title>Discrete Nonlinear Schr\"odinger versus Ablowitz-Ladik: Existence and dynamics of generalized NLS-type lattices over a nonzero background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of well-posedness of the generalized Ablowitz-Ladik and Discrete Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations with \textit{nonzero} boundary conditions on the infinite lattice is far less understood than in the case where the models are supplemented with vanishing boundary conditions. This question remains largely unexplored even in the standard case of cubic nonlinearities in which, in particular, the Ablowitz-Ladik equation is completely integrable while the Discrete Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation is not (in contrast with its continuous counterpart). We establish local well-posedness for both of these generalized nonlinear systems supplemented with a broad class of nonzero boundary conditions and, in addition, derive analytical upper bounds for the minimal guaranteed lifespan of their solutions. These bounds depend explicitly on the norm of the initial data, the background, and the nonlinearity exponents. In particular, they suggest the possibility of finite-time collapse (blow-up) of solutions. Furthermore, by comparing models with different nonlinearity exponents, we prove estimates for the distance between their respective solutions (measured in suitable metrics), valid up to their common minimal guaranteed lifespan. Highly accurate numerical studies illustrate that solutions of the generalized Ablowitz-Ladik equation may collapse in finite time. Importantly, the numerically observed blow-up time is in excellent agreement with the theoretically predicted order of the minimal guaranteed lifespan. Furthermore, in the case of the Discrete Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a finite lattice we prove global existence of solutions; this is consistent with our numerical observations of the phenomenon of \textit{quasi-collapse}, manifested by narrow oscillatory spikes that nevertheless persist throughout time -- continued in pdf ...</description>

      <title>Pattern formation of generalized fuzzy elementary cellular automaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general method for constructing a fuzzy cellular automaton from a given cellular automaton. Unlike previous approaches that use fuzzy distinctive normal form, whose update function is restricted to third-order polynomials, our method accommodates a wide range of fuzzification functions, enabling the generation of diverse and complex time-evolution patterns that are unattainable with simpler heuristic models. We demonstrate that phase transitions in pattern formation can be observed by changing the parameters of the fuzzification function or the mixing ratio between two distinct evolution rules of elementary cellular automata. Remarkably, the resulting generalized fuzzy elementary cellular automata exhibit rich dynamical properties, including stable manifolds and chaos, even in minimal systems composed of just three cells.</description>

      <title>Early warning of critical transitions: distinguishing tipping points from Turing destabilizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current early warning signs for tipping points often fail to distinguish between catastrophic shifts and less dramatic state changes, such as spatial pattern formation. This paper introduces a novel method that addresses this limitation by providing more information about the type of bifurcation being approached starting from a spatially homogeneous system state. This method relies on estimates of the dispersion relation from noisy spatio-temporal data, which reveals whether the system is approaching a spatially homogeneous (tipping) or spatially heterogeneous (Turing patterning) bifurcation. Using a modified Klausmeier model, we validate this method on synthetic data, exploring its performance under varying conditions including noise properties and distance to bifurcation. We also determine the data requirements for optimal performance. Our results indicate the promise of a new spatial early warning system built on this method to improve predictions of future transitions in many climate subsystems and ecosystems, which is critical for effective conservation and management in a rapidly changing world.</description>
