      <title>Marine spatial planning techniques with a case study on wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As emerging marine technologies lead to the development of new infrastructure across the ocean, they enter an environment that existing ecosystems and industries already rely on. Although necessary to provide sustainable sources of energy and food, careful planning will be important to make informed decisions and avoid conflicts. This paper examines several techniques used for marine spatial planning, an approach for analyzing and planning the use of marine resources. Using open source software including QGIS and Python, the potential for developing wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms using the RM3 wave energy converter along the Northeast coast of the United States is assessed and several feasible sites are identified. The optimal site, located at 43.7{\deg}N, 68.9{\deg}W along the coast of Maine, has a total cost for a 5-pen farm of $56.8M, annual fish yield of 676 tonnes, and a levelized cost of fish of $9.23 per kilogram. Overall trends indicate that the cost greatly decreases with distance to shore due to the greater availability of wave energy and that conflicts and environmental constraints significantly limit the number of feasible sites in this region.</description>

      <title>The Typicality of Regimes Associated with Northern Hemisphere Heatwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hemispheric to continental scale regimes that lead to summertime heatwaves in the Northern Hemisphere. By using a powerful data mining methodology - archetype analysis - we identify characteristic spatial patterns consisting of a blocking high pressure systems embedded within a meandering upper atmosphere circulation that is longitudinally modulated by coherent Rossby Wave Packets. Periods when these atmospheric regimes are strongly expressed correspond to large increases in the likelihood of extreme surface temperature. Most strikingly, these regimes are shown to be typical of surface extremes and frequently reoccur. Three well publicised heatwaves are studied in detail - the June-July 2003 western European heatwave, the August 2010 "Russian" heatwave, and the June 2021 "Heatdome" event across western North America, and are shown to be driven by blocking high pressure systems linked to stalled Rossby Wave Packets. We discuss the implications of our work for long-range prediction or early warning, climate model assessment and post-event diagnosis.</description>

      <title>The Reality of Climate Change: Evidence, Impacts and Engineering Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change is one of the most significant global challenges, yet misconceptions persist regarding its causes and impact. This report addresses common myths surrounding climate change and presents scientific evidence to clarify its reality. Utilising data from NASA, NOAA, and the NSW government, this study provides evidence of rising global temperatures, melting ice sheets, rising sea levels, and extreme weather patterns in regions like New South Wales. The analysis demonstrates the human-driven nature of climate change, primarily caused by increased carbon emissions. Engineering solutions, including renewable energy technologies, green buildings, and carbon capture methods, are essential to mitigating the effects of climate change. Future research should focus on improving the scalability of these technologies and addressing the broader impact on ecosystems and human societies.</description>

      <title>"The Simplest Idea One Can Have" for Seamless Forecasts with Postprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seamless forecasts are based on a combination of different sources to produce the best possible forecasts. Statistical multimodel postprocessing helps to combine various sources to achieve these seamless forecasts. However, when one of the combined sources of the forecast is not available due to reaching the end of its forecasting horizon, forecasts can be temporally inconsistent and sudden drops in skill can be observed. To obtain a seamless forecast, the output of multimodel postprocessing is often blended across these transitions, although this unnecessarily worsens the forecasts immediately before the transition. Additionally, large differences between the latest observation and the first forecasts can be present. This paper presents an idea to preserve a smooth temporal prediction until the end of the forecast range and increase its predictability. This optimal seamless forecast is simply accomplished by not excluding any model from the multimodel by using the latest possible lead time as model persistence into the future. Furthermore, the gap between the latest available observation and the first model step is seamlessly closed with the persistence of the observation by using the latest observation as additional predictor. With this idea, no visible jump in forecasts is observed and the verification presents a seamless quality in terms of scores. The benefit of accounting for observation and forecast persistence in multimodel postprocessing is illustrated using a simple temperature example with linear regression but can also be extended to other predictors and postprocessing methods.</description>

      <title>On the parameters of common settling velocity models for porous sediment aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The settling behavior of sediment aggregates is a critical factor influencing the transport of fine-grained sediments in riverine and marine environments. Due to the small size and fragile structure of cohesive sediment aggregates, direct measurement of their porosity and permeability is challenging. While porosity is often estimated using settling velocity relations, permeability is frequently overlooked. This study examines the impact of considering non-negligible permeability on the properties of flocs. We compare aggregate properties by calibrating experimental data to two settling models in a dilute regime: one assumes a fractal structure of aggregates and neglects permeability, while the other assumes constant porosity and permeability. Our results demonstrate that both models describe the experimental data of highly porous aggregates with similar accuracy. We further investigate aggregate dynamics in more complex flow conditions using numerical simulations employing a volume penalization method to geometrically resolve flocs. We compare the behavior of permeable and impermeable flocs in dense suspension regimes and during dilute settling in density-stratified environments. Our findings reveal that permeability significantly influences settling dynamics in complex scenarios and should be considered when determining aggregate properties.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of an AI-based climate model through the lens of a heatwave storyline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI-based weather and climate models are emerging as accurate and computationally efficient tools. Beyond weather forecasting, they also show promise to accelerate storyline analyses. We rigorously evaluate NeuralGCM's ability to reproduce an extreme heatwave against physics-based climate model hindcasts. NeuralGCM accurately replicates the targeted event, and generates stable and realistic mid-century projections. However, due to the absence of land feedbacks, NeuralGCM underestimates the projected warming amplitude compared to physics-based model benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Towards Physically Consistent Deep Learning For Climate Model Parameterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03920v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate models play a critical role in understanding and projecting climate change. Due to their complexity, their horizontal resolution of about 40-100 km remains too coarse to resolve processes such as clouds and convection, which need to be approximated via parameterizations. These parameterizations are a major source of systematic errors and large uncertainties in climate projections. Deep learning (DL)-based parameterizations, trained on data from computationally expensive short, high-resolution simulations, have shown great promise for improving climate models in that regard. However, their lack of interpretability and tendency to learn spurious non-physical correlations result in reduced trust in the climate simulation. We propose an efficient supervised learning framework for DL-based parameterizations that leads to physically consistent models with improved interpretability and negligible computational overhead compared to standard supervised training. First, key features determining the target physical processes are uncovered. Subsequently, the neural network is fine-tuned using only those relevant features. We show empirically that our method robustly identifies a small subset of the inputs as actual physical drivers, therefore removing spurious non-physical relationships. This results in by design physically consistent and interpretable neural networks while maintaining the predictive performance of unconstrained black-box DL-based parameterizations.</description>
