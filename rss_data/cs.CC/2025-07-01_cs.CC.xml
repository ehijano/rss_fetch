      <title>Closure under factorization from a result of Furstenberg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that algebraic formulas and constant-depth circuits are closed under taking factors. In other words, we show that if a multivariate polynomial over a field of characteristic zero has a small constant-depth circuit or formula, then all its factors can be computed by small constant-depth circuits or formulas respectively.
  Our result turns out to be an elementary consequence of a fundamental and surprising result of Furstenberg from the 1960s, which gives a non-iterative description of the power series roots of a bivariate polynomial. Combined with standard structural ideas in algebraic complexity, we observe that this theorem yields the desired closure results.
  As applications, we get alternative (and perhaps simpler) proofs of various known results and strengthen the quantitative bounds in some of them. This includes a unified proof of known closure results for algebraic models (circuits, branching programs and VNP), an extension of the analysis of the Kabanets-Impagliazzo hitting set generator to formulas and constant-depth circuits, and a (significantly) simpler proof of correctness as well as stronger guarantees on the output in the subexponential time deterministic algorithm for factorization of constant-depth circuits from a recent work of Bhattacharjee, Kumar, Ramanathan, Saptharishi &amp; Saraf.</description>

      <title>Constant-depth circuits for polynomial GCD over any characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the GCD of two univariate polynomials can be computed by (piece-wise) algebraic circuits of constant depth and polynomial size over any sufficiently large field, regardless of the characteristic. This extends a recent result of Andrews &amp; Wigderson who showed such an upper bound over fields of zero or large characteristic.
  Our proofs are based on a recent work of Bhattacharjee, Kumar, Rai, Ramanathan, Saptharishi \&amp; Saraf that shows closure of constant depth algebraic circuits under factorization. On our way to the proof, we show that any $n$-variate symmetric polynomial $P$ that has a small constant depth algebraic circuit can be written as the composition of a small constant depth algebraic circuit with elementary symmetric polynomials. This statement is a constant depth version of a result of Bl\"{a}ser &amp; Jindal, who showed this for algebraic circuits of unbounded depth. As an application of our techniques, we also strengthen the closure results for factors of constant-depth circuits in the work of Bhattacharjee et al. over fields for small characteristic.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Small Circuit Classes from FAC^0 to FAC^1 via Discrete Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a uniform framework for investigating small circuit classes and bounds through the lens of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Following an approach recently introduced to capture the class of polynomial-time computable functions via ODE-based recursion schemas and later applied to the context of functions computed by unbounded fan-in circuits of constant depth (FAC^0), we study multiple relevant small circuit classes. In particular, we show that natural restrictions on linearity and derivation along functions with specific growth rate correspond to kinds of functions that can be proved to be in various classes, ranging from FAC^0 to FAC^1. This reveals an intriguing link between constraints over linear-length ODEs and circuit computation, providing new tools to tackle the complex challenge of establishing bounds for classes in the circuit hierarchies and possibly enhancing our understanding of the role of counters in this setting. Additionally, we establish several completeness results, in particular obtaining the first ODE-based characterizations for the classes of functions computable in constant depth with unbounded fan-in and Mod 2 gates (FACC[2]) and in logarithmic depth with bounded fan-in Boolean gates (FNC1).</description>

      <title>Tight Additive Sensitivity on LZ-style Compressors and String Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The worst-case additive sensitivity of a string repetitiveness measure $c$ is defined to be the largest difference between $c(w)$ and $c(w')$, where $w$ is a string of length $n$ and $w'$ is a string that can be obtained by performing a single-character edit operation on $w$. We present $O(\sqrt{n})$ upper bounds for the worst-case additive sensitivity of the smallest string attractor size $\gamma$ and the smallest bidirectional scheme size $b$, which match the known lower bounds $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ for $\gamma$ and $b$ [Akagi et al. 2023]. Further, we present matching upper and lower bounds for the worst-case additive sensitivity of the Lempel-Ziv family - $\Theta(n^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for LZSS and LZ-End, and $\Theta(n)$ for LZ78.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Critical Node Cut Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and integers $k, x \geq 0$, the Critical Node Cut problem asks whether it is possible to delete at most $k$ vertices from $G$ such that the number of remaining pairs of connected vertices is at most $x$. This problem generalizes Vertex Cover (when $x = 0$), and has applications in network design, epidemiology, and social network analysis. We investigate the parameterized complexity of Critical Node Cut under various structural parameters. We first significantly strengthen existing hardness results by proving W[1]-hardness even when parameterized by the combined parameter $k + \mathrm{fes} + \Delta + \mathrm{pw}$, where $\mathrm{fes}$ is the feedback edge set number, $\Delta$ the maximum degree, and $\mathrm{pw}$ the pathwidth of the input graph. We then identify three structural parameters--max-leaf number, vertex integrity, and modular-width--that render the problem fixed-parameter tractable. Furthermore, leveraging a technique introduced by Lampis [ICALP '14], we develop an FPT approximation scheme that, for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate solution in time $(\mathrm{tw} / \varepsilon)^{\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{tw})} n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, where $\mathrm{tw}$ denotes the treewidth of the input graph. Finally, we show that Critical Node Cut does not admit a polynomial kernel when parameterized by vertex cover number, unless standard complexity assumptions fail. Overall, our results significantly sharpen the known complexity landscape of Critical Node Cut.</description>

      <title>A Graph Width Perspective on Partially Ordered Hamiltonian Paths and Cycles I: Treewidth, Pathwidth, and Grid Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path or a Hamiltonian cycle with precedence constraints in the form of a partial order on the vertex set. We show that the path problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete for graphs of pathwidth 4 while the cycle problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete on graphs of pathwidth 5. We complement these results by giving polynomial-time algorithms for graphs of pathwidth 3 and treewidth 2 for Hamiltonian paths as well as pathwidth 4 and treewidth 3 for Hamiltonian cycles. Furthermore, we study the complexity of the path and cycle problems on rectangular grid graphs of bounded height. For these, we show that the path and cycle problems are $\mathsf{NP}$-complete when the height of the grid is greater or equal to 7 and 9, respectively. In the variant where we look for minimum edge-weighted Hamiltonian paths and cycles, the problems are $\mathsf{NP}$-hard for heights 5 and 6, respectively.</description>

      <title>Segmented Operations using Matrix Multiplications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Specialized computational units that perform small matrix multiplications as primitive operations are typically present in modern accelerators. However, these units are often underutilized for many fundamental operations besides dense matrix multiplications. The analysis of algorithms for such architectures is currently stagnated due to the lack of a rigorous theoretical model of computation that captures their characteristics. In this work, we propose MMV-RAM, a computational model tailored to matrix multiplication accelerators. MMV-RAM judiciously extends the Vector-RAM model with an additional processing unit that multiplies two matrices of sizes $n\times s$ and $s\times s$ in a single parallel step, where $s$ is a model parameter. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the model, and carefully balance the computational power between the matrix and vector units, guided by the circuit complexity lower bound that parity is not in AC[0].
  In MMV-RAM, we study algorithms for segmented scan and sum, two fundamental parallel primitives. We propose a segmented scan algorithm that uses matrix multiplications to perform speculative block-scan computations, which runs in $O(\log_s(n))$ steps. In contrast, we show that any algorithm that uses only the vector unit of MMV-RAM requires $\Omega\left(\frac{\log_2(n)}{\log_2\log_2(n)}\right)$ steps. We further apply these techniques to obtain similar theoretical speedups for element-wise vector multiplication and matrix multiplication. Beyond the worst-case complexity analysis, we propose algorithms for segmented operations that could lead to highly efficient and pragmatic implementations. For example, we observe that segmented sum is a combination of three elementary parallel primitives: scan, compress, and vector differentiation. As a case study, we implement...</description>

      <title>Factorization norms and an inverse theorem for MaxCut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that Boolean matrices with bounded $\gamma_2$-norm or bounded normalized trace norm must contain a linear-sized all-ones or all-zeros submatrix, verifying a conjecture of Hambardzumyan, Hatami, and Hatami. We also present further structural results about Boolean matrices of bounded $\gamma_2$-norm and discuss applications in communication complexity, operator theory, spectral graph theory, and extremal combinatorics.
  As a key application, we establish an inverse theorem for MaxCut. A celebrated result of Edwards states that every graph $G$ with $m$ edges has a cut of size at least $\frac{m}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{8m+1}-1}{8}$, with equality achieved by complete graphs with an odd number of vertices. To contrast this, we prove that if the MaxCut of $G$ is at most $\frac{m}{2}+O(\sqrt{m})$, then $G$ must contain a clique of size $\Omega(\sqrt{m})$.</description>

      <title>Fantastic Flips and Where to Find Them: A General Framework for Parameterized Local Search on Partitioning Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameterized local search combines classic local search heuristics with the paradigm of parameterized algorithmics. While most local search algorithms aim to improve given solutions by performing one single operation on a given solution, the parameterized approach aims to improve a solution by performing $k$ simultaneous operations. Herein, $k$ is a parameter called search radius for which the value can be chosen by a user. One major goal in the field of parameterized local search is to outline the trade-off between the size of $k$ and the running time of the local search step. In this work, we introduce an abstract framework that generalizes natural parameterized local search approaches for a large class of partitioning problems: Given $n$ items that are partitioned into $b$ bins and a target function that evaluates the quality of the current partition, one asks whether it is possible to improve the solution by removing up to $k$ items from their current bins and reassigning them to other bins. Among others, our framework applies for the local search versions of problems like Cluster Editing, Vector Bin Packing, and Nash Social Welfare. Motivated by a real-world application of the problem Vector Bin Packing, we introduce a parameter called number of types $\tau \le n$ and show that all problems fitting in our framework can be solved in $\tau^k 2^{O(k)} |I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $|I|$ denotes the total input size. In case of Cluster Editing, the parameter $\tau$ generalizes the well-known parameter neighborhood diversity of the input graph. We complement this by showing that for all considered problems, an algorithm significantly improving over our algorithm with running time $\tau^k 2^{O(k)} |I|^{O(1)}$ would contradict the ETH. Additionally, we show that even on very restricted instances, all considered problems are W[1]-hard when parameterized by the search radius $k$ alone.</description>

      <title>Dominating Set Knapsack: Profit Optimization on Dominating Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a large-scale network, we want to choose some influential nodes to make a profit by paying some cost within a limited budget so that we do not have to spend more budget on some nodes adjacent to the chosen nodes; our problem is the graph-theoretic representation of it. We define our problem Dominating Set Knapsack by attaching Knapsack Problem with Dominating Set on graphs. Each vertex is associated with a cost factor and a profit amount. We aim to choose some vertices within a fixed budget that gives maximum profit so that we do not need to choose their 1-hop neighbors. We show that the Dominating Set Knapsack problem is strongly NP-complete even when restricted to Bipartite graphs but weakly NP-complete for Star graphs. We present a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for Trees in time $O(n\cdot min\{s^2, (\alpha(V))^2\})$. We show that Dominating Set Knapsack is very unlikely to be Fixed Parameter Tractable(FPT) by proving that it is in W[2]-hard parameterized by the solution size. We developed FPT algorithms with running time $O(4^{tw}\cdot n^{O(1)} \cdot min\{s^2,{\alpha(V)}^2\})$ and $O(2^{vck-1}\cdot n^{O(1)} \cdot min\{s^2,{\alpha(V)}^2\})$, where $tw$ represents the treewidth of the given graph, $vck$ is the solution size of the Vertex Cover Knapsack, $s$ is the size of the knapsack and $\alpha(V)=\sum_{v\in V}\alpha(v)$.</description>

      <title>Randomized Communication and Implicit Graph Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.03639v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the focused study of constant-cost randomized communication, with emphasis on its connection to graph representations. We observe that constant-cost randomized communication problems are equivalent to hereditary (i.e. closed under taking induced subgraphs) graph classes which admit constant-size adjacency sketches and probabilistic universal graphs (PUGs), which are randomized versions of the well-studied adjacency labeling schemes and induced-universal graphs. This gives a new perspective on long-standing questions about the existence of these objects, including new methods of constructing adjacency labeling schemes.
  We ask three main questions about constant-cost communication, or equivalently, constant-size PUGs: (1) Are there any natural, non-trivial problems aside from Equality and k-Hamming Distance which have constant-cost communication? We provide a number of new examples, including deciding whether two vertices have path-distance at most k in a planar graph, and showing that constant-size PUGs are preserved by the Cartesian product operation. (2) What structures of a problem explain the existence or non-existence of a constant-cost protocol? We show that in many cases a Greater-Than subproblem is such a structure. (3) Is the Equality problem complete for constant-cost randomized communication? We show that it is not: there are constant-cost problems which do not reduce to Equality.</description>

      <title>The Parameterized Landscape of Labeled Graph Contractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of computing a maximum common contraction of two vertex-labeled graphs, i.e. how to make them identical by contracting as little edges as possible in the two graphs. We study the problem from a parameterized complexity point of view, using parameters such as the maximum degree, the degeneracy, the clique-width or treewidth of the input graphs as well as the number of allowed contractions. We put this complexity in perspective with that of the labeled contractibility problem, i.e determining whether a labeled graph is a contraction of another. Surprisingly, our results indicate very little difference between these problems in terms of parameterized complexity status. We only prove their status to differ when parameterizing by both the degeneracy and the number of allowed contractions, showing W[1]-hardness of the maximum common contraction problem in this case, whereas the contractibility problem is FPT.</description>

      <title>New aspects of quantum topological data analysis: Betti number estimation, and testing and tracking of homology and cohomology classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of quantum computation to topological data analysis (TDA) has received growing attention. While estimating Betti numbers is a central task in TDA, general complexity theoretic limitations restrict the possibility of quantum speedups. To address this, we explore quantum algorithms under a more structured input model. We show that access to additional topological information enables improved quantum algorithms for estimating Betti and persistent Betti numbers. Building on this, we introduce a new approach based on homology tracking, which avoids computing the kernel of combinatorial Laplacians used in prior methods. This yields a framework that remains efficient even when Betti numbers are small, offering substantial and sometimes exponential speedups. Beyond Betti number estimation, we formulate and study the homology property testing problem, and extend our approach to the cohomological setting. We present quantum algorithms for testing triviality and distinguishing homology classes, revealing new avenues for quantum advantage in TDA.</description>

  We first extend the notions of the {\it probabilistic pushdown systems} and {\it Markov chains} to their quantum analogues and investigate the question of whether it is necessary to define a quantum analogue of {\it probabilistic computational tree logic} to describe the probabilistic and branching-time properties of the {\it quantum Markov chain}. We study its model-checking question and show that model-checking of {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems (qBPA)} against {\it probabilistic computational tree logic (PCTL)} is generally undecidable, i.e., there exists no algorithm for model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\it probabilistic computational tree logic}.
  We then study in which case there exists an algorithm for model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} and show that the problem of model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\it bounded probabilistic computational tree logic} (bPCTL) is decidable, and further show that this problem is in $NP$-complete. Our reduction is from the {\it bounded Post Correspondence Problem} for the first time, a well-known $NP$-complete problem.</description>
