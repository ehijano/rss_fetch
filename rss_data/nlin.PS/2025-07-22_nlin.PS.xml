      <title>A finite difference method with symmetry properties for the high-dimensional Bratu equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12553v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving the three-dimensional (3D) Bratu equation is highly challenging due to the presence of multiple and sharp solutions. Research on this equation began in the late 1990s, but there are no satisfactory results to date. To address this issue, we introduce a symmetric finite difference method (SFDM) which embeds the symmetry properties of the solutions into a finite difference method (FDM). This SFDM is primarily used to obtain more accurate solutions and bifurcation diagrams for the 3D Bratu equation. Additionally, we propose modifying the Bratu equation by incorporating a new constraint that facilitates the construction of bifurcation diagrams and simplifies handling the turning points. The proposed method, combined with the use of sparse matrix representation, successfully solves the 3D Bratu equation on grids of up to $301^3$ points. The results demonstrate that SFDM outperforms all previously employed methods for the 3D Bratu equation. Furthermore, we provide bifurcation diagrams for the 1D, 2D, 4D, and 5D cases, and accurately identify the first turning points in all dimensions. All simulations indicate that the bifurcation diagrams of the Bratu equation on the cube domains closely resemble the well-established behavior on the ball domains described by Joseph and Lundgren [1]. Furthermore, when SFDM is applied to linear stability analysis, it yields the same largest real eigenvalue as the standard FDM despite having fewer equations and variables in the nonlinear system.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for high-dimensional solutions and snaking bifurcations in nonlinear lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for addressing key challenges in nonlinear lattices, including solution approximation, bifurcation diagram construction, and linear stability analysis. We first employ PINNs to approximate solutions of nonlinear systems arising from lattice models, using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to optimize network weights for greater accuracy. To enhance computational efficiency in high-dimensional settings, we integrate a stochastic sampling strategy. We then extend the method by coupling PINNs with a continuation approach to compute snaking bifurcation diagrams, incorporating an auxiliary equation to effectively track successive solution branches. For linear stability analysis, we adapt PINNs to compute eigenvectors, introducing output constraints to enforce positivity, in line with Sturm-Liouville theory. Numerical experiments are conducted on the discrete Allen-Cahn equation with cubic and quintic nonlinearities in one to five spatial dimensions. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accuracy comparable to, or better than, traditional numerical methods, especially in high-dimensional regimes where computational resources are a limiting factor. These findings highlight the potential of neural networks as scalable and efficient tools for the study of complex nonlinear lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Phase reduction analysis of traveling breathers in reaction--diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a theory for phase reduction analysis of traveling breathers in reaction--diffusion systems with spatial translational symmetry. In this formulation, the spatial and temporal phases represent the position and oscillation of a traveling breather, respectively. We perform phase reduction analysis on a pair of FitzHugh--Nagumo models exhibiting standing breathers and a pair of Gray--Scott models exhibiting traveling breathers. The derived phase equations for the spatial and temporal phases indicate nontrivial spatiotemporal dynamics, where both phases are mutually coupled. Using the phase equations, we obtain the time evolution of the phase differences, which is consistent with that obtained from direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Pattern Localisation in the Swift-Hohenberg Equation via Slowly Varying Spatial Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theories of localised pattern formation are important to understand a broad range of natural patterns, but are less well-understood than more established mechanisms of domain-filling pattern formation. Here, we extend recent work on pattern localisation via slow spatial heterogeneity in reaction-diffusion systems to the Swift-Hohenberg equation. We use a WKB asymptotic approach to show that, in the limit of a large domain and slowly varying heterogeneity, conditions for Turing-type linear instability localise in a simple way, with the spatial variable playing the role of a parameter. For nonlinearities locally corresponding to supercritical bifurcations in the spatially homogeneous system, this analysis asymptotically predicts regions where patterned states are confined, which we confirm numerically. We resolve the inner region of this asymptotic approach, finding excellent agreement with the tails of these confined pattern regions. In the locally subcritical case, however, this theory is insufficient to fully predict such confined regions, and so we propose an approach based on numerical continuation of a local homogeneous analog system. Pattern localisation in the heterogeneous system can then be determined based on the Maxwell point of this system, with the spatial variable parameterizing this point. We compare this theory of localisation via spatial heterogeneity to localised patterns arising from homoclinic snaking, and suggest a way to distinguish between different localisation mechanisms in natural systems based on how these structures decay to the background state (i.e. how their tails decay). We also explore cases where both of these local theories of pattern formation fail to capture the interaction between spatial heterogeneity and underlying pattern-forming mechanisms, suggesting that more work needs to be done to fully disentangle exogenous and intrinsic heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear states of the conservative complex Swift-Hohenberg equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the conservative complex Swift-Hohenberg equation, which belongs to the family of nonlinear fourth-order dispersive Schr\"odinger equations. In contrast to the well-studied one-dimensional dissipative Swift-Hohenberg equation, the complex variant introduces a wide array of largely unexplored solutions. Our study provides a fundamental step in understanding the complex characteristics of this equation, particularly for typical classes of solutions-uniform, periodic, and localized states-and their relationship with the original dissipative model. Our findings reveal significant differences between the two models. For instance, uniform solutions in the conservative model are inherently unstable, and periodic solutions are generally unstable except within a narrow parameter interval that supports multiple localized states. Furthermore, we establish a generalized Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion to determine the stability of localized states in the conservative equation and relate it to the stability properties of the dissipative counterpart.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of superconductivity outside Abrikosov vortex core in a tightly bound Cooper pair superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abrikosov vortices play a central role in the disruption of superconductivity in type-II superconductors. It is commonly accepted that as one moves away from the vortex's axis of an $s$-wave superconductor, the density of superconductive electrons gradually increases from zero to its bulk value. However, we demonstrate that this behavior is qualitatively altered in the zero-temperature limit provided that the Cooper pairs comprising the superconductive liquid are sufficiently tightly bound. Specifically, outside the vortex core, the density of superconductive electrons reaches a maximum surpassing its bulk value. This phenomenon has electrostatic origins: since normal electrons are absent and there exists a charged ionic background, the spatial variation of the charge density of superconductive electrons violates local neutrality, leading to the generation of an electric field. This electric field shrinks the vortex core and turns the density profile into that with a maximum, ensuring global neutrality. The effect is most pronounced in the limit of strong electrostatic screening, where the field configurations describing the vortex attain a universal form, with the electric field screened over a length scale determined by the London penetration depth.</description>
