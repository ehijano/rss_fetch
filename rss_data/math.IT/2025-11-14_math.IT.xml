      <title>A Universal Block Error Rate Bound for Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FASs) offer genuine simplicity for communication network design by eliminating expensive hardware overhead and reducing the complexity of access protocol architectures. Through the discovery of significant spatial diversity within a compact antenna space, FASs enable the implementation of reconfigurable-antenna-based architectures. However, current state-of-the-art studies rarely investigate the impact of finite blocklength constraints on FAS-based designs, leaving a gap in both analytical modeling and the establishment of a solid, universally applicable performance metric for finite blocklength fluid antenna systems (FBL-FAS). In this work, we focus on the study of FBL-FAS and, more importantly, derive a block error rate (BLER) bound that serves as a general and practical performance benchmark across various FAS architectures. The proposed BLER bound is computable both with and without an explicit statistical model, meaning that the BLER performance can be characterized analytically or empirically under model-aware or model-free system scenarios. Moreover, when the statistical model is known, the analytical results derived from the proposed BLER bound exhibit strong alignment with the empirical findings, demonstrating the remarkable simplicity, accuracy, and universality of the proposed BLER bound.</description>

      <title>Implicit Semantic Communication Based on Bayesian Reconstruction Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication is a novel communication paradigm that focuses on the transportation and delivery of the \emph{meaning} of messages. Recent results have verified that a graphical structure provides the most expressive and structurally faithful formalism for representing the relational semantics in most information sources. However, most existing works represent the semantics based on pairwise relation-based graphs, which cannot capture the higher-order interactions that are essential for some semantic sources. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian hypergraph inference-based semantic communication framework that can directly recover implicit semantic information involving high-order hyperedges at the receiver based on the pairwise relation-based explicit semantics sent by the transmitter. Experimental results based on real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed SBRF achieves up to 90\% recovery accuracy of the high-order hyperedges based on the pairwise relation-based explicit semantics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Spectral Bound for Quasi-Twisted Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semenov and Trifonov [22] developed a spectral theory for quasi-cyclic codes and formulated a BCH-like minimum distance bound. Their approach was generalized by Zeh and Ling [24], by using the HT bound. The first spectral bound for quasi-twisted codes appeared in [7], which generalizes Semenov-Trifonov and Zeh-Ling bounds, but its overall performance was observed to be worse than the Jensen bound. More recently, an improved spectral bound for quasi-cyclic codes was proposed in [15], which outperforms the Jensen bound in many cases. In this paper, we adopt this approach to quasi-twisted case and we show that this new generalized spectral bound provides tighter lower bounds on the minimum distance compared to the Jensen and Ezerman et. al. bounds.</description>

      <title>Sequential Adversarial Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the adversarial binary hypothesis testing problem in the sequential setting. Associated with each hypothesis is a closed, convex set of distributions. Given the hypothesis, each observation is generated according to a distribution chosen (from the set associated with the hypothesis) by an adversary who has access to past observations. In the sequential setting, the number of observations the detector uses to arrive at a decision is variable; this extra freedom improves the asymptotic performance of the test. We characterize the closure of the set of achievable pairs of error exponents. We also study the problem under constraints on the number of observations used and the probability of error incurred.</description>

      <title>Causal Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Sample-Efficient IoT Channel Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the advantages of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for wireless use case such as medium access control (MAC), their real-world deployment in Internet of Things (IoT) is hindered by their sample inefficiency. To alleviate this challenge, one can leverage model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) solutions, however, conventional MBRL approaches rely on black-box models that are not interpretable and cannot reason. In contrast, in this paper, a novel causal model-based MARL framework is developed by leveraging tools from causal learn- ing. In particular, the proposed model can explicitly represent causal dependencies between network variables using structural causal models (SCMs) and attention-based inference networks. Interpretable causal models are then developed to capture how MAC control messages influence observations, how transmission actions determine outcomes, and how channel observations affect rewards. Data augmentation techniques are then used to generate synthetic rollouts using the learned causal model for policy optimization via proximal policy optimization (PPO). Analytical results demonstrate exponential sample complexity gains of causal MBRL over black-box approaches. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, on average, the proposed approach can reduce environment interactions by 58%, and yield faster convergence compared to model-free baselines. The proposed approach inherently is also shown to provide interpretable scheduling decisions via attention-based causal attribution, revealing which network conditions drive the policy. The resulting combination of sample efficiency and interpretability establishes causal MBRL as a practical approach for resource-constrained wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Airspace: Synergizing Movable Antenna and Intelligent Surface for Low-Altitude ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks are integral to future 6G integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, their deployment is hindered by challenges stemming from high mobility of UAVs, complex propagation environments, and the inherent trade-offs between coexisting sensing and communication functions. This article proposes a novel framework that leverages movable antennas (MAs) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) as dual enablers to overcome these limitations. MAs, through active transceiver reconfiguration, and IRSs, via passive channel reconstruction, can work in synergy to significantly enhance system performance. Our analysis first elaborates on the fundamental gains offered by MAs and IRSs, and provides simulation results that validate the immense potential of the MA-IRS-enabled ISAC architecture. Two core UAV deployment scenarios are then investigated: (i) UAVs as ISAC users, where we focus on achieving high-precision tracking and aerial safety, and (ii) UAVs as aerial network nodes, where we address robust design and complex coupled resource optimization. Finally, key technical challenges and research opportunities are identified and analyzed for each scenario, charting a clear course for the future design of advanced low-altitude ISAC networks.</description>

      <title>RLD Fisher Information Bound for Multiparameter Estimation of Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.11178v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental tasks in quantum metrology is to estimate multiple parameters embedded in a noisy process, i.e., a quantum channel. In this paper, we study fundamental limits to quantum channel estimation via the concept of amortization and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) Fisher information value. Our key technical result is the proof of a chain-rule inequality for the RLD Fisher information value, which implies that amortization, i.e., access to a catalyst state family, does not increase the RLD Fisher information value of quantum channels. This technical result leads to a fundamental and efficiently computable limitation for multiparameter channel estimation in the sequential setting, in terms of the RLD Fisher information value. As a consequence, we conclude that if the RLD Fisher information value is finite, then Heisenberg scaling is unattainable in the multiparameter setting.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Explainable AIoT Application via SHAP Entropy Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread integration of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) in smart home environments has amplified the demand for transparent and interpretable machine learning models. To foster user trust and comply with emerging regulatory frameworks, the Explainable AI (XAI) methods, particularly post-hoc techniques such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), are widely employed to elucidate model behavior. However, recent studies have shown that these explanation methods can inadvertently expose sensitive user attributes and behavioral patterns, thereby introducing new privacy risks. To address these concerns, we propose a novel privacy-preserving approach based on SHAP entropy regularization to mitigate privacy leakage in explainable AIoT applications. Our method incorporates an entropy-based regularization objective that penalizes low-entropy SHAP attribution distributions during training, promoting a more uniform spread of feature contributions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we developed a suite of SHAP-based privacy attacks that strategically leverage model explanation outputs to infer sensitive information. We validate our method through comparative evaluations using these attacks alongside utility metrics on benchmark smart home energy consumption datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SHAP entropy regularization substantially reduces privacy leakage compared to baseline models, while maintaining high predictive accuracy and faithful explanation fidelity. This work contributes to the development of privacy-preserving explainable AI techniques for secure and trustworthy AIoT applications.</description>

      <title>Massive MIMO-OFDM Channel Acquisition with Multi-group Adjustable Phase Shift Pilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output - orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems face the challenge of high channel acquisition overhead while providing significant spectral efficiency (SE). Adjustable phase shift pilots (APSPs) are an effective technique to acquire channels with low overhead by exploiting channel sparsity. In this paper, we extend it to multiple groups and propose multi-group adjustable phase shift pilots (MAPSPs) to improve SE further. We first introduce a massive MIMO-OFDM system model and transform the conventional channel model in the space-frequency domain to the angle-delay domain, obtaining a sparse channel matrix. Then, we propose a method of generating MAPSPs through multiple basic sequences and investigate channel estimation processes. By analyzing the components of pilot interference, we elucidate the underlying mechanism by which interference affects MMSE estimation. Building upon this foundation, we demonstrate the benefit of phase scheduling in MAPSP channel estimation and establish the optimal design condition tailored for scheduling. Furthermore, we propose an implementation scheme based on Zadoff-Chu sequences that includes received signal pre-processing and pilot scheduling methods to mitigate pilot interference. Simulation results indicate that the MAPSP method achieves a lower mean square error (MSE) of estimation than APSP and significantly enhances SE in mobility scenarios.</description>

      <title>Know Your Limits: Entropy Estimation Modeling for Compression and Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language prediction is constrained by informational entropy intrinsic to language, such that there exists a limit to how accurate any language model can become and equivalently a lower bound to language compression. The most efficient language compression algorithms today are causal (next token prediction) large language models, but the use of these models to form accurate estimates of language entropy is currently computationally infeasible. We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value. We show empirically that causal models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted Multiple-Antenna Coded Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technology to enhance the wireless propagation environment for next-generation wireless communication systems. This paper introduces a new RIS-assisted multiple-antenna coded caching problem. Unlike the existing multi-antenna coded caching models, our considered model incorporates a passive RIS with a limited number of elements aimed at enhancing the multicast gain (i.e., Degrees of Freedom (DoF)). The system consists of a server equipped with multiple antennas and several single-antenna users. The RIS, which functions as a passive and configurable relay, improves communication by selectively erasing certain transmission paths between transmit and receive antennas, thereby reducing interference. We first propose a new RIS-assisted interference nulling algorithm to determine the phase-shift coefficients of the RIS. This algorithm achieves faster convergence compared to the existing approach. By strategically nulling certain interference paths in each time slot, the transmission process is divided into multiple interference-free groups. Each group consists of a set of transmit antennas that serve a corresponding set of users without any interference from other groups. The optimal grouping strategy to maximize the DoF is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. To efficiently solve this, we design a low-complexity algorithm that identifies the optimal solution and develops a corresponding coded caching scheme to achieve the maximum DoF. Building on the optimal grouping strategy, we introduce a new framework, referred to as RIS-assisted Multiple-Antenna Placement Delivery Array (RMAPDA), to construct the cache placement and delivery phases. Then we propose a general RMAPDA design to achieve the maximum DoF under the optimal grouping strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary Reed-Muller (RM) codes are defined via evaluations of Boolean-valued functions on $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$. We introduce a class of binary linear codes that generalizes the RM family by replacing the domain $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$ with an arbitrary finite Coxeter group. Like RM codes, this class is closed under duality, forms a nested code sequence, satisfies a multiplication property, and has asymptotic rate determined by a Gaussian distribution. Coxeter codes also give rise to a family of quantum codes for which transversal diagonal $Z$ rotations can perform non-trivial logic.</description>

      <title>Function-Correcting Codes for Locally Bounded Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of functions that assume only a limited number $\lambda$ of values within a given Hamming $\rho$-ball and call them locally $(\rho, \lambda)$-bounded functions. We develop function-correcting codes (FCCs) for a subclass of these functions and propose an upper bound on the redundancy of FCCs. The bound is based on the minimum length of an error-correcting code with a given number of codewords and a minimum distance. Furthermore, we provide a sufficient optimality condition for FCCs when $\lambda = 4$. We also demonstrate that any function can be represented as a locally $(\rho, \lambda)$-bounded function, illustrating this with a representation of Hamming weight distribution functions. Furthermore, we present another construction of function-correcting codes for Hamming weight distribution functions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interference widely exists in communication systems and is often not optimally treated at the receivers due to limited knowledge and/or computational burden. Evolutions of receivers have been proposed to balance complexity and spectral efficiency, for example, for 6G, while commonly used performance metrics, such as capacity and mutual information (MI), fail to capture the suboptimal treatment of interference, leading to potentially inaccurate performance evaluations. Mismatched decoding is an information-theoretic tool for analyzing communications with suboptimal decoders. In this work, we use mismatched decoding to analyze communications with decoders that treat interference suboptimally, aiming at more accurate performance metrics. Specifically, we consider a finite-alphabet input Gaussian channel under interference, representative of modern systems, where the decoder can be matched (optimal) or mismatched (suboptimal) to the channel. The matched capacity is derived using MI, while a lower bound on the mismatched capacity under various decoding metrics is derived using generalized mutual information (GMI). We show that the decoding metric in the proposed channel model is closely related to the behavior of the demodulator in bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems. Simulations illustrate that GMI/MI accurately predicts the throughput of BICM-type systems {with various demodulators}. Finally, we extend the channel model and the GMI to multiple antenna cases, with an example of multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) precoder optimization problem considering GMI under different decoding strategies. In short, this work discovers new insights about the impact of interference, proposes novel receivers, and introduces a new design and performance evaluation framework that more accurately captures the effect of interference.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation for Multi-waveguide Pinching Antenna-assisted Broadcast Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation for multi-dielectric waveguide-assisted broadcast systems, where each waveguide employs multiple pinching antennas (PAs), aiming to maximize the minimum achievable rate among multiple users. To capture realistic propagation effects, we propose a novel generalized frequency-dependent power attenuation model for dielectric waveguides PA systems. We jointly optimize waveguide beamforming, PA power ratio allocation, and antenna positions via a block coordinate descent scheme that capitalizes on majorization minimization and penalty methods, circumventing the inherent non-convexity of the formulated optimization problem and obtaining a computationally efficient sub-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework substantially outperforms both conventional antenna systems and single PA per waveguide configurations, clearly illustrating the intricate trade-offs between waveguide propagation loss, path loss, and resource allocation among multiple PAs.</description>

      <title>Formalising Propositional Information via Implication Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a framework for quantifying the information content of logical propositions through the use of implication hypergraphs. We posit that a proposition's informativeness is primarily determined by its relationships with other propositions; specifically, the extent to which it implies or derives other propositions. To formalize this notion, we develop a framework based on implication hypergraphs, that seeks to capture these relationships. Within this framework, we define propositional information, derive some key properties, and illustrate the concept through examples. While the approach is broadly applicable, mathematical propositions emerge as an ideal domain for its application due to their inherently rich and interconnected structure. We provide several examples to illustrate this and subsequently discuss the limitations of the framework, along with suggestions for potential refinements.</description>

      <title>Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing: Generic Constructions and Lattice-Based Instantiations in the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14381v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) allows a dealer to share a secret among a set of shareholders so that the secret can be reconstructed later from any set of qualified participants. In addition, any public verifier should be able to check the correctness of the sharing and reconstruction process. PVSS has been demonstrated to yield various applications, such as e-voting, distributed key generation, decentralized random number generation protocols, and multi-party computation. Although many concrete PVSS protocols have been proposed, their security is either proven in the random oracle model or relies on quantum-vulnerable assumptions such as factoring or discrete logarithm. In this work, we put forward a generic construction for PVSS that can be instantiated in the standard model under the Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption. Our instantiation provides the first post-quantum PVSS in the standard model, with a reasonable level of asymptotic efficiency.</description>

Abstract: A novel original procedure of encryption/decryption based on the polyadic algebraic structures and on signal processing methods is proposed. First, we use signals with integer amplitudes to send information. Then we use polyadic techniques to transfer the plaintext into series of special integers. The receiver restores the plaintext using special rules and systems of equations.</description>

      <title>Minimax Analysis of Estimation Problems in Coherent Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike conventional imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging, which are often well described by a linear regression framework, coherent imaging systems follow a significantly more complex model. In these systems, the task is to estimate the unknown image ${\boldsymbol x}_o \in \mathbb{R}^n$ from observations ${\boldsymbol y}_1, \ldots, {\boldsymbol y}_L \in \mathbb{R}^m$ of the form \[ {\boldsymbol y}_l = A_l X_o {\boldsymbol w}_l + {\boldsymbol z}_l, \quad l = 1, \ldots, L, \] where $X_o = \mathrm{diag}({\boldsymbol x}_o)$ is an $n \times n$ diagonal matrix, ${\boldsymbol w}_1, \ldots, {\boldsymbol w}_L \stackrel{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,I_n)$ represent speckle noise, and ${\boldsymbol z}_1, \ldots, {\boldsymbol z}_L \stackrel{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_z^2 I_m)$ denote additive noise. The matrices $A_1, \ldots, A_L$ are known forward operators determined by the imaging system.
  The fundamental limits of conventional imaging systems have been extensively studied through sparse linear regression models. However, the limits of coherent imaging systems remain largely unexplored. Our goal is to close this gap by characterizing the minimax risk of estimating ${\boldsymbol x}_o$ in high-dimensional settings.
  Motivated by insights from sparse regression, we observe that the structure of ${\boldsymbol x}_o$ plays a crucial role in determining the estimation error. In this work, we adopt a general notion of structure based on the covering numbers, which is more appropriate for coherent imaging systems. We show that the minimax mean squared error (MSE) scales as \[ \frac{\max\{\sigma_z^4,\, m^2,\, n^2\}\, k \log n}{m^2 n L}, \] where $k$ is a parameter that quantifies the effective complexity of the class of images.</description>

      <title>On robust hypothesis testing with respect to Hellinger distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hypothesis testing problem where the observed samples need not come from either of the specified hypotheses (distributions). In such a situation, we would like our test to be robust to this misspecification and output the distribution closer in Hellinger distance. If the underlying distribution is close to being equidistant from the hypotheses, then this would not be possible. Our main result is quantifying how close the underlying distribution has to be to either of the hypotheses. We also study the composite testing problem, where each hypothesis is a Hellinger ball around a fixed distribution. A generalized likelihood ratio test is known to work for this problem. We give an alternate test for the same.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information Ordering and Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum differential privacy (QDP) by defining a notion of the order of informativeness between two pairs of quantum states. In particular, we show that if the hypothesis testing divergence of the one pair dominates over that of the other pair, then this dominance holds for every $f$-divergence. This approach completely characterizes $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-QDP mechanisms by identifying the most informative $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP quantum state pairs. We apply this to analyze the stability of quantum differentially private learning algorithms, generalizing classical results to the case $\delta&gt;0$. Additionally, we study precise limits for privatized hypothesis testing and privatized quantum parameter estimation, including tight upper-bounds on the quantum Fisher information under QDP. Finally, we establish near-optimal contraction bounds for differentially private quantum channels with respect to the hockey-stick divergence.</description>

      <title>Cross-link RTS/CTS for MLO mm-Wave WLANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The directional RTS/CTS mechanism of mm-wave Wi-Fi hardly resolves the hidden terminal problem perfectly. This paper proposes cross-link RTS/CTS under multi-link operation (MLO) to address this problem and introduces a novel point process, named the generalized RTS/CTS hard-core process (G-HCP), to model the spatial transceiver relationships under the RTS/CTS mechanism, including the directional case and the omnidirectional case. Analytical expressions are derived for the intensity, the mean interference, an approximation of the success probability, and the expected number of hidden nodes for the directional RTS/CTS mechanism. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate the performance difference between two RTS/CTS mechanisms. The cross-link RTS/CTS mechanism ensures higher link quality at the cost of reduced network throughput. In contrast, the directional RTS/CTS sacrifices the link quality for higher throughput. Our study reveals a fundamental trade-off between link reliability and network throughput, providing critical insights into the selection and optimization of RTS/CTS mechanisms in next-generation WLAN standards.</description>
