      <title>SAM3D: Zero-Shot Semi-Automatic Segmentation in 3D Medical Images with the Segment Anything Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SAM3D, a new approach to semi-automatic zero-shot segmentation of 3D images building on the existing Segment Anything Model. We achieve fast and accurate segmentations in 3D images with a four-step strategy comprising: volume slicing along non-orthogonal axes, efficient prompting in 3D, slice-wise inference using the pretrained SAM, and recoposition and refinement in 3D. We evaluated SAM3D performance qualitatively on an array of imaging modalities and anatomical structures and quantify performance for specific organs in body CT and tumors in brain MRI. By enabling users to create 3D segmentations of unseen data quickly and with dramatically reduced manual input, these methods have the potential to aid surgical planning and education, diagnostic imaging, and scientific research.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Recursive Diffusion Bridge for Medical Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion models (DDM) have gained recent traction in medical image translation given improved training stability over adversarial models. DDMs learn a multi-step denoising transformation to progressively map random Gaussian-noise images onto target-modality images, while receiving stationary guidance from source-modality images. As this denoising transformation diverges significantly from the task-relevant source-to-target transformation, DDMs can suffer from weak source-modality guidance. Here, we propose a novel self-consistent recursive diffusion bridge (SelfRDB) for improved performance in medical image translation. Unlike DDMs, SelfRDB employs a novel forward process with start- and end-points defined based on target and source images, respectively. Intermediate image samples across the process are expressed via a normal distribution with mean taken as a convex combination of start-end points, and variance from additive noise. Unlike regular diffusion bridges that prescribe zero variance at start-end points and high variance at mid-point of the process, we propose a novel noise scheduling with monotonically increasing variance towards the end-point in order to boost generalization performance and facilitate information transfer between the two modalities. To further enhance sampling accuracy in each reverse step, we propose a novel sampling procedure where the network recursively generates a transient-estimate of the target image until convergence onto a self-consistent solution. Comprehensive analyses in multi-contrast MRI and MRI-CT translation indicate that SelfRDB offers superior performance against competing methods.</description>

      <title>Merging Point Data for InSAR Deformation Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a collection of points $S \subset \mathbb{R}^N$, which is partitioned into $M$ overlapping subsets $\{S_i\}_{i=1}^M$, and approximate data $\{D_i\}_{i=1}^M$ associated with the subsets, one may seek a consistent merged dataset $D$ that is derived from $\{S_i\}_{i=1}^M$ and $\{D_i\}_{i=1}^M$. This note presents a method for constructing $D$ under the assumption that $D$ represents discrete samples of a suitably smooth function $f:\mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ evaluated at the points in $S$. The method has two steps. The first step uses a least-squares solve to approximate the constant offsets for each $D_i$. The second step uses a sequence of discrete Dirichlet problems to resolve any remaining differences. We include a two dimensional example of this method applied to deformation measurements derived from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR).</description>

      <title>EMCAD: Efficient Multi-scale Convolutional Attention Decoding for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient and effective decoding mechanism is crucial in medical image segmentation, especially in scenarios with limited computational resources. However, these decoding mechanisms usually come with high computational costs. To address this concern, we introduce EMCAD, a new efficient multi-scale convolutional attention decoder, designed to optimize both performance and computational efficiency. EMCAD leverages a unique multi-scale depth-wise convolution block, significantly enhancing feature maps through multi-scale convolutions. EMCAD also employs channel, spatial, and grouped (large-kernel) gated attention mechanisms, which are highly effective at capturing intricate spatial relationships while focusing on salient regions. By employing group and depth-wise convolution, EMCAD is very efficient and scales well (e.g., only 1.91M parameters and 0.381G FLOPs are needed when using a standard encoder). Our rigorous evaluations across 12 datasets that belong to six medical image segmentation tasks reveal that EMCAD achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 79.4% and 80.3% reduction in #Params and #FLOPs, respectively. Moreover, EMCAD's adaptability to different encoders and versatility across segmentation tasks further establish EMCAD as a promising tool, advancing the field towards more efficient and accurate medical image analysis. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/SLDGroup/EMCAD.</description>

      <title>Efficient Real-world Image Super-Resolution Via Adaptive Directional Gradient Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-SR endeavors to produce high-resolution images with rich details while mitigating the impact of multiple degradation factors. Although existing methods have achieved impressive achievements in detail recovery, they still fall short when addressing regions with complex gradient arrangements due to the intensity-based linear weighting feature extraction manner. Moreover, the stochastic artifacts introduced by degradation cues during the imaging process in real LR increase the disorder of the overall image details, further complicating the perception of intrinsic gradient arrangement. To address these challenges, we innovatively introduce kernel-wise differential operations within the convolutional kernel and develop several learnable directional gradient convolutions. These convolutions are integrated in parallel with a novel linear weighting mechanism to form an Adaptive Directional Gradient Convolution (DGConv), which adaptively weights and fuses the basic directional gradients to improve the gradient arrangement perception capability for both regular and irregular textures. Coupled with DGConv, we further devise a novel equivalent parameter fusion method for DGConv that maintains its rich representational capabilities while keeping computational costs consistent with a single Vanilla Convolution (VConv), enabling DGConv to improve the performance of existing super-resolution networks without incurring additional computational expenses. To better leverage the superiority of DGConv, we further develop an Adaptive Information Interaction Block (AIIBlock) to adeptly balance the enhancement of texture and contrast while meticulously investigating the interdependencies, culminating in the creation of a DGPNet for Real-SR through simple stacking. Comparative results with 15 SOTA methods across three public datasets underscore the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Vision Data Coding: Classifying and Reviewing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, visual sensors have been quickly improving towards mimicking the visual information acquisition process of human brain, by responding to illumination changes as they occur in time rather than at fixed time intervals. In this context, the so-called neuromorphic vision sensors depart from the conventional frame-based image sensors by adopting a paradigm shift in the way visual information is acquired. This new way of visual information acquisition enables faster and asynchronous per-pixel responses/recordings driven by the scene dynamics with a very high dynamic range and low power consumption. However, the huge amount of data outputted by the emerging neuromorphic vision sensors critically demands highly efficient coding solutions in order applications may take full advantage of these new, attractive sensors' capabilities. For this reason, considerable research efforts have been invested in recent years towards developing increasingly efficient neuromorphic vision data coding (NVDC) solutions. In this context, the main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of NVDC solutions in the literature, guided by a novel classification taxonomy, which allows better organizing this emerging field. In this way, more solid conclusions can be drawn about the current NVDC status quo, thus allowing to better drive future research and standardization developments in this emerging technical area.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Fixed and Dynamic Pseudo-labels for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation has gained growing interest due to its ability to utilize unannotated data. The current state-of-the-art methods mostly rely on pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. These methods depend on a single pseudo-label for training, but these labels are not as accurate as the ground truth of labeled data. Relying solely on one pseudo-label often results in suboptimal results. To this end, we propose a novel approach where multiple pseudo-labels for the same unannotated image are used to learn from the unlabeled data: the conventional fixed pseudo-label and the newly introduced dynamic pseudo-label. By incorporating multiple pseudo-labels for the same unannotated image into the co-training framework, our approach provides a more robust training approach that improves model performance and generalization capabilities. We validate our novel approach on three semi-supervised medical benchmark segmentation datasets, the Left Atrium dataset, the Pancreas-CT dataset, and the Brats-2019 dataset. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods over multiple medical benchmark segmentation datasets with different labeled data ratios. We also present several ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of various components used in our approach.</description>

      <title>Explainable Convolutional Neural Networks for Retinal Fundus Classification and Cutting-Edge Segmentation Models for Retinal Blood Vessels from Fundus Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our research focuses on the critical field of early diagnosis of disease by examining retinal blood vessels in fundus images. While automatic segmentation of retinal blood vessels holds promise for early detection, accurate analysis remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods, which often lack discrimination power and are susceptible to influences from pathological regions. Our research in fundus image analysis advances deep learning-based classification using eight pre-trained CNN models. To enhance interpretability, we utilize Explainable AI techniques such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Score-CAM, Faster Score-CAM, and Layer CAM. These techniques illuminate the decision-making processes of the models, fostering transparency and trust in their predictions. Expanding our exploration, we investigate ten models, including TransUNet with ResNet backbones, Attention U-Net with DenseNet and ResNet backbones, and Swin-UNET. Incorporating diverse architectures such as ResNet50V2, ResNet101V2, ResNet152V2, and DenseNet121 among others, this comprehensive study deepens our insights into attention mechanisms for enhanced fundus image analysis. Among the evaluated models for fundus image classification, ResNet101 emerged with the highest accuracy, achieving an impressive 94.17%. On the other end of the spectrum, EfficientNetB0 exhibited the lowest accuracy among the models, achieving a score of 88.33%. Furthermore, in the domain of fundus image segmentation, Swin-Unet demonstrated a Mean Pixel Accuracy of 86.19%, showcasing its effectiveness in accurately delineating regions of interest within fundus images. Conversely, Attention U-Net with DenseNet201 backbone exhibited the lowest Mean Pixel Accuracy among the evaluated models, achieving a score of 75.87%.</description>

      <title>CoVScreen: Pitfalls and recommendations for screening COVID-19 using Chest X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), a highly infectious respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as an unprecedented healthcare crisis. The pandemic had a devastating impact on the health, well-being, and economy of the global population. Early screening and diagnosis of symptomatic patients plays crucial role in isolation of patient to help stop community transmission as well as providing early treatment helping in reducing the mortality rate. Although, the RT-PCR test is the gold standard for COVID-19 testing, it is a manual, laborious, time consuming, uncomfortable, and invasive process. Due to its accessibility, availability, lower-cost, ease of sanitisation, and portable setup, chest X-Ray imaging can serve as an effective screening and diagnostic tool. In this study, we first highlight limitations of existing datasets and studies in terms of data quality, data imbalance, and evaluation strategy. Second, we curated a large-scale COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset from many publicly available COVID-19 imaging databases and proposed a pre-processing pipeline to improve quality of the dataset. We proposed CoVScreen, an CNN architecture to train and test the curated dataset. The experimental results applying different classification scenarios on the curated dataset in terms of various evaluation metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed methodology in the screening of COVID-19 infection.</description>

      <title>On the Adversarial Robustness of Learning-based Image Compression Against Rate-Distortion Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite demonstrating superior rate-distortion (RD) performance, learning-based image compression (LIC) algorithms have been found to be vulnerable to malicious perturbations in recent studies. Adversarial samples in these studies are designed to attack only one dimension of either bitrate or distortion, targeting a submodel with a specific compression ratio. However, adversaries in real-world scenarios are neither confined to singular dimensional attacks nor always have control over compression ratios. This variability highlights the inadequacy of existing research in comprehensively assessing the adversarial robustness of LIC algorithms in practical applications. To tackle this issue, this paper presents two joint rate-distortion attack paradigms at both submodel and algorithm levels, i.e., Specific-ratio Rate-Distortion Attack (SRDA) and Agnostic-ratio Rate-Distortion Attack (ARDA). Additionally, a suite of multi-granularity assessment tools is introduced to evaluate the attack results from various perspectives. On this basis, extensive experiments on eight prominent LIC algorithms are conducted to offer a thorough analysis of their inherent vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we explore the efficacy of two defense techniques in improving the performance under joint rate-distortion attacks. The findings from these experiments can provide a valuable reference for the development of compression algorithms with enhanced adversarial robustness.</description>

      <title>A method for supervoxel-wise association studies of age and other non-imaging variables from coronary computed tomography angiograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of associations between an individual's age and imaging and non-imaging data is an active research area that attempts to aid understanding of the effects and patterns of aging. In this work we have conducted a supervoxel-wise association study between both volumetric and tissue density features in coronary computed tomography angiograms and the chronological age of a subject, to understand the localized changes in morphology and tissue density with age. To enable a supervoxel-wise study of volume and tissue density, we developed a novel method based on image segmentation, inter-subject image registration, and robust supervoxel-based correlation analysis, to achieve a statistical association study between the images and age. We evaluate the registration methodology in terms of the Dice coefficient for the heart chambers and myocardium, and the inverse consistency of the transformations, showing that the method works well in most cases with high overlap and inverse consistency. In a sex-stratified study conducted on a subset of $n=1388$ images from the SCAPIS study, the supervoxel-wise analysis was able to find localized associations with age outside of the commonly segmented and analyzed sub-regions, and several substantial differences between the sexes in association of age and volume.</description>

      <title>Using Multiparametric MRI with Optimized Synthetic Correlated Diffusion Imaging to Enhance Breast Cancer Pathologic Complete Response Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2020, 685,000 deaths across the world were attributed to breast cancer, underscoring the critical need for innovative and effective breast cancer treatment. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has recently gained popularity as a promising treatment strategy for breast cancer, attributed to its efficacy in shrinking large tumors and leading to pathologic complete response. However, the current process to recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy relies on the subjective evaluation of medical experts which contain inherent biases and significant uncertainty. A recent study, utilizing volumetric deep radiomic features extracted from synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$), demonstrated significant potential in noninvasive breast cancer pathologic complete response prediction. Inspired by the positive outcomes of optimizing CDI$^s$ for prostate cancer delineation, this research investigates the application of optimized CDI$^s$ to enhance breast cancer pathologic complete response prediction. Using multiparametric MRI that fuses optimized CDI$^s$ with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), we obtain a leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy of 93.28%, over 5.5% higher than that previously reported.</description>

      <title>Improving Breast Cancer Grade Prediction with Multiparametric MRI Created Using Optimized Synthetic Correlated Diffusion Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer was diagnosed for over 7.8 million women between 2015 to 2020. Grading plays a vital role in breast cancer treatment planning. However, the current tumor grading method involves extracting tissue from patients, leading to stress, discomfort, and high medical costs. A recent paper leveraging volumetric deep radiomic features from synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$) for breast cancer grade prediction showed immense promise for noninvasive methods for grading. Motivated by the impact of CDI$^s$ optimization for prostate cancer delineation, this paper examines using optimized CDI$^s$ to improve breast cancer grade prediction. We fuse the optimized CDI$^s$ signal with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to create a multiparametric MRI for each patient. Using a larger patient cohort and training across all the layers of a pretrained MONAI model, we achieve a leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy of 95.79%, over 8% higher compared to that previously reported.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Prediction in T2-weighted Images through Transfer Learning from Breast Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2020, prostate cancer saw a staggering 1.4 million new cases, resulting in over 375,000 deaths. The accurate identification of clinically significant prostate cancer is crucial for delivering effective treatment to patients. Consequently, there has been a surge in research exploring the application of deep neural networks to predict clinical significance based on magnetic resonance images. However, these networks demand extensive datasets to attain optimal performance. Recently, transfer learning emerged as a technique that leverages acquired features from a domain with richer data to enhance the performance of a domain with limited data. In this paper, we investigate the improvement of clinically significant prostate cancer prediction in T2-weighted images through transfer learning from breast cancer. The results demonstrate a remarkable improvement of over 30% in leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy.</description>

      <title>PLUTO: Pathology-Universal Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathology is the study of microscopic inspection of tissue, and a pathology diagnosis is often the medical gold standard to diagnose disease. Pathology images provide a unique challenge for computer-vision-based analysis: a single pathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) is gigapixel-sized and often contains hundreds of thousands to millions of objects of interest across multiple resolutions. In this work, we propose PathoLogy Universal TransfOrmer (PLUTO): a light-weight pathology FM that is pre-trained on a diverse dataset of 195 million image tiles collected from multiple sites and extracts meaningful representations across multiple WSI scales that enable a large variety of downstream pathology tasks. In particular, we design task-specific adaptation heads that utilize PLUTO's output embeddings for tasks which span pathology scales ranging from subcellular to slide-scale, including instance segmentation, tile classification, and slide-level prediction. We compare PLUTO's performance to other state-of-the-art methods on a diverse set of external and internal benchmarks covering multiple biologically relevant tasks, tissue types, resolutions, stains, and scanners. We find that PLUTO matches or outperforms existing task-specific baselines and pathology-specific foundation models, some of which use orders-of-magnitude larger datasets and model sizes when compared to PLUTO. Our findings present a path towards a universal embedding to power pathology image analysis, and motivate further exploration around pathology foundation models in terms of data diversity, architectural improvements, sample efficiency, and practical deployability in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>A Performance Analysis Modeling Framework for Extended Reality Applications in Edge-Assisted Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended reality (XR) is at the center of attraction in the research community due to the emergence of augmented, mixed, and virtual reality applications. The performance of such applications needs to be uptight to maintain the requirements of latency, energy consumption, and freshness of data. Therefore, a comprehensive performance analysis model is required to assess the effectiveness of an XR application but is challenging to design due to the dependence of the performance metrics on several difficult-to-model parameters, such as computing resources and hardware utilization of XR and edge devices, which are controlled by both their operating systems and the application itself. Moreover, the heterogeneity in devices and wireless access networks brings additional challenges in modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel modeling framework for performance analysis of XR applications considering edge-assisted wireless networks and validate the model with experimental data collected from testbeds designed specifically for XR applications. In addition, we present the challenges associated with performance analysis modeling and present methods to overcome them in detail. Finally, the performance evaluation shows that the proposed analytical model can analyze XR applications' performance with high accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art analytical models.</description>

      <title>CDFormer:When Degradation Prediction Embraces Diffusion Model for Blind Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing Blind image Super-Resolution (BSR) methods focus on estimating either kernel or degradation information, but have long overlooked the essential content details. In this paper, we propose a novel BSR approach, Content-aware Degradation-driven Transformer (CDFormer), to capture both degradation and content representations. However, low-resolution images cannot provide enough content details, and thus we introduce a diffusion-based module $CDFormer_{diff}$ to first learn Content Degradation Prior (CDP) in both low- and high-resolution images, and then approximate the real distribution given only low-resolution information. Moreover, we apply an adaptive SR network $CDFormer_{SR}$ that effectively utilizes CDP to refine features. Compared to previous diffusion-based SR methods, we treat the diffusion model as an estimator that can overcome the limitations of expensive sampling time and excessive diversity. Experiments show that CDFormer can outperform existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks under blind settings. Codes and models will be available at \href{https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/CDFormer}{https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/CDFormer}.</description>

      <title>MADRL-Based Rate Adaptation for 360$\degree$ Video Streaming with Multi-Viewpoint Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last few years, 360$\degree$ video traffic on the network has grown significantly. A key challenge of 360$\degree$ video playback is ensuring a high quality of experience (QoE) with limited network bandwidth. Currently, most studies focus on tile-based adaptive bitrate (ABR) streaming based on single viewport prediction to reduce bandwidth consumption. However, the performance of models for single-viewpoint prediction is severely limited by the inherent uncertainty in head movement, which can not cope with the sudden movement of users very well. This paper first presents a multimodal spatial-temporal attention transformer to generate multiple viewpoint trajectories with their probabilities given a historical trajectory. The proposed method models viewpoint prediction as a classification problem and uses attention mechanisms to capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of input video frames and viewpoint trajectories for multi-viewpoint prediction. After that, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based ABR algorithm utilizing multi-viewpoint prediction for 360$\degree$ video streaming is proposed for maximizing different QoE objectives under various network conditions. We formulate the ABR problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) problem and present a MAPPO algorithm based on centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework to solve the problem. The experimental results show that our proposed method improves the defined QoE metric by up to 85.5\% compared to existing ABR methods.</description>

      <title>SAR Image Synthesis with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models (DMs) have become a popular method for generating synthetic data. By achieving samples of higher quality, they quickly became superior to generative adversarial networks (GANs) and the current state-of-the-art method in generative modeling. However, their potential has not yet been exploited in radar, where the lack of available training data is a long-standing problem. In this work, a specific type of DMs, namely denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is adapted to the SAR domain. We investigate the network choice and specific diffusion parameters for conditional and unconditional SAR image generation. In our experiments, we show that DDPM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based methods for SAR image generation. Finally, we show that DDPM profits from pretraining on largescale clutter data, generating SAR images of even higher quality.</description>

      <title>GMSR:Gradient-Guided Mamba for Spectral Reconstruction from RGB Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mainstream approaches to spectral reconstruction (SR) primarily focus on designing Convolution- and Transformer-based architectures. However, CNN methods often face challenges in handling long-range dependencies, whereas Transformers are constrained by computational efficiency limitations. Recent breakthroughs in state-space model (e.g., Mamba) has attracted significant attention due to its near-linear computational efficiency and superior performance, prompting our investigation into its potential for SR problem. To this end, we propose the Gradient-guided Mamba for Spectral Reconstruction from RGB Images, dubbed GMSR-Net. GMSR-Net is a lightweight model characterized by a global receptive field and linear computational complexity. Its core comprises multiple stacked Gradient Mamba (GM) blocks, each featuring a tri-branch structure. In addition to benefiting from efficient global feature representation by Mamba block, we further innovatively introduce spatial gradient attention and spectral gradient attention to guide the reconstruction of spatial and spectral cues. GMSR-Net demonstrates a significant accuracy-efficiency trade-off, achieving state-of-the-art performance while markedly reducing the number of parameters and computational burdens. Compared to existing approaches, GMSR-Net slashes parameters and FLOPS by substantial margins of 10 times and 20 times, respectively.

      <title>LENAS: Learning-based Neural Architecture Search and Ensemble for 3D Radiotherapy Dose Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.06733v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation therapy treatment planning requires balancing the delivery of the target dose while sparing normal tissues, making it a complex process. To streamline the planning process and enhance its quality, there is a growing demand for knowledge-based planning (KBP). Ensemble learning has shown impressive power in various deep learning tasks, and it has great potential to improve the performance of KBP. However, the effectiveness of ensemble learning heavily depends on the diversity and individual accuracy of the base learners. Moreover, the complexity of model ensembles is a major concern, as it requires maintaining multiple models during inference, leading to increased computational cost and storage overhead. In this study, we propose a novel learning-based ensemble approach named LENAS, which integrates neural architecture search with knowledge distillation for 3D radiotherapy dose prediction. Our approach starts by exhaustively searching each block from an enormous architecture space to identify multiple architectures that exhibit promising performance and significant diversity. To mitigate the complexity introduced by the model ensemble, we adopt the teacher-student paradigm, leveraging the diverse outputs from multiple learned networks as supervisory signals to guide the training of the student network. Furthermore, to preserve high-level semantic information, we design a hybrid-loss to optimize the student network, enabling it to recover the knowledge embedded within the teacher networks. The proposed method has been evaluated on two public datasets, OpenKBP and AIMIS. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The incorporation of physical information in machine learning frameworks is opening and transforming many application domains. Here the learning process is augmented through the induction of fundamental knowledge and governing physical laws. In this work, we explore their utility for computer vision tasks in interpreting and understanding visual data. We present a systematic literature review of more than 250 papers on formulation and approaches to computer vision tasks guided by physical laws. We begin by decomposing the popular computer vision pipeline into a taxonomy of stages and investigate approaches to incorporate governing physical equations in each stage. Existing approaches in computer vision tasks are analyzed with regard to what governing physical processes are modeled and formulated, and how they are incorporated, i.e. modification of input data (observation bias), modification of network architectures (inductive bias), and modification of training losses (learning bias). The taxonomy offers a unified view of the application of the physics-informed capability, highlighting where physics-informed learning has been conducted and where the gaps and opportunities are. Finally, we highlight open problems and challenges to inform future research. While still in its early days, the study of physics-informed computer vision has the promise to develop better computer vision models that can improve physical plausibility, accuracy, data efficiency, and generalization in increasingly realistic applications.</description>

      <title>Swift Parameter-free Attention Network for Efficient Super-Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is a crucial task in low-level computer vision, aiming to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution counterparts. Conventional attention mechanisms have significantly improved SISR performance but often result in complex network structures and large number of parameters, leading to slow inference speed and large model size. To address this issue, we propose the Swift Parameter-free Attention Network (SPAN), a highly efficient SISR model that balances parameter count, inference speed, and image quality. SPAN employs a novel parameter-free attention mechanism, which leverages symmetric activation functions and residual connections to enhance high-contribution information and suppress redundant information. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of this design in achieving the attention mechanism's purpose. We evaluate SPAN on multiple benchmarks, showing that it outperforms existing efficient super-resolution models in terms of both image quality and inference speed, achieving a significant quality-speed trade-off. This makes SPAN highly suitable for real-world applications, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios. Notably, we won the first place both in the overall performance track and runtime track of the NTIRE 2024 efficient super-resolution challenge. Our code and models are made publicly available at https://github.com/hongyuanyu/SPAN.</description>

      <title>C2P-GCN: Cell-to-Patch Graph Convolutional Network for Colorectal Cancer Grading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph-based learning approaches, due to their ability to encode tissue/organ structure information, are increasingly favored for grading colorectal cancer histology images. Recent graph-based techniques involve dividing whole slide images (WSIs) into smaller or medium-sized patches, and then building graphs on each patch for direct use in training. This method, however, fails to capture the tissue structure information present in an entire WSI and relies on training from a significantly large dataset of image patches. In this paper, we propose a novel cell-to-patch graph convolutional network (C2P-GCN), which is a two-stage graph formation-based approach. In the first stage, it forms a patch-level graph based on the cell organization on each patch of a WSI. In the second stage, it forms an image-level graph based on a similarity measure between patches of a WSI considering each patch as a node of a graph. This graph representation is then fed into a multi-layer GCN-based classification network. Our approach, through its dual-phase graph construction, effectively gathers local structural details from individual patches and establishes a meaningful connection among all patches across a WSI. As C2P-GCN integrates the structural data of an entire WSI into a single graph, it allows our model to work with significantly fewer training data compared to the latest models for colorectal cancer. Experimental validation of C2P-GCN on two distinct colorectal cancer datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.</description>

Abstract: Modern displays nowadays possess the capability to render video content with a high dynamic range (HDR) and an extensive color gamut .However, the majority of available resources are still in standard dynamic range (SDR). Therefore, we need to identify an effective methodology for this objective.The existing deep neural networks (DNN) based SDR to HDR conversion methods outperforms conventional methods, but they are either too large to implement or generate some terrible artifacts. We propose a neural network for SDR to HDR conversion, termed "FastHDRNet". This network includes two parts, Adaptive Universal Color Transformation (AUCT) and Local Enhancement (LE). The architecture is designed as a lightweight network that utilizes global statistics and local information with super high efficiency. After the experiment, we find that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative comparisons and visual quality with a lightweight structure and a enhanced infer speed.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Tri-Modal Medical Image Fusion and Super-Resolution using Conditional Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In clinical practice, tri-modal medical image fusion, compared to the existing dual-modal technique, can provide a more comprehensive view of the lesions, aiding physicians in evaluating the disease's shape, location, and biological activity. However, due to the limitations of imaging equipment and considerations for patient safety, the quality of medical images is usually limited, leading to sub-optimal fusion performance, and affecting the depth of image analysis by the physician. Thus, there is an urgent need for a technology that can both enhance image resolution and integrate multi-modal information. Although current image processing methods can effectively address image fusion and super-resolution individually, solving both problems synchronously remains extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose TFS-Diff, a simultaneously realize tri-modal medical image fusion and super-resolution model. Specially, TFS-Diff is based on the diffusion model generation of a random iterative denoising process. We also develop a simple objective function and the proposed fusion super-resolution loss, effectively evaluates the uncertainty in the fusion and ensures the stability of the optimization process. And the channel attention module is proposed to effectively integrate key information from different modalities for clinical diagnosis, avoiding information loss caused by multiple image processing. Extensive experiments on public Harvard datasets show that TFS-Diff significantly surpass the existing state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and visual evaluations. The source code will be available at GitHub.</description>

      <title>SSUMamba: Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model for Hyperspectral Image Denoising</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denoising hyperspectral images (HSIs) is a crucial preprocessing procedure due to the noise originating from intra-imaging mechanisms and environmental factors. Utilizing domain-specific knowledge of HSIs, such as spectral correlation, spatial self-similarity, and spatial-spectral correlation, is essential for deep learning-based denoising. Existing methods are often constrained by running time, space complexity, and computational complexity, employing strategies that explore these priors separately. While these strategies can avoid some redundant information, they inevitably overlook broader and more underlying long-range spatial-spectral information that positively impacts image restoration. This paper proposes a Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model-based U-shaped network, termed Spatial-Spectral U-Mamba (SSUMamba), for hyperspectral image denoising. We can obtain complete global spatial-spectral correlation within a module thanks to the linear space complexity in State Space Model (SSM) computations. We introduce a Spatial-Spectral Alternating Scan (SSAS) strategy for HSIs, which helps model the information flow in multiple directions in 3-D HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms compared methods. The source code will be available at https://github.com/lronkitty/SSUMamba.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to accelerate SR network inference by minimizing computational complexity and network parameters while preserving performance. Existing state-of-the-art Efficient Image Super-Resolution methods are based on convolutional neural networks. Few attempts have been made with Mamba to harness its long-range modeling capability and efficient computational complexity, which have shown impressive performance on high-level vision tasks. In this paper, we propose DVMSR, a novel lightweight Image SR network that incorporates Vision Mamba and a distillation strategy. The network of DVMSR consists of three modules: feature extraction convolution, multiple stacked Residual State Space Blocks (RSSBs), and a reconstruction module. Specifically, the deep feature extraction module is composed of several residual state space blocks (RSSB), each of which has several Vision Mamba Moudles(ViMM) together with a residual connection. To achieve efficiency improvement while maintaining comparable performance, we employ a distillation strategy to the vision Mamba network for superior performance. Specifically, we leverage the rich representation knowledge of teacher network as additional supervision for the output of lightweight student networks. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed DVMSR can outperform state-of-the-art efficient SR methods in terms of model parameters while maintaining the performance of both PSNR and SSIM.

      <title>HC-Mamba: Vision MAMBA with Hybrid Convolutional Techniques for Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic medical image segmentation technology has the potential to expedite pathological diagnoses, thereby enhancing the efficiency of patient care. However, medical images often have complex textures and structures, and the models often face the problem of reduced image resolution and information loss due to downsampling. To address this issue, we propose HC-Mamba, a new medical image segmentation model based on the modern state space model Mamba. Specifically, we introduce the technique of dilated convolution in the HC-Mamba model to capture a more extensive range of contextual information without increasing the computational cost by extending the perceptual field of the convolution kernel. In addition, the HC-Mamba model employs depthwise separable convolutions, significantly reducing the number of parameters and the computational power of the model. By combining dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolutions, HC-Mamba is able to process large-scale medical image data at a much lower computational cost while maintaining a high level of performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments on segmentation tasks including organ segmentation and skin lesion, and conduct extensive experiments on Synapse, ISIC17 and ISIC18 to demonstrate the potential of the HC-Mamba model in medical image segmentation. The experimental results show that HC-Mamba exhibits competitive performance on all these datasets, thereby proving its effectiveness and usefulness in medical image segmentation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To introduce a deep learning model capable of multi-organ segmentation in MRI scans, offering a solution to the current limitations in MRI analysis due to challenges in resolution, standardized intensity values, and variability in sequences.
  Materials and Methods: he model was trained on 1,200 manually annotated MRI scans from the UK Biobank, 221 in-house MRI scans and 1228 CT scans, leveraging cross-modality transfer learning from CT segmentation models. A human-in-the-loop annotation workflow was employed to efficiently create high-quality segmentations. The model's performance was evaluated on NAKO and the AMOS22 dataset containing 600 and 60 MRI examinations. Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance (HD) was used to assess segmentation accuracy. The model will be open sourced.
  Results: The model showcased high accuracy in segmenting well-defined organs, achieving Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) scores of 0.97 for the right and left lungs, and 0.95 for the heart. It also demonstrated robustness in organs like the liver (DSC: 0.96) and kidneys (DSC: 0.95 left, 0.95 right), which present more variability. However, segmentation of smaller and complex structures such as the portal and splenic veins (DSC: 0.54) and adrenal glands (DSC: 0.65 left, 0.61 right) revealed the need for further model optimization.
  Conclusion: The proposed model is a robust, tool for accurate segmentation of 40 anatomical structures in MRI and CT images. By leveraging cross-modality learning and interactive annotation, the model achieves strong performance and generalizability across diverse datasets, making it a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians.

      <title>SparseGS: Real-Time 360{\deg} Sparse View Synthesis using Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of novel view synthesis has grown significantly in popularity recently with the introduction of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and other implicit scene representation methods. A recent advance, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), leverages an explicit representation to achieve real-time rendering with high-quality results. However, 3DGS still requires an abundance of training views to generate a coherent scene representation. In few shot settings, similar to NeRF, 3DGS tends to overfit to training views, causing background collapse and excessive floaters, especially as the number of training views are reduced. We propose a method to enable training coherent 3DGS-based radiance fields of 360-degree scenes from sparse training views. We integrate depth priors with generative and explicit constraints to reduce background collapse, remove floaters, and enhance consistency from unseen viewpoints. Experiments show that our method outperforms base 3DGS by 6.4% in LPIPS and by 12.2% in PSNR, and NeRF-based methods by at least 17.6% in LPIPS on the MipNeRF-360 dataset with substantially less training and inference cost.</description>

      <title>FusionMamba: Efficient Image Fusion with State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image fusion aims to generate a high-resolution multi/hyper-spectral image by combining a high-resolution image with limited spectral information and a low-resolution image with abundant spectral data. Current deep learning (DL)-based methods for image fusion primarily rely on CNNs or Transformers to extract features and merge different types of data. While CNNs are efficient, their receptive fields are limited, restricting their capacity to capture global context. Conversely, Transformers excel at learning global information but are hindered by their quadratic complexity. Fortunately, recent advancements in the State Space Model (SSM), particularly Mamba, offer a promising solution to this issue by enabling global awareness with linear complexity. However, there have been few attempts to explore the potential of the SSM in information fusion, which is a crucial ability in domains like image fusion. Therefore, we propose FusionMamba, an innovative method for efficient image fusion. Our contributions mainly focus on two aspects. Firstly, recognizing that images from different sources possess distinct properties, we incorporate Mamba blocks into two U-shaped networks, presenting a novel architecture that extracts spatial and spectral features in an efficient, independent, and hierarchical manner. Secondly, to effectively combine spatial and spectral information, we extend the Mamba block to accommodate dual inputs. This expansion leads to the creation of a new module called the FusionMamba block, which outperforms existing fusion techniques such as concatenation and cross-attention. We conduct a series of experiments on five datasets related to three image fusion tasks. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation results demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance, underscoring the superiority of FusionMamba. The code is available at https://github.com/PSRben/FusionMamba.</description>

      <title>Assessing The Impact of CNN Auto Encoder-Based Image Denoising on Image Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Images captured from the real world are often affected by different types of noise, which can significantly impact the performance of Computer Vision systems and the quality of visual data. This study presents a novel approach for defect detection in casting product noisy images, specifically focusing on submersible pump impellers. The methodology involves utilizing deep learning models such as VGG16, InceptionV3, and other models in both the spatial and frequency domains to identify noise types and defect status. The research process begins with preprocessing images, followed by applying denoising techniques tailored to specific noise categories. The goal is to enhance the accuracy and robustness of defect detection by integrating noise detection and denoising into the classification pipeline. The study achieved remarkable results using VGG16 for noise type classification in the frequency domain, achieving an accuracy of over 99%. Removal of salt and pepper noise resulted in an average SSIM of 87.9, while Gaussian noise removal had an average SSIM of 64.0, and periodic noise removal yielded an average SSIM of 81.6. This comprehensive approach showcases the effectiveness of the deep AutoEncoder model and median filter, for denoising strategies in real-world industrial applications. Finally, our study reports significant improvements in binary classification accuracy for defect detection compared to previous methods. For the VGG16 classifier, accuracy increased from 94.6% to 97.0%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed noise detection and denoising approach. Similarly, for the InceptionV3 classifier, accuracy improved from 84.7% to 90.0%, further validating the benefits of integrating noise analysis into the classification pipeline.</description>

      <title>EvaNet: Elevation-Guided Flood Extent Mapping on Earth Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and timely mapping of flood extent from high-resolution satellite imagery plays a crucial role in disaster management such as damage assessment and relief activities. However, current state-of-the-art solutions are based on U-Net, which can-not segment the flood pixels accurately due to the ambiguous pixels (e.g., tree canopies, clouds) that prevent a direct judgement from only the spectral features. Thanks to the digital elevation model (DEM) data readily available from sources such as United States Geological Survey (USGS), this work explores the use of an elevation map to improve flood extent mapping. We propose, EvaNet, an elevation-guided segmentation model based on the encoder-decoder architecture with two novel techniques: (1) a loss function encoding the physical law of gravity that if a location is flooded (resp. dry), then its adjacent locations with a lower (resp. higher) elevation must also be flooded (resp. dry); (2) a new (de)convolution operation that integrates the elevation map by a location sensitive gating mechanism to regulate how much spectral features flow through adjacent layers. Extensive experiments show that EvaNet significantly outperforms the U-Net baselines, and works as a perfect drop-in replacement for U-Net in existing solutions to flood extent mapping.</description>

      <title>WateRF: Robust Watermarks in Radiance Fields for Protection of Copyrights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advances in the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) research offer extensive applications in diverse domains, but protecting their copyrights has not yet been researched in depth. Recently, NeRF watermarking has been considered one of the pivotal solutions for safely deploying NeRF-based 3D representations. However, existing methods are designed to apply only to implicit or explicit NeRF representations. In this work, we introduce an innovative watermarking method that can be employed in both representations of NeRF. This is achieved by fine-tuning NeRF to embed binary messages in the rendering process. In detail, we propose utilizing the discrete wavelet transform in the NeRF space for watermarking. Furthermore, we adopt a deferred back-propagation technique and introduce a combination with the patch-wise loss to improve rendering quality and bit accuracy with minimum trade-offs. We evaluate our method in three different aspects: capacity, invisibility, and robustness of the embedded watermarks in the 2D-rendered images. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with faster training speed over the compared state-of-the-art methods.</description>
