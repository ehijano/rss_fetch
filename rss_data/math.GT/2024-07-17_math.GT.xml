Abstract: We show that the torus knots $T(2,5)$ and $T(2,9)$ bound smooth M\"{o}bius bands in the 4-ball whose double branched covers are negative definite, giving counterexamples to Conjectures 1.6 and 1.8 of Allen in [New York J. Math. 29 (2023) 1038-1059].</description>

      <title>Characterization of generic parameter families of constraint mappings in optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to understand generic behavior of constraint functions in optimization problems relying on singularity theory of smooth mappings. To this end, we will focus on the subgroup $\mathcal{K}[G]$ of the Mather's group $\mathcal{K}$, whose action to constraint map-germs preserves the corresponding feasible set-germs (i.e.~the set consisting of points satisfying the constraints). We will classify map-germs with small stratum $\mathcal{K}[G]_e$-codimensions, and calculate the codimensions of the $\mathcal{K}[G]$-orbits of jets represented by germs in the classification lists and those of the complements of these orbits. Applying these results and a variant of the transversality theorem, we will show that families of constraint mappings whose germ at any point in the corresponding feasible set is $\mathcal{K}[G]$-equivalent to one of the normal forms in the classification list compose a residual set in the entire space of constraint mappings with at most $4$-parameters. These results enable us to quantify genericity of given constraint mappings, and thus evaluate to what extent known test suites are generic.</description>

      <title>On the $n$-transitivity of the group of equivariant diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a Lie group and let $M$ be a proper smooth $G$-manifold. If $M$ is connected and $\dim(M)\geq 2$, the group of diffeomorphisms of $M$, that are isotopic to the identity through a compactly supported isotopy, acts $n$-transitively on $M$, for any $n$. In this paper, we prove a version of the $n$-transitivity result for the group of equivariant diffeomorphisms of $M$. As a corollary we obtain a result concerning diffeomorphisms of the orbit space $M/G$. A special case of the result for orbit spaces gives an $n$-transitivity result for orbifold diffeomorphisms that was earlier proved by F. Pasquotto and T. O. Rot.</description>

      <title>An Alexander Polynomial Obstruction to Cosmetic Crossing Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmetic crossing conjecture posits that switching a non-trivial crossing in a knot diagram always changes the knot type. Generalizing work of Balm, Friedl, Kalfagianni and Powell, and of Lidman and Moore, we give an Alexander polynomial condition that obstructs cosmetic crossing changes for knots with $L$-space branched double covers, a family that includes all alternating knots. As an application, we prove the cosmetic crossing conjecture for an infinite family of pretzel knots.</description>

      <title>Non-semisimple topological field theory and $\widehat{Z}$-invariants from $\mathfrak{osp}(1 \vert 2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct three dimensional non-semisimple topological field theories from the unrolled quantum group of the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(1 \vert 2)$. More precisely, the quantum group depends on a root of unity $q=e^{\frac{2 \pi \sqrt{-1}}{r}}$, where $r$ is a positive integer greater than $2$, and the construction applies when $r$ is not congruent to $4$ modulo $8$. The algebraic result which underlies the construction is the existence of a relative modular structure on the non-finite, non-semisimple category of weight modules for the quantum group. We prove a Verlinde formula which allows for the computation of dimensions and Euler characteristics of topological field theory state spaces of unmarked surfaces. When $r$ is congruent to $\pm 1$ or $\pm 2$ modulo $8$, we relate the resulting $3$-manifold invariants with physicists' $\widehat{Z}$-invariants associated to $\mathfrak{osp}(1 \vert 2)$. Finally, we establish a relation between $\widehat{Z}$-invariants associated to $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{osp}(1 \vert 2)$ which was conjectured in the physics literature.</description>

      <title>Row-Column Mirror Symmetry for Colored Torus Knot Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a recursive construction of the categorified Young symmetrizer introduced by Abel-Hogancamp in arXiv:1510.05330 corresponding to the single-column partition. As a consequence, we obtain new expressions for the uncolored $y$-ified HOMFLYPT homology of positive torus links and the $y$-ified column-colored HOMFLYPT homology of positive torus knots. In the latter case, we compare with the row-colored homology of positive torus knots computed by Hogancamp-Mellit in arXiv:1909.00418, verifying the mirror symmetry conjectures of arXiv:1112.0030 and arXiv:1304.3481 in this case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a condition involving noncommutative Alexander modules which ensures that a knot with Alexander module $\mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm 1}]/(t-2) \oplus \mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm 1}]/(t^{-1}- 2)$ is topologically doubly slice. As an application, we show that a satellite knot $R_\eta(K)$ is doubly slice if the pattern $R$ has Alexander module $\mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm 1}]/(t- 2) \oplus \mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm 1}]/(t^{-1}- 2)$ and satisfies this condition, and if the infection curve $\eta \subset S^3 \setminus R$ lies in the second derived subgroup $\pi_1(S^3 \setminus R)^{(2)}.$</description>

      <title>On the Kashaev signature conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2018, Kashaev introduced a square matrix indexed by the regions of a link diagram, and conjectured that it provides a novel way of computing the Levine-Tristram signature and Alexander polynomial of the corresponding oriented link. In this article, we show that for the classical signature (i.e. the Levine-Tristram signature at -1), this conjecture follows from the seminal work of Gordon-Litherland. We also relate Kashaev's matrix to Kauffman's "Formal Knot Theory" model of the Alexander polynomial. As a consequence, we establish the Alexander polynomial and classical signature parts of the conjecture for arbitrary links, as well as the full conjecture for definite knots.</description>

      <title>Graphes dans les surfaces et ergodicit\'e topologique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simplest way to make a dynamical system out of a finite connected graph $G$ is to give it a polarization, that is to say a cyclic ordering of the edges incident to a vertex, for each vertex. The phase space $\mathcal{P}(G)$ then consists of all pairs $(v,e)$ where $v$ is a vertex and $e$ is an edge incident to $v$. Such an initial condition gives a position and a momentum. The data $(v,e)$ is of course equivalent to an edge endowed with an orientation $e_{\mathcal O}$. With the polarization, each initial data leads to a leftward walk defined by turning left at each vertex, or making a rebound if there is no other edge. A leftward walk is called complete if it goes through all edges of $G$, not necessarily in both directions. As usual, we define the valence of a vertex as the number of edges incident to it, and we define the valence of a graph as the average of the valences of its vertices. In this article, we prove that if a graph which is embedded in a closed oriented surface of genus $g$ admits a complete leftward walk, then its valence is at most $1 + \sqrt{6g+1}$. We prove furthermore that this result is sharp for infinitely many genera $g$, and that it is asymptotically optimal as $g \to + \infty$. This leads to obstructions for the embeddability of graphs on a surface in a way which admits a complete leftward walk. Since checking that a polarized graph admits a complete leftward walk or not is done in time $4N$, where $N$ is the cardinality of the edges, this obstruction is particularly efficient in terms of computability. This problem has its origins in interesting consequences for what we will call here the topological ergodicity of conservative systems, especially Hamiltonian systems $H$ in two dimensions where the existence of a complete leftward walk corresponds to a topologically ergodic orbit of the system, i.e. an orbit of $H$ visiting all the topology of the surface.</description>

      <title>Cubes, cacti, and framed long knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an action of the operad of projective spineless cacti on each stage of the Taylor tower for the space of framed 1-dimensional long knots in any Euclidean space. By mapping a subspace of the overlapping intervals operad to the subspace of normalized cacti, we prove a space-level compatibility of our action with Budney's little 2-cubes action on the space of framed long knots itself. Our result improves upon previous joint work of the first author related to the conjecture that the Taylor tower for classical long knots is a universal Vassiliev invariant over the integers. As a corollary, we reprove the nontriviality of a certain Browder bracket class first detected by Sakai.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present examples of Legendrian knots in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that have linearized Legendrian contact homology over $\mathbb{Z}$ containing torsion. As a consequence, we show that there exist augmentations of Legendrian knots over $\mathbb{Z}$ that are not induced by exact Lagrangian fillings, even though their mod $2$ reductions are.</description>
