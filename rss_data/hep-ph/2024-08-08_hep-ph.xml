      <title>Proper Time Observables of General Gravitational Perturbations in Laser Interferometry-based Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicitly gauge-invariant observable of {\em any} general gravitational perturbation, $h_{\mu\nu}$ (\textit{not} necessarily due to gravitational waves (GWs)), in a laser interferometry-based GW detector, identifying the signature as the proper time elapsed of the beamsplitter observer, between two events: when a photon passes through the beamsplitter, and when the same photon returns to the beamsplitter after traveling through the interferometer arm and reflecting off the far mirror. Our formalism applies to simple Michelson interferometers and can be generalized to more advanced setups. We demonstrate that the proper time observable for a plane GW is equivalent to the detector strain commonly used by the GW community, though now the common framework can be easily generalized for other types of signals, such as dark matter clumps or spacetime fluctuations from quantum gravity. We provide a simple recipe for computing the proper time observable for a general metric perturbation in linearized gravity and explicitly show that it is invariant under diffeomorphisms of the perturbation, as any physical observable should be.</description>

      <title>Long-lived particle phenomenology in one-loop neutrino mass models with dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino masses and dark matter (DM) might have a common origin. The scotogenic model can be considered the proto-type model realizing this idea, but many other variants exist. In this paper we explore the phenomemology of a particular DM neutrino mass model, containing a triplet scalar. We calculate the relic density and check for constraints from direct detection experiments. The parameter space of the model, allowed by these constraints, contains typically a long-lived or quasi-stable doubly charged scalar, that can be searched for at the LHC. We reinterpret existing searches to derive limits on the masses of the scalars of the model and estimate future sensitivities in the high-luminosity phase of the LHC. The searches we discuss can serve to constrain also many other 1-loop neutrino mass models.</description>

      <title>Field Redefinitions in Classical Field Theory with some Quantum Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum field theories, field redefinitions are often employed to remove redundant operators in the Lagrangian, making calculations simpler and physics more evident. This technique requires some care regarding, among other things, the choice of observables, the range of applicability, and the appearance and disappearance of solutions of the equations of motion (EOM). Many of these issues can already be studied at the classical level, which is the focus of this work. We highlight the importance of selecting appropriate observables and initial/boundary conditions to ensure the physical invariance of solutions. A classical analogue to the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann (LSZ) formula is presented, confirming that some observables remain independent of field variables without tracking redefinitions. Additionally, we address, with an example, the limitations of non-invertible field redefinitions, particularly with non-perturbative objects like solitons, and discuss their implications for classical and quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Conversion of ALPs into Dark Photon Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a mechanism by which a misaligned ALP can be dynamically converted into a dark photon in the presence of a background magnetic field. An abundance of non-relativistic ALPs will convert to dark photons with momentum of order the inhomogeneities in the background field; therefore a highly homogeneous field will produce non-relativistic dark photons without relying on any redshifting of their momenta. Taking hidden sector magnetic fields produced by a first order phase transition, the mechanism can reproduce the relic abundance of dark matter for a wide range of dark photon masses down to $10^{-13}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Effective Theory for Partons in the Spirit of Steven Weinberg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard formulation of parton physics involves light-cone correlations of quark and gluon fields in a hadron, which leads to a widespread impression that it can only be studied through real-time Hamiltonian dynamics or light-front quantization, which are challenged by non-perturbative computations with a pertinent regulator for light-cone/rapidity divergences (or zero modes). As such, standard lattice QCD studies have been limited to indirect parton observables such as first few moments and short-distance correlations, which do not provide the $x$-distributions without solving the model-dependent inverse problem. Here I describe an alternative formulation of partons in terms of equal-time (or Euclidean) correlators, which allows to compute precision-controlled $x$-distribution through lattice QCD simulations. This approach is in accord with Weinberg's pioneering idea of effective field theory as well as Wilson's renormalization group, in which the large hadron momentum serves as a natural cut-off for light-cone/rapidity divergences and can ultimately be eliminated through a method like the ``perfect action'' program in lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Uniting Low-energy Semileptonic and Hadronic Anomalies within SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two categories of four-fermion SMEFT operators are semileptonic (two quarks and two leptons) and hadronic (four quarks). At tree level, an operator of a given category contributes only to processes of the same category. However, when the SMEFT Hamiltonian is evolved down from the new-physics scale to low energies using the renormalization-group equations (RGEs), due to operator mixing this same SMEFT operator can generate operators of the other category at one loop. Thus, to search for a SMEFT explanation of a low-energy anomaly, or combination of anomalies, one must: (i) identify the candidate semileptonic and hadronic SMEFT operators, (ii) run them down to low energy with the RGEs, (iii) generate the required low-energy operators with the correct Wilson coefficients, and (iv) check that all other constraints are satisfied. In this paper, we illustrate this method by finding all SMEFT operators that, by themselves, provide a combined explanation of the (semileptonic) $\bar b \to \bar s \ell^+ \ell^-$ anomalies and the (hadronic) $B \to K \pi$ puzzle.</description>

      <title>Heavy Neutral Lepton searches at an ICARUS-like detector using NuMI beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of non-zero neutrino masses points to the likely existence of multiple SM neutral fermions. When such states are heavy enough that they cannot be produced in oscillations, they are referred to as Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs). In minimal models, the HNL production and decay are controlled by SM interactions and the mixing between HNLs and the active neutrino and typically result in relatively long lifetimes if the masses are in the MeV-GeV range. We have studied the physics case and technical feasibility for a dedicated HNL search using the NuMI beam at an ICARUS-like detector. Our analysis conclusively demonstrates that the constraints on the mixing of the HNL as a function of its mass for an ICARUS-like detector with NuMI beam are highly competitive with the limits obtained from present experiments.</description>

      <title>Sivers and Boer-Mulders distributions in boost-invariant longitudinal position space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boost invariant longitudinal position space variable $\sigma$, the Fourier conjugate to skewness $\xi$, unravels the longitudinal impact parameter information in a proton. Here, we investigate skewness sensitivity of T-odd leading twist GTMDs considering a momentum transfer to longitudinal as well as transverse direction and present a detailed study of the spin-transverse momentum correlation through Sivers and Boer-Mulders Wigner Distributions in boost invariant longitudinal position space. The $\sigma$-space distributions of T-odd sector show oscillatory patterns sensitive to square of the total momentum transfer $-t$, analogous to the diffraction scattering of wave in Optics. An additional effect on the diffraction pattern is reported caused by interference between transverse momentum transfer $\bfd$ to the transverse momentum $\bfp$ of quarks.</description>

      <title>Probing radiative electroweak symmetry breaking with colliders and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative symmetry breaking provides an appealing explanation for electroweak symmetry breaking and addresses the hierarchy problem. We present a comprehensive phenomenological study of this scenario, focusing on its key feature: the logarithmic-shaped potential. This potential gives rise to a relatively light scalar boson that mixes with the Higgs boson and leads to first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in the early Universe. Our detailed analysis includes providing exact and analytical solutions for the vacuum structure and scalar interactions, classifying four patterns of cosmic thermal history, and calculating the supercooled FOPT dynamics and GWs. By combining future collider and gravitational wave experiments, we can probe the conformal symmetry breaking scales up to $10^5-10^8$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Singlino-dominated Thermal Neutralino Dark Matter in the $Z_3$ invariant NMSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the parameter space of the Next to Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) with Singlino-dominated neutralino $\widetilde\chi_1^0$ as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). Our study focuses on identifying the regions within this parameter space that produce a thermal relic abundance of $\widetilde\chi_1^0$ smaller than the observed cold dark matter relic density while remaining consistent with constraints from LEP measurements, low-energy experiments, Higgs measurements, LHC data, and dark matter direct detection experiments. We identify the dominant annihilation modes of the LSP neutralino across varying LSP mass ranges $\sim \mathcal{O}(1)-\mathcal{O}(10^{3})~$GeV. Furthermore, we conduct a benchmark study to assess the production rates of triple-boson final states emerging from direct electroweakino pair production at the LHC. Drawing insights from these findings, we perform a detailed collider analysis to explore the future potential of probing the triple-boson final states involving a light Higgs boson at the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).</description>

      <title>A 95 GeV Higgs boson and spontaneous CP-violation at the finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ATLAS and CMS collaborations reported a diphoton excess in the invariant mass distribution around the 95.4 GeV with a local significance of $3.1\sigma$. Moreover, there is another $2.3\sigma$ local excess in the $b\bar{b}$ final state at LEP in the same mass region. A plausible solution is that the Higgs sector is extended to include an additional Higgs bosom with a mass of $95.4$ GeV. We study a complex singlet scalar extension of the two-Higgs-doublet model in which the 95.4 GeV Higgs is from the mixing of three CP-even Higgs fields. In addition, the extended Higgs potential can achieve spontaneous CP-violation at the finite temperature and restore CP symmetry at the present temperature of the Universe. We find that the model can simultaneously explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, the diphoton and $b\bar{b}$ excesses around the 95.4 GeV while satisfying various relevant constraints including the experiments of collider and electric dipole moment.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Rotating Lifshitz Dilaton Black Brane in Quartic Quasitopological gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the rotating Lifshitz dilaton black brane solutions in the presence of the quartic quasitopological gravity and then probe the related thermodynamics. At first, we obtain the field equations form which a total constant along the radial coordinate $r$ is deduced. Since we cannot solve the solutions exactly, so we investigate their asymptotic behaviors at the horizon and at the infinity. We attain the conserved and thermodynamic quantities such as temperature, angular velocity, entropy, the energy and the angular momentum densities of the rotating quartic quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane. By evaluating the total constant at the horizon and the infinity, we can make a relation between the thermodynamic quantities and so get to a Smarr-type formula. We demonstrate that the thermodynamic quantities of this rotating black brane obey the first law of the thermodynamics. We also study the thermal stability of the rotating quartic quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane and it is not thermally stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We attempt to apply the Regge trajectory approach to the triply heavy triquarks. We present the triquark Regge trajectory relations, and then employ them to crudely estimate the spectra of the triquarks $((cc)\bar{c})$, $((cc)\bar{b})$, $((bc)\bar{c})$, $((bc)\bar{b})$, $((bb)\bar{c})$, and $((bb)\bar{b})$. The $\lambda$-trajectories and the $\rho$-trajectories are discussed. The triquark Regge trajectory becomes a new and very simple approach for estimating the spectra of triquarks.</description>

      <title>Deep Inelastic Scattering in the Capture of Dark Matter by Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the dense environment, neutron stars (NSs) can serve as an ideal laboratory for studying the interactions between dark matter (DM) and ordinary matter. In the process of DM capture, deep inelastic scattering may dominate over elastic scattering, especially for the DM with a large momentum transfer. In this work, we calculate DM-nucleon deep inelastic scattering via a vector mediator and estimate its contribution to the capture rate. Using the surface temperature of the NSs, we derive the exclusion limits for the DM-nucleon scattering cross section in the mass range, $1~{\rm GeV}&lt;m_{\chi}&lt; 10^{5}~{\rm GeV}$. We find the bounds for DM with the mass $\gtrsim$ 1 GeV can be changed several times after including the deep inelastic scattering contribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the late-time asymptotic solutions, attractor, and focusing behavior of minimal causal spin hydrodynamics in Bjorken expansion. Using the method of dominant balance, we derive the late-time asymptotic solutions of the evolution equation for spin density and identify the specific conditions necessary for the spin density to exhibit a power-law decay. We then analyze both the late-time and early-time attractors for the decay rate of spin density. Additionally, we report the focusing behavior in spin hydrodynamics, which has not been found in conventional relativistic hydrodynamics in Bjorken expansion. Our findings suggest that spin density can be treated as a conventional hydrodynamic variable at late times under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Modeling of Heavy-Quark Potential from Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), we construct a holographic model based on lattice QCD data for the heavy-quark potential in the 2+1 system. The deformation factor $w(r)$ in the metric is obtained using the two types of neural network. First, we numerically obtain $w(r)$ using MLP, accurately reproducing the QCD results of the lattice, and calculate the heavy quark potential at finite temperature and the chemical potential. Subsequently, we employ KAN within the Andreev-Zakharov model for validation purpose, which can analytically reconstruct $w(r)$, matching the Andreev-Zakharov model exactly and confirming the validity of MLP. Finally, we construct an analytical holographic model using KAN and study the heavy-quark potential at finite temperature and chemical potential using the KAN-based holographic model. This work demonstrates the potential of KAN to derive analytical expressions for high-energy physics applications.</description>

      <title>B Anomalies in Two Higgs Doublet Model with Flavor Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-standing flavor anomalies in $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ and $b \to c \ell \nu$ persist. In this work, we explore a specific flavor-gauged two-Higgs doublet model (FG2HDM) extended by a scalar singlet, with an imposed $U(1)$ flavor symmetry. Compared to the Standard Model (SM), four additional scalars and one neutral gauge boson $Z'$ are added to the particle spectrum. The special Yukawa coupling matrices, due to the $U(1)$ symmetry, lead to flavor-changing neutral Higgs (FCNH) interactions uniquely occurring in the down-type quark sector, while the new gauge boson $Z'$ induces flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) interactions in the down-type quark sector as well. The two distinct types of anomalies can be accommodated simultaneously in such a model. Incorporating scalar and vector contributions to $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ and $B_s^0$-$\bar{B}_s^0$ mixing, along with charged Higgs contributions to $b \to c \ell \nu$, we investigate the parameter space in FG2HDM and find substantial room in the solution space. Specifically, in the SM-like model setup, the data suggests that $m_{Z'} &lt; 450\, \text{GeV}$, $\tan\beta &lt; 28$, and $g'/m_{Z'} &gt; 3.5 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{GeV}^{-1}$, while there are fewer constraints on heavy scalars, which can be further tested by a combination of other observables.</description>

      <title>How the Contact Can Produce Snowballs from Hell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A loosely bound hadronic molecule produced by a relativistic heavy-ion collision has been described as a "snowball in hell" since it emerges from a hadron gas whose temperature is orders of magnitude larger than the binding energy of the molecule. This remarkable phenomenon can be explained in terms of a novel thermodynamic variable called the "contact" that is conjugate to the binding momentum of the molecule. The production rate of the molecule can be expressed in terms of the contact density at the kinetic freezeout of the hadron gas. It approaches a nonzero limit as the binding energy goes to 0.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness Criteria for the Virasoro-Shapiro Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Veneziano amplitude has recently been uniquely bootstrapped from crossing symmetry, faster than power-law falloff at high energies, and a property dubbed level truncation. In this paper we apply this bootstrap approach to fully permutation invariant amplitudes, deriving new deformations of the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude for graviton scattering in string theory. Superpolynomially soft Regge behavior yields the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude as the unique solution, and we find the string spectrum as an output rather than an input of the bootstrap. While the remaining variations exhibit the same Regge scaling as pure gravity, in the tensionless limit they reproduce remarkable extremal amplitudes that have appeared in bottom-up studies of positivity.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay nuclear matrix elements complete up to N$^2$LO in heavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate all nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) up to next-to-next-to leading order (N$^2$LO) in chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) for the neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay of the nuclei most relevant for experiments, including $^{76}$Ge, $^{100}$Mo, and $^{136}$Xe. We use the proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation (pnQRPA) and the nuclear shell model to calculate the N$^2$LO NMEs from very low-momentum (ultrasoft) neutrinos and from loop diagrams usually neglected in $0\nu\beta\beta$ studies. Our results indicate that, separately, the new N$^2$LO NMEs can have up to a $15\%$ impact on the total NME, but cancellations lead to an overall N$^2$LO contribution centered around $-5\%$ for the shell model and $+10\%$ for the pnQRPA, with sizable uncertainties due to the short-range nature of the loop NMEs. The sign discrepancy between many-body methods is common to all studied nuclei and points to the different behaviour of the intermediate states of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. In addition, our results support the $\chi$EFT prediction that the ultrasoft NME is closely related to contributions usually referred to as ``beyond the closure approximation''.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-spin asymmetries observed in polarised deep-inelastic scattering are important probes of hadron structure. The Sivers asymmetry has been the focus of much attention in QCD phenomenology and is yet to be understood at the quark level. In this Letter, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the spatial distribution of a colour-Lorentz force acting on the struck quark in a proton. We determine a spin-independent confining force, as well as spin-dependent force distributions with local forces on the order of 3 GeV/fm. These distributions offer a complementary picture of the Sivers asymmetry in transversely polarised deep-inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>The massless S-matrix of integrable $\sigma$-models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contradistinction to the case of massive excitations, the connection between integrability and the tree-level massless scattering matrix of integrable $\sigma$-models is lost. Namely, in well-known 2-d integrable models the tree-level massless S-matrix exhibits particle production and fails to factorise. This is conjectured to happen due to IR ambiguities in the massless tree-level amplitudes. We present a definition of the massless S-matrix which has all the nice properties of integrable theories, there is no particle production and the S-matrix factorises. As an example, we present in detail the case of the $SU(2)$ principal chiral model (PCM).</description>

      <title>Infrared Sensitivity of Cosmological Probes In The Presence of Axion Field Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of long wavelength entropy fluctuations on cosmological probes such as galaxy clustering, luminosity distance, and CMB temperature anisotropies. Specifically, we consider fluctuations of a massless spectator scalar field set up in the early universe, which later acquires mass during the radiation-dominated era. We find that there are non-vanishing effects on observables, and the amplitude of these effects peaks for observables set up at the time of equal matter and radiation, and decreases as $\eta^{-2}$ where $\eta$ is the conformal time. Hence, the back-reaction effects are important for CMB anisotropies, but their impact on late-time observables is suppressed. In particular, the back-reaction effects are unable to explain the Hubble tension while they might alleviate the cosmic dipole tension. In contrast to a lot of the previous work on back-reaction, we work in position rather than momentum space.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of dark matter admixed neutron star based on recent observational constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EOS) for neutron stars is modeled using the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) approach with a mesonic nonlinear (NL) interaction, a modified sigma cut potential (NL-$\sigma$ cut), and the influences of dark matter in the NL (NL DM). Using a Bayesian analysis framework, we evaluate the plausibility and impact of each scenario. Experimental constraints on the general properties of finite nuclei and heavy ion collisions, along with astrophysical observational data on neutron star radii and tidal deformation, have been taken into account. It was shown that all models, including the PREX-II data, were less favored, indicating that this experimental data seemed to be in tension with the other constraints included in the inference procedure, and were incompatible with chiral effective field theoretical calculations of pure neutron matter. Considering the models with no PREX-II constraints, we find the model NL-$\sigma$ cut with the largest Bayes evidence, indicating that the constraints considered favor the stiffening of the EOS at large densities. Conversely, the neutron star with a dark matter component is the least favorable case in light of recent observational constraints, among different scenarios considered here. The $f$ and $p$ modes were calculated within the Cowling approximation, and it can be seen that $f$ modes are sensitive to the EOS. An analysis of the slopes of the mass-radius curves and $f$-mode mass curves has indicated that these quantities may help distinguish the different scenarios.We also analyzed the impact of new PSR J0437-4715 measurements on neutron star mass-radius estimates, noting a $\sim$ 0.2 km reduction in the 90\% CI upper boundary across all models and a significant Bayes evidence decrease, indicating potential conflicts with previous data or the necessity for more adaptable models.</description>

      <title>4D de Sitter from String Theory via 6D Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain de Sitter (dS) solutions from controlled string-theory constructions. We review how minimal gauged chiral 6D supergravity evades standard dS no-go theorems by having a positive scalar potential and describe the known 4D classical dS, AdS and Minkowski solutions. Grimm and collaborators recently found a related 6D supergravity by direct F-theory Calabi-Yau flux compactifications and we construct classical 4D maximally symmetric solutions for this 6D supergravity. These provide explicit solutions of the higher-dimensional field equations corresponding to dS, AdS and flat spacetimes in 4D, allowing interesting hierarchies of scales. We show how the singularities of these solutions are consistent with the back-reaction of two space-filling 4D brane-like sources situated within the extra dimensions and infer some of the properties of these sources using the formalism of point particle effective field theory (PPEFT), showing the sources are not vanilla objects like D branes. These tools relate the near-source asymptotic forms of bulk fields to source properties and have been extensively tested for more prosaic physical systems involving the back-reaction of small sources, such as the dependence of atomic energy levels on nuclear properties. We use it to determine the tension of the brane-like sources (that can be positive) and its derivatives. We verify that the solutions are in the weak coupling/large volume regime required to neglect quantum and $\alpha'$ effects.</description>

      <title>Investigation of pion-nucleon contributions to nucleon matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate contributions of excited states to nucleon matrix elements computed in lattice QCD by employing, in addition to the standard nucleon interpolating operator, pion-nucleon ($\pi$-$N$) operators. We solve a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) to obtain an optimal interpolating operator that minimizes overlap with the $\pi$-$N$ states. We derive a variant of the standard application of the GEVP method, which allows for constructing 3-point correlation functions using the optimized interpolating operator without requiring the computationally demanding combination that includes $\pi$-$N$ operators in both sink and source. We extract nucleon matrix elements using two twisted mass fermion ensembles, one ensemble generated using pion mass of 346 MeV and one ensemble tuned to reproduce the physical value of the pion mass. Especially, we determine the isoscalar and isovector scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial, and tensor matrix elements. We include results obtained using a range of kinematic setups, including momentum in the sink. Our results using this variational approach are compared with previous results obtained using the same ensembles and multi-state fits without GEVP improvement. We find that for the physical mass point ensemble, the improvement, in terms of suppression of excited states using this method, is most significant for the case of the matrix elements of the isovector axial and pseudoscalar currents.</description>

Abstract: We develop a self-supervised method for density-based anomaly detection using contrastive learning, and test it using event-level anomaly data from CMS ADC2021. The AnomalyCLR technique is data-driven and uses augmentations of the background data to mimic non-Standard-Model events in a model-agnostic way. It uses a permutation-invariant Transformer Encoder architecture to map the objects measured in a collider event to the representation space, where the data augmentations define a representation space which is sensitive to potential anomalous features. An AutoEncoder trained on background representations then computes anomaly scores for a variety of signals in the representation space. With AnomalyCLR we find significant improvements on performance metrics for all signals when compared to the raw data baseline.</description>

      <title>CPT-Odd effects on magnetic dipole moments in the Standard Model Extension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of the CPT-Odd electroweak gauge sector of the Standard Model Extension on the magnetic dipole moment of charged leptons is studied. This gauge sector is characterized by the $(k_1)_\mu$ and $(k_2)_\mu$ Lorentz coefficients, which have positive mass dimension because they are associated with a $U_Y(1)$-invariant and with an $SU_L(2)$-invariant dimension-three operators, respectively. We present a comprehensive study up to second order in these Lorentz coefficients, both at the tree and one-loop levels. We find that the first-order contributions in the Lorentz coefficients at the tree and one-loop levels depend on energy, while second-order ones at the tree-level do not. As for second-order one-loop effects, there are both energy-dependent and energy-independent contributions, but we have focused only on those of the latter type. We find that the contribution to the dipole associated with the electron is by far the dominant one, as it can be up to fourteen and sixteen orders of magnitude greater than that of the muon and that of the tau, respectively. The Lorentz coefficient $(k_{AF})_\mu$ of the Carroll-Field-Jackiw's QED is given by a linear combination of the $(k_1)_\mu$ and $(k_2)_\mu$ vectors. Assuming that $|k^2_1|, |k^2_2|\gg |k^2_{AF}|$ and taking $(k_{AF})_\mu=0$, which implies that $(k_1)_\mu$ and $(k_2)_\mu$ are collinear, we obtain an upper bound of $\left|-(3.49\times 10^{-4})\frac{(k_2)_0}{m_e}+\frac{k^2_2}{m_e^2}\right|&lt;3.27\times 10^{-19}$. The fact that $k^2_2$ is an observer Lorentz invariant allows us to introduce a new-physics scale through $\sqrt{k^2_2}=\Lambda_{CPT}$ and also to consider the possibility of a light-like vector $k^2_2=0$. In the first case, second-order effects lead to the upper bound $\Lambda_{CPT}&lt;5.74\times 10^{-10}\, m_e$, while in the latter case, the first-order contribution leads to $(k_2)_0=\left|\mathbf{k_2}\right|&lt;10^{-15}\, m_e$.</description>

      <title>Testing Meson Portal Dark Sector Solutions to the MiniBooNE Anomaly at CCM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02599v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A solution to the MiniBooNE excess invoking rare three-body decays of the charged pions and kaons to new states in the MeV mass scale was recently proposed as a dark-sector explanation. This class of solution illuminates the fact that, while the charged pions were focused in the target-mode run, their decay products were isotropically suppressed in the beam-dump-mode run in which no excess was observed. This suggests a new physics solution correlated to the mesonic sector. We investigate an extended set of phenomenological models that can explain the MiniBooNE excess as a dark sector solution, utilizing long-lived particles that might be produced in the three-body decays of the charged mesons and the two-body anomalous decays of the neutral mesons. Over a broad set of interactions with the long-lived particles, we show that these scenarios can be compatible with constraints from LSND, KARMEN, and MicroBooNE, and evaluate the sensitivity of the ongoing and future data taken by the Coherent CAPTAIN Mills experiment (CCM) to a potential discovery in this parameter space.</description>

      <title>HL-LHC sensitivity to higgsinos from natural SUSY with gravitino LSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of natural supersymmetric models, higgsinos are typically the lightest electroweakinos. In gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking models, the lightest higgsino-dominated particles decay into a $Z$-boson or a Higgs boson ($h$), along with an ultra-light gravitino ($\tilde{G}$) serving as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). This scenario suggests a significant non-resonant $hh$ production. Basing on the recent global fitting results of the $\tilde{G}$-EWMSSM (MSSM with light electroweakinos and an eV-scale gravitino as the LSP) performed by the \textsf{GAMBIT} collaboration, which support a higgsino dominated electroweakino as light as 140 GeV, we develop two simplified models to evaluate their detection potential at the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) with $\sqrt{s} = 14~{\rm TeV}$ and an integrated luminosity of $3000~{\rm fb}^{-1}$. The first model examines the processes where heavier higgsino-dominated states decay into soft $W/Z$ bosons, while the second focuses on direct decays of all three higgsino-dominated electroweakinos into $W/Z/h$ plus a $\tilde{G}$. Our study, incorporating both models and their distinct decay channels, utilizes detailed Monte Carlo simulations for signals and standard model backgrounds. We find that the HL-LHC can probe higgsinos up to 575 GeV, potentially discovering or excluding the natural SUSY scenario in the context of a gravitino LSP. Further, we reinterpret this discovery potential using the GAMBIT global fit samples, and find that the entire parameter space of $|\mu| \leq 500~{\rm GeV}$ with an electroweak fine-tuning measure ($\Delta_{\rm EW}$) under 100 in $\tilde{G}$-EWMSSM is accessible at the HL-LHC.</description>

Abstract: We compute the N-jettiness soft function in hadronic collisions to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the strong-coupling expansion. Our calculation is based on an extension of the SoftSERVE framework to soft functions that involve an arbitrary number of lightlike Wilson lines. We present numerical results for 1-jettiness and 2-jettiness, and illustrate that our formalism carries over to a generic number of jets by calculating a few benchmark points for 3-jettiness. We also perform a detailed analytic study of the asymptotic behaviour of the soft-function coefficients at the edges of phase space, when one of the jets becomes collinear to another jet or beam direction, and comment on previous calculations of the N-jettiness soft function.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we mainly predict the rates of $M$1 radiative and spin-nonflip $\pi\pi$ transitions of the $B_{c}$-meson under the nonrelativistic Cornell potential model with a screening potential effect. We employ the numerical wave function to determine the $M$1 radiative transition widths of $B_c$ excited states and utilize the Kuang-Yan proposed method for the spin-nonflip $\pi\pi$ transitions among $B_c$ states. Our theoretical results are valuable for studying the $M$1 radiative and spin-nonflip $\pi\pi$ transition processes of $B_c$ states in experiments.</description>

      <title>Dynamical origin of neutrino masses and dark matter from a new confining sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dynamical mechanism, based on a confining non-abelian dark symmetry, which generates Majorana masses for hypercharge-less fermions, is proposed. We apply it to the inverse seesaw scenario, which allows to generate light neutrino masses from the interplay of TeV-scale Pseudo-Dirac mass terms and a small explicit breaking of lepton number. A single generation of vector-like dark quarks, transforming under a $\text{SU}(3)_\text{D}$ gauge symmetry, is coupled to a real singlet scalar, which serves as a portal between the dark quark condensate and three generations of heavy sterile neutrinos. Such a dark sector and the Standard Model (SM) are kept in thermal equilibrium with each other via sizeable Yukawa couplings to the heavy neutrinos. In this framework the lightest dark baryon, which has spin $3/2$ and is stabilized at the renormalizable level by an accidental dark baryon number symmetry, can account for the observed relic density via thermal freeze-out from annihilations into the lightest dark mesons. These mesons in turn decay to heavy neutrinos, which produce SM final states upon decay. This model may be probed by next generation neutrino telescopes via neutrino lines produced from dark matter annihilations.</description>

Abstract: Parton distribution functions play a pivotal role in hadron collider phenomenology. They are non-perturbative quantities extracted from fits to available data, and their scale dependence is dictated by the DGLAP evolution equations. In this article, we discuss machine-assisted strategies to efficiently compute PDFs directly incorporating the scale evolution without the need of separately solving DGLAP equations. Analytical approximations to the PDFs as a function of $x$ and $Q^2$, including up to next-to-leading order effects in Quantum Chromodynamics, are obtained. The methodology is tested by reproducing the $\texttt{HERAPDF2.0}$ set and implementing the analytical expressions in benchmarking codes. It is found that the computational cost is reduced while the precision of the simulations stays well under control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18217v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the holographic model, which incorporates the equation of state (EoS) and baryon number susceptibility for different flavors, we calculate the drag force, jet quenching parameter, and diffusion coefficient of the heavy quark at finite temperature and chemical potential. The holographic results for the diffusion coefficient align with lattice data for $N_f = 0$ and $N_f = 2+1$, falling within their error margins. The holographic diffusion coefficient for heavy quark in the systems of different flavors agrees with the fitting results of ALICE data well. The jet quenching parameter in our model demonstrates strong consistency with the results from both RHIC and LHC for different flavors. By comparing the experimental data with other models, we can confirm the validity of our holographic model calculation. The work reinforces the potential of bottom-up holographic model in advancing our understanding of transport properties of hot and dense quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dark Sector of the inspired FNSM at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the possibility of having a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) Dark Matter (DM) candidate in the inspired Froggatt-Nielsen Singlet Model (iFNSM) wherein a direct connection exists between the DM mass and new flavon symmetry-breaking scale. We find a considerable allowed region of parameter space for the ensuing pseudoscalar DM, which is dependent upon the flavon Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV) and Yukawa couplings, over which it may be possible to explain the fermion mass hierarchy. Finally, we choose a Benchmark Point (BP) and perform detailed collider analyses to probe this DM state in the context of Run 3 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Specifically, in this model, one obtains large missing transverse energy ($\slashed{E}_T$) when the DM particle is resonantly produced from the decay of a heavy Higgs field, along with multiple jets from Initial State Radiation (ISR). Thus, the ensuing $\slashed{E}_T$ + $n\, {\rm jets}~(n \geq 1)$ signature is an excellent probe of DM in this construct.</description>

Abstract: Within the framework of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) model, which incorporates information on the equation of state and baryon number susceptibility from lattice results, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the potential energy, running coupling, and dissociation time for heavy quark-antiquark pairs using gauge/gravity duality. This study encompasses various systems, including pure gluon systems, 2 flavor systems, 2+1 flavor systems, and 2+1+1 flavor systems under finite temperature and chemical potential. The results reveal that the linear component of the potential energy diminishes as the flavor increases. It is also found that our results are extremely close to the recent lattice results for 2+1 flavors at finite temperature. Moreover, we have thoroughly investigated the dissociation distance and running coupling constant of quark-antiquark pairs to gain a comprehensive understanding of their behavior across various flavors. Finally, we have examined real-time dynamics of quark dissociation. The findings indicate that the dissociation time of quark-antiquark pairs is dependent on temperature, chemical potential, and flavor of the systems.</description>

      <title>Antenna subtraction for processes with identified particles at hadron colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collider processes with identified hadrons in the final state are widely studied in view of determining details of the proton structure and of understanding hadronization. Their theory description requires the introduction of fragmentation functions, which parametrise the transition of a produced parton into the identified hadron. To compute higher-order perturbative corrections to these processes requires a subtraction method for infrared singular configurations. We extend the antenna subtraction method to hadron fragmentation processes in hadronic collisions up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD by computing the required fragmentation antenna functions in initial-final kinematics. The integrated antenna functions retain their dependence on the momentum fractions of the incoming and fragmenting partons.</description>

      <title>Emergent particles of de Sitter: thermal interpretation of the stochastic formalism and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A thermal interpretation of the stochastic formalism of a slow-rolling scalar field in de Sitter (dS) is given. We construct a correspondence between Hubble patches of dS and particles living in another space called an abstract space. By assuming a dual description of scalar fields and classical mechanics in the abstract space, we show that the stochastic evolution of the infrared part of the field is equivalent to the Brownian motion in the abstract space filled with a heat bath of massless particles. The 1st slow-roll condition and the Hubble expansion are also reinterpreted in the abstract space as the speed of light and a transfer of conserved energy, respectively. Inspired by this, we sketch quantum emergent particles, which may realize the Hubble expansion by an exponential particle production. This gives another meaning of dS entropy as entropy per Hubble volume.</description>

      <title>Correlated scalar perturbations and gravitational waves from axion inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scalar and tensor fluctuations generated during inflation can be correlated, if arising from the same underlying mechanism. In this paper we investigate such correlation in the model of axion inflation, where the rolling inflaton produces quanta of a $U(1)$ gauge field which, in turn, source scalar and tensor fluctuations. We compute the primordial correlator of the curvature perturbation, $\zeta$, with the gravitational energy density, $\Omega_{GW}$, at frequencies probed by gravitational wave detectors. This two-point function receives two contributions: one arising from the correlation of gravitational waves with the scalar perturbations generated by the standard mechanism of amplification of vacuum fluctuations, and the other coming from the correlation of gravitational waves with the scalar perturbations sourced by the gauge field. Our analysis shows that the former effect is generally dominant. For typical values of the parameters, the correlator, normalized by the amplitude of $\zeta$ and by the fractional energy in gravitational waves at interferometer frequencies, turns out to be of the order of $ 10^{-4}\div 10^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Metastable Dark Energy Decaying into Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the proposal that an energy transfer from dark energy into dark matter can be described in field theory by a first order phase transition. We analyze the model proposed in Ref. Abdalla et al. (2013), using updated constraints on the decay time of a metastable dark energy from the work of Ref. Shafieloo et al. (2018). The results of our analysis show no prospects for potentially observable signals that could distinguish this scenario. We also show that such model would not drive a complete transition to a dark matter dominated phase even in a distant future. Nevertheless, the model is not excluded by the latest data and we confirm that the mass of the dark matter particle that would result from such a process corresponds to an axion-like particle, which is currently one of the best motivated dark matter candidates. We argue that extensions to this model, possibly with additional couplings, still deserve further attention as it could provide an interesting and viable description for an interacting dark sector scenario based in a single scalar field.</description>

      <title>Tidal Formation of dark matter deficit diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2 by SIDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations have revealed a significant dark matter deficit in the ultra-diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2 (DF2). It is widely accepted that the formation of this unique galaxy can be attributed to the tidal stripping of its host galaxy, NGC1052. In this study, we simulate the evolution of a satellite system containing globular clusters (GCs) within an accreting host halo in the framework of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). Our simulation results suggest that the heightened tidal stripping resulting from DM self-interactions can give rise to the transformation of a conventional dwarf galaxy into a dark matter deficit galaxy resembling DF2. By comparing the simulation results with identical initial conditions in both the standard cold dark matter (CDM) and SIDM models, we find that the latter is more likely to replicate the properties of DF2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a DF2 analog can also be produced on an orbit with a greater pericenter distance by increasing the strength of DM self-interactions. This suggests that the issue of extreme orbital parameters can be mitigated by implementing the SIDM model. The distributions of the GC population derived in our SIDM simulation are consistent with the observed characteristics of DF2. For comparison, we also explored the potential for achieving GC distributions in the context of CDM.</description>

      <title>Superradiance in the Bulk Protects Quantum State Evolution of Rapidly Rotating Matter on the Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that the rate at which the interior of an AdS black hole evolves is dual to the rate of evolution of the (quantum state of the) strongly coupled matter on the boundary which, according to holography, is dual to the black hole. However, we have shown elsewhere that it seems to be possible, by adjusting the specific angular momentum of an AdS$_5$-Kerr black hole, to reduce this rate to (effectively) zero. We argue that this is unphysical, and that it is prevented by the intervention of a superradiant instability, which causes the black hole to shed angular momentum when the angular velocity exceeds a certain critical value. The precise way in which this works has recently been explained by the ``grey galaxy'' model of the end state, in which the angular momentum is transferred to a ``galactic disc.'' Thus, the black hole itself cannot sustain a specific angular momentum beyond a critical value: there is an effective upper bound. The holographic interpretation is that, beyond a certain limiting specific angular momentum, strongly coupled matter (corresponding to the black hole) will spontaneously shed angular momentum to some other, confined, form of matter (corresponding to the disc). This idea is supported by recent numerical work on ultra-vortical plasmas. Such an upper bound on specific angular momentum would prevent arbitrarily small rates of quantum state evolution on the boundary. We give a tentative discussion of the relevant observational data in the case of the vortical Quark-Gluon Plasma, and suggest a way in which such an upper bound might appear in future observations.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy of Non-Supersymmetric $\mathbf{\tilde{S}}$ Heterotic String Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the free fermionic formulation of the heterotic-string in four dimensions to study the vacuum structure and energy of non-supersymmetric tachyon free models that correspond to compactifications of tachyonic vacua of the ten dimensional heterotic-string. We explore the class of heterotic $SO(10)$ non-supersymmetric models constructed from the $\tilde{S}$-model in the Free Fermionic Formalism, and investigate the dependence of the potential on the geometric moduli. This paper will explore a sample of $ 10^{9}$ string vacua to find the frequency of viable models, classifying these vacua by the following fertility criteria: tachyon presence; number of spinorial $\boldsymbol{16/\overline{16}}$ representations; vectorial $\boldsymbol{10}$ states; Top Quark Mass Coupling compatibility. Of these we find those that mimic supersymmetric models with equal number of bosons and fermions at the massless level - $a_{00} = 0$. Tachyon free models occur with a frequency of $5.309\times10^{-3}$. Furthermore, models that fulfil the rest of the phenomenological fertility conditions and the additional condition on $a_{00}$ occur with probability $4.0 \times 10^{-9}$ We analyse the partition functions and study the moduli dependence of such models, finding that almost all fertile models have finite, positive potential at the Free Fermionic Point, with $2$ out of $84$ of the fertile cores having negative, finite potential. We demonstratate that the Free Fermionic Point is not necessarily a minimum in the potential. This work provides further evidence that supersymmetry may not be a necessary ingredient of phenomenological models, recreating many of the desirable features of such models without employing supersymmetry.</description>
