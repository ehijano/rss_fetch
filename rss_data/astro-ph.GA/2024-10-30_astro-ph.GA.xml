      <title>Blind source separation of the stellar halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar halo of the Milky Way comprises an abundance of chemical signatures from accretion events and \textit{in-situ} evolution, that form an interweaving tapestry in kinematic space. To untangle this, we consider the mixtures of chemical information, in a given region of integral of motion space, as a variant of the blind source separation problem and utilise non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF). Specifically, we examine the variation in [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], and [Al/Fe] distributions of APOGEE DR17 stars across the $(E,L_z)$ plane of the halo. When 2 components are prescribed, the NMF algorithm splits stellar halo into low- and high-energy components in the $(E,L_z)$ plane which approximately correspond to the accreted and \textit{in-situ} halo respectively. We use these two components to define a new boundary between the \textit{in-situ} and the accreted stellar halo. Moreover, we calculate the components fractional contribution to the stellar halo as a function of energy, galactocentric spherical radius, height, and galactocentric cylindrical radius. Using a stellar halo defined by kinematic cuts, we find that the halo transitions from \textit{in-situ} dominated to accretion dominated at $E \approx -1.67 \times 10^5$ (km/s)$^2$ (using the potential in McMillan 2017), and at $(r,z,R) \approx (8.7, 3.0, 8.1)$ kpc. The low-energy component is found to span a range of [Al/Fe] that falls beyond the typically accepted \textit{in-situ} floor of [Al/Fe] $=0$. Upon prescribing more components to the NMF model, we find hints of the existence of overlapping chemical evolution sequences that other techniques struggle to find. We also examine features within these components that resemble known substructures in the halo, such as \textit{Eos} and \textit{Aurora}. This work provides insight into their origin and the part they play in the Milky Way's formation.</description>

      <title>X-ray cavities in TNG-Cluster: AGN phenomena in the full cosmological context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxy clusters plays a key role in regulating star formation and shaping the intracluster medium (ICM), often manifesting through prominent X-ray cavities embedded in the cluster's hot atmosphere. Here we show that X-ray cavities arise naturally due to AGN feedback in TNG-Cluster. This is a new suite of magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution, and hence of galaxy clusters, whereby cold dark matter, baryon dynamics, galactic astrophysics, and magnetic fields are evolved together consistently. We construct mock Chandra X-ray observations of the central regions of the 352 simulated clusters at $z=0$ and find that $\sim$39 per cent contain X-ray cavities. Identified X-ray cavities vary in configuration (single, pairs, or multiples), with some still attached to SMBHs, while others have buoyantly risen. Their size ranges from a few to several tens of kpc. In terms of gas physical properties, TNG-Cluster X-ray cavities are underdense compared to the surrounding halo and filled with hot gas ($\sim$10$^8$K); 25 per cent of them are surrounded by an X-ray bright and compressed rim associated with a weak shock (Mach number $\sim 1.5$). Clusters exhibiting X-ray cavities are preferentially strong or weak cool-cores, are dynamically relaxed, and host SMBHs accreting at low Eddington rates. We show that TNG-Cluster X-ray cavities originate from episodic, wind-like energy injections from central AGN. Our results illustrate the existence and diversity of X-ray cavities simulated in state-of-the-art models within realistic cosmological environments and show that these can form without necessarily invoking bipolar, collimated, or relativistic jets.</description>

      <title>Molecular Hydrogen in the Extremely Metal-Poor, Star-Forming Galaxy Leo P</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed unexpectedly rapid galaxy assembly in the early universe, in tension with models of star and galaxy formation. In the gas conditions typical of early galaxies, particularly their low abundances of heavy elements (metals) and dust, the star-formation process is poorly understood. Some models predict that stars form in atomic gas at low metallicity, in contrast to forming in molecular gas as observed in higher-metallicity galaxies. To understand the very high star-formation rates at early epochs, it is necessary to determine whether molecular gas formation represents a bottleneck to star formation, or if it is plentiful even at extremely low metallicity. Despite repeated searches, star-forming molecular gas has not yet been observed in any galaxy below 7% of the Solar metallicity, leaving the question of how stars form at lower metallicities unresolved. Here, we report the detection of rotationally excited emission from molecular hydrogen in the star-forming region of the nearby, 3% Solar metallicity galaxy Leo P with the MIRI-MRS instrument onboard JWST. These observations place a lower limit on the molecular gas content of Leo P and, combined with our upper limit on carbon monoxide emission from a deep search of this galaxy, demonstrate that MIRI-MRS is sensitive to much smaller molecular gas masses at extremely low metallicity compared to the traditional observational tracer. This discovery pushes the maximum metallicity at which purely atomic gas may fuel star formation a factor of two lower, providing crucial empirical guidance for models of star formation in the early universe.</description>

      <title>An Indication of Gas Inflow in Clumpy Star-Forming Galaxies near $z\sim1$: Lower Gas-Phase Metallicities in Clumpy Galaxies Compared to Non-Clumpy Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of clumpy star-forming galaxies at high-redshift, the origin of clumps are still largely unconstrained due to the limited observations that can validate the mechanisms for clump formation. We postulate that if clumps form due to the accretion of metal-poor gas that leads to violent disk instability, clumpy galaxies should have lower gas-phase metallicities compared to non-clumpy galaxies. In this work, we obtain the near-infrared spectrum for 42 clumpy and non-clumpy star-forming galaxies of similar masses, SFRs, and colors at $z\approx0.7$ using the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS) and infer their gas-phase metallicity from the {\nii} and {\halpha} line ratio. We find that clumpy galaxies have lower metallicities compared to non-clumpy galaxies, with an offset in the weighted average metallicity of $0.07\pm0.02$ dex. We also find an offset of $0.06\pm0.02$ dex between clumpy and non-clumpy galaxies in a comparable sample of 23 star-forming galaxies at $z\approx1.5$ using existing data from the FMOS-COSMOS survey. Similarly, lower {\nii}/{\halpha} ratio are typically found in galaxies that have more of their $\mathrm{UV_{rest}}$ luminosity originating from clumps, suggesting that \enquote{clumpier} galaxies are more metal poor. We also derive the intrinsic velocity dispersion and line-of-sight rotational velocity for galaxies from the GNIRS sample. The majority of galaxies have $\sigma_0/v_c \approx 0.2$, with no significant difference between clumpy and non-clumpy galaxies. Our result indicates that clump formation may be related to the inflow of metal-poor gas; however, the process that forms them does not necessarily require significant, long-term kinematic instability in the disk.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-MC: Self-consistent $\alpha$-enhanced stellar population models covering a wide range of age, metallicity, and wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new stellar population models, $\alpha$-MC, self-consistently taking into account non-solar $\rm [\alpha/Fe]$ abundances for both isochrones and stellar spectra. The $\alpha$-MC models are based on $\alpha$-enhanced MIST isochrones and C3K spectral libraries, which are publicly available in FSPS. Our new models cover a wide range of ages ($\rm \log (age/yr) = 5.0 - 10.3$), metallicities ($\rm [Fe/H]=[-2.5,+0.5]$ in steps of 0.25, $\rm [\alpha/Fe]=-0.2,+0.0,+0.2,+0.4,+0.6$), and wavelengths ($0.1-2.5\,\rm \mu m$). We investigate the separate and combined effects of $\alpha$-enhanced isochrones and stellar spectral libraries on simple stellar populations (SSPs), including their broadband colors, spectral indices, and full spectra. We find that the primary effect of $\alpha$-enhancement in isochrones is to lower the overall continuum levels and redden the continuum shapes, while $\alpha$-enhancement in stellar spectra mainly affects individual spectral lines. At constant $\rm [Fe/H]$, $\alpha$-enhancement has significant impacts on the broadband colors by $\rm \sim 0.1-0.4\,mag$ across all ages ($\rm 0.01 - 10\,Gyr$). The effects of $\alpha$-enhancement on colors at fixed $\rm [Z/H]$ are smaller, by $\rm \sim 0.1-0.2\,mag$. The spectral indices involving $\alpha$-elements, Ca4227 and Mg b, increase with $\rm [\alpha/Fe]$ (both at fixed $\rm [Fe/H]$ and fixed $\rm [Z/H]$) due to enhanced $\alpha$-abundances. At constant $\rm [Fe/H]$, $\alpha$-enhancement weakens most Fe-sensitive and Hydrogen Balmer lines. Our new self-consistent $\alpha$-enhanced models will be essential in deriving accurate physical properties of high-redshift galaxies, where $\alpha$-enhancement is expected to be common.</description>

      <title>Inside-out versus Upside-down: The Origin and Evolution of Metallicity Radial Gradients in FIRE Simulations of Milky Way-mass Galaxies and the Essential Role of Gas Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the Milky Way (MW), younger stellar populations exhibit steeper (more negative) metallicity radial gradients; the origin of this trend remains debated. The FIRE-2 cosmological simulations of MW-mass galaxies show the same trend as the MW, which in FIRE-2 arises because the metallicity gradient of the interstellar medium (ISM), and thus of stars at birth, became steeper over time. We seek to understand this evolution in the context of inside-out radial growth of galaxies. Most FIRE-2 galaxies grew radially inside-out in both gas and stars; specifically, their surface density profiles, $\Sigma(R)$, became shallower over time. Combined with a realized superlinear (Kennicutt-Schmidt-like) relation between star formation and total gas density, the profile of the ratio $\Sigma_{\rm star}(R)/\Sigma_{\rm gas}(R)$ became shallower (flatter) over time. Thus, if metals stayed where they were injected into the ISM from stars, the metallicity gradient would become shallower over time, as some models predict. However, metallicity gradients in FIRE-2 became steeper over time, because of the additional effects of (radial) mixing of metals in the ISM. Specifically, the velocity dispersion and net radial advection of gas declined over time, as ISM turbulence decreased and the disk settled, leading to upside-down vertical growth. In FIRE-2, this evolution in metal mixing of gas associated with upside-down growth dominates over inside-out radial growth, causing the metallicity radial gradient of the ISM and of stars at birth to become steeper over time. We argue that this reflects the ISM history of the MW and of typical MW-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>Estimating Masses of Supermassive Black Holes in Active Galactic Nuclei from the Halpha Emission Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this project is to construct an estimator for the masses of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on the broad Halpha emission line. We make use of published reverberation mapping data. We remeasure all Halpha time lags from the original data as we find that often the reverberation measurements are improved by detrending the light curves. We produce mass estimators that require only the Halpha luminosity and the width of the Halpha emission line as characterized by either the FWHM or the line dispersion. It is possible, on the basis of a single spectrum covering the Halpha emission line, to estimate the mass of the central supermassive black hole in AGNs, taking into account all three parameters believed to affect mass measurement: luminosity, line width, and Eddington ratio. The typical formal accuracy in such estimates is of order 0.2-0.3 dex.</description>

      <title>CO isotopologue-derived molecular gas conditions and CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factors in M51</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, several millimeter interferometer programs have mapped the nearby star-forming galaxy M51 at a spatial resolution of ${\le}170$ pc. This study combines observations from three major programs: the PdBI Arcsecond Whirlpool Survey (PAWS), the SMA M51 large program (SMA-PAWS), and the Surveying the Whirlpool at Arcseconds with NOEMA (SWAN). The dataset includes the (1-0) and (2-1) rotational transitions of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O isotopologues. The observations cover the $r{&lt;}\rm 3\,kpc$ region including center and part of the disk, thereby ensuring strong detections of the weaker $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O lines. All observations are convolved in this analysis to an angular resolution of 4$''$, corresponding to a physical scale of ${\sim}$170 pc. We investigate empirical line ratio relations and quantitatively evaluate molecular gas conditions such as temperature, density, and the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_{\rm CO}$). We employ two approaches to study the molecular gas conditions: (i) assuming local thermal equilibrium (LTE) to analytically determine the CO column density and $\alpha_{\rm CO}$, and (ii) using non-LTE modeling with RADEX to fit physical conditions to observed CO isotopologue intensities. We find that the $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ values {in the center and along the inner spiral arm} are $\sim$0.5 dex (LTE) and ${\sim}$0.1 dex (non-LTE) below the Milky Way inner disk value. The average non-LTE $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ is $2.4{\pm}0.5$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$. While both methods show dispersion due to underlying assumptions, the scatter is larger for LTE-derived values. This study underscores the necessity for robust CO line modeling to accurately constrain the molecular ISM's physical and chemical conditions in nearby galaxies.</description>

      <title>Constraining bursty star formation histories with galaxy UV and H$\alpha$ luminosity functions and clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed prevalence of galaxies exhibiting bursty star formation histories (SFHs) at $z\gtrsim6$ has created new challenges and opportunities for understanding their formation pathways. The degenerate effects of the efficiency and burstiness of star formation on the observed UV luminosity function are separable by galaxy clustering. However, quantifying the timescales of burstiness requires more than just the continuum UV measurements. Here we develop a flexible semi-analytic framework for modeling both the amplitude of star formation rate (SFR) variations and their temporal correlation, from which the luminosity function and clustering can be derived for SFR indicators tracing different characteristic timescales (e.g., UV continuum and H$\alpha$ luminosities). Based on this framework, we study the prospect of using galaxy summary statistics to distinguish models where SFR fluctuations are prescribed by different power spectral density (PSD) forms. Using the Fisher matrix approach, we forecast the constraints on parameters in our PSD-based model that can be extracted from mock JWST observations of the UV and H$\alpha$ luminosity functions and clustering bias factors at $z\sim6$. These constraints demonstrate the feasibility of constraining the burstiness of high-$z$ galaxies solely from their one-point and two-point statistics and underscore the importance of combining tracers of both long-term and short-term SFR variations. Our flexible framework can be readily extended to characterize the SFH of high-redshift galaxies with a wider range of observational diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Radial properties of dust in galaxies: Comparison between observations and isolated galaxy simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21430v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the importance of several processes that influence the evolution of dust and its grain size distribution on spatially resolved scales in nearby galaxies. Here, we compiled several multi-wavelength observations for the nearby galaxies NGC628(M74), NGC5457(M101), NGC598(M33), and NGC300. We applied spatially resolved spectral energy distribution fitting to the latest iteration of infrared data to get constraints on the galaxy dust masses and the small-to-large grain abundance ratio. For comparison, we took the radial profiles of the stellar mass and gas mass surface density for NGC628 combined with its metallicity gradient in the literature to calibrate a single-galaxy simulation using the GADGET4-OSAKA code. The simulations include a parametrization to separate the dense and diffuse phases of the ISM where different dust-evolution mechanisms are in action. We find that our simulation can reproduce the radial profile of dust mass surface density but overestimates the SLR in NGC628. Changing the dust-accretion timescale has little impact on the dust mass or SLR, as most of the available metals are accreted onto dust grains at early times (&lt; 3Gyr), except in the outer regions of the galaxy. This suggests we can only constrain the accretion timescale of galaxies at extremely low metallicities where accretion still competes with other mechanisms controlling the dust budget. The overestimation of the SLR likely results from (i) overly efficient shattering processes in the diffuse interstellar medium, which were calibrated to reproduce Milky Way-type galaxies and/or (ii) our use of a diffuse and dense gas density subgrid model that does not entirely capture the intricacies of the small-scale structure present in NGC628.</description>

      <title>Dust Battery: A Novel Mechanism for Seed Magnetic Field Generation in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel dust battery mechanism for generating seed magnetic fields in the early universe, in which charged dust grains are radiatively accelerated, inducing strong electric currents that subsequently generate magnetic fields. Our analysis demonstrates that this process is effective even at very low metallicities (approximately $ \sim 10^{-5} Z_\odot$), and capable of producing seed fields with significant amplitudes of $B \sim \rm \mu G$ around luminous sources over timescales of years to Myr and across spatial scales ranging from au to kpc. Crucially, we find that this mechanism is generically $\sim10^8$ times more effective than the radiatively-driven electron battery or Biermann battery in relatively cool gas ($\ll 10^{5}\,$K), including both neutral and ionized gas. Furthermore, our results suggest that, to first order, dissipation effects do not appear to significantly impede this process, and that it can feasibly generate coherent seed fields on macroscopically large ISM scales (much larger than turbulent dissipation scales or electron mean-free-paths in the ISM). These seed fields could then be amplified by subsequent dynamo actions to the observed magnetic fields in galaxies. Additionally, we propose a sub-grid model for integration into cosmological simulations, and the required electric-field expressions for magnetohydrodynamic-particle-in-a-cell (MHD-PIC) simulations that explicitly model dust dynamics. Finally, we explore the broad applicability of this mechanism across different scales and conditions, emphasizing its robustness compared to other known battery mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Improving photometric redshifts of Epoch of Reionization galaxies: a new transmission curve with the neutral hydrogen damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new analytical model for the attenuation to Epoch of Reionization (EoR) galaxies by proximate neutral hydrogen gas. Many galaxy spectra in the EoR taken by JWST have shown a flux deficit at wavelengths just redward of the Lyman break, and this has been regarded as resulting from Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption by the increasing amount of neutral hydrogen in the line-of-sight. However, previous attenuation models for the intergalactic medium (IGM) commonly used in photometric redshift template-fitting codes assume that the Lyman break is rather sharp, which leads to systematic overestimation of photometric redshifts at $z&gt;7$. In this letter, we build and empirically calibrate a new attenuation model that takes the increased Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption into account. Our model consists of the canonical IGM absorption and an additional absorption component due to dense neutral hydrogen gas clouds proximate to the galaxy, and we derive the redshift evolution of HI column density of the proximate clouds by calibrating the model using CANUCS JWST observations. The resulting total transmission curve resolves the photometric redshift bias at $z&gt;7$, an improvement that is robust to choice of template-fitting code, template set, and photometric catalog used. The new attenuation model can be easily implemented in existing template-fitting codes, and significantly improves the photometric redshift performance in the EoR.</description>

      <title>Two stellar populations with different metallicities in the low-mass globular cluster Gran 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. With the increasing number of discoveries of globular clusters in the inner Milky Way, the need for spectroscopic confirmation and further investigation of their stellar populations and chemodynamical properties has become crucial. Aims. Gran 5 is a newly reported low-mass globular cluster located close to the Galactic center, and it is thought to be an accreted object associated with the Gaia-Enceladus structure. This study aims to investigate the stellar populations of Gran 5 and their detailed chemical properties. Methods. We performed high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy on seven stars in the field of Gran 5 using IGRINS on the Gemini-South telescope. Results. We identified six stars as cluster members and reveal that they are divided into two stellar populations with different metallicities, with mean [Fe/H] values of -0.76 dex and -0.55 dex, respectively. In addition, the chemodynamical properties of Gran 5 agree with those of in situ globular clusters. Conclusions. Our findings represent the first detection of two stellar populations with different metallicities in a low-mass globular cluster. This suggests that the metallicity variation in Gran 5 may have arisen from processes different from those in other globular clusters with metallicity variation, or that it may have lost a substantial amount of its initial mass during its evolution.</description>

      <title>Comparison of chemical compositions between the bright and faint red clumps for the metal-poor and metal-rich populations in the Milky Way bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examined the double red clump (RC) observed in the Galactic bulge, interpreted as a difference in distance ("X-shaped bulge scenario") or in chemical composition ("multiple population scenario"). To verify chemical differences between the RC groups, we performed low-resolution spectroscopy for RC and red giant branch (RGB) stars using Gemini-South/GMOS in three fields of the bulge, and collected diverse data from literature. We divided our sample stars not only into bright and faint RC groups, but also into bluer ([Fe/H] &lt; -0.1) and redder ([Fe/H] &gt; -0.1) groups following the recent u-band photometric studies. For the metal-poor stars, no statistically significant difference in CN index was detected between the bright and faint RC groups for all observed fields. However, we found, from cross-matching with high-resolution spectroscopic data, a sign of Na enhancement in the "metal-poor and bright" RC group compared to the "metal-poor and faint" group at (l,b)=(-1 deg,-8.5 deg). When the contributions of the RGB stars on the RC regimes are taken into account, the Na abundance difference between genuine RCs would correspond to approximately 0.23 dex, similar to globular cluster (GCs) with multiple populations. In contrast, the metal-rich stars do not show chemical differences between the bright and faint RCs. It implies that the double RC observed in the metal-poor component of the bulge might be linked to the multiple populations originated from GC-like subsystem, whereas that of the metal-rich component would have produced by the X-shaped structure. Our results support the previous studies suggesting composite nature of the Milky Way bulge.</description>

      <title>Rising from the Ashes II: The Bar-driven Abundance Bimodality of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way hosts at least two modes in its present day distribution of Fe and alpha-elements. The exact cause of this bimodality is disputed, but one class of explanations involves the merger between the Milky Way and a relatively massive satellite (Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus) at z~2. However, reproducing this bimodality in simulations is not straightforward, with conflicting results on the prevalance, morphology, and mechanism behind multimodality. We present a case study of a galaxy in the Illustris TNG50 simulation which undergoes sequential phases of starburst, brief quiescence, and then rejuvenation. This scenario results in a pronounced abundance bimodality after a post-processing adjustment of the [alpha/Fe] of old stars designed to mimic a higher star formation efficiency in dense gas. The high- and low-alpha sequences are separated in time by the brief quiescent period, which is not associated with a merger but by the formation of a bar followed by AGN activity. This galaxy indicates a novel scenario in which the alpha-bimodality in the Milky Way is caused by the formation of the bar via AGN-induced quenching. In addition to a stellar age gap in the Milky Way, we predict that abundance bimodalities should be more common in barred as opposed to unbarred galaxies.</description>

      <title>The evolution of two-point correlation function of galaxies with a twin-peak initial power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution equation of two-point correlation function $\xi$ of galaxies can analytically describe the large scale structure of the galaxy distribution, and the solution depends also upon the initial condition. The primeval spectrum of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) contains multi peaks that survived the Silk damping, and, as a relevant portion, two peaks of the primeval BAO spectrum fall into the range of current galaxy surveys. Incorporating this portion, we use a twin-peak initial power spectrum of the galaxies, and obtain the evolution solution from a redshift $z=8$ to $z=0$ in the Gaussian approximation. The outcome $\xi(r)$ at $z=0.6$ still exhibits the 100 Mpc periodic bumps as observed by the WiggleZ survey, a feature largely determined by the Jeans length $\lambda_J$ in the equation. In particular, due to the superposition of the twin peaks in the initial condition, $\xi(r)$ shows a shallow trough at $\sim 70 h^{-1}$Mpc and a deep trough at $\sim 140 h^{-1}$Mpc, agreeing with the observational data, much better than our previous work that used a simple one-peak initial spectrum.</description>

      <title>Tracing Outflows from Stellar Feedback in the Early Universe with Lyman-$\alpha$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind spectroscopy of massive lensing galaxy clusters with MUSE has revealed large numbers of gravitationally-lensed Lyman-$ \alpha $ emitters exhibiting asymmetric profiles at $ 2.9 \leq z \leq 6.7 $, suggesting abundant outflows from low-mass star-forming galaxies in the early universe. Are these primaeval galaxies experiencing their first bursts of star formation, or established galaxies experiencing rejuvenation? With JWST rest-frame optical/NIR continuum imaging now available for many of these objects, we can search for older stellar populations. Here, we search for spectroscopic confirmation of outflows from these galaxies, finding a few high-signal-to-noise cases in which blueshifted interstellar absorption lines are detected. Next, we analyse the star formation histories with combined HST + JWST photometry. We find most them to be well characterised by very young, low metallicity stellar populations. However, despite the rest-frame optical/NIR coverage of JWST, we cannot place strict upper bounds on the mass in old stars (age $ &gt; 100\,\text{Myr} $).</description>

      <title>The missing FeII bump in faint JWST AGN: possible evidence for metal-poor broad-line regions at early cosmic times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have revealed a large population of intermediate/low-luminosity AGN at early times with peculiar properties, different from local AGN or luminous quasars. To better understand the physical conditions in the BLRs of these early AGN, we used the optical FeII (4434--4684 \AA) and the broad $\rm H \beta$ emission, and the ratio between their equivalent widths $R_{Fe}$, as a probe on a purposefully assembled sample. Specifically, we gathered a sample of 26 high redshift ($\langle z \rangle$=6.4) AGN, observed by JWST, with broad $\rm H\beta$ detection both in the high and low luminosity regimes (respectively 14 faint AGN and 12 quasars), to investigate their optical FeII emission properties. In addition, we carefully selected control samples at lower $z$. We found that the population of faint AGN ($\rm \log(L_{H \beta} / (erg \, s^{-1}))\lesssim 44$) exhibits a significantly lower FeII emission than their local counterparts ($R_{Fe}&lt;$0.24 versus $R_{Fe}\simeq$0.85 in the control sample), while the quasars at the epoch of reionisation observed by JWST present a FeII emission profile that closely resembles that observed at $z&lt;3$. We argue that the weakness of the FeII bump in the faint JWST AGN might be due to the reduced metallicity of their broad line region ($\lesssim 0.5~Z_{\odot}$), while luminous quasars have already reached chemical maturity ($\sim Z{_\odot}$ or higher). Lastly, we highlight an intriguing similarity between the spectral properties of the high redshift population of faint AGN with those harboured in local metal poor dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Capivara: A Spectral-based Segmentation Method for IFU Data Cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present capivara, a fast and scalable multi-decomposition package designed to study astrophysical properties within distinct structural components of galaxies. Our spectro-decomposition code for analyzing integral field unit (IFU) data enables a more holistic approach, moving beyond conventional radial gradients and the bulge-plus-disk dichotomy. It facilitates comprehensive comparisons of integrated stellar ages and metallicities across various galactic structures. Our classification method naturally identifies outliers and organizes the different pixels based on their dominant spectral features. The algorithm leverages the scalability and GPU acceleration of Torch, outputting both a one-dimensional spectrum and a full data cube for each galaxy component, without relying on Voronoi binning. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach using a sample of galaxies from the MaNGA survey, processing the resulting data cubes with the starlight spectral fitting code to derive both stellar population and ionized gas properties of the galaxy components. Our method effectively groups regions with similar spectral properties in both the continuum and emission lines. By aggregating the spectra of these regions, we enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of our analysis while significantly speeding up computations by reducing the number of spectra processed simultaneously. capivara will be freely available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>GaiaUnlimited: The old stellar disc of the Milky Way as traced by the Red Clump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exploration of the Milky Way's structural parameters using an all-sky sample of RC giants to map the stellar density from the inner to the outer parts of the Galactic disc. These evolved giants are considered to be standard candles due to their low intrinsic variance in their absolute luminosities, allowing us to estimate their distances with reasonable confidence. We exploit all-sky photometry from the AllWISE mid-infrared survey and the Gaia survey, along with astrometry from Gaia Data Release 3 and recent 3D extinction maps, to develop a probabilistic scheme in order to select with high confidence \rc{}-like stars. Our curated catalogue contains about 10 million sources, for which we estimate photometric distances based on the WISE $W1$ photometry. We then derive the selection function for our sample, which is the combined selection function of sources with both \gaia{} and \allwise{} photometry. Using the distances and accounting for the full selection function of our observables, we are able to fit a two-disc, multi-parameter model to constrain the scale height (\hz{}), scale-length (\rd{}), flaring, and the relative mass ratios of the two disc components. We illustrate and verify our methodology using mock catalogues of \rc{} stars. We find that the \rc{} population is best described by a flared thin disc with scale length \rd{}=$3.56\pm0.32$ kpc and scale height at the Sun of \hzsun{}=$0.17\pm0.01$ kpc, and a shorter and thicker disc with \rd{}=$2.59\pm0.11$ kpc, \hzsun{}=$0.45\pm0.11$ kpc, with no flare. The thicker disc constitutes 64\% of the \rc{} stellar mass beyond 3 kpc, while the thin disk shows evidence of being warped beyond 9 kpc from the Galactic center. The residuals between the predicted number density of RC stars from our axisymmetric model and the measured counts show possible evidence of a two-armed spiral perturbation in the disc of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Many elements matter: Detailed abundance patterns reveal star-formation and enrichment differences among Milky Way structural components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many nucleosynthetic channels create the elements, but two-parameter models characterized by $\alpha$ and Fe nonetheless predict stellar abundances in the Galactic disk to accuracies of 0.02 to 0.05 dex for most measured elements, near the level of current abundance uncertainties. It is difficult to make individual measurements more precise than this to investigate lower-amplitude nucleosynthetic effects, but population studies of mean abundance patterns can reveal more subtle abundance differences. Here we look at the detailed abundances for 67315 stars from APOGEE DR17, but in the form of abundance residuals away from a best-fit two-parameter, data-driven nucleosynthetic model. We find that these residuals show complex structures with respect to age, guiding radius, and vertical action that are not random and are also not strongly correlated with sources of systematic error such as surface gravity, effective temperature, and radial velocity. The residual patterns, especially in Na, C+N, Ni, Mn, and Ce, trace kinematic structures in the Milky Way, such as the inner disk, thick disk, and flared outer disk. A principal component analysis suggests that most of the observed structure is low-dimensional and can be explained by a few eigenvectors. We find that some, but not all, of the effects in the low-$\alpha$ disk can be explained by dilution with fresh gas, so that abundance ratios resemble those of stars with higher metallicity. The patterns and maps we provide could be combined with accurate forward models of nucleosynthesis, star formation, and gas infall to provide a more detailed picture of star and element formation in different Milky Way components.</description>

      <title>On the Ubiquity of Extreme Baryon Concentrations in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22138v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early JWST observations have revealed the ubiquitous presence in the early Universe, up to z about 16, of extreme baryon concentrations, namely forming globular clusters, extremely dense galaxies that may or may not be UV bright, and supermassive black holes in relatively low-mass galaxies. This paper is trying to pinpoint which physical conditions may have favored the formation of such concentrations, that appear to be very common at high redshifts while their formation being progressively more and more rare at lower redshifts. Building on local globular cluster evidence, it is argued that such conditions can consist in a combination of a 10 Myr extended feedback free time, coupled to low angular-momentum densities in deep local minima of the ISM vorticity field, where baryon concentrations are more likely to form. It is argued that the former condition would follow from more massive stars failing to explode as supernovae, and the latter one from low vorticity prevailing in the early Universe, in contrast to later times with their secular increase of the angular momentum density due to the cumulative effect of tidal interactions.</description>

      <title>ADF22-WEB: A giant barred spiral starburst galaxy in the z = 3.1 SSA22 protocluster core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present-day universe, the most massive galaxies are ellipticals located in the cores of galaxy clusters, harboring the heaviest super-massive black holes (SMBHs). However the mechanisms that drive the early growth phase and subsequent transformation of these morphology and kinematics of galaxies remain elusive. Here we report (sub)kiloparsec scale observations of stars, gas, and dust in ADF22.A1, a bright dusty starburst galaxy at z=3.1, hosting a heavily obscured active galactic nucleus and residing in a proto-cluster core. ADF22.A1 is a giant spiral galaxy with the kinematics of a rotating disk with rotation velocity Vrot=530+/-10km/s and diameter larger than 30 kpc. The high specific stellar angular momentum of this system, j*=3400+/-600 kpc km/s, requires a mechanism to effectively spin-up ADF22.A1, indicating the importance of accretion from the cosmic web to supply both gas and angular momentum to galaxies in their early gas-rich starburst phase. In its inner region, gas flows along dust lanes in a bar connected with the bright dusty core and the estimated mass ratio of a bulge to SMBH matches the local relation, suggesting that bars are a key mechanism to shape the early co-evolution of these components. Comparison with cosmological simulations shows that ADF22.A1 will likely evolve into a massive elliptical at the present day, experiencing a significant reduction in angular momentum associated with subsequent galaxy mergers.</description>

      <title>Cosmological evolution of dark matter subhaloes under tidal stripping by growing Milky Way-like galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the findings of a comprehensive and detailed analysis of merger tree data from ultra-high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulations. The analysis, conducted with a particle mass resolution of $5 \times 10^3 h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ and a halo mass resolution of $10^7 h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, provides sufficient accuracy to suppress numerical artefacts. This study elucidates the dynamical evolution of subhaloes associated with the Milky Way-like host haloes. Unlike more massive dark matter haloes, which have been extensively studied, these subhaloes follow a distinct mass evolution pattern: an initial accretion phase, followed by a tidal stripping phase where mass is lost due to the tidal forces of the host halo. The transition from accretion to stripping, where subhaloes reach their maximum mass, occurs around a redshift of $z\simeq1$. Smaller subhaloes reach this point earlier, while larger ones do so later. Our analysis reveals that over 80 per cent of subhaloes have experienced mass loss, underscoring the universality of tidal stripping in subhalo evolution. Additionally, we derived the eccentricities and pericentre distances of subhalo orbits from the simulations and compare them with those of nearby satellite galaxies observed by the Gaia satellite. The results demonstrate a significant alignment between the orbital elements predicted by the cold dark matter model and the observed data, providing robust support for the model as a credible candidate for dark matter.</description>

      <title>First Detection of Molecular Gas in the Giant Low Surface Brightness Galaxy Malin 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After over three decades of unsuccessful attempts, we report the first detection of molecular gas emission in Malin 1, the largest spiral galaxy observed to date, and one of the most iconic giant low surface brightness galaxies. Using ALMA, we detect significant $^{12}$CO(J=1-0) emission in the galaxy's central region and tentatively identify CO emission across three regions on the disc. These observations allow for a better estimate of the H$_2$ mass and molecular gas mass surface density, both of which are remarkably low given the galaxy's scale. By integrating data on its HI mass, we derive a very low molecular-to-atomic gas mass ratio. Overall, our results highlight the minimal presence of molecular gas in Malin 1, contrasting sharply with its extensive, homogeneous atomic gas reservoir. For the first time, we position Malin 1 on the Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S) diagram, where it falls below the main sequence for normal spirals, consistent with previous upper limits but now with more accurate figures. These findings are crucial for constraining our understanding of star formation processes in environments characterized by extremely low molecular gas densities and for refining models of galaxy formation, thereby improving predictions concerning the formation, evolution, and distribution of these giant, elusive galaxies.</description>

      <title>The realm of Aurora. Density distribution of metal-poor giants in the heart of the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The innermost portions of the Milky Way's stellar halo have avoided scrutiny until recently. The lack of wide-area survey data, made it difficult to reconstruct an uninterrupted view of the density distribution of the metal-poor stars inside the Solar radius. In this study, we utilize red giant branch (RGB) stars from Gaia, with metallicities estimated using spectro-photometry from Gaia Data Release 3. Accounting for Gaia's selection function, we examine the spatial distribution of metal-poor ([M/H]&lt;-1.3) RGB stars, from the Galactic centre (r~1 kpc) out to beyond the Solar radius (r~18 kpc). Our best-fitting single-component cored power-law model shows a vertical flattening of ~0.5 and a slope -3.4, consistent with previous studies. Motivated by the mounting evidence for two distinct stellar populations in the inner halo, we additionally test a range of two-component models. One of the components models the tidal debris from the Gaia Sausage/Enceladus merger, while the other captures the Aurora population -- stars that predate the Galactic disk formation. Our best-fit two-component model suggests that both populations contribute equally around the Solar radius, but Aurora dominates the inner halo with a steeper power-law index of -4.5, in agreement with the nitrogen-rich star distribution measured by Horta et al. (2021).</description>

      <title>Regulating Sommerfeld resonances for multi-state systems and higher partial waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range attractive interactions between dark matter particles can significantly enhance their annihilation, particularly at low velocities. This ``Sommerfeld enhancement'' is typically computed by evaluating the deformation of the two-particle wavefunction due to the long-range potential, while ignoring the physics associated with the annihilation, and then scaling the appropriate annihilation matrix elements by factors that depend on the wavefunction in the limit where the particles approach zero relative separation. It has long been recognized that this approach is a valid approximation only in the limit where the annihilation rate is small, and breaks down in the regime where the enhanced annihilation rate approaches the unitarity bound, in which case ignoring the impact of the annihilation physics on the two-particle wavefunction cannot be justified and leads to apparent violations of unitarity. In the case where the physics relevant to annihilation occurs at a parametrically shorter distance scale (higher energy scale) compared with the long-range potential, we provide a simple prescription for correcting the Sommerfeld enhancement for the effects of the short-range physics, valid for all partial waves and for systems where multiple states are coupled by the long-range potential.</description>

      <title>Bow Shock and Local Bubble Plasma Unveiled by the Scintillating Millisecond Pulsar J0437$-$4715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interstellar medium of the Milky Way contains turbulent plasma with structures driven by energetic processes that fuel star formation and shape the evolution of our Galaxy. Radio waves from pulsars are scattered off the small (au-scale and below) structures, resulting in frequency-dependent interference patterns that are modulated in time because of the relative motions of the pulsar, Earth, and plasma. Power spectral analyses of these patterns show parabolic arcs with curvatures that encode the locations and kinematics of individual structures. Here we report the discovery of at least 25 distinct plasma structures in the direction of the brilliant millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437$-$4715, in observations obtained with the MeerKAT radio telescope. Four arcs reveal structures within 5000 au of the pulsar, from a series of shocks induced as the pulsar and its wind interact with the ambient insterstellar medium. The measured radial distance and velocity of the main shock allows us to solve the shock geometry and space velocity of the pulsar in three dimensions, while the velocity of another structure unexpectedly indicates a back flow from the direction of the shock or pulsar-wind tail. The remaining 21 arcs represent a surprising abundance of structures sustained by turbulence within the Local Bubble -- a region of the interstellar medium thought to be depleted of gas by a series of supernova explosions about 14 Myr ago.</description>

      <title>Outflow from the very massive Wolf-Rayet binary Melnick 34</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Melnick 34 (Mk 34) is one of the most massive binary systems known and is one of the brightest X-ray point sources in the 30 Doradus region. We investigated the impact of this massive system on the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) using the optical spectroscopic capabilities of the narrow-field mode (NFM) of the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). MUSE-NFM spatially resolved the ISM in the vicinity of Mk 34 with a resolution comparable to that of the HST. The analysis of the [NII]$\lambda$6583 and [SII]$\lambda$6717 emission lines reveals a cone-like structure apparently originating from Mk 34 and extending southeast. Electron density maps and radial velocity measurements of the ISM lines further support an outflow scenario traced by these emissions. While no clear northwestern counterpart to this outflow was observed, we note increased extinction in that direction, towards the R136 cluster. The ISM material along the projected diagonal of the outflow on both sides of Mk 34 shows similar properties in terms of the emission line ratios seen in the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram. These results are consistent across two observational epochs. Additionally, we examined the residual maps within a 0.5" radius of Mk 34 after modeling and subtracting the point spread function. The observed variations in the residuals could potentially be linked to Mk 34's known periodic behavior. However, further observations with appropriate cadence are needed to fully monitor the 155 day periodicity of Mk 34's X-ray emissions.</description>

      <title>The more accurately we model the metal-dependent star formation rate, the larger the predicted excess of binary black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the number of gravitational-wave detections grows, the merger rate of binary black holes (BBHs) can help us to constrain their formation, the properties of their progenitors, and their birth environment. Here, we aim to address the impact of the metal-dependent star formation rate (SFR) on the BBH merger rate. To this end, we have developed a fully data-driven approach to model the metal-dependent SFR and coupled it to BBH evolution. We have adopted the most up-to-date scaling relations, based on recent observational results, and we have studied how the BBH merger rate density varies over a wide grid of galaxy and binary evolution parameters. Our results show that including a realistic metal-dependent SFR evolution yields a value of the merger rate density which is too high compared to the one inferred from GW data. Moreover, variations of the SFR in low-mass galaxies ($M_\ast \lesssim 10^8 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) do not contribute more than a factor $\sim 2$ to the overall merger rate density at redshift $z=0$. These results suggest that the discrepancy between the BBH merger rate density inferred from data and theoretical models is not caused by approximations in the treatment of the metal-dependent SFR, but rather stems from stellar evolution models and/or BBH formation channels.</description>

      <title>Connecting the X-ray/UV variability of Fairall 9 with NICER: A Possible Warm Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Seyfert 1 AGN Fairall 9 was targeted by NICER, Swift, and ground-based observatories for a $\sim$1000-day long reverberation mapping campaign. The following analysis of NICER spectra taken at a two-day cadence provides new insights into the structure and heating mechanisms of the central black hole environment. Observations of Fairall 9 with NICER and Swift revealed a strong relationship between the flux of the UV continuum and the X-ray soft excess, indicating the presence of a "warm" Comptonized corona which likely lies in the upper layers of the innermost accretion flow, serving as a second reprocessor between the "hot" X-ray corona and the accretion disk. The X-ray emission from the hot corona lacks sufficient energy and variability to power slow changes in the UV light curve on timescales of 30 days or longer, suggesting an intrinsic disk-driven variability process in the UV and soft X-rays. Fast variability in the UV on timescales shorter than 30 days can be explained through X-ray reprocessing, and the observed weak X-ray/UV correlation suggests that the corona changes dynamically throughout the campaign.</description>

      <title>Extending the ALMA Census of Circumstellar Disks in the Upper Scorpius OB Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ALMA Band 7 continuum (340 GHz) and CO J=3-2 observations for an extended sample of disks in the Upper Scorpius OB Association (Upper Sco, age ~ 10 Myr). The targets were selected from previous studies that identified new members of Upper Sco using photometry and astrometry from the Gaia mission, and the presence of a disk has been inferred from mid-infrared excess emission. The new ALMA observations are combined with previous ALMA data to define a sample of 202 Upper Sco members with disks that have spectral types between G0 and M5.5. Among these sources, 120 (59%) have been detected in the continuum with a signal-to-noise ratio &gt;= 3, and 83 (41%) have been detected in CO J=3-2. Both the continuum and CO J=3-2 fluxes show a strong correlation with the spectral type of the central star and the type of disk inferred from the shape of the infrared spectral energy distribution, where disks around earlier type stars and full disks are more luminous than disks around later type stars and evolved and debris disks. The median dust continuum luminosity is lower for disks in Upper Sco than in younger regions, as found in previous studies, where the differences are more pronounced in later spectral types (M4-M5) than in earlier spectral types.</description>

      <title>On the Significance of Covariance for Constraining Theoretical Models From Galaxy Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of covariance within uncertainties on the inference of cosmological and astrophysical parameters, specifically focusing on galaxy stellar mass functions derived from the CAMELS simulation suite. Utilizing both Fisher analysis and Implicit Likelihood Inference (ILI), we explore how different covariance structures, including simple toy models and physics-motivated uncertainties, affect posterior distributions and parameter variances. Our methodology utilizes forward modeling via emulators that are trained on CAMELS simulations to produce stellar mass functions based on input parameters, subsequently incorporating Gaussian noise as defined by covariance matrices. We examine both toy model covariance matrices and physically motivated covariance matrices derived from observational factors like the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) and photometric aperture size. Our results demonstrate that covariance terms significantly influence parameter inference, often leading to tighter constraints or revealing complex, multimodal posterior distributions. These findings underscore the necessity of accounting for covariance when interpreting astrophysical observations, especially in fields where accurate parameter estimation is critical for model validation and hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Searching for radio late-type dwarf stars in the GLEAM-X DR1 catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a new method of multi-wavelength data combination for the search of late-type radio dwarfs, and have put it into practice using GLEAM-X DR1 data. The initial sample is selected by cross-matching the Gaia/DR3 objects with the probability of being a star no less than 99$\%$, and removing the extragalactic objects assigned by the SIMBAD database. The late-type dwarf stars are judged according to their location in the $(BP-RP)_0/M_{\rm G}$ color-magnitude diagram and in the $(J-H)_0/(K-W1)_0$ near-infrared color-color diagram. Furthermore, stellar activity is searched by ultraviolet excess in the GALEX/NUV band and the Rossby number in the TESS light curves. In total, 12 stars are found to be late-type dwarf stars associated with radio source, which is consisted of five stars with the UV excess and seven stars with the Rossby number less than 0.13. Three of these 12 stars are previously studied to be associated with radio objects. All these 12 stars are considered to be reliable counterparts of radio sources.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Cosmic Dispersion Measure in the D &lt; 120 Mpc Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22098v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Local Universe (D &lt; 120 Mpc) has been intensely studied for decades, with highly complete galaxy redshift surveys now publicly available. These data have driven density reconstructions of the underlying matter density field, as well as constrained simulations that aim to reproduce the observed structures. In this paper, we introduce a dispersion measure (DM) model that makes use of this detailed knowledge of our Local Universe within D &lt; 120 Mpc. The model comprises three key components: (i) the DM from the Milky Way halo and the intra-group medium (up to 3.4 Mpc), derived from the HESTIA simulations, a series of constrained hydrodynamic simulations designed to reproduce our Local Group; (ii) the DM contribution from the large-scale intergalactic medium beyond the Local Group (3.4 Mpc &lt; D &lt; 120 Mpc), calculated using the HAMLET reconstructed matter density field; and (iii) the individual DM contributions from Local Universe galaxy halos and clusters based on data from the 2MASS Galaxy Group Catalog and the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. This comprehensive model will be made available as a Python package. As the most realistic model to date for DM in the local volume, it promises to improve the constraints of DM contributions from the Intergalactic Medium and Circumgalactic Medium of FRBs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of cosmic baryon distribution calculations based on DM analysis of FRBs.</description>

      <title>Bolometric Corrections for FU Ori Object Accretion Disk Luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accretion luminosity of an FU Ori disk is a fundamental system parameter, but a challenging one to estimate for all but the most well-studied systems. FU Ori objects are dynamically evolving accretion disks, especially close in time to the outburst epoch. They have a complex multi-temperature disk structure that results in distinctly shaped, broad SEDs. Detailed spectroscopic analysis is required for simultaneous constraint on relevant physical parameters such as the central stellar mass, inner disk radius, disk inclination, and disk accretion rate. However, outbursting systems that are deeply embedded and/or distant may be limited to only photometric measurement, and over only a narrow range of wavelengths. The bolometric corrections necessary to estimate accretion luminosities are not straightforward, and in particular can not be adopted from existing literature on isotropically radiating stars. We present bolometric corrections specific to astrophysical accretion disks for a variety of filters in ongoing and upcoming all-sky surveys.</description>

      <title>Accretion Efficiency Evolution of Central Supermassive Black Holes in Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ongoing debate regarding the most accurate accretion model for supermassive black holes at the center of quasars has remained a contentious issue in astrophysics. One significant challenge is the variation in calculated accretion efficiency, with values exceeding the standard range of $0.038 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 0.42$. This discrepancy is especially pronounced in high redshift supermassive black holes, necessitating the development of a comprehensive model that can address the accretion efficiency for supermassive black holes in both the low and high redshift ranges. The selection effect was removed from model construction by creating a flux- and volume-limited sample, as the range of values for estimating the accretion efficiency factor varied through different redshifts. In this study, we have focused on low redshift ($z &lt; 0.5$) Palomar-Green quasars (79 quasars) and high redshift ($z \geq 3$) quasars with standard disks from the flux- and volume-limited QUOTAS+QuasarNET dataset (75 quasars) to establish a model for accretion efficiency. By considering the QUOTAS+QuasarNET+DL11 dataset, a peak can be seen around $z \sim 2.708$, and it seems to be related to the peak of the star formation rate ($1 &lt; z_{SFR} &lt; 3$). Consequently, the observed maximum and minimum values of accretion efficiency in standard disks, through the considered bond (3$\sigma$), display a significantly wider range than previously noted and differentiate over time. In redshifts higher than 2.708, the accretion efficiency shows patterns of increase as redshift decreases, while in redshifts lower than 2.708, accretion efficiency is seen to decrease with reducing redshift. This result can potentially lead to a more accurate correlation between the star formation rate in quasars and their relationship with the mass of the central supermassive black holes with a more comprehensive disk model in future studies.</description>

      <title>Study of the high-mass star-forming region S255IR at various scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The S255IR-SMA1 core contains the protostar NIRS3 with a mass of $\sim$20 M$_\odot$. Several years ago, the first burst of luminosity for massive protostars, caused by an episodic accretion event, was recorded here. We have been studying this object for a long time using various instruments, including ALMA. The general morphology and kinematics of this area have been investigated. Disk-shaped structures, jets and outflows have been identified and studied in detail. We recently observed this object with ALMA with a resolution an order of magnitude higher than previously achieved - about 15 milliarcseconds, which corresponds to about 25 AU. This paper presents new results from the analysis of these data together with observations in other bands. The new data show an inhomogeneous disk structure, an ionized region around the protostar, and the presence of a jet observed in the submillimeter continuum, consisting of individual knots, the orientation of which differs markedly from that on large scales. The submillimeter emission from the jet most likely represents bremsstrahlung from ionized gas. Based on observations of the lines of some molecules, the kinematics and physical characteristics of this region are discussed. Methanol maser emission associated with the jet is observed.</description>

      <title>Effects of secular growth and mergers on the evolution of metallicity gradients and azimuthal variations in a Milky Way-like galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the evolution of the radial profiles and the azimuthal variations of the stellar metallicities from the Vintergatan simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy. We find that negative gradients exist as soon as the disk settles at high redshift, and are maintained throughout the long term evolution of the galaxy, including during major merger events. The inside-out growth of the disk and an overall outward radial migration tend to flatten these gradients in time. Major merger events only have a moderate and short-lived imprint on the [Fe/H] distributions with almost no radial dependence. The reason lies in the timescale for enrichment in Fe being significantly longer than the duration of the starbursts episodes, themselves slower than dynamical mixing during typical interactions. It results that signatures of major mergers become undetectable in [Fe/H] only a few Myr after pericenter passages. We note that considering other tracers like the warm interstellar medium, or monitoring the evolution of the metallicity gradient as a single value instead of a radial full profile could lead to different interpretations, and warn against an oversimplification of this complex problem.</description>

      <title>Symmetry in Hyper Suprime-Cam galaxy spin directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a Bayesian analysis of anisotropy in binary galaxy spin directions in the Hyper-Suprime Cam Data Release 3 catalogue, in response to a recent claim that it exhibits a dipole (Shamir 2024). We find no significant evidence for anisotropy, or for a direction-independent spin probability that differs from 0.5. These results are unchanged allowing for a quadrupole or simply searching for a fixed anisotropy between any two hemispheres, and the Bayes factor indicates decisive evidence for the isotropic model. Our principled method contrasts with the ad-hoc statistic employed by Shamir (2024).</description>

      <title>Mass and energy cascade in collisionless dark matter flow and relevant constraints on the dark matter particle mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.09985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cascade phenomenon is fundamental to turbulence, a typical non-equilibrium system. In turbulence, energy is cascaded from large to small scales, where it is dissipated by fluid viscosity. Using Illustris and Virgo simulations, this paper presents the cascade in non-equilibrium collisionless dark matter flow. The cosmic energy of dark matter decreases with time, as if "dissipated" due to the expanding background. This is facilitated by the energy cascade from large to small haloes via halo merging and from large to small scales in individual haloes via particle migration in fluctuating non-uniform potential, such that the cosmic energy is "dissipated" on small scales. Inverse mass cascade across haloes of different sizes leads to a random walk of haloes in halo mass space. The halo mass function is naturally given by the Fokker-Planck equation for halo random walk. Similarly, the random walk of particles in haloes leads to the distribution of particles. The halo density profile can also be analytically derived. Universal scaling laws were identified for the halo density, mass, and velocity dispersion. The different inner density slopes of simulated haloes can be explained by the nonzero net mass and energy flux in individual haloes. The mass and energy cascade establishes a statistically steady state to continuously release energy and maximize entropy. The key feature of this state is scale-independent rates of cascade such that the statistical structures of the haloes are self-similar and scale-free, and there is no net accumulation of mass and energy on any intermediate scales. Since the waiting time and jumping length for particle random walk depends on the particle mass $m_p$, new mass constraints can be identified as $m_p\ge 10^{-15}$kg or $10^{12}$GeV. This constraint excludes standard WIMPs and suggests a heavy dark matter scenario (superheavy right-handed neutrinos, etc.).</description>

      <title>Are nonrelativistic ground state $\ell$-boson stars only stable for $\ell=0$ and $\ell=1$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work we analyzed the linear stability of non-relativistic $\ell$-boson stars with respect to radial modes and showed that ground state configurations are stable with respect to these modes, whereas excited states are unstable. In this work we extend the analysis to non-spherical linear mode perturbations. To this purpose, we expand the wave function in terms of tensor spherical harmonics which allows us to decouple the perturbation equations into a family of radial problems. By using a combination of analytic and numerical methods, we show that ground state configurations with $\ell &gt; 1$ possess exponentially in time growing non-radial modes, whereas only oscillating modes are found for $\ell=0$ and $\ell=1$. This leads us to conjecture that nonrelativistic $\ell$-boson stars in their ground state are stable for $\ell=1$ as well as $\ell=0$, while ground state and excited configurations with $\ell &gt; 1$ are unstable.</description>

      <title>Are Lithium-Rich Giants Binaries? A Radial Velocity Variability Analysis of 1,400 Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-mass giants with large amounts of lithium (Li) have challenged stellar evolution for decades. One of the possibilities usually discussed to explain them involves the interaction with a close binary companion. This predicts that when compared against their non-enriched counterparts, Li-rich giants should preferentially be found as part of binary systems. In order to test this scenario, we assemble a sample of 1418 giants with radial velocities (RVs) from RAVE, GALAH, and Gaia, as well as stellar parameters and Li abundances from GALAH. Evolutionary states can be determined for 1030 of these giants. We develop a method that quantifies the degree of RV variability, which we use as a proxy for close binary companions. The method is tested and calibrated against samples of known RV standard stars and known spectroscopic binaries. We also compare the results of our RV variability analysis with binarity indicators from Gaia. We find that the accuracy of the classification is controlled by the precision of the RVs, which for the set of RVs available for the giants is 80-85%. Consistent with seismic studies, the resulting sample of giants contains a fraction of Li-rich objects in the red clump (RC) that is twice as large as that for first-ascent giants (RGB). Among RC giants, the fractions of Li-rich objects with high RV variability and with no RV variability are the same as those for Li-normal objects, which argues against a binary interaction scenario for the genesis of the bulk of Li-rich giants at that evolutionary stage. On the other hand, Li-rich giants in the RGB appear to have a small but detectable preference for higher RV variability, and thus possibly a larger close binary fraction, than the Li-normal giants at that stage. Additional measurements of the RVs of these giants at higher RV precision would greatly help confirm and more robustly quantify these results.</description>

      <title>Data-Space Validation of High-Dimensional Models by Comparing Sample Quantiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple method for assessing the predictive performance of high-dimensional models directly in data space when only samples are available. Our approach is to compare the quantiles of observables predicted by a model to those of the observables themselves. In cases where the dimensionality of the observables is large (e.g. multiband galaxy photometry), we advocate that the comparison is made after projection onto a set of principal axes to reduce the dimensionality. We demonstrate our method on a series of two-dimensional examples. We then apply it to results from a state-of-the-art generative model for galaxy photometry (pop-cosmos; arXiv:2402.00935) that generates predictions of colors and magnitudes by forward simulating from a 16-dimensional distribution of physical parameters represented by a score-based diffusion model. We validate the predictive performance of this model directly in a space of nine broadband colors. Although motivated by this specific example, we expect that the techniques we present will be broadly useful for evaluating the performance of flexible, non-parametric population models of this kind, and other settings where two sets of samples are to be compared.</description>

      <title>A deconstruction of methods to derive one-point lensing statistics</title>

Abstract: Gravitational lensing is a crucial tool for exploring cosmic phenomena, providing insights into galaxy clustering, dark matter, and dark energy. Given the substantial computational demands of $N$-body simulations, approximate methods like $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ and $\texttt{turboGL}$ have been proposed as viable alternatives for simulating lensing probability density functions (PDFs). This paper evaluates these methods and their effectiveness across both weak and strong lensing regimes, with a focus in the context where baryonic effects are negligible. Our comparative analysis reveals that these methods are effective for applications where lensing is mild, such as the majority of sources of electromagnetic and gravitational waves. However, both $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ and $\texttt{turboGL}$ break down for large values of convergence and magnification due to their loss of accuracy in capturing small-scale nonlinear matter fields, owing to oversimplified assumptions about internal halo structures and reliance on perturbation theory. $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ yields second-to-fourth moments of the lensing PDFs, which are 6-10% smaller than those resulting from $N$-body simulations in regimes where baryonic effects are minimal. These findings aim to inform future studies on gravitational lensing of point sources, which are increasingly relevant with upcoming supernova and gravitational wave datasets.</description>

      <title>Recurring tidal disruption events a decade apart in IRAS F01004-2237</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a second optical flare that occurred in September 2021 in IRAS F01004-2237, where the first flare occurred in 2010 has been reported, and present a detailed analysis of multi-band data. The position of the flare coincides with the galaxy centre with a precision of 650 pc. The flare peaks in $\sim50$ days with an absolute magnitude of $\sim-21$ and fades in two years roughly following $L\propto t^{-5/3}$. It maintains a nearly constant blackbody temperature of $\sim$22,000 K in the late time. Its optical and UV spectra show hydrogen and helium broad emission lines with full width at half maxima of 7,000--21,000 km s$^{-1}$ and He II/H$\alpha$ ratio of 0.3--2.3. It shows weak X-ray emission relative to UV emission, with X-ray flares lasting for $&lt;2-3$ weeks, during which the spectrum is soft with a power-law index $\Gamma=4.4^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$. These characters are consistent with a tidal disruption event (TDE), ruling out the possibilities of a supernova or an active galactic nuclei flare. With a TDE model, we infer a peak UV luminosity of $3.3\pm0.2\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and an energy budget of $4.5\pm0.2\times10^{51}$ erg. The two optical flares separated by $10.3\pm0.3$ years can be interpreted as repeating partial TDEs, double TDEs, or two independent TDEs. Although no definitive conclusion can be drawn, the partial TDEs interpretation predicts a third flare around 2033, and the independent TDEs interpretation predicts a high TDE rate of $\gtrsim10^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ in F01004-2237, both of which can be tested by future observations.</description>
