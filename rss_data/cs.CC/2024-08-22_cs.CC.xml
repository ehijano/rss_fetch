      <title>Classifying Entanglement by Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Entanglement is one of the key manifestations of quantum mechanics that separate the quantum realm from the classical one. Characterization of entanglement as a physical resource for quantum technology became of uppermost importance. While the entanglement of bipartite systems is already well understood, the ultimate goal to cope with the properties of entanglement of multipartite systems is still far from being realized. This dissertation covers characterization of multipartite entanglement using algebraic-geometric tools. Firstly, we establish an algorithm to classify multipartite entanglement by $k$-secant varieties of the Segre variety and $\ell$-multilinear ranks that are invariant under Stochastic Local Operations with Classical Communication (SLOCC). We present a fine-structure classification of multiqubit and tripartite entanglement based on this algorithm. Another fundamental problem in quantum information theory is entanglement transformation that is quite challenging regarding to multipartite systems. It is captivating that the proposed entanglement classification by algebraic geometry can be considered as a reference to study SLOCC and asymptotic SLOCC interconversions among different resources based on tensor rank and border rank, respectively. In this regard, we also introduce a new class of tensors that we call \emph{persistent tensors} and construct a lower bound for their tensor rank. We further cover SLOCC convertibility of multipartite systems considering several families of persistent tensors.</description>

      <title>Directed st-connectivity with few paths is in quantum logspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a $\mathsf{BQSPACE}(O(\log n))$-procedure to count $st$-paths on directed graphs for which we are promised that there are at most polynomially many paths starting in $s$ and polynomially many paths ending in $t$. For comparison, the best known classical upper bound in this case just to decide $st$-connectivity is $\mathsf{DSPACE}(O(\log^2 n/ \log \log n))$. The result establishes a new relationship between $\mathsf{BQL}$ and unambiguity and fewness subclasses of $\mathsf{NL}$. Further, some preprocessing in our approach also allows us to verify whether there are at most polynomially many paths between any two nodes in $\mathsf{BQSPACE}(O(\log n))$. This yields the first natural candidate for a language problem separating $\mathsf{BQL}$ from $\mathsf{L}$ and $\mathsf{BPL}$. Until now, all candidates separating these classes were promise problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sabotage Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$, the goal in the usual query model is to compute $f$ on an unknown input $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ while minimizing the number of queries to $x$. One can also consider a "distinguishing" problem denoted by $f_{\mathsf{sab}}$: given an input $x \in f^{-1}(0)$ and an input $y \in f^{-1}(1)$, either all differing locations are replaced by a $*$, or all differing locations are replaced by $\dagger$, and an algorithm's goal is to identify which of these is the case while minimizing the number of queries.
  Ben-David and Kothari [ToC'18] introduced the notion of randomized sabotage complexity of a Boolean function to be the zero-error randomized query complexity of $f_{\mathsf{sab}}$. A natural follow-up question is to understand $\mathsf{Q}(f_{\mathsf{sab}})$, the quantum query complexity of $f_{\mathsf{sab}}$. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of this. The following are our main results:
  $\bullet\;\;$ If we have additional query access to $x$ and $y$, then $\mathsf{Q}(f_{\mathsf{sab}})=O(\min\{\mathsf{Q}(f),\sqrt{n}\})$.
  $\bullet\;\;$ If an algorithm is also required to output a differing index of a 0-input and a 1-input, then $\mathsf{Q}(f_{\mathsf{sab}})=O(\min\{\mathsf{Q}(f)^{1.5},\sqrt{n}\})$.
  $\bullet\;\;$ $\mathsf{Q}(f_{\mathsf{sab}}) = \Omega(\sqrt{\mathsf{fbs}(f)})$, where $\mathsf{fbs}(f)$ denotes the fractional block sensitivity of $f$. By known results, along with the results in the previous bullets, this implies that $\mathsf{Q}(f_{\mathsf{sab}})$ is polynomially related to $\mathsf{Q}(f)$.
  $\bullet\;\;$ The bound above is easily seen to be tight for standard functions such as And, Or, Majority and Parity. We show that when $f$ is the Indexing function, $\mathsf{Q}(f_{\mathsf{sab}})=\Theta(\mathsf{fbs}(f))$, ruling out the possibility that $\mathsf{Q}(f_{\mathsf{sab}})=\Theta(\sqrt{\mathsf{fbs}(f)})$ for all $f$.</description>

      <title>On $NP$ versus ${\rm co}NP$ and Frege Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove in this paper that there is a language $L_d$ accepted by some nondeterministic Turing machines but not by any ${\rm co}\mathcal{NP}$-machines (defined later). We further show that $L_d$ is in $\mathcal{NP}$, thus proving that $\mathcal{NP}\neq{\rm co}\mathcal{NP}$. The techniques used in this paper are lazy-diagonalization and the novel new technique developed in author's recent work \cite{Lin21}. As a by-product, we reach the important result \cite{Lin21} that $\mathcal{P}\neq\mathcal{NP}$ once again, which is clear from the above outcome and the well-known fact that $\mathcal{P}={\rm co}\mathcal{P}$. Next, we show that the complexity class ${\rm co}\mathcal{NP}$ has intermediate languages, i.e., there are language $L_{inter}\in{\rm co}\mathcal{NP}$ which is not in $\mathcal{P}$ and not ${\rm co}\mathcal{NP}$-complete. We also summarize other direct consequences in the area of proof complexity implied by our main outcome. Lastly, we show a lower bounds result for Frege proof systems, i.e., no Frege proof systems can be polynomial bounded.</description>

      <title>Topics in Algebra of Synchronous Games, Algebraic Graph Identities and Quantum NP-hardness Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the correspondence between a synchronous game and its associated game algebra. We slightly develop the work of Helton et al.[HMPS17] by proposing results on algebraic and locally commuting graph identities. Based on the theoretical works on noncommutative Nullstellens\"atze [BWHK23], we build computational tools involving Gr\"obner basis method and semidefinite programming to check the existence of perfect strategies with specific models. We prove the equivalence between the hereditary and $C^*$ models proposed in [HMPS17]. We also extend Ji's reduction $\texttt{3-Coloring}^* \leq_p \texttt{3-SAT}^*$ [Ji13] and exhibit another instance of quantum-version NP-hardness reduction $\texttt{Clique}^* \leq_p \texttt{3-SAT}^*$.</description>
