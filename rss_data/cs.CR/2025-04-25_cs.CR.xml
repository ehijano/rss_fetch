      <title>Integrating Graph Theoretical Approaches in Cybersecurity Education CSCI-RTED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, the need for advanced tools to analyze and understand complex cyber environments has become increasingly critical. Graph theory offers a powerful framework for modeling relationships within cyber ecosystems, making it highly applicable to cybersecurity. This paper focuses on the development of an enriched version of the widely recognized NSL-KDD dataset, incorporating graph-theoretical concepts to enhance its practical value. The enriched dataset provides a resource for students and professionals to engage in hands-on analysis, enabling them to explore graph-based methodologies for identifying network behavior and vulnerabilities. To validate the effectiveness of this dataset, we employed IBM Auto AI, demonstrating its capability in real-world applications such as classification and threat prediction. By addressing the need for graph-theoretical datasets, this study provides a practical tool for equipping future cybersecurity professionals with the skills necessary to confront complex cyber challenges.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Argon2 Adoption and Effectiveness in Real-World Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern password hashing remains a critical defense against credential cracking, yet the transition from theoretically secure algorithms to robust real-world implementations remains fraught with challenges. This paper presents a dual analysis of Argon2, the Password Hashing Competition winner, combining attack simulations quantifying how parameter configurations impact guessing costs under realistic budgets, with the first large-scale empirical study of Argon2 adoption across public GitHub software repositories. Our economic model, validated against cryptocurrency mining benchmarks, demonstrates that OWASP's recommended 46 MiB configuration reduces compromise rates by 42.5% compared to SHA-256 at \$1/account attack budgets for strong user passwords. However, memory-hardness exhibits diminishing returns as increasing allocations to RFC 9106's 2048 MiB provides just 23.3% (\$1) and 17.7% (\$20) additional protection despite 44.5 times greater memory demands. Crucially, both configurations fail to mitigate risks from weak passwords, with 96.9-99.8% compromise rates for RockYou-like credentials regardless of algorithm choice. Our repository analysis shows accelerating Argon2 adoption, yet weak configuration practices: 46.6% of deployments use weaker-than-OWASP parameters. Surprisingly, sensitive applications (password managers, encryption tools) show no stronger configurations than general software. Our findings highlight that a secure algorithm alone cannot ensure security, effective parameter guidance and developer education remain essential for realizing Argon2's theoretical advantages.</description>

      <title>P$_\ell$-Kyber: Packing $\ell$ Plaintexts and Lattice Coding for Kyber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a joint design of encoding and encryption processes for KEMs like Kyber, without assuming the independence of the decoding noise entries. Our design features two techniques: ciphertext packing and lattice packing. First, we extend the Peikert-Vaikuntanathan-Waters (PVW) method to the Kyber: $\ell$ plaintexts are packed into a single ciphertext. This scheme is referred to as P$_\ell$-Kyber. We prove that the P$_\ell$-Kyber is IND-CCA secure under the M-LWE hardness assumption. We show that the decryption decoding noise entries across the $\ell$ plaintexts (also known as layers) are mutually independent. Second, we propose a cross-layer lattice encoding scheme for the P$_\ell$-Kyber, where every $\ell$ cross-layer information symbols are encoded to a lattice point. This way we obtain a \emph{coded} P$_\ell$-Kyber, where the decoding noise entries for each lattice point are mutually independent. Therefore, the decryption failure rate (DFR) analysis does not require the assumption of independence among the decryption decoding noise entries. Both DFR and communication cost (CER) are greatly decreased thanks to ciphertext packing and lattice packing. Finally, we demonstrate that with $\ell=24$ and Leech lattice encoder, the proposed coded P$_\ell$-KYBER1024 achieves DFR $&lt;2^{-281}$ and CER $ = 4.6$, i.e., a decrease of CER by $90\%$ compared to KYBER1024.</description>

      <title>Developing a Blockchain-Based Secure Digital Contents Distribution System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As digital content distribution expands rapidly through online platforms, securing digital media and protecting intellectual property has become increasingly complex. Traditional centralized systems, while widely adopted, suffer from vulnerabilities such as single points of failure and limited traceability of unauthorized access. This paper presents a blockchain-based secure digital content distribution system that integrates Sia, a decentralized storage network, and Skynet, a content delivery network, to enhance content protection and distribution. The proposed system employs a dual-layer architecture: off-chain for user authentication and on-chain for transaction validation using smart contracts and asymmetric encryption. By introducing a license issuance and secret block mechanism, the system ensures content authenticity, privacy, and controlled access. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the system in securely distributing multimedia files. The proposed platform not only improves content security but also paves the way for future enhancements with decentralized applications and integrated royalty payment mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a prominent Sybil control mechanism for blockchain-based systems. In "e-PoS: Making PoS Decentralized and Fair," Saad et al. (TPDS'21) introduced a new Proof-of-Stake protocol, e-PoS, to enhance PoS applications' decentralization and fairness. In this comment paper, we address a misunderstanding in the work of Saad et al. The conventional Proof-of-Stake model that causes the fairness problem does not align with the general concept of Proof-of-Stake nor the Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies mentioned in their paper.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning for Continuous Touch-Based Authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart mobile devices have become indispensable in modern daily life, where sensitive information is frequently processed, stored, and transmitted-posing critical demands for robust security controls. Given that touchscreens are the primary medium for human-device interaction, continuous user authentication based on touch behavior presents a natural and seamless security solution. While existing methods predominantly adopt binary classification under single-modal learning settings, we propose a unified contrastive learning framework for continuous authentication in a non-disruptive manner. Specifically, the proposed method leverages a Temporal Masked Autoencoder to extract temporal patterns from raw multi-sensor data streams, capturing continuous motion and gesture dynamics. The pre-trained TMAE is subsequently integrated into a Siamese Temporal-Attentive Convolutional Network within a contrastive learning paradigm to model both sequential and cross-modal patterns. To further enhance performance, we incorporate multi-head attention and channel attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and optimize inter-channel feature integration. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and a self-collected dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a reliable and effective solution for user authentication on mobile devices.</description>

      <title>Proof of Useful Intelligence (PoUI): Blockchain Consensus Beyond Energy Waste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain technology enables secure, transparent data management in decentralized systems, supporting applications from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to tokenizing real-world assets like property. Its scalability and sustainability hinge on consensus mechanisms balancing security and efficiency. Proof of Work (PoW), used by Bitcoin, ensures security through energy-intensive computations but demands significant resources. Proof of Stake (PoS), as in Ethereum post-Merge, selects validators based on staked cryptocurrency, offering energy efficiency but risking centralization from wealth concentration. With AI models straining computational resources, we propose Proof of Useful Intelligence (PoUI), a hybrid consensus mechanism. In PoUI, workers perform AI tasks like language processing or image analysis to earn coins, which are staked to secure the network, blending security with practical utility. Decentralized nodes--job posters, market coordinators, workers, and validators --collaborate via smart contracts to manage tasks and rewards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the vulnerability of machine learning models to simple single-feature adversarial attacks in the context of Ethereum fraudulent transaction detection. Through comprehensive experimentation, we investigate the impact of various adversarial attack strategies on model performance metrics. Our findings, highlighting how prone those techniques are to simple attacks, are alarming, and the inconsistency in the attacks' effect on different algorithms promises ways for attack mitigation. We examine the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies, including adversarial training and enhanced feature selection, in enhancing model robustness and show their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>User Profiles: The Achilles' Heel of Web Browsers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web browsers provide the security foundation for our online experiences. Significant research has been done into the security of browsers themselves, but relatively little investigation has been done into how they interact with the operating system or the file system. In this work, we provide the first systematic security study of browser profiles, the on-disk persistence layer of browsers, used for storing everything from users' authentication cookies and browser extensions to certificate trust decisions and device permissions. We show that, except for the Tor Browser, all modern browsers store sensitive data in home directories with little to no integrity or confidentiality controls. We show that security measures like password and cookie encryption can be easily bypassed. In addition, HTTPS can be sidestepped entirely by deploying malicious root certificates within users' browser profiles. The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), the backbone of the secure Web. HTTPS can be fully bypassed with the deployment of custom potentially malicious root certificates. More worryingly, we show how these powerful attacks can be fully mounted directly from web browsers themselves, through the File System Access API, a recent feature added by Chromium browsers that enables a website to directly manipulate a user's file system via JavaScript. In a series of case studies, we demonstrate how an attacker can install malicious browser extensions, inject additional root certificates, hijack HTTPS traffic, and enable websites to access hardware devices like the camera and GPS. Based on our findings, we argue that researchers and browser vendors need to develop and deploy more secure mechanisms for protecting users' browser data against file system attackers.</description>

      <title>Identity Control Plane: The Unifying Layer for Zero Trust Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Identity Control Plane (ICP), an architectural framework for enforcing identity-aware Zero Trust access across human users, workloads, and automation systems. The ICP model unifies SPIFFE-based workload identity, OIDC/SAML user identity, and scoped automation credentials via broker-issued transaction tokens. We propose a composable enforcement layer using ABAC policy engines (e.g., OPA, Cedar), aligned with IETF WIMSE drafts and OAuth transaction tokens. The paper includes architectural components, integration patterns, use cases, a comparative analysis with current models, and theorized performance metrics. A FedRAMP and SLSA compliance mapping is also presented. This is a theoretical infrastructure architecture paper intended for security researchers and platform architects. No prior version of this work has been published.</description>

      <title>Silenzio: Secure Non-Interactive Outsourced MLP Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outsourcing the ML training to cloud providers presents a compelling opportunity for resource constrained clients, while it simultaneously bears inherent privacy risks, especially for highly sensitive training data. We introduce Silenzio, the first fully non-interactive outsourcing scheme for the training of multi-layer perceptrons that achieves 128 bit security using FHE. Unlike traditional MPC based protocols that necessitate interactive communication between the client and server(s) or non-collusion assumptions among multiple servers, Silenzio enables the fire-and-forget paradigm without such assumptions. In this approach, the client encrypts the training data once, and the cloud server performs the training without any further interaction.
  Silenzio operates over low bitwidth integers - never exceeding 8 bit - to mitigate the computational overhead of FHE. Our approach features a novel low-bitwidth matrix multiplication that leverages input-dependent residue number systems and a Karatsuba-inspired multiplication routine, ensuring that no intermediate FHE-processed value overflows 8 bit. Starting from an RNS-to-MRNS conversion process, we propose an efficient block-scaling mechanism, which approximately shifts encrypted tensor values to the user-specified most significant bits. To instantiate the backpropagation of the error, Silenzio introduces a low-bitwidth and TFHE friendly gradient computation for the cross entropy loss.
  Implemented using the state-of-the-art Concrete library, we evaluate Silenzio on standard MLP training tasks regarding runtime as well as model performance and achieve similar classification accuracy as MLPs trained using standard PyTorch with 32 bit floating-point computations. Our open-source implementation represents a significant advancement in privacy-preserving ML, providing a new baseline for secure and non-interactive outsourced MLP training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way we access information. These models are often tuned to refuse to comply with requests that are considered harmful and to produce responses that better align with the preferences of those who control the models. To understand how this "censorship" works. We use representation engineering techniques to study open-weights safety-tuned models. We present a method for finding a refusal--compliance vector that detects and controls the level of censorship in model outputs. We also analyze recent reasoning LLMs, distilled from DeepSeek-R1, and uncover an additional dimension of censorship through "thought suppression". We show a similar approach can be used to find a vector that suppresses the model's reasoning process, allowing us to remove censorship by applying the negative multiples of this vector</description>

      <title>Automatically Generating Rules of Malicious Software Packages via Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today's security tools predominantly rely on predefined rules crafted by experts, making them poorly adapted to the emergence of software supply chain attacks. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel tool, RuleLLM, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate rule generation for OSS ecosystems. RuleLLM extracts metadata and code snippets from malware as its input, producing YARA and Semgrep rules that can be directly deployed in software development. Specifically, the rule generation task involves three subtasks: crafting rules, refining rules, and aligning rules. To validate RuleLLM's effectiveness, we implemented a prototype system and conducted experiments on the dataset of 1,633 malicious packages. The results are promising that RuleLLM generated 763 rules (452 YARA and 311 Semgrep) with a precision of 85.2\% and a recall of 91.8\%, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) tools and scored-based approaches. We further analyzed generated rules and proposed a rule taxonomy: 11 categories and 38 subcategories.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Flow and the Bank: Stealthy Cyberattacks on Water Network Hydraulics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As water distribution networks (WDNs) become increasingly connected with digital infrastructures, they face greater exposure to cyberattacks that threaten their operational integrity. Stealthy False Data Injection Attacks (SFDIAs) are particularly concerning, as they manipulate sensor data to compromise system operations while avoiding detection. While existing studies have focused on either detection methods or specific attack formulations, the relationship between attack sophistication, system knowledge requirements, and achievable impact remains unexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis of sensor attacks against WDNs, investigating different combinations of physical constraints, state monitoring requirements, and intrusion detection evasion conditions. We propose several attack formulations that range from tailored strategies satisfying both physical and detection constraints to simpler measurement manipulations. The proposed attacks are simple and local -- requiring knowledge only of targeted sensors and their hydraulic connections -- making them scalable and practical. Through case studies on Net1 and Net3 benchmark networks, we demonstrate how these attacks can persistently increase operational costs and alter water flows while remaining undetected by monitoring systems for extended periods. The analysis provides utilities with insights for vulnerability assessment and motivates the development of protection strategies that combine physical and statistical security mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Variational Autoencoders with Smooth Robust Latent Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have played a key role in scaling up diffusion-based generative models, as in Stable Diffusion, yet questions regarding their robustness remain largely underexplored. Although adversarial training has been an established technique for enhancing robustness in predictive models, it has been overlooked for generative models due to concerns about potential fidelity degradation by the nature of trade-offs between performance and robustness. In this work, we challenge this presumption, introducing Smooth Robust Latent VAE (SRL-VAE), a novel adversarial training framework that boosts both generation quality and robustness. In contrast to conventional adversarial training, which focuses on robustness only, our approach smooths the latent space via adversarial perturbations, promoting more generalizable representations while regularizing with originality representation to sustain original fidelity. Applied as a post-training step on pre-trained VAEs, SRL-VAE improves image robustness and fidelity with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show that SRL-VAE improves both generation quality, in image reconstruction and text-guided image editing, and robustness, against Nightshade attacks and image editing attacks. These results establish a new paradigm, showing that adversarial training, once thought to be detrimental to generative models, can instead enhance both fidelity and robustness.</description>

      <title>Wolves in the Repository: A Software Engineering Analysis of the XZ Utils Supply Chain Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The digital economy runs on Open Source Software (OSS), with an estimated 90\% of modern applications containing open-source components. While this widespread adoption has revolutionized software development, it has also created critical security vulnerabilities, particularly in essential but under-resourced projects. This paper examines a sophisticated attack on the XZ Utils project (CVE-2024-3094), where attackers exploited not just code, but the entire open-source development process to inject a backdoor into a fundamental Linux compression library. Our analysis reveals a new breed of supply chain attack that manipulates software engineering practices themselves -- from community management to CI/CD configurations -- to establish legitimacy and maintain long-term control. Through a comprehensive examination of GitHub events and development artifacts, we reconstruct the attack timeline, analyze the evolution of attacker tactics. Our findings demonstrate how attackers leveraged seemingly beneficial contributions to project infrastructure and maintenance to bypass traditional security measures. This work extends beyond traditional security analysis by examining how software engineering practices themselves can be weaponized, offering insights for protecting the open-source ecosystem.</description>

      <title>From Randomized Response to Randomized Index: Answering Subset Counting Queries with Local Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is the predominant privacy model for safeguarding individual data privacy. Existing perturbation mechanisms typically require perturbing the original values to ensure acceptable privacy, which inevitably results in value distortion and utility deterioration. In this work, we propose an alternative approach -- instead of perturbing values, we apply randomization to indexes of values while ensuring rigorous LDP guarantees. Inspired by the deniability of randomized indexes, we present CRIAD for answering subset counting queries on set-value data. By integrating a multi-dummy, multi-sample, and multi-group strategy, CRIAD serves as a fully scalable solution that offers flexibility across various privacy requirements and domain sizes, and achieves more accurate query results than any existing methods. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experimental evaluations, we validate the effectiveness of CRIAD and demonstrate its superiority over traditional value-perturbation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Autoencoder for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) defines the task of identifying observations or events that deviate from typical - or normal - patterns, a critical capability in IT security for recognizing incidents such as system misconfigurations, malware infections, or cyberattacks. In enterprise environments like SAP HANA Cloud systems, this task often involves monitoring high-dimensional, multivariate time series (MTS) derived from telemetry and log data. With the advent of quantum machine learning offering efficient calculations in high-dimensional latent spaces, many avenues open for dealing with such complex data. One approach is the Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), an emerging and promising method with potential for application in both data compression and AD. However, prior applications of QAEs to time series AD have been restricted to univariate data, limiting their relevance for real-world enterprise systems. In this work, we introduce a novel QAE-based framework designed specifically for MTS AD towards enterprise scale. We theoretically develop and experimentally validate the architecture, demonstrating that our QAE achieves performance competitive with neural-network-based autoencoders while requiring fewer trainable parameters. We evaluate our model on datasets that closely reflect SAP system telemetry and show that the proposed QAE is a viable and efficient alternative for semisupervised AD in real-world enterprise settings.</description>

      <title>STCL:Curriculum learning Strategies for deep learning image steganography models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aiming at the problems of poor quality of steganographic images and slow network convergence of image steganography models based on deep learning, this paper proposes a Steganography Curriculum Learning training strategy (STCL) for deep learning image steganography models. So that only easy images are selected for training when the model has poor fitting ability at the initial stage, and gradually expand to more difficult images, the strategy includes a difficulty evaluation strategy based on the teacher model and an knee point-based training scheduling strategy. Firstly, multiple teacher models are trained, and the consistency of the quality of steganographic images under multiple teacher models is used as the difficulty score to construct the training subsets from easy to difficult. Secondly, a training control strategy based on knee points is proposed to reduce the possibility of overfitting on small training sets and accelerate the training process. Experimental results on three large public datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, show that the proposed image steganography scheme is able to improve the model performance under multiple algorithmic frameworks, which not only has a high PSNR, SSIM score, and decoding accuracy, but also the steganographic images generated by the model under the training of the STCL strategy have a low steganography analysis scores.

      <title>Near-Term Pseudorandom and Pseudoresource Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A pseudorandom quantum state (PRS) is an ensemble of quantum states indistinguishable from Haar-random states to observers with efficient quantum computers. It allows one to substitute the costly Haar-random state with efficiently preparable PRS as a resource for cryptographic protocols, while also finding applications in quantum learning theory, black hole physics, many-body thermalization, quantum foundations, and quantum chaos. All existing constructions of PRS equate the notion of efficiency to quantum computers which runtime is bounded by a polynomial in its input size. In this work, we relax the notion of efficiency for PRS with respect to observers with near-term quantum computers implementing algorithms with runtime that scales slower than polynomial-time. We introduce the $\mathbf{T}$-PRS which is indistinguishable to quantum algorithms with runtime $\mathbf{T}(n)$ that grows slower than polynomials in the input size $n$. We give a set of reasonable conditions that a $\mathbf{T}$-PRS must satisfy and give two constructions by using quantum-secure pseudorandom functions and pseudorandom functions. For $\mathbf{T}(n)$ being linearithmic, linear, polylogarithmic, and logarithmic function, we characterize the amount of quantum resources a $\mathbf{T}$-PRS must possess, particularly on its coherence, entanglement, and magic. Our quantum resource characterization applies generally to any two state ensembles that are indistinguishable to observers with computational power $\mathbf{T}(n)$, giving a general necessary condition of whether a low-resource ensemble can mimic a high-resource ensemble, forming a $\mathbf{T}$-pseudoresource pair. We demonstate how the necessary amount of resource decreases as the observer's computational power is more restricted, giving a $\mathbf{T}$-pseudoresource pair with larger resource gap for more computationally limited observers.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Study on the Design of Odd-Sized Highly Nonlinear Boolean Functions via Evolutionary Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the problem of evolving Boolean functions of odd sizes with high nonlinearity, a property of cryptographic relevance. Despite its simple formulation, this problem turns out to be remarkably difficult. We perform a systematic evaluation by considering three solution encodings and four problem instances, analyzing how well different types of evolutionary algorithms behave in finding a maximally nonlinear Boolean function. Our results show that genetic programming generally outperforms other evolutionary algorithms, although it falls short of the best-known results achieved by ad-hoc heuristics. Interestingly, by adding local search and restricting the space to rotation symmetric Boolean functions, we show that a genetic algorithm with the bitstring encoding manages to evolve a $9$-variable Boolean function with nonlinearity 241.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01246v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces MapComp, a novel view-based framework to facilitate join-group-aggregation (JGA) queries for secure collaborative analytics. Through specially crafted materialized views for join and novel design of group-aggregation (GA) protocols, MapComp removes duplicated join workload and expedites subsequent GA, improving the efficiency of JGA query execution. To support continuous data updates, our materialized view offers payload-independence feature and brings in significant efficiency improvement of view refreshing with free MPC overhead. This feature also allows further acceleration for GA, where we devise multiple novel protocols that outperform prior works. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate a significant advantage of MapComp, achieving up to a 308.9x efficiency improvement compared to the baseline in the real-world query simulation.</description>

      <title>JailbreakLens: Interpreting Jailbreak Mechanism in the Lens of Representation and Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of Large language Models (LLMs) in diverse tasks, they are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, wherein adversarial prompts are crafted to bypass their security mechanisms and elicit unexpected responses. Although jailbreak attacks are prevalent, the understanding of their underlying mechanisms remains limited. Recent studies have explained typical jailbreaking behavior (e.g., the degree to which the model refuses to respond) of LLMs by analyzing representation shifts in their latent space caused by jailbreak prompts or identifying key neurons that contribute to the success of jailbreak attacks. However, these studies neither explore diverse jailbreak patterns nor provide a fine-grained explanation from the failure of circuit to the changes of representational, leaving significant gaps in uncovering the jailbreak mechanism. In this paper, we propose JailbreakLens, an interpretation framework that analyzes jailbreak mechanisms from both representation (which reveals how jailbreaks alter the model's harmfulness perception) and circuit perspectives~(which uncovers the causes of these deceptions by identifying key circuits contributing to the vulnerability), tracking their evolution throughout the entire response generation process. We then conduct an in-depth evaluation of jailbreak behavior on five mainstream LLMs under seven jailbreak strategies. Our evaluation reveals that jailbreak prompts amplify components that reinforce affirmative responses while suppressing those that produce refusal. This manipulation shifts model representations toward safe clusters to deceive the LLM, leading it to provide detailed responses instead of refusals. Notably, we find a strong and consistent correlation between representation deception and activation shift of key circuits across diverse jailbreak methods and multiple LLMs.</description>

      <title>Generating Privacy-Preserving Personalized Advice with Zero-Knowledge Proofs and LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in domains such as finance, healthcare, and interpersonal relationships to provide advice tailored to user traits and contexts. However, this personalization often relies on sensitive data, raising critical privacy concerns and necessitating data minimization. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that integrates zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology, specifically zkVM, with LLM-based chatbots. This integration enables privacy-preserving data sharing by verifying user traits without disclosing sensitive information. Our research introduces both an architecture and a prompting strategy for this approach. Through empirical evaluation, we clarify the current constraints and performance limitations of both zkVM and the proposed prompting strategy, thereby demonstrating their practical feasibility in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>CRAFT: Characterizing and Root-Causing Fault Injection Threats at Pre-Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault injection attacks represent a class of threats that can compromise embedded systems across multiple layers of abstraction, such as system software, instruction set architecture (ISA), microarchitecture, and physical implementation. Early detection of these vulnerabilities and understanding their root causes, along with their propagation from the physical layer to the system software, is critical to secure the cyberinfrastructure. This work presents a comprehensive methodology for conducting controlled fault injection attacks at the pre-silicon level and an analysis of the underlying system for root-causing behavior. As the driving application, we use the clock glitch attacks in AI/ML applications for critical misclassification. Our study aims to characterize and diagnose the impact of faults within the RISC-V instruction set and pipeline stages, while tracing fault propagation from the circuit level to the AI/ML application software. This analysis resulted in discovering two new vulnerabilities through controlled clock glitch parameters. First, we reveal a novel method for causing instruction skips, thereby preventing the loading of critical values from memory. This can cause disruption and affect program continuity and correctness. Second, we demonstrate an attack that converts legal instructions into illegal ones, thereby diverting control flow in a manner exploitable by attackers. Our work underscores the complexity of fault injection attack exploits and emphasizes the importance of preemptive security analysis.</description>

      <title>CheatAgent: Attacking LLM-Empowered Recommender Systems via LLM Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered recommender systems (RecSys) have brought significant advances in personalized user experience and have attracted considerable attention. Despite the impressive progress, the research question regarding the safety vulnerability of LLM-empowered RecSys still remains largely under-investigated. Given the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to focus on attacking the black-box RecSys, where attackers can only observe the system's inputs and outputs. However, traditional attack approaches employing reinforcement learning (RL) agents are not effective for attacking LLM-empowered RecSys due to the limited capabilities in processing complex textual inputs, planning, and reasoning. On the other hand, LLMs provide unprecedented opportunities to serve as attack agents to attack RecSys because of their impressive capability in simulating human-like decision-making processes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel attack framework called CheatAgent by harnessing the human-like capabilities of LLMs, where an LLM-based agent is developed to attack LLM-Empowered RecSys. Specifically, our method first identifies the insertion position for maximum impact with minimal input modification. After that, the LLM agent is designed to generate adversarial perturbations to insert at target positions. To further improve the quality of generated perturbations, we utilize the prompt tuning technique to improve attacking strategies via feedback from the victim RecSys iteratively. Extensive experiments across three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attacking method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: This review explores the trustworthiness of multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) systems, specifically focusing on vision-language tasks. It addresses critical challenges related to fairness, transparency, and ethical implications in these systems, providing a comparative analysis of key tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), image captioning, and visual dialogue. Background: Multimodal models, particularly vision-language models, enhance artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities by integrating visual and textual data, mimicking human learning processes. Despite significant advancements, the trustworthiness of these models remains a crucial concern, particularly as AI systems increasingly confront issues regarding fairness, transparency, and ethics. Methods: This review examines research conducted from 2017 to 2024 focusing on forenamed core vision-language tasks. It employs a comparative approach to analyze these tasks through the lens of trustworthiness, underlining fairness, explainability, and ethics. This study synthesizes findings from recent literature to identify trends, challenges, and state-of-the-art solutions. Results: Several key findings were highlighted. Transparency: Explainability of vision language tasks is important for user trust. Techniques, such as attention maps and gradient-based methods, have successfully addressed this issue. Fairness: Bias mitigation in VQA and visual dialogue systems is essential for ensuring unbiased outcomes across diverse demographic groups. Ethical Implications: Addressing biases in multilingual models and ensuring ethical data handling is critical for the responsible deployment of vision-language systems. Conclusion: This study underscores the importance of integrating fairness, transparency, and ethical considerations in developing vision-language models within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>vApps: Verifiable Applications at Internet Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchain technology promises a decentralized, trustless, and interoperable infrastructure. However, widespread adoption remains hindered by issues such as limited scalability, high transaction costs, and the complexity of maintaining coherent verification logic across different blockchain layers. This paper introduces Verifiable Applications (vApps), a novel development framework designed to streamline the creation and deployment of verifiable blockchain computing applications. vApps offer a unified Rust-based Domain-Specific Language (DSL) within a comprehensive SDK, featuring modular abstractions for verification, proof generation, and inter-chain connectivity. This eases the developer's burden in securing diverse software components, allowing them to focus on application logic. The DSL also ensures that applications can automatically take advantage of specialized precompiles and hardware acceleration to achieve consistently high performance with minimal developer effort, as demonstrated by benchmark results for zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs). Experiments show that native Rust execution eliminates interpretation overhead, delivering up to an 832x cycle count improvement compared to EVM-based approaches. Precompiled circuits can accelerate the proof by more than 95%, while GPU acceleration increases throughput by up to 30x and recursion compresses the proof size by up to 230x, enabling succinct and efficient verification. The framework also supports seamless integration with the Web2 and Web3 systems, enabling developers to focus solely on their application logic. Through modular architecture, robust security guarantees, and composability, vApps pave the way toward a trust-minimized and verifiable Internet-scale application environment.</description>

      <title>Automated Static Vulnerability Detection via a Holistic Neuro-symbolic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Static vulnerability detection is still a challenging problem and demands excessive human efforts, e.g., manual curation of good vulnerability patterns. None of prior works, including classic program analysis or Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches, have fully automated such vulnerability pattern generations with reasonable detection accuracy. In this paper, we design and implement, MoCQ, a novel holistic neuro-symbolic framework that combines the complementary strengths of LLMs and classical static analysis to enable scalable vulnerability detection. The key insight is that MoCQ leverages an LLM to automatically extract vulnerability patterns and translate them into detection queries, and then on static analysis to refine such queries in a feedback loop and eventually execute them for analyzing large codebases and mining vulnerabilities. We evaluate MoCQ on seven types of vulnerabilities spanning two programming languages. We found MoCQ-generated queries uncovered at least 12 patterns that were missed by experts. On a ground truth dataset, MoCQ achieved comparable precision and recall compared to expert-crafted queries. Moreover, MoCQ has identified seven previously unknown vulnerabilities in real-world applications, demonstrating its practical effectiveness. We have responsibly disclosed them to the corresponding developers.</description>

      <title>AI-Based Vulnerability Analysis of NFT Smart Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of the NFT market, the security of smart contracts has become crucial. However, existing AI-based detection models for NFT contract vulnerabilities remain limited due to their complexity, while traditional manual methods are time-consuming and costly. This study proposes an AI-driven approach to detect vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts.
  We collected 16,527 public smart contract codes, classifying them into five vulnerability categories: Risky Mutable Proxy, ERC-721 Reentrancy, Unlimited Minting, Missing Requirements, and Public Burn. Python-processed data was structured into training/test sets. Using the CART algorithm with Gini coefficient evaluation, we built initial decision trees for feature extraction. A random forest model was implemented to improve robustness through random data/feature sampling and multitree integration. GridSearch hyperparameter tuning further optimized the model, with 3D visualizations demonstrating parameter impacts on vulnerability detection.
  Results show the random forest model excels in detecting all five vulnerabilities. For example, it identifies Risky Mutable Proxy by analyzing authorization mechanisms and state modifications, while ERC-721 Reentrancy detection relies on external call locations and lock mechanisms. The ensemble approach effectively reduces single-tree overfitting, with stable performance improvements after parameter tuning. This method provides an efficient technical solution for automated NFT contract detection and lays groundwork for scaling AI applications.</description>

      <title>Honeybee: Byzantine Tolerant Decentralized Peer Sampling with Verifiable Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16201v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Popular blockchains today have hundreds of thousands of nodes and need to be able to support sophisticated scaling solutions$\unicode{x2013}$such as sharding, data availability sampling, and layer-2 methods. Designing secure and efficient peer-to-peer (p2p) networking protocols at these scales to support the tight demands of the upper layer crypto-economic primitives is a highly non-trivial endeavor. We identify decentralized, uniform random sampling of nodes as a fundamental capability necessary for building robust p2p networks in emerging blockchain networks. Sampling algorithms used in practice today (primarily for address discovery) rely on either distributed hash tables (e.g., Kademlia) or sharing addresses with neighbors (e.g., GossipSub), and are not secure in a Sybil setting. We present Honeybee, a decentralized algorithm for sampling nodes that uses verifiable random walks and table consistency checks. Honeybee is secure against attacks even in the presence of an overwhelming number of Byzantine nodes (e.g., $\geq50\%$ of the network). We evaluate Honeybee through experiments and show that the quality of sampling achieved by Honeybee is significantly better compared to the state-of-the-art. Our proposed algorithm has implications for network design in both full nodes and light nodes.</description>

      <title>Aegis: Tethering a Blockchain with Primary-Chain Stake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blockchains implement decentralized monetary systems and applications. Recent advancements enable what we call tethering a blockchain to a primary blockchain, securing the tethered chain by nodes that post primary-chain tokens as collateral. The collateral ensures nodes behave as intended, until they withdraw it. Unlike a Proof of Stake blockchain which uses its own token as collateral, using primary-chain tokens shields the tethered chain from the volatility of its own token.
  State-of-the-art tethered blockchains either rely on centralization, or make extreme assumptions: that all communication is synchronous, that operators remain correct even post-withdrawal, or that withdrawals can be indefinitely delayed by tethered-chain failures.
  We prove that with partial synchrony, there is no solution to the problem. However, under the standard assumptions that communication with the primary chain is synchronous and communication among the tethered chain nodes is partially synchronous, there is a solution. We present a tethered-chain protocol called Aegis. Aegis uses references from its blocks to primary blocks to define committees, checkpoints on the primary chain to perpetuate decisions, and resets to establish new committees when previous ones become obsolete. It ensures safety at all times and rapid progress when latency among Aegis nodes is low.</description>

      <title>GraphRAG under Fire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GraphRAG advances retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by structuring external knowledge as multi-scale knowledge graphs, enabling language models to integrate both broad context and granular details in their generation. While GraphRAG has demonstrated success across domains, its security implications remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, this work examines GraphRAG's vulnerability to poisoning attacks, uncovering an intriguing security paradox: compared to conventional RAG, GraphRAG's graph-based indexing and retrieval enhance resilience against simple poisoning attacks; yet, the same features also create new attack surfaces. We present GRAGPoison, a novel attack that exploits shared relations in the underlying knowledge graph to craft poisoning text capable of compromising multiple queries simultaneously. GRAGPoison employs three key strategies: i) relation injection to introduce false knowledge, ii) relation enhancement to amplify poisoning influence, and iii) narrative generation to embed malicious content within coherent text. Empirical evaluation across diverse datasets and models shows that GRAGPoison substantially outperforms existing attacks in terms of effectiveness (up to 98\% success rate) and scalability (using less than 68\% poisoning text) on various GraphRAG-based systems. We also explore potential defensive measures and their limitations, identifying promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Review of Demographic Fairness in Face Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Demographic fairness in face recognition (FR) has emerged as a critical area of research, given its impact on fairness, equity, and reliability across diverse applications. As FR technologies are increasingly deployed globally, disparities in performance across demographic groups-- such as race, ethnicity, and gender-- have garnered significant attention. These biases not only compromise the credibility of FR systems but also raise ethical concerns, especially when these technologies are employed in sensitive domains. This review consolidates extensive research efforts providing a comprehensive overview of the multifaceted aspects of demographic fairness in FR.
  We systematically examine the primary causes, datasets, assessment metrics, and mitigation approaches associated with demographic disparities in FR. By categorizing key contributions in these areas, this work provides a structured approach to understanding and addressing the complexity of this issue. Finally, we highlight current advancements and identify emerging challenges that need further investigation. This article aims to provide researchers with a unified perspective on the state-of-the-art while emphasizing the critical need for equitable and trustworthy FR systems.</description>

      <title>"I'm not for sale" -- Perceptions and limited awareness of privacy risks by digital natives about location data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although mobile devices benefit users in their daily lives in numerous ways, they also raise several privacy concerns. For instance, they can reveal sensitive information that can be inferred from location data. This location data is shared through service providers as well as mobile applications. Understanding how and with whom users share their location data -- as well as users' perception of the underlying privacy risks --, are important notions to grasp in order to design usable privacy-enhancing technologies. In this work, we perform a quantitative and qualitative analysis of smartphone users' awareness, perception and self-reported behavior towards location data-sharing through a survey of n=99 young adult participants (i.e., digital natives). We compare stated practices with actual behaviors to better understand their mental models, and survey participants' understanding of privacy risks before and after the inspection of location traces and the information that can be inferred therefrom.
  Our empirical results show that participants have risky privacy practices: about 54% of participants underestimate the number of mobile applications to which they have granted access to their data, and 33% forget or do not think of revoking access to their data. Also, by using a demonstrator to perform inferences from location data, we observe that slightly more than half of participants (57%) are surprised by the extent of potentially inferred information, and that 47% intend to reduce access to their data via permissions as a result of using the demonstrator. Last, a majority of participants have little knowledge of the tools to better protect themselves, but are nonetheless willing to follow suggestions to improve privacy (51%). Educating people, including digital natives, about privacy risks through transparency tools seems a promising approach.</description>

      <title>EditLord: Learning Code Transformation Rules for Code Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code editing is a foundational task in software development, where its effectiveness depends on whether it introduces desired code property changes without changing the original code's intended functionality. Existing approaches often formulate code editing as an implicit end-to-end task, omitting the fact that code-editing procedures inherently consist of discrete and explicit steps. Thus, they suffer from suboptimal performance and lack of robustness and generalization. We introduce EditLord, a code editing framework that makes the code transformation steps explicit. Our key insight is to employ a language model (LM) as an inductive learner to extract code editing rules from the training code pairs as concise meta-rule sets. Such rule sets will be manifested for each training sample to augment them for finetuning or assist in prompting- and iterative-based code editing. EditLordoutperforms the state-of-the-art by an average of 22.7% in editing performance and 58.1% in robustness while achieving 20.2% higher functional correctness across critical software engineering and security applications, LM models, and editing modes.</description>

      <title>A Study on Mixup-Inspired Augmentation Methods for Software Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various deep learning (DL) methods have recently been utilized to detect software vulnerabilities. Real-world software vulnerability datasets are rare and hard to acquire, as there is no simple metric for classifying vulnerability. Such datasets are heavily imbalanced, and none of the current datasets are considered huge for DL models. To tackle these problems, a recent work has tried to augment the dataset using the source code and generate realistic single-statement vulnerabilities, which is not quite practical and requires manual checking of the generated vulnerabilities. In this paper, we aim to explore the augmentation of vulnerabilities at the representation level to help current models learn better, which has never been done before to the best of our knowledge. We implement and evaluate five augmentation techniques that augment the embedding of the data and have recently been used for code search, which is a completely different software engineering task. We also introduced a conditioned version of those augmentation methods, which ensures the augmentation does not change the vulnerable section of the vector representation. We show that such augmentation methods can be helpful and increase the F1-score by up to 9.67%, yet they cannot beat Random Oversampling when balancing datasets, which increases the F1-score by 10.82%.</description>
