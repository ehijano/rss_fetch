      <title>Autonomous Reporting of Normal Chest X-rays by Artificial Intelligence in the United Kingdom. Can We Take the Human Out of the Loop?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most commonly performed imaging investigation. In the UK, many centres experience reporting delays due to radiologist workforce shortages. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools capable of distinguishing normal from abnormal CXRs have emerged as a potential solution. If normal CXRs could be safely identified and reported without human input, a substantial portion of radiology workload could be reduced.
  This article examines the feasibility and implications of autonomous AI reporting of normal CXRs. Key issues include defining normal, ensuring generalisability across populations, and managing the sensitivity-specificity trade-off. It also addresses legal and regulatory challenges, such as compliance with IR(ME)R and GDPR, and the lack accountability frameworks for errors. Further considerations include the impact on radiologists practice, the need for robust post-market surveillance, and incorporation of patient perspectives. While the benefits are clear, adoption must be cautious.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion models of invasive tree pest spread: quantifying the spread of oak processionary moth in the UK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UK woodlands, forests, and urban treescapes are under threat from invasive species, exacerbated by climate change, trade, and transport. Invasive tree pests debilitate their host and disrupt forest ecosystems, thus it is imperative to quantitatively model and predict their spread. Addressing this, we represent the spatial distribution of the pest as a population density field which evolves according to a spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion equation. We solve this intractable system of equations numerically and, from the solution, we determine first arrival times of the pest at locations in the field. The adopted model permits us to obtain the expansion rate of pest spread directly from the model parameters, which we infer in the Bayesian paradigm, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme. We apply our framework to the ongoing spread of oak processionary moth in the UK, an outbreak which continues to grow despite management efforts. We demonstrate that our approach effectively captures the spread of the pest and that this has occurred at a non-constant expansion rate. The proposed framework is a powerful tool for quantitatively modelling the spread of an invasive tree pest and could underpin future prediction and management approaches.</description>

      <title>Maintaining diversity in structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine population structures for their ability to maintain diversity in neutral evolution. We use the general framework of evolutionary graph theory and consider birth-death (bd) and death-birth (db) updating. The population is of size $N$. Initially all individuals represent different types. The basic question is: what is the time $T_N$ until one type takes over the population? This time is known as consensus time in computer science and as total coalescent time in evolutionary biology. For the complete graph, it is known that $T_N$ is quadratic in $N$ for db and bd. For the cycle, we prove that $T_N$ is cubic in $N$ for db and bd. For the star, we prove that $T_N$ is cubic for bd and quasilinear ($N\log N$) for db. For the double star, we show that $T_N$ is quartic for bd. We derive upper and lower bounds for all undirected graphs for bd and db. We also show the Pareto front of graphs (of size $N=8$) that maintain diversity the longest for bd and db. Further, we show that some graphs that quickly homogenize can maintain high levels of diversity longer than graphs that slowly homogenize. For directed graphs, we give simple contracting star-like structures that have superexponential time scales for maintaining diversity.</description>
