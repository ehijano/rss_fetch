      <title>Stability and Decay of Macrovortices in Rotating Bose Gases Beyond Mean Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation, stability, and decay of macrovortices in a rotating Bose gas confined by a Mexican-hat potential with a multiconfigurational ansatz. By systematically including correlations beyond the mean-field level, we map the equilibrium phase diagram and identify regimes of coexistence between vortex lattices and multiply charge central vortices. Quench dynamics reveals that macrovortices are robust under changes in rotation or interaction strength, sustaining clean monopole oscillations with well-separated, vorticity-dependent breathing frequencies. In contrast, trap quenches trigger a universal decay process mediated by vortex-phonon coupling, in which rotational energy is progressively transferred to compressible modes until the macrovortex splits into singly quantized vortices. Our results demonstrate that macrovortex lifetimes and decay pathways can be tuned by trap confinement, providing experimentally accessible signatures of vortex-phonon interactions and collective energy transfer in correlated quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>Correlated dynamics of three-particle bound states induced by emergent impurities in Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states, known as particles tied together and moving as a whole, are profound correlated effects induced by particle-particle interactions. While dimer-monomer bound states are manifested as a single particle attached to dimer bound pair, it is still unclear about quantum walks and Bloch oscillations of dimer-monomer bound states. Here, we revisit three-particle bound states in the Bose-Hubbard model and find that interaction-induced impurities adjacent to bound pair and boundaries cause two kinds of bound states: one is dimer-monomer bound state and the other is bound edge states. In quantum walks, the spread velocity of dimer-monomer bound state is determined by the maximal group velocity of their energy band, which is much smaller than that in the single-particle case. In Bloch oscillations, the period of dimer-monomer bound states is one third of that in the single-particle case. Our works provide new insights to the collective dynamics of three-particle bound states.</description>

      <title>Superfluidity in the spin-1/2 XY model with power-law interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In trapped-ion quantum simulators, effective spin-1/2 XY interactions can be engineered via laser-induced coupling between internal atomic states and collective phonon modes. In the simplest one-dimensional ($1d$) traps, these interactions decay as a power-law with distance $1/r^{\alpha}$, with a tunable exponent $\alpha$. For small $\alpha$, the resulting long-range $1d$ XY model exhibits continuous symmetry breaking, in marked contrast to its nearest neighbor counterpart. In this paper, we examine this model near the phase transition at $\alpha_c$ from the lens of the spin stiffness, or superfluid density. We develop a stochastic series expansion (SSE) quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation and a generalized winding number estimator to measure the superfluid density in the presence of power-law interactions, which we test against exact diagonalization for small lattice sizes. Our results show how conventional superfluidity in the $1d$ XY model is enhanced in the long-range interacting regime. This is observed as a diverging superfluid density as $\alpha \rightarrow 0$ in the thermodynamic limit, which we show is consistent with linear spin-wave theory. Finally, we define a normalized superfluid density estimator that clearly distinguishes the short, medium, and long-range interacting regimes, providing a novel QMC probe of the critical value $\alpha_c$.</description>

      <title>Three-body scattering area of identical bosons in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the wave function $\phi^{(3)}$ of three identical bosons scattering at zero energy, zero total momentum, and zero orbital angular momentum in two dimensions, interacting via short-range potentials with a finite two-body scattering length $a$. We derive asymptotic expansions of $\phi^{(3)}$ in two regimes: the 111-expansion, where all three pairwise distances are large, and the 21-expansion, where one particle is far from the other two. In the 111-expansion, the leading term grows as $\ln^3(B/a)$ at large hyperradius $B=\sqrt{(s_1^2+s_2^2+s_3^2)/2}$. At order $B^{-2}\ln^{-3}(B/a)$, we identify a three-body parameter $D$ with dimension of length squared, which we term the three-body scattering area. This quantity should be contrasted with the three-body scattering area previously studied for infinite or vanishing two-body scattering length. If the two-body interaction is attractive and supports bound states, $D$ acquires a negative imaginary part, and we derive its relation to the probability amplitudes for the production of two-body bound states in three-body collisions. Under weak modifications of the interaction potentials, we derive the corresponding shift of $D$ in terms of $\phi^{(3)}$ and the changes of the two-body and three-body potentials. We also study the effects of $D$ and $\phi^{(3)}$ on three-body and many-body physics, including the three-body ground-state energy in a large periodic volume, the many-body energy and the three-body correlation function of the dilute two-dimensional Bose gas, and the three-body recombination rates of two-dimensional ultracold atomic Bose gases.</description>

      <title>Double-exchange ferromagnetism of fermionic atoms in a $p$-orbital hexagonal lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large class of correlated quantum materials feature strong Hund's coupling. Yet cold-atom quantum simulators have so far focused primarily on single-orbital Fermi-Hubbard systems near a Mott insulator. Here we show that repulsively interacting fermions loaded into the $p$-bands of a hexagonal lattice offer a unique platform to study the interplay of "Hundness" and "Mottness." Our theory predicts that the orbital degrees of freedom, despite geometric frustration, produce a rich phase diagram featuring a competing itinerant ferromagnetic (FM) metal and a spin-1 antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator, with a surprising first-order transition between them controlled by density near half-filling. Ferromagnetism emerges at low fillings from the flat band and persists to stronger interactions and higher fillings via a double-exchange mechanism, where spins align to avoid Hund-rule penalties at the expense of Dirac-fermion kinetic energy. We further argue that the paramagnetic regime is a correlated "Hund metal." $p$-orbital Fermi gases thus provide an ideal experimental setting to investigate competing exchange mechanisms in multi-orbital systems with coexisting localized and itinerant spins.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Instability of the ferromagnetic quantum critical point and symmetry of the ferromagnetic ground state in two-dimensional and three-dimensional electron gases with arbitrary spin-orbit splitting"</title>

Abstract: Metallic quantum ferromagnets in the absence of quenched disorder are known to generically undergo a first-order quantum phase transition, avoiding the quantum critical point that had originally been expected. This is due to soft modes in the underlying Fermi liquid that lead to long-ranged correlations. These correlations in turn yield a nonanalytic dependence of the free energy on the magnetization even at a mean-field level that results in a fluctuation-induced first-order transition. Kirkpatrick and Belitz [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 124}, 147201 (2020)] have pointed out that one notable exception are non-centrosymmetric metals with a strong spin-orbit interaction. In such materials the spin-orbit interaction gives the relevant soft modes a mass, which inhibits the mechanism leading to a first-order transition. Miserev, Loss, and Klinovaja [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 106}, 134417 (2022)] have claimed that this conclusion does not hold if electron-electron interactions in the particle-particle channel, or 2$\kF$ scattering processes, are considered. They concluded that this interaction channel leads to soft modes that are not rendered massive by the spin-orbit interaction and again lead to a first-order quantum phase transition. In this Comment we show that this conclusion is not correct in three-dimensional magnets if the screening of the interaction is properly taken into account.</description>

      <title>Scattering State Theory for One-dimensional Floquet Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Floquet transfer matrix method to solve scattering in extended 1D Floquet lattices, uncovering an underlying conjugate symplectic structure that enforces current conservation across sidebands. By engineering a spatial adiabatic boundary, we suppress multi-channel sideband interference, allowing us to establish a direct mapping between the bulk winding number $C$ and a rigid shift in the transmission energy windows--quantified as $C\hbar\omega$. We further propose two experimental realizations: cold-atom Bragg scattering to directly verify the transmission shift, and surface-acoustic-wave-induced transport demonstrating the quantized zero-bias current plateau.</description>

      <title>A Unified Symmetry Classification of Many-Body Localized Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization admits a complete symmetry classification given by the Altland-Zirnbauer (AZ) tenfold scheme, whereas an analogous framework for interacting many-body localization (MBL) has remained elusive. Here we develop a symmetry-based classification of static MBL phases formulated at the level of local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We show that a symmetry is compatible with stable MBL if and only if its action can be consistently represented within a quasi-local LIOM algebra, without enforcing extensive degeneracies or nonlocal operator mixing. This criterion sharply distinguishes symmetry classes: onsite Abelian symmetries are compatible with stable MBL and can host distinct symmetry-protected topological MBL phases, whereas continuous non-Abelian symmetries generically preclude stable MBL. By systematically combining AZ symmetries with additional onsite symmetries, we construct a complete classification table of MBL phases, identify stable, fragile, and unstable classes, and provide representative lattice realizations. Our results establish a unified and physically transparent framework for understanding symmetry constraints on MBL.</description>

Abstract: We present a two-tone heterodyne optical readout scheme to extract unequal-time density correlations along an arbitrary stationary interaction path from a pancake-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate, using a modulated laser probe. Analysing the measurement noise both from imprecision and backaction, we identify the standard quantum limit for the signal-extraction scheme, and examine how a class of two-mode squeezed initial states can be used to push beyond this limit. As an application, we show how the readout scheme can be used for an experimentally feasible realisation of acceleration-dependence of quantum-vacuum fluctuations in the system, including the analogue spacetime circular motion Unruh effect. The scheme is adaptable beyond Bose-Einstein condensates, providing nondestructive access to unequal-time correlations in quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>Gap solitons of the Wannier and Bloch types in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with a moir\'{e} lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gap solitons (GSs) bifurcating from flat bands, which may be represented in terms of Wannier functions, have garnered significant interest due to their strong localization with extremely small norms. Moir\'{e} lattices (MLs), with multiple flat bands, offer an appropriate platform for creating such solitons. We explore the formation mechanism and stability of GSs in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates under the combined action of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and an ML potential. We identify five Wannier-type GS families bifurcating from the lowest five energy bands in the spectrum induced by the ML with sufficiently large period and depth. These fundamental GSs serve as basic elements for constructing more complex Wannier-type GS states. Reducing the lattice period and depth triggers a transition from the Wannier-type GSs to ones of the Bloch type, the latter exhibiting higher norm thresholds and pronounced spatial broadening near edges of the energy bands. In addition to tuning the lattice-potential parameters, adjusting the SOC strength can also modulate the flatness of energy bands and enhance the localization of gap solitons, enabling reversible transitions between the GSs of the Wannier and Bloch types. Distinctive properties of GSs in the quasiperiodic ML are uncovered too. Thus, we propose the theoretical foundation for the creation of and manipulations with strongly localized GSs.</description>

      <title>Observation of emergent scaling of spin-charge correlations at the onset of the pseudogap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In strongly correlated materials, interacting electrons are entangled and form collective quantum states, resulting in rich low-temperature phase diagrams. Notable examples include cuprate superconductors, in which superconductivity emerges at low doping out of an unusual "pseudogap" metallic state above the critical temperature. The Fermi-Hubbard model, describing a wide range of phenomena associated with strong electron correlations, still offers major computational challenges despite its simple formulation. In this context, ultracold atoms quantum simulators have provided invaluable insights into the microscopic nature of correlated quantum states. Here, we use a quantum gas microscope Fermi-Hubbard simulator to explore a wide range of dopings and temperatures in a regime where a pseudogap is known to develop. By measuring multi-point correlation functions up to fifth order, we uncover a novel universal scaling behaviour in magnetic and higher-order spin-charge correlations characterised by a doping-dependent temperature scale. Accurate comparisons with determinant Quantum Monte Carlo and Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States simulations confirm that this temperature scale is comparable to the pseudogap temperature T*. Our quantitative findings reveal a novel qualitative behaviour of magnetic properties and spin-charge correlations in an emergent pseudogap and pave the way towards the exploration of charge pairing and collective phenomena expected at lower temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02912v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for extracting non-polynomial analytic functions of density matrices in randomized measurement experiments by a method of analytical continuation. A central advantage of this approach, dubbed stabilized analytic continuation (SAC), is its robustness to statistical noise arising from finite repetitions of a quantum experiment, making it well-suited to realistic quantum hardware. As a demonstration, we use SAC to estimate the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a numerically simulated quenched N\'eel state from R\'enyi entropies estimated via the randomized measurement protocol. We then apply the method to experimental R\'enyi data from a trapped-ion quantum simulator, extracting subsystem von Neumann entropies at different evolution times. Finally, we briefly note that the SAC framework is readily generalizable to obtain other nonlinear diagnostics, such as the logarithmic negativity and R\'enyi relative entropies.</description>

      <title>Scalable Spin Squeezing in Power-Law Interacting XXZ Models with Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While spin squeezing has been traditionally considered in all-to-all interacting models, recent works have shown that it can also occur in systems with power-law interactions, enabling direct tests in Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, ultracold atoms, and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. For the latter, Wu et al. Nature 646 (2025) demonstrated that spin squeezing is heavily affected by positional disorder, reducing any capacity for a practical squeezing advantage, which requires scalability with the system size. In this Letter we explore the robustness of spin squeezing in two-dimensional lattices with a fraction of unoccupied lattice sites. Using semiclassical modeling, we demonstrate the existence of scalable squeezing in power-law interacting XXZ models up to a disorder threshold, above which squeezing is not scalable. We produce a phase diagram for scalable squeezing, and explain its absence in the aforementioned NV experiment. Our work illustrates the maximum disorder allowed for realizing scalable spin squeezing in a host of quantum simulators, highlights a regime with substantial tolerance to disorder, and identifies controlled defect creation as a promising route for scalable squeezing in solid-state systems.</description>

Abstract: We report the creation of optically trapped ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules in a mixture of 23Na and 87Rb atoms. With loss spectroscopy and binding energy measurements, we systematically characterize the interspecies p-wave Feshbach resonances near 284 G. Leveraging this understanding, we use magneto-association to form p-wave NaRb Feshbach molecules, producing both pure samples and mixtures of molecules in different angular momentum states. Additionally, we investigate the inelastic loss of these molecules, primarily influenced by atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collisions. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing tunable p-wave interactions in heteronuclear ultracold systems and provide a foundation for exploring non-zero angular momentum molecules.</description>
