      <title>Scattering theory for $C^2$ long-range potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a complete stationary scattering theory for Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb R^d$, $d\ge 2$, with $C^2$ long-range potentials. This extends former results in the literature, in particular [Is1, Is2, II, GY], which all require a higher degree of smoothness. In this sense the spirit of our paper is similar to [H\"o2, Chapter XXX], which also develops a scattering theory under the $C^2$ condition, however being very different from ours. While the Agmon-H\"ormander theory is based on the Fourier transform, our theory is not and may be seen as more related to our previous approach to scattering theory on manifolds [IS1,IS2,IS3]. The $C^2$ regularity is natural in the Agmon-H\"ormander theory as well as in our theory, in fact probably being `optimal' in the Euclidean setting. We prove equivalence of the stationary and time-dependent theories by giving stationary representations of associated time-dependent wave operators. Furthermore we develop a related stationary scattering theory at fixed energy in terms of asymptotics of generalized eigenfunctions of minimal growth. A basic ingredient of our approach is a solution to the eikonal equation constructed from the geometric variational scheme of [CS]. Another key ingredient is strong radiation condition bounds for the limiting resolvents originating in [HS]. They improve formerly known ones [Is1, Sa] and considerably simplify the stationary approach. We obtain the bounds by a new commutator scheme whose elementary form allows a small degree of smoothness.</description>

      <title>A generalization of the Choi isomorphism with application to open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Completely positive transformations play an important role in the description of state changes in quantum mechanics, including the time evolution of open quantum systems. One useful tool to describe them is the so-called Choi isomorphism, which maps completely positive transformations to positive semi-definite matrices. Accordingly, there are numerous proposals to generalize the Choi isomorphism. In the present paper, we show that the 1976 paper of Gorini, Kossakowski and Sudarshan (GKS) already holds the key for a further generalization and study the resulting GKS isomorphism. As an application, we compute the GKS matrix of the time evolution of a general open quantum system up to second order in time.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial proof of a Non-Renormalization Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a direct combinatorial proof of a Feynman graph identity which implies a wide generalization of a formality theorem by Kontsevich. For a Feynman graph $\Gamma$, we associate to each vertex a position $x_v \in \mathbb R$ and to each edge $e$ the combination $s_e = a_e^{-\frac 12} \left( x^+_e - x^-_e \right)$, where $x^\pm_e$ are the positions of the two end vertices of $e$ and $a_e$ a Schwinger parameter. The $``$topological propagator$"$ $P_e = e^{-s_e^2}$d$s_e$ includes a part proportional to d$x_v$ and a part proportional to d$a_e$. Integrating the product of all $P_e$ over positions produces a differential form $\alpha_\Gamma$ in the variables $a_e$. We prove that $\alpha_\Gamma \wedge \alpha_\Gamma=0$.</description>

      <title>Thermal One-point Functions and Their Partial Wave Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we address partial wave decompositions of thermal one-point functions in conformal field theories on $S^1 \times S^{d-1}$. With the help of Casimir differential equations we develop efficient algorithms to compute the relevant conformal blocks for an external field of arbitrary spin and with any spin exchange along the thermal circle, at least in three dimensions. This is achieved by identifying solutions to the Casimir equations with a special class of spherical functions in the harmonic analysis of the conformal group. The resulting blocks are then applied to study the decomposition of one-point functions of the scalar $\phi^2$ and the stress tensor $T$ for a three-dimensional free scalar field $\phi$. We are able to read off averaged OPE coefficients into exchanged fields of high weight and spin for a complete set of tensor structures. We also extract an asymptotic behaviour of conformal blocks and use it to analyse the density of heavy-heavy-light OPE coefficients for spinning operators, comparing it with semi-classical predictions, such as the dimensions of operators at large charge.</description>

      <title>A critical reassessment of "Restricted Weyl Symmetry"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A class of globally scale-invariant scalar-tensor theories have been proposed to be invariant under a larger class of transformations that take the form of local Weyl transformations supplemented by a restriction that the conformal factor satisfies a covariant Klein-Gordon equation. The action of these theories indeed seems to be invariant under such transformations up to boundary terms, this property being referred to as "restricted Weyl symmetry". However, we find that corresponding equations of motion are not invariant under these transformations. This is a paradox, that is explained by realizing that the restriction condition on the conformal factor forces the "restricted Weyl transformation" to be a nonlocal transformation. For nonlocal transformations would-be boundary terms cannot in general be discarded from the action. Moreover, variations of trajectories cannot be assumed to vanish at boundaries of the action when deriving equations of motion. We illustrate both of these less known properties by considering a series of simple examples. Finally, we apply these observations to the case of globally scale-invariant scalar-tensor theories to demonstrate that "restricted Weyl transformations" are, in fact, not symmetries of the full system.</description>

      <title>Spectral statistics of the Laplacian on random covers of a closed negatively curved surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,g)$ be a closed, connected surface, with variable negative curvature. We consider the distribution of eigenvalues of the Laplacian on random covers $X_n\to X$ of degree $n$. We focus on the ensemble variance of the smoothed number of eigenvalues of the square root of the positive Laplacian $\sqrt{\Delta}$ in windows $[\lambda-\frac 1L,\lambda+\frac 1L]$, over the set of $n$-sheeted covers of $X$. We first take the limit of large degree $n\to +\infty$, then we let the energy $\lambda$ go to $+\infty$ while the window size $\frac 1L$ goes to $0$. In this ad hoc limit, local energy averages of the variance converge to an expression corresponding to the variance of the same statistic when considering instead spectra of large random matrices of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). By twisting the Laplacian with unitary representations, we are able to observe different statistics, corresponding to the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) when time reversal symmetry is broken. These results were shown by F. Naud for the model of random covers of a hyperbolic surface.
  For an individual cover $X_n\to X$, we consider spectral fluctuations of the counting function on $X_n$ around the ensemble average. In the large energy regime, for a typical cover $X_n\to X$ of large degree, these fluctuations are shown to approach the GOE result, a phenomenon called ergodicity in Random Matrix Theory. An analogous result for random covers of hyperbolic surfaces was obtained by Y. Maoz.</description>

      <title>Categorical generalization of BF theory coupled to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a thorough introduction to the tools of category theory required for formulating gauge theories based on 2-connections. We provide a detailed construction of the categorical generalization of BF theory, dubbed BFCG, also known as 2BF. Similar to BF gravity, it is known that BFCG can be deformed to give general relativity. Here, we obtain an alternative relation between BFCG and gravity, which consists of coupling general relativity and BFCG by means of the volume form constructed out of the BFCG connections. The resulting theory, closely related to unimodular gravity, is a generalization of BF sequestered gravity not only in the sense that it adds new fields but also in that it allows for new choices for the volume form that is coupled to gravity. Furthermore, we show that BF sequestered gravity in the abelian case is recovered for a specific choice of the 2-group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Quantum Energy Teleportation protocol within the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics. By employing the Wigner quasi-probability distribution and the star product, we show that the teleported energy is proportional to the amount of entanglement present in the initial ground state. Further, we introduce the Husimi $Q$-function on a Bloch coherent state in order to determine the Wehrl entropy of the system. Finally, the Wherl entropy enable us to compute the consumption of coherence and entanglement throughout the protocol.</description>

      <title>On the application of Lorentz-Finsler geometry to model wave propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent increasing interest in the study of Lorentz-Finsler geometry has led to several applications to model real-world physical phenomena. Our purpose is to provide a simple, step-by-step review on how to build and implement such a geometric model to describe the propagation of a classical wave satisfying Fermat's and Huygens' principles in an anisotropic and rheonomic (time-dependent) medium. The model is based on identifying the individual wave trajectories as lightlike pregeodesics of a specific Lorentz-Finsler metric, which obey a simple ODE system and can therefore be easily computed in real time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the enumeration problem of a special kind of branched coverings of the Riemann sphere, whose partition function can be regarded as a generalization of the dessin partition function. First we derive a cut-and-join type representation for the generalized dessin partition function using the actions of $W$-type operators on Schur functions. Then we study the polynomial structures of the generalized dessin partition function. We prove a polynomial structure for the disconnected correlators which generalizes a result of Stanley, and then propose a conjectural polynomial structure for the connected correlators. We prove the $1$-point case of this conjecture using the KP integrability of this partition function.</description>

      <title>Low energy resolvent asymptotics of the multipole Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute low energy asymptotics for the resolvent of the Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonian with multiple poles for both integer and non-integer total fluxes. For integral total flux we reduce to prior results in black-box scattering while for non-integral total flux we build on the corresponding techniques using an appropriately chosen model resolvent. The resolvent expansion can be used to obtain long-time wave asymptotics for the Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonian with multiple poles. An interesting phenomenon is that if the total flux is an integer then the scattering resembles even-dimensional Euclidean scattering, while if it is half an odd integer then it resembles odd-dimensional Euclidean scattering. The behavior for other values of total flux thus provides an `interpolation' between these.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a new class of plane billiards - the `pensive billiard' - in which the billiard ball travels along the boundary for some distance depending on the incidence angle before reflecting, while preserving the billiard rule of equality of the angles of incidence and reflection. This generalizes so called `puck billiards' proposed by M.Bialy, as well as a `vortex billiard', i.e. the motion of a point vortex dipole in 2D hydrodynamics on domains with boundary. We prove the variational origin and invariance of a symplectic structure for pensive billiards, as well as study their properties including conditions for a twist map, the existence of periodic orbits, etc. We also demonstrate the appearance of both the golden and silver ratios in the corresponding hydrodynamical vortex setting. Finally, we introduce and describe basic properties of pensive outer billiards.</description>

Abstract: Causal systems describe the localizability of relativistic quantum systems complying with the principles of special relativity and elementary causality. At their classification we restrict ourselves to real mass and finite spinor systems. It follows that (up to certain not yet discarded unitarily related systems) the only irreducible causal systems are the Dirac and the Weyl fermions. Their wave-equations are established as a mere consequence of causal localization. - The bounded localized Dirac and Weyl wavefunctions are studied in detail. One finds that, at the speed of light, the carriers shrink in the past and expand in the future. For every direction in space there is a definite time at which the change from shrinking to expanding occurs. A late changing time characterizes those states, which shrink to a delta-strip if boosted in the opposite direction. Using a density result for these late-change states one shows that all Dirac and Weyl wave-functions are subjected to Lorentz contraction. The latter is discussed in some detail. - We tackle the question whether a causal system induces a representation of a causal logic and thus provides a localization in proper space-time regions rather than on spacelike hyperplanes. The causal logic generated by the spacelike relation is shown to do not admit representations at all. But the logic generated by the non-timelike relation in general does, and the necessary condition is derived that there is a projection valued measure on every non-timelike non-spacelike hyperplane being the high boost limit of the localization on the spacelike hyperplanes. Dirac and Weyl systems are shown to satisfy this condition and thus to extend to all non-timelike hyperplanes, which implies more profound properties of the causal systems. The bounded localized eigenstates of the projections to non-spacelike flat strips are late-change states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14205v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the mean field Ising model from a geometric perspective, focusing on the thermodynamic limit. When the number of spins is finite, the Gibbs equilibria form a smooth Legendrian submanifold in the thermodynamic phase space whose points describe the stable macroscopic states of the system. We describe the convergence of these smooth Legendrian submanifolds, as the number of spins goes to infinity, to a singular Legendrian submanifold, admitting an analytic continuation that contains both the stable and metastable states. We also discuss the relaxation to a Gibbs equilibrium when the physical parameters are changed abruptly. The relaxation is defined via the gradient flow of the free energy with respect to the Wasserstein metric on microscopic states, that is, in the geometric language, via the gradient flow of the generating function of the equilibrium Legendrian with respect to the ghost variables. This leads to a discrete Fokker-Planck equation when the number of spins is finite. We show that in the thermodynamic limit this description is closely related to the seminal model of relaxation proposed by Glauber. Finally, we find a special range of parameters where such relaxation happens instantaneously, along the Reeb chords connecting the initial and the terminal Legendrian submanifolds.</description>

Abstract: We study the Laurent property, the irreducibility and the coprimeness for lattice equations (partial difference equations), mainly focusing on how the choice of initial value problem (the choice of domain) affects these properties. We show that these properties do not depend on the choice of domain as long as they are considered together. In other words, these properties are inherent to a difference equation. Applying our result, we discuss the reductions of lattice equations.

      <description>arXiv:2102.13528v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a compact, boundaryless, Riemannian manifold whose geodesic flow on its unit sphere bundle is Anosov. Consider the (semiclassical) Laplace-Beltrami operator on $M$. Let $\epsilon &gt;0$.
  We study the semiclassical measures $\mu_{sc}$ of quasimodes spectrally supported in intervals of width $\epsilon \frac{h}{|\log h|}$, a critical-type regime when considering ``delocalization". We derive a lower bound for the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of $\mu_{sc}$ that depends explicitly on $\epsilon$, in the spirit of that given by Ananthamaran-Koch-Nonnenmacher.</description>

      <title>A general model for wildfire propagation with wind and slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.03364v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A geometric model for the computation of the firefront of a forest wildfire which takes into account several effects (possibly time-dependent wind, anisotropies and slope of the ground) is introduced. It relies on a general theoretical framework, which reduces the hyperbolic PDE system of any wave to an ODE in a Lorentz-Finsler framework. The wind induces a sort of double semi-elliptical fire growth, while the influence of the slope is modeled by means of a term which comes from the Matsumoto metric (i.e., the standard non-reversible Finsler metric that measures the time when going up and down a hill). These contributions make a significant difference from previous models because, now, the infinitesimal wavefronts are not restricted to be elliptical. Even though this is a technical complication, the wavefronts remain computable in real time. Some simulations of evolution are shown, paying special attention to possible crossovers of the fire.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the hyper-K\"ahler moduli space of framed monopoles over $\mathbb{R}^3$ for any connected, simply connected, compact, semisimple Lie group and arbitrary mass and charge, and hence symmetry breaking. In order to do so, we define a configuration space of pairs with appropriate asymptotic conditions and perform an infinite-dimensional quotient construction. We make use of the b and scattering calculuses to study the relevant differential operators.</description>

      <title>Postselected communication over quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The single-letter characterisation of the entanglement-assisted capacity of a quantum channel is one of the seminal results of quantum information theory. In this paper, we consider a modified communication scenario in which the receiver is allowed an additional, `inconclusive' measurement outcome, and we employ an error metric given by the error probability in decoding the transmitted message conditioned on a conclusive measurement result. We call this setting postselected communication and the ensuing highest achievable rates the postselected capacities. Here, we provide a precise single-letter characterisation of postselected capacities in the setting of entanglement assistance as well as the more general nonsignalling assistance, establishing that they are both equal to the channel's projective mutual information -- a variant of mutual information based on the Hilbert projective metric. We do so by establishing bounds on the one-shot postselected capacities, with a lower bound that makes use of a postselected teleportation-based protocol and an upper bound in terms of the postselected hypothesis testing relative entropy. As such, we obtain fundamental limits on a channel's ability to communicate even when this strong resource of postselection is allowed, implying limitations on communication even when the receiver has access to postselected closed timelike curves.</description>

      <title>Defect groups of class $\mathcal{S}$ theories from the Coulomb branch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the global forms of class $\mathcal{S}[A_{N-1}]$ 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ theories by deriving their defect groups (charges of line operators up to screening by local operators) from Coulomb branch data. Specifically, we employ an explicit construction of the BPS quiver for the case of full regular punctures to show that the defect group is $(\mathbb{Z}_N)^{2g}$, where $g$ is the genus of the associated Riemann surface. This determines a sector of surface operators in the 5d symmetry TFT. We show how these can also be identified from dimensional reduction of M-theory.</description>

      <title>Resurgence of Refined Topological Strings and Dual Partition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the resurgent structure of the refined topological string partition function on a non-compact Calabi-Yau threefold, at large orders in the string coupling constant $g_s$ and fixed refinement parameter $\mathsf{b}$. For $\mathsf{b}\neq 1$, the Borel transform admits two families of simple poles, corresponding to integral periods rescaled by $\mathsf{b}$ and $1/\mathsf{b}$. We show that the corresponding Stokes automorphism is expressed in terms of a generalization of the non-compact quantum dilogarithm, and we conjecture that the Stokes constants are determined by the refined Donaldson-Thomas invariants counting spin-$j$ BPS states. This jump in the refined topological string partition function is a special case (unit five-brane charge) of a more general transformation property of wave functions on quantum twisted tori introduced in earlier work by two of the authors. We show that this property follows from the transformation of a suitable refined dual partition function across BPS rays, defined by extending the Moyal star product to the realm of contact geometry.</description>

      <title>Generalized Models for Inflationary Preheating: Oscillations and Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paradigm of the inflationary universe provides a possible explanation for several observed cosmological properties. In order for such solutions to be successful, the universe must convert the energy stored in the inflaton potential into standard model particles through a process known as reheating. In this paper, we reconsider the reheating process for the case where the inflaton potential respects an approximate (but spontaneously broken) conformal symmetry during the reheating epoch. After reviewing the Effective Field Theory of Reheating, we present solutions for the nonlinear oscillations of the inflaton field, derive the corresponding Hill's equation for the coupled reheating field, and determine the stability diagram for parametric resonance. For this class of models -- the simplest realization being a scalar field with a quartic term -- the expansion of the universe drives the coupled field toward a more unstable part of parameter space, in contrast to the standard case. We also generalize this class of models to include quadratic breaking terms in the potential during the reheating epoch and address the process of stability in that universality class of models.</description>

      <title>The noisy Landau-Streater(Werner-Holevo) channel in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07700v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two important classes of quantum channels, namly the Werner-Holevo and the Landau-Streater channels are known to be related only in three dimensions, i.e. when acting on qutrits. In this work, definition of the Landau-Streater channel is extended in such a way which retains its equivalence to the Werner-Holevo channel in all dimensions. This channel is then modified to be representable as a model of noise acting on qudits. We then investigate propeties of the resulting noisy channel and determine the conditions under which it cannot be the result of a Markovian evolution. Furthermore, we investigate its different capacities for transmitting classical and quantum information with or without entanglement. In particular, while the pure (or high noise) Landau-Streater or the Werner-Holevo channel is entanglement breaking and hence has zero capacity, by finding a lower bound for the quantum capacity, we show that when the level of noise is lower than a critical value the quantum capacity will be non-zero. Surprizingly this value turns out to be approximately equal to $0.4$ in all dimensions. Finally we show that, in even dimension, this channel has a decomposition in terms of unitary operations. This is in contrast with the three dimensional case where it has been proved that such a decomposition is impossible, even in terms of other quantum maps.</description>

      <title>Spinoptics in a curved spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study propagation of the high frequency electromagnetic waves in a curved spacetime. We discuss a so call spinoptics approach which generalizes a well known geometric optics approximation and allows one to take into account spin-dependent corrections. A new element proposed in this work is the use of effective action which allows one to derive spinoptics equations. This method is simpler and more transparent than the earlier proposed methods. It is explicitly covariant and can be applied to an arbitrary spacetime background. We also demonstrate how the initial value problem for the high frequency electromagnetiv wave can be soled in the developed spinoptics approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, Lie symmetry analysis method is applied to the (2+1)-dimensional time fractional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation with the mixed derivative of Riemann-Liouville time-fractional derivative and integer-order $x$-derivative. We obtained all the Lie symmetries admitted by the KP equation and used them to reduce the (2+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equation with Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative to some (1+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equations with Erd\'{e}lyi-Kober fractional derivative or Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, thereby getting some exact solutions of the reduced equations. In addition, the new conservation theorem and the generalization of Noether operators are developed to construct the conservation laws for the equation studied.</description>

      <title>Gibbs Sampling gives Quantum Advantage at Constant Temperatures with $O(1)$-Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from Gibbs states $\unicode{x2013}$ states corresponding to system in thermal equilibrium $\unicode{x2013}$ has recently been shown to be a task for which quantum computers are expected to achieve super-polynomial speed-up compared to classical computers, provided the locality of the Hamiltonian increases with the system size (Bergamaschi et al., arXiv: 2404.14639). We extend these results to show that this quantum advantage still occurs for Gibbs states of Hamiltonians with O(1)-local interactions at constant temperature by showing classical hardness-of-sampling and demonstrating such Gibbs states can be prepared efficiently using a quantum computer. In particular, we show hardness-of-sampling is maintained even for 5-local Hamiltonians on a 3D lattice. We additionally show that the hardness-of-sampling is robust when we are only able to make imperfect measurements. Beyond these hardness results, we present a lower bound on the temperatures that Gibbs states become easy to sample from classically in terms of the maximum degree of the Hamiltonian's interaction graph.</description>
