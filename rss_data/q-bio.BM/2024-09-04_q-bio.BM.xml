      <title>Integrating Latent Variable and Auto-Regressive Models for Goal-directed Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: De novo molecule design has become a highly active research area, advanced significantly through the use of state-of-the-art generative models. Despite these advances, several fundamental questions remain unanswered as the field increasingly focuses on more complex generative models and sophisticated molecular representations as an answer to the challenges of drug design. In this paper, we return to the simplest representation of molecules, and investigate overlooked limitations of classical generative approaches, particularly Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and auto-regressive models. We propose a hybrid model in the form of a novel regularizer that leverages the strengths of both to improve validity, conditional generation, and style transfer of molecular sequences. Additionally, we provide an in depth discussion of overlooked assumptions of these models' behaviour.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Prediction of Protein-Polyelectrolyte Binding Thermodynamics: Adsorption of Heparin-Analog Polysulfates to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein RBD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions of polyelectrolytes (PEs) with proteins play a crucial role in numerous biological processes, such as the internalization of virus particles into host cells. Although docking, machine learning methods, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are utilized to estimate binding poses and binding free energies of small-molecule drugs to proteins, quantitative prediction of the binding thermodynamics of PE-based drugs presents a significant obstacle in computer-aided drug design. This is due to the sluggish dynamics of PEs caused by their size and strong charge-charge correlations. In this paper, we introduce advanced sampling methods based on a force-spectroscopy setup and theoretical modeling to overcome this barrier. We exemplify our method with explicit solvent all-atom MD simulations of interactions of anionic PEs that show antiviral properties, namely heparin and linear polyglycerol sulfate (LPGS), with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Our prediction for the binding free energy of LPGS to the wild-type RBD matches experimentally measured dissociation constants within thermal energy, kT, and correctly reproduces the experimental PE-length dependence. We find that LPGS binds to the Delta-variant RBD with an additional free-energy gain of 2.4 kT, compared to the wild-type RBD, in accord with electrostatic arguments. We show that the LPGS-RBD binding is solvent-dominated and enthalpy-driven, though with a large entropy-enthalpy compensation. Our method is applicable to general polymer adsorption phenomena and predicts precise binding free energies and re-configurational friction as needed for drug and drug-delivery design.</description>

      <title>Beyond Efficiency: Molecular Data Pruning for Enhanced Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the emergence of various molecular tasks and massive datasets, how to perform efficient training has become an urgent yet under-explored issue in the area. Data pruning (DP), as an oft-stated approach to saving training burdens, filters out less influential samples to form a coreset for training. However, the increasing reliance on pretrained models for molecular tasks renders traditional in-domain DP methods incompatible. Therefore, we propose a Molecular data Pruning framework for enhanced Generalization (MolPeg), which focuses on the source-free data pruning scenario, where data pruning is applied with pretrained models. By maintaining two models with different updating paces during training, we introduce a novel scoring function to measure the informativeness of samples based on the loss discrepancy. As a plug-and-play framework, MolPeg realizes the perception of both source and target domain and consistently outperforms existing DP methods across four downstream tasks. Remarkably, it can surpass the performance obtained from full-dataset training, even when pruning up to 60-70% of the data on HIV and PCBA dataset. Our work suggests that the discovery of effective data-pruning metrics could provide a viable path to both enhanced efficiency and superior generalization in transfer learning.</description>

      <title>From Static to Dynamic Structures: Improving Binding Affinity Prediction with Graph-Based Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10230v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities is an essential challenge in structure-based drug design. Despite recent advances in data-driven methods for affinity prediction, their accuracy is still limited, partially because they only take advantage of static crystal structures while the actual binding affinities are generally determined by the thermodynamic ensembles between proteins and ligands. One effective way to approximate such a thermodynamic ensemble is to use molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Here, an MD dataset containing 3,218 different protein-ligand complexes is curated, and Dynaformer, a graph-based deep learning model is further developed to predict the binding affinities by learning the geometric characteristics of the protein-ligand interactions from the MD trajectories. In silico experiments demonstrated that the model exhibits state-of-the-art scoring and ranking power on the CASF-2016 benchmark dataset, outperforming the methods hitherto reported. Moreover, in a virtual screening on heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) using Dynaformer, 20 candidates are identified and their binding affinities are further experimentally validated. Dynaformer displayed promising results in virtual drug screening, revealing 12 hit compounds (two are in the submicromolar range), including several novel scaffolds. Overall, these results demonstrated that the approach offer a promising avenue for accelerating the early drug discovery process.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Scalar Fields for Molecular Docking with Fast Fourier Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular docking is critical to structure-based virtual screening, yet the throughput of such workflows is limited by the expensive optimization of scoring functions involved in most docking algorithms. We explore how machine learning can accelerate this process by learning a scoring function with a functional form that allows for more rapid optimization. Specifically, we define the scoring function to be the cross-correlation of multi-channel ligand and protein scalar fields parameterized by equivariant graph neural networks, enabling rapid optimization over rigid-body degrees of freedom with fast Fourier transforms. The runtime of our approach can be amortized at several levels of abstraction, and is particularly favorable for virtual screening settings with a common binding pocket. We benchmark our scoring functions on two simplified docking-related tasks: decoy pose scoring and rigid conformer docking. Our method attains similar but faster performance on crystal structures compared to the widely-used Vina and Gnina scoring functions, and is more robust on computationally predicted structures.

      <title>AlphaFold Meets Flow Matching for Generating Protein Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The biological functions of proteins often depend on dynamic structural ensembles. In this work, we develop a flow-based generative modeling approach for learning and sampling the conformational landscapes of proteins. We repurpose highly accurate single-state predictors such as AlphaFold and ESMFold and fine-tune them under a custom flow matching framework to obtain sequence-conditoned generative models of protein structure called AlphaFlow and ESMFlow. When trained and evaluated on the PDB, our method provides a superior combination of precision and diversity compared to AlphaFold with MSA subsampling. When further trained on ensembles from all-atom MD, our method accurately captures conformational flexibility, positional distributions, and higher-order ensemble observables for unseen proteins. Moreover, our method can diversify a static PDB structure with faster wall-clock convergence to certain equilibrium properties than replicate MD trajectories, demonstrating its potential as a proxy for expensive physics-based simulations.

      <title>Target-Specific De Novo Peptide Binder Design with DiffPepBuilder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the exciting progress in target-specific de novo protein binder design, peptide binder design remains challenging due to the flexibility of peptide structures and the scarcity of protein-peptide complex structure data. In this study, we curated a large synthetic dataset, referred to as PepPC-F, from the abundant protein-protein interface data and developed DiffPepBuilder, a de novo target-specific peptide binder generation method that utilizes an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model trained on PepPC-F to co-design peptide sequences and structures. DiffPepBuilder also introduces disulfide bonds to stabilize the generated peptide structures. We tested DiffPepBuilder on 30 experimentally verified strong peptide binders with available protein-peptide complex structures. DiffPepBuilder was able to effectively recall the native structures and sequences of the peptide ligands and to generate novel peptide binders with improved binding free energy. We subsequently conducted de novo generation case studies on three targets. In both the regeneration test and case studies, DiffPepBuilder outperformed AfDesign and RFdiffusion coupled with ProteinMPNN, in terms of sequence and structure recall, interface quality, and structural diversity. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the introduction of disulfide bonds enhanced the structural rigidity and binding performance of the generated peptides. As a general peptide binder de novo design tool, DiffPepBuilder can be used to design peptide binders for given protein targets with three dimensional and binding site information.</description>

      <title>Barlow Twins Deep Neural Network for Advanced 1D Drug-Target Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target interactions is critical for advancing drug discovery. By reducing time and cost, machine learning and deep learning can accelerate this laborious discovery process. In a novel approach, BarlowDTI, we utilise the powerful Barlow Twins architecture for feature-extraction while considering the structure of the target protein. Our method achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance against multiple established benchmarks using only one-dimensional input. The use of gradient boosting machine as the underlying predictor ensures fast and efficient predictions without the need for substantial computational resources. We also investigate how the model reaches its decision based on individual training samples. By comparing co-crystal structures, we find that BarlowDTI effectively exploits catalytically active and stabilising residues, highlighting the model's ability to generalise from one-dimensional input data. In addition, we further benchmark new baselines against existing methods. Together, these innovations improve the efficiency and effectiveness of drug-target interaction predictions, providing robust tools for accelerating drug development and deepening the understanding of molecular interactions. Therefore, we provide an easy-to-use web interface that can be freely accessed at https://www.bio.nat.tum.de/oc2/barlowdti .</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Active Learning with GFlowNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last decades, the capacity to generate large amounts of data in science and engineering applications has been growing steadily. Meanwhile, machine learning has progressed to become a suitable tool to process and utilise the available data. Nonetheless, many relevant scientific and engineering problems present challenges where current machine learning methods cannot yet efficiently leverage the available data and resources. For example, in scientific discovery, we are often faced with the problem of exploring very large, structured and high-dimensional spaces. Moreover, the high fidelity, black-box objective function is often very expensive to evaluate. Progress in machine learning methods that can efficiently tackle such challenges would help accelerate currently crucial areas such as drug and materials discovery. In this paper, we propose a multi-fidelity active learning algorithm with GFlowNets as a sampler, to efficiently discover diverse, high-scoring candidates where multiple approximations of the black-box function are available at lower fidelity and cost. Our evaluation on molecular discovery tasks shows that multi-fidelity active learning with GFlowNets can discover high-scoring candidates at a fraction of the budget of its single-fidelity counterpart while maintaining diversity, unlike RL-based alternatives. These results open new avenues for multi-fidelity active learning to accelerate scientific discovery and engineering design.</description>

      <title>ApisTox: a new benchmark dataset for the classification of small molecules toxicity on honey bees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global decline in bee populations poses significant risks to agriculture, biodiversity, and environmental stability. To bridge the gap in existing data, we introduce ApisTox, a comprehensive dataset focusing on the toxicity of pesticides to honey bees (Apis mellifera). This dataset combines and leverages data from existing sources such as ECOTOX and PPDB, providing an extensive, consistent, and curated collection that surpasses the previous datasets. ApisTox incorporates a wide array of data, including toxicity levels for chemicals, details such as time of their publication in literature, and identifiers linking them to external chemical databases. This dataset may serve as an important tool for environmental and agricultural research, but also can support the development of policies and practices aimed at minimizing harm to bee populations. Finally, ApisTox offers a unique resource for benchmarking molecular property prediction methods on agrochemical compounds, facilitating advancements in both environmental science and cheminformatics. This makes it a valuable tool for both academic research and practical applications in bee conservation.</description>

      <title>Force-Guided Bridge Matching for Full-Atom Time-Coarsened Dynamics of Peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are irreplaceable and ubiquitous in fields of materials science, chemistry, pharmacology just to name a few. Conventional MD simulations are plagued by numerical stability as well as long equilibration time issues, which limits broader applications of MD simulations. Recently, a surge of deep learning approaches have been devised for time-coarsened dynamics, which learns the state transition mechanism over much larger time scales to overcome these limitations. However, only a few methods target the underlying Boltzmann distribution by resampling techniques, where proposals are rarely accepted as new states with low efficiency. In this work, we propose a force-guided bridge matching model, FBM, a novel framework that first incorporates physical priors into bridge matching for full-atom time-coarsened dynamics. With the guidance of our well-designed intermediate force field, FBM is feasible to target the Boltzmann-like distribution by direct inference without extra steps. Experiments on small peptides verify our superiority in terms of comprehensive metrics and demonstrate transferability to unseen peptide systems.</description>
