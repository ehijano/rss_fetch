      <title>Fast Whole-Brain MR Multi-Parametric Mapping with Scan-Specific Self-Supervised Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantification of tissue parameters using MRI is emerging as a powerful tool in clinical diagnosis and research studies. The need for multiple long scans with different acquisition parameters prohibits quantitative MRI from reaching widespread adoption in routine clinical and research exams. Accelerated parameter mapping techniques leverage parallel imaging, signal modelling and deep learning to offer more practical quantitative MRI acquisitions. However, the achievable acceleration and the quality of maps are often limited. Joint MAPLE is a recent state-of-the-art multi-parametric and scan-specific parameter mapping technique with promising performance at high acceleration rates. It synergistically combines parallel imaging, model-based and machine learning approaches for joint mapping of T1, T2*, proton density and the field inhomogeneity. However, Joint MAPLE suffers from prohibitively long reconstruction time to estimate the maps from a multi-echo, multi-flip angle (MEMFA) dataset at high resolution in a scan-specific manner. In this work, we propose a faster version of Joint MAPLE which retains the mapping performance of the original version. Coil compression, random slice selection, parameter-specific learning rates and transfer learning are synergistically combined in the proposed framework. It speeds-up the reconstruction time up to 700 times than the original version and processes a whole-brain MEMFA dataset in 21 minutes on average, which originally requires ~260 hours for Joint MAPLE. The mapping performance of the proposed framework is ~2-fold better than the standard and the state-of-the-art evaluated reconstruction techniques on average in terms of the root mean squared error.</description>

      <title>Beta regression mixed model applied to sensory analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensory analysis is an important area that the food industry can use to innovate and improve its products. This study involves a sample of individuals who can be trained or not to assess a product using a hedonic scale or notes, where the experimental design is a balanced incomplete block design. In this context, integrating sensory analysis with effective statistical methods, which consider the nature of the response variables, is essential to answer the aim of the experimental study. Some techniques are available to analyse sensory data, such as response surface models or categorical models. This article proposes using beta regression as an alternative to the proportional odds model, addressing some convergence problems, especially regarding the number of parameters. Moreover, the beta distribution is flexible for heteroscedasticity and asymmetry data. To this end, we conducted simulation studies that showed agreement rates in product selection using both models. Also, we presented a motivational study that was developed to select prebiotic drinks based on cashew nuts added to grape juice. In this application, the beta regression mixed model results corroborated with the selected formulations using the proportional mixed model.</description>

      <title>DaCapo: a modular deep learning framework for scalable 3D image segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DaCapo is a specialized deep learning library tailored to expedite the training and application of existing machine learning approaches on large, near-isotropic image data. In this correspondence, we introduce DaCapo's unique features optimized for this specific domain, highlighting its modular structure, efficient experiment management tools, and scalable deployment capabilities. We discuss its potential to improve access to large-scale, isotropic image segmentation and invite the community to explore and contribute to this open-source initiative.</description>

      <title>Detection of circular permutations by Protein Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein circular permutations are crucial for understanding protein evolution and functionality. Traditional detection methods, sequence-based or structure-based, struggle with accuracy and computational efficiency, the latter also limited by treating proteins as rigid bodies. The plmCP method, utilizing a protein language model, not only speeds up the detection process but also enhances the accuracy of identifying circular permutations, contributing significantly to protein research and engineering by acknowledging structural flexibility.</description>

      <title>Cooperativity, information gain, and energy cost during early LTP in dendritic spines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a mutual relationship between information and energy during early phase of LTP induction and maintenance in a large-scale system of mutually coupled dendritic spines, with discrete internal states and probabilistic dynamics, within the framework of nonequilibrium stochastic thermodynamics. In order to analyze this computationally intractable stochastic multidimensional system, we introduce a pair approximation, which allows us to reduce the spine dynamics into a lower dimensional manageable system of closed equations. It is found that the rates of information gain and energy attain their maximal values during an initial period of LTP (i.e. during stimulation), and after that they recover to their baseline low values, as opposed to a memory trace that lasts much longer. This suggests that learning phase is much more energy demanding than the memory phase. We show that positive correlations between neighboring spines increase both a duration of memory trace and energy cost during LTP, but the memory time per invested energy increases dramatically for very strong positive synaptic cooperativity, suggesting a beneficial role of synaptic clustering on memory duration. In contrast, information gain after LTP is the largest for negative correlations, and energy efficiency of that information generally declines with increasing synaptic cooperativity. We also find that dendritic spines can use sparse representations for encoding of long-term information, as both energetic and structural efficiencies of retained information and its lifetime exhibit maxima for low fractions of stimulated synapses during LTP. In general, our stochastic thermodynamics approach provides a unifying framework for studying, from first principles, information encoding and its energy cost during learning and memory in stochastic systems of interacting synapses.</description>
