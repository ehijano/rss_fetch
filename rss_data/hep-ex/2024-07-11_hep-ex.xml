      <title>Measurement of boosted Higgs bosons produced via vector boson fusion or gluon fusion in the H $\to$ $\mathrm{b\bar{b}}$ decay mode using LHC proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A measurement is performed of Higgs bosons produced with high transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) via vector boson or gluon fusion in proton-proton collisions. The result is based on a data set with a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected in 2016-2018 with the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The decay of a high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ Higgs boson to a boosted bottom quark-antiquark pair is selected using large-radius jets and employing jet substructure and heavy-flavor taggers based on machine learning techniques. Independent regions targeting the vector boson and gluon fusion mechanisms are defined based on the topology of two quark-initiated jets with large pseudorapidity separation. The signal strengths for both processes are extracted simultaneously by performing a maximum likelihood fit to data in the large-radius jet mass distribution. The observed signal strengths relative to the standard model expectation are 4.9$^{+1.9}_{-1.6}$ and 1.6$^{+1.7}_{-1.5}$ for the vector boson and gluon fusion mechanisms, respectively. A differential cross section measurement is also reported in the simplified template cross section framework.</description>

      <title>Light Dark Matter Constraints from SuperCDMS HVeV Detectors Operated Underground with an Anticoincidence Event Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents constraints on dark-matter-electron interactions obtained from the first underground data-taking campaign with multiple SuperCDMS HVeV detectors operated in the same housing. An exposure of 7.63 g-days is used to set upper limits on the dark-matter-electron scattering cross section for dark matter masses between 0.5 and 1000 MeV/$c^2$, as well as upper limits on dark photon kinetic mixing and axion-like particle axioelectric coupling for masses between 1.2 and 23.3 eV/$c^2$. Compared to an earlier HVeV search, sensitivity was improved as a result of an increased overburden of 225 meters of water equivalent, an anticoincidence event selection, and better pile-up rejection. In the case of dark-matter-electron scattering via a heavy mediator, an improvement by up to a factor of 25 in cross-section sensitivity was achieved.</description>

      <title>Towards an Interpretation of the First Measurements of Energy Correlators in the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy correlators have recently been proposed as a class of jet substructure observables that directly link experimental measurements of the asymptotic energy flux with the field theoretic description of the underlying microscopic dynamics. This link holds particular promise in heavy-ion physics, where both experimental measurements and theoretical interpretations are inherently complex. With recent measurements of energy correlators in proton-proton collisions, the first measurement of these observables on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions underscores the importance of a theoretical understanding of their behavior in this complex environment. In this manuscript, we extend our previous calculations to account for several effects necessary for a qualitative understanding of the behavior of energy correlators on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions. Through a semi-analytic approach implemented in a hydrodynamically expanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP), we account for medium-induced radiation with leading broadening effects, selection biases arising from energy loss, and a description of the confinement transition. Our results represent a crucial first step towards interpreting the measurements of energy correlators on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions, which marks a significant milestone in connecting heavy-ion experiment and fundamental quantum field theory, in the quest to disentangle the microscopic dynamics of the QGP.</description>

      <title>A Stress Test of Global PDF Fits: Closure Testing the MSHT PDFs and a First Direct Comparison to the Neural Net Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first global closure test of the fixed parameterisation (MSHT) approach to PDF fitting. We find that the default MSHT20 parameterisation can reproduce the features of the input set in such a closure test to well within the textbook uncertainties. This provides strong evidence that parameterisation inflexibility in the MSHT20 fit is not a significant issue in the data region. We also present the first completely like-for-like comparison between two global PDF fits, namely MSHT and NNPDF, where the only difference is guaranteed to be due to the fitting methodology. To achieve this, we present a fit to the NNPDF4.0 data and theory inputs, but with the MSHT fixed parameterisation. We find that this gives a moderately, but noticeably, better fit quality than the central NNPDF4.0 fits, both with perturbative and fitted charm, and that this difference persists at the level of the PDFs and benchmark cross sections. The NNPDF4.0 uncertainties are found to be broadly in line with the MSHT results if a textbook $T^2=1$ tolerance is applied, but to be significantly smaller if a tolerance typical of the MSHT20 fit is applied. This points to an inherent inconsistency between these approaches. We discuss the need for an enlarged tolerance criterion in global PDF fits in detail, and demonstrate the impact of data/theory inconsistencies in the closure test setting; namely, these do not lead to any increase in the $T^2=1$ PDF uncertainty. We also investigate the impact of restricting the PDF parameterisation to have fewer free parameters than the default MSHT20 case, and find this can be significant at the level of both closure tests and the full fit.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Beyond-Standard-Model Event Discovery at the LHC with a Novel Quantum Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of unsupervised anomaly detection for identifying physics beyond the Standard Model that may appear at proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. We introduce a novel quantum autoencoder circuit ansatz that is specifically designed for this task and demonstrates superior performance compared to previous approaches. To assess its robustness, we evaluate the quantum autoencoder on various types of new physics 'signal' events and varying problem sizes. Additionally, we develop classical autoencoders that outperform previously proposed quantum autoencoders but remain outpaced by the new quantum ansatz, despite its significantly reduced number of trainable parameters. Finally, we investigate the properties of quantum autoencoder circuits, focusing on entanglement and magic. We introduce a novel metric in the context of parameterised quantum circuits, stabilizer 2-R\'enyi entropy to quantify magic, along with the previously studied Meyer-Wallach measure for entanglement. Intriguingly, both metrics decreased throughout the training process along with the decrease in the loss function. This appears to suggest that models preferentially learn parameters that reduce these metrics. This study highlights the potential utility of quantum autoencoders in searching for physics beyond the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider and opens exciting avenues for further research into the role of entanglement and magic in quantum machine learning more generally.</description>

      <title>Leptophilic ALPs with TWIST data for polarized muon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the production of axion-like particles (ALPs) in association with electrons and neutrinos in the muon decay process. For this purpose, we compute the decay width of the muon to a four-body channel using a $d=7$ effective operator that couples the ALP to the Standard model fermions, namely leptons and neutrinos. Assuming a dominant coupling of the ALP to the dark sector, we only consider ALP decays to invisible final states. To obtain constraints on our model using the existing measurements, we leverage data from the TRIUMF Weak Interaction Symmetry Test (TWIST) experiment and obtain bounds on the ALP-lepton coupling for masses in the range of $0 &lt; m_{\phi} &lt; m_{\mu}/4$, as allowed by kinematics. Using the precision of current TWIST measurements, we obtain an order of magnitude estimation necessary for future searches to further constrain the parameter space for such a setup. Furthermore, we find that keeping realistic considerations, the new physics contribution can possibly be enhanced even with a minimalistic modification to the fiducial area used in the experiment potentially allowing for stringer constraints. At the end, in an attempt to relax the assumption that ALP decays to invisible only, we also investigate its stability and find potential longevity within collider environments for the mass range considered in this study.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the $\Xi_c^* \bar K$ molecular pentaquark state by its electromagnetic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are systematically studying the electromagnetic characteristics of multiquark systems to shed light on their internal structure, whose nature and quantum numbers are controversial. In this study, we investigate the magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic octupole moments of the $\Xi_c^*\bar K$ state within the context of the QCD light-cone sum rule. During this analysis, we posit that the $\Xi_c^*\bar K$ state assumes a molecular structure with quantum numbers $J^P = \frac{3}{2}^-$. The extracted outcomes are given as $\mu_{\Xi_c^*\bar K} = 0.15^{+0.04}_{-0.03}\,\mu_N$, $\mathcal{Q}_{\Xi_c^*\bar K} = (-0.93^{+0.22}_{-0.17})\times 10^{-3}\,\rm{fm^2}$, and $\mathcal{O}_{\Xi_c^*\bar K} = (-0.45^{+0.10}_{-0.09})\times 10^{-4}\,\rm{fm^3}$. The findings of this study, when considered alongside other pertinent characteristics, may assist in elucidating the nature of this controversial phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Non-universal SUSY models, $g_\mu-2$, $m_H$ and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $g_\mu - 2 \equiv 2 a_\mu$, in the context of supersymmetric models beyond the CMSSM, where the unification of either the gaugino masses $M_{1,2,3}$ or sfermion and Higgs masses is relaxed, taking into account the measured mass of the Higgs boson, $m_H$, the cosmological dark matter density and the direct detection rate. We find that the model with non-unified gaugino masses can make a contribution $\Delta a_\mu\sim 20 \times 10^{-10}$ to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, for example if $M_{1,2} \sim 600$ GeV and $M_3\sim 8$ TeV. The model with non-universal sfermion and Higgs masses can provide even larger $\Delta a_\mu \sim 24 \times 10^{-10}$ if the sfermion masses for the first and the second generations are $ \sim 400 $ GeV and that of the third is $ \sim 8 $ TeV. We discuss the prospects for collider searches for supersymmetric particles in specific benchmark scenarios illustrating these possibilities, focusing in particular on the prospects for detecting the lighter smuon and the lightest neutralino.</description>

      <title>Training toward significance with the decorrelated event classifier transformer neural network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental particle physics uses machine learning for many tasks, where one application is to classify signal and background events. This classification can be used to bin an analysis region to enhance the expected significance for a mass resonance search. In natural language processing, one of the leading neural network architectures is the transformer. In this work, an event classifier transformer is proposed to bin an analysis region, in which the network is trained with special techniques. The techniques developed here can enhance the significance and reduce the correlation between the network's output and the reconstructed mass. It is found that this trained network can perform better than boosted decision trees and feed-forward networks.</description>

      <title>Jet Flavour Tagging at FCC-ee with a Transformer-based Neural Network: DeepJetTransformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jet flavour tagging is crucial in experimental high-energy physics. A tagging algorithm, DeepJetTransformer, is presented, which exploits a transformer-based neural network that is substantially faster to train.
  The DeepJetTransformer network uses information from particle flow-style objects and secondary vertex reconstruction as is standard for $b$- and $c$-jet identification supplemented by additional information, such as reconstructed V$^0$s and $K^{\pm}/\pi^{\pm}$ discrimination, typically not included in tagging algorithms at the LHC. The model is trained as a multiclassifier to identify all quark flavours separately and performs excellently in identifying $b$- and $c$-jets. An $s$-tagging efficiency of $40\%$ can be achieved with a $10\%$ $ud$-jet background efficiency. The impact of including V$^0$s and $K^{\pm}/\pi^{\pm}$ discrimination is presented.
  The network is applied on exclusive $Z \to q\bar{q}$ samples to examine the physics potential and is shown to isolate $Z \to s\bar{s}$ events. Assuming all other backgrounds can be efficiently rejected, a $5\sigma$ discovery significance for $Z \to s\bar{s}$ can be achieved with an integrated luminosity of $60~\text{nb}^{-1}$, corresponding to less than a second of the FCC-ee run plan at the $Z$ resonance.</description>

      <title>Constraining Ultralight Dark Matter through an Accelerated Resonant Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experiments aimed at detecting ultralight dark matter typically rely on resonant effects, which are sensitive to the dark matter mass that matches the resonance frequency. In this study, we investigate the nucleon couplings of ultralight axion dark matter using a magnetometer operating in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) mode. Our approach involves the use of a $^{21}$Ne spin-based sensor, which features the lowest nuclear magnetic moment among noble-gas spins. This configuration allows us to achieve an ultrahigh sensitivity of 0.73 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$ at around 5 Hz, corresponding to energy resolution of approximately 1.5$\times
  10^{-23}\,\rm{eV/Hz^{1/2}}$. Our analysis reveals that under certain conditions it is beneficial to scan the frequency with steps significantly larger than the resonance width. The analytical results are in agreement with experimental data and the scan strategy is potentially applicable to other resonant searches. Further, our study establishes stringent constraints on axion-like particles (ALP) in the 4.5--15.5 Hz Compton-frequency range coupling to neutrons and protons, improving on prior work by several-fold. Within a band around 4.6--6.6 Hz and around 7.5 Hz, our laboratory findings surpass astrophysical limits derived from neutron-star cooling. Hence, we demonstrate an accelerated resonance search for ultralight dark matter, achieving an approximately 30-fold increase in scanning step while maintaining competitive sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Heavy vector-like quarks decaying to exotic scalars: a case study with triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the pair production of a vector-like quark triplet with hypercharge 5/3 decaying into top quark and a complex scalar triplet with hypercharge 1 at the LHC. This novel scenario, featuring particles with exotic charges - two quarks with charge 8/3 and 5/3 and a scalar with charge 2 - serves as a unique window to models based on the framework of partial compositeness, where these particles naturally emerge as bound states around the TeV scale. Leveraging on the LHC data we establish exclusion limits on the masses of the vector-like quark and the scalar triplet. Subsequently, we design an analysis strategy aimed at improving sensitivity in the region which is still allowed. Our analysis focuses on two specific regions in the parameter space: the first entails a large mass gap between the vector-like quarks and the scalars, so that the vector-like quarks can decay into the scalars; the second involves a small mass gap, such that this decay is forbidden. To simplify the parameter space, both vector-like quarks and scalars are assumed to be degenerate or almost degenerate within the triplets, such that chain decays between fermions and scalars are suppressed. As a result, we found that final states characterized by a same-sign lepton pair, multiple jets, and high net transverse momentum (i.e. effective mass) will play a pivotal role to unveil this model and, more in general, models characterised by multiple vector-like quarks around the same mass scale during the high luminosity LHC phase.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study of Lepton Flavor Violation (LFV) in semileptonic transitions in the framework of an Effective Field Theory with general flavor structure. We account for the Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs), which induce non-trivial correlations between the different types of LFV processes. In particular, we show that these loop effects are needed to improve the bounds on several coefficients that are not efficiently constrained at tree level. For illustration, we consider a few concrete scenarios, with predominant couplings to third-generation quarks, and we explore the correlations between the various tree- and loop-level constraints on these models. As a by-product, we also provide expressions for several semileptonic LFV meson decays by using the latest determinations of the relevant hadronic form factors on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Masked Particle Modeling on Sets: Towards Self-Supervised High Energy Physics Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose masked particle modeling (MPM) as a self-supervised method for learning generic, transferable, and reusable representations on unordered sets of inputs for use in high energy physics (HEP) scientific data. This work provides a novel scheme to perform masked modeling based pre-training to learn permutation invariant functions on sets. More generally, this work provides a step towards building large foundation models for HEP that can be generically pre-trained with self-supervised learning and later fine-tuned for a variety of down-stream tasks. In MPM, particles in a set are masked and the training objective is to recover their identity, as defined by a discretized token representation of a pre-trained vector quantized variational autoencoder. We study the efficacy of the method in samples of high energy jets at collider physics experiments, including studies on the impact of discretization, permutation invariance, and ordering. We also study the fine-tuning capability of the model, showing that it can be adapted to tasks such as supervised and weakly supervised jet classification, and that the model can transfer efficiently with small fine-tuning data sets to new classes and new data domains.</description>

      <title>Full quantum tomography of top quark decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum tomography in high-energy physics processes has usually been restricted to the spin degrees of freedom. We address the case of top quark decays $t \to W b$, in which the orbital angular momentum ($L$) and the spins of $W$ and $b$ are intertwined into a 54-dimensional $LWb$ density operator. The entanglement between $L$ and the $W$ or $b$ spin is large and could be determined for decays of single top quarks produced at the Large Hadron Collider with Run 2 data. With the foreseen statistical and systematic uncertainties, the significance is well above $5\sigma$ from the separability hypothesis for $L$-$W$ entanglement, and $3.2\sigma$ for $L$-$b$. These would be the first entanglement measurements between orbital and spin angular momenta in high-energy physics. Likewise, the genuine tripartite entanglement between $L$ and the two spins could be established with more than $5\sigma$. The method presented paves the way for similar measurements in other processes.</description>

      <title>Reactor Antineutrino Directionality Measurement with the PROSPECT-I Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The PROSPECT-I detector has several features that enable measurement of the direction of a compact neutrino source. In this paper, a detailed report on the directional measurements made on electron antineutrinos emitted from the High Flux Isotope Reactor is presented. With an estimated true neutrino (reactor to detector) direction of $\phi = 40.8\unicode{xB0} \pm 0.7\unicode{xB0}$ and $\theta = 98.6\unicode{xB0} \pm 0.4\unicode{xB0}$, the PROSPECT-I detector is able to reconstruct an average neutrino direction of $\phi = 39.4\unicode{xB0} \pm 2.9\unicode{xB0}$ and $\theta = 97.6\unicode{xB0} \pm 1.6\unicode{xB0}$. This measurement is made with approximately 48000 Inverse Beta Decay signal events and is the most precise directional reconstruction of reactor antineutrinos to date.</description>

      <title>Parity and Lepton Masses in the Left Right Symmetric Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Curiously in the minimal left right symmetric model, chiral ($\chi$) symmetry that protects the electron's mass ($m_e$), due to parity (P) implies the vanishing of its neutrino mixing angles. We break the $\chi$ symmetry to generate the observed neutrino mixing which causes the electron to acquire its mass on RGE running, and in turn determines the B-L gauge symmetry breaking scale ($v_R$) to be $10^{10} GeV \lesssim v_R \leq 10^{15} GeV $ (and with fine-tuning can be at $10 TeV$ scale). If the muon's mass is also generated radiatively, the B-L breaking scale is $\sim 10^{14-15}$ GeV. Regardless of how the high scale $v_R$ is, this is a testable model for obtaining the mass of the electron (and muon), since on RGE running and P breaking, a large strong CP phase ($\bar{\theta} &gt;&gt; 10^{-10}$) which depends logarithmically on $v_R$ is generated if there is O(1) CP violation in leptonic Yukawa couplings. Hence we expect that leptonic CP phases including the Dirac CP phase $\delta_{CP}$ of the PMNS matrix must be consistent with $0$ or $180^o$ to within a degree, which can be verified or excluded by neutrino experiments such as DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande. In lieu of P, if charge conjugation C is used, the same results follow. However with C and no P, axions would likely need to be added anyway, in which case there is no constraint on $\delta_{CP}$.</description>
