      <title>The Boundary Reproduction Number for Determining Boundary Steady State Stability in Chemical Reaction Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the boundary reproduction number, adapted from the next generation matrix method, to assess whether an infusion of species will persist or become exhausted in a chemical reaction system. Our main contributions are as follows: (a) we show how the concept of a siphon, prevalent in Petri nets and chemical reaction network theory, identifies sets of species that may become depleted at steady state, analogous to a disease-free boundary steady state; (b) we develop an approach for incorporating biochemically motivated conservation laws, which allows the stability of boundary steady states to be determined within specific compatibility classes; and (c) we present an effective heuristic for decomposing the Jacobian of the system that reduces the computational complexity required to compute the stability domain of a boundary steady state. The boundary reproduction number approach significantly simplifies existing parameter-dependent methods for determining the stability of boundary steady states in chemical reaction systems and has implications for the capacity of critical metabolites and substrates in metabolic pathways to become exhausted.</description>

      <title>The optimization of crop response to climatic stress through modulation of plant stress response mechanisms. Opportunities for biostimulants and plant hormones to meet climate challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change is a major threat to crop potential and is characterized by both long-term shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns as well as increased occurrence of extreme weather events, these extreme weather events are the most immediate and intractable threat to agriculture. Crop resilience in the face of stress depends upon the speed and effectiveness with which plants and cropping systems sense and respond to that stress. A variety of agronomic practices including breeding, exogenous inputs (nutrients, water, biostimulants and others) and shifts in cultivation practice have been used to influence plant stress response to achieve the goal of increased plant and cropping system resilience. Traditional breeding is a powerful tool that has resulted in stable and long-term cultivar improvements but is often too slow and complex to meet the diverse, complex and unpredictable challenges of climate induced stresses. Increased inputs (water, nutrients, pesticides etc.) and management strategies (cropping system choice, soil management etc.) can alleviate stress but are often constrained by cost and availability of inputs. Exogenous biostimulants, microbials and plant hormones have shown great promise as mechanisms to optimize natural plant resilience resulting in immediate but non-permanent improvements in plant responses to climate induced stresses. The failure to modernize regulatory frameworks for the use of biostimulants in agriculture will constrain the development of safe effective tools and deprive growers of means to respond to the vagaries of climate change. Here we discuss the scientific rationale for eliminating the regulatory barriers that constrain the potential for biostimulants or products that modulate plant regulatory networks to address climate change challenges and propose a framework for enabling legislation to strengthen cropping system resilience.</description>

      <title>Transcriptome and Redox Proteome Reveal Temporal Scales of Carbon Metabolism Regulation in Model Cyanobacteria Under Light Disturbance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systems approach based on an energy-landscape concept to differentiate interactions involving redox activities and conformational changes of proteins and nucleic acids interactions in multi-layered protein-DNA regulatory networks under light disturbance. Our approach is a data-driven modeling workflow using a physics-informed machine learning algorithm to train a non-linear mathematical model for interpreting gene expression dynamics and to lead discovery for protein regulators using redox proteome analysis. We distinguish light-responsive elements within central carbon metabolism pathways from independent variables like circadian time using the publicly available transcriptome datasets of Synechococcus elongatus over diel cycles responding to light perturbations. Our approach provides interpretable de novo models for elucidating events of reactions in complex regulatory pathways in response to stressful disturbance from the environment. We discovered protein regulators in response to light disturbance in the proteome analysis involving shifts in protein abundance as well as cysteine redox states under constant illumination and after two hours of darkness. We discovered significant shifts in cysteine redox states in regulatory proteins such as transcription sigma factors and metabolic enzymes in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and the Calvin-Benson cycle, while the changes in their protein abundance were minimal. These results indicate that regulatory dynamics in reductant generation link photo-induced electron transport pathways and redox metabolic pathways with circadian rhythms through fast redox-induced conformational changes or slow expression regulations across networks.</description>
