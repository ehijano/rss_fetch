      <title>Regulatory Migration to Europe: ICO Reallocation Following U.S. Securities Enforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines whether a major U.S. regulatory clarification coincided with cross-border spillovers in crypto-asset entrepreneurial finance. We study the Securities and Exchange Commission's July 2017 DAO Report, which clarified the application of U.S. securities law to many initial coin offerings, and analyze how global issuance activity adjusted across regions. Using a comprehensive global dataset of ICOs from 2014 to 2021, we construct a region-month panel and evaluate issuance dynamics around the announcement. We document a substantial and persistent reallocation of ICO activity toward Europe following the DAO Report. In panel regressions with region and month fixed effects, Europe experiences an average post-2017 increase of approximately 14 additional ICOs per region-month relative to other regions, net of global market cycles. The results are consistent with cross-border regulatory spillovers in highly mobile digital-asset markets.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Interpretability of Forecasting Models for Energy Balancing Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The balancing market in the energy sector plays a critical role in physically and financially balancing the supply and demand. Modeling dynamics in the balancing market can provide valuable insights and prognosis for power grid stability and secure energy supply. While complex machine learning models can achieve high accuracy, their black-box nature severely limits the model interpretability. In this paper, we explore the trade-off between model accuracy and interpretability for the energy balancing market. Particularly, we take the example of forecasting manual frequency restoration reserve (mFRR) activation price in the balancing market using real market data from different energy price zones. We explore the interpretability of mFRR forecasting using two models: extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine and explainable boosting machine (EBM). We also integrate the two models, and we benchmark all the models against a baseline naive model. Our results show that EBM provides forecasting accuracy comparable to XGBoost while yielding a considerable level of interpretability. Our analysis also underscores the challenge of accurately predicting the mFRR price for the instances when the activation price deviates significantly from the spot price. Importantly, EBM's interpretability features reveal insights into non-linear mFRR price drivers and regional market dynamics. Our study demonstrates that EBM is a viable and valuable interpretable alternative to complex black-box AI models in the forecast for the balancing market.</description>

      <title>A Prior-Predictive Monte Carlo Framework for Pricing Complex Data Products in Data-Poor Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pricing advanced data products - particularly in complex fields such as semiconductor manufacturing - is a fundamentally challenging task due to the sparsity of publicly available transaction data, and its frequent heterogeneity and confidentiality. While data value depends on multiple interacting factors, such as technical sophistication, quality, utility, and licensing rights, traditional pricing methods tend to rely on ad-hoc heuristics or require massive amounts of historical transaction data. In an increasingly data-based economy, we introduce a prior-predictive Monte Carlo framework that enables the generation of fair, consistent, and justified price ranges for data products in the absence of empirical data. By simulating many plausible pricing 'worlds' and deal configurations, the framework produces stable probabilistic price bands (e.g., P5/P50/P95) rather than single point estimates, creating an auditable and repeatable probabilistic pricing system with business realism enforced via constraint-truncated priors. The proposed model bridges traditional data pricing rooted in professional experience with a data-based approach that also allows for classical Bayesian updating as more transaction data is accumulated.</description>

      <title>A Methodology to Measure Impacts of Scenarios Through Expected Credit Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a methodology for measuring the impact of scenarios on the expected losses of exposures by leveraging the existing provisioning infrastructure within financial institutions, where scenario effects are captured through changes in probabilities of default. We then describe how to design and implement a scenario test where risk drivers are given for standardized groupings of exposures, and the groupings are defined based on common features of the exposures. The methodology presented served as a theoretical foundation for the standardized climate scenario exercise conducted in 2024 by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions of Canada and Quebec's Autorite des Marches Financiers.</description>
