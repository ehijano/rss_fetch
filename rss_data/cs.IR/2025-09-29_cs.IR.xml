      <title>How good are LLMs at Retrieving Documents in a Specific Domain?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical search engines using indexing methods in data infrastructures primarily allow keyword-based queries to retrieve content. While these indexing-based methods are highly scalable and efficient, due to a lack of an appropriate evaluation dataset and a limited understanding of semantics, they often fail to capture the user's intent and generate incomplete responses during evaluation. This problem also extends to domain-specific search systems that utilize a Knowledge Base (KB) to access data from various research infrastructures. Research infrastructures (RIs) from the environmental and earth science domain, which encompass the study of ecosystems, biodiversity, oceanography, and climate change, generate, share, and reuse large volumes of data. While there are attempts to provide a centralized search service using Elasticsearch as a knowledge base, they also face similar challenges in understanding queries with multiple intents. To address these challenges, we proposed an automated method to curate a domain-specific evaluation dataset to analyze the capability of a search system. Furthermore, we incorporate the Retrieval of Augmented Generation (RAG), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for high-quality retrieval of environmental domain data using natural language queries. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis of the evaluation dataset shows that LLM-based systems for information retrieval return results with higher precision when understanding queries with multiple intents, compared to Elasticsearch-based systems.</description>

      <title>Federated Consistency- and Complementarity-aware Consensus-enhanced Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized federated recommendation system (FedRec) has gained significant attention for its ability to preserve privacy in delivering tailored recommendations. To alleviate the statistical heterogeneity challenges among clients and improve personalization, decoupling item embeddings into the server and client-specific views has become a promising way. Among them, the global item embedding table serves as a consensus representation that integrates and reflects the collective patterns across all clients. However, the inherent sparsity and high uniformity of interaction data from massive-scale clients results in degraded consensus and insufficient decoupling, reducing consensus's utility. To this end, we propose a \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{C}onsistency- and \textbf{C}omplementarity-aware \textbf{C}onsensus-enhanced \textbf{R}ecommendation (Fed3CR) method for personalized FedRec. To improve the efficiency of the utilization of consensus, we propose an \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}onsensus \textbf{E}nhancement (ACE) strategy to learn the relationship between global and client-specific item embeddings. It enables the client to adaptively enhance specific information in the consensus, transforming it into a form that best suits itself. To improve the quality of decoupling, we propose a \textbf{C}onsistency- and \textbf{C}omplementarity-aware \textbf{O}ptimization (C2O) strategy, which helps to learn more effective and complementary representations. Notably, our proposed Fed3CR is a plug-and-play method, which can be integrated with other FedRec methods to improve its performance. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets represent the superior performance of Fed3CR.</description>

      <title>Fairness for niche users and providers: algorithmic choice and profile portability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring fair outcomes for multiple stakeholders in recommender systems has been studied mostly in terms of algorithmic interventions: building new models with better fairness properties, or using reranking to improve outcomes from an existing algorithm. What has rarely been studied is structural changes in the recommendation ecosystem itself. Our work explores the fairness impact of algorithmic pluralism, the idea that the recommendation algorithm is decoupled from the platform through which users access content, enabling user choice in algorithms. Prior work using a simulation approach has shown that niche consumers and (especially) niche providers benefit from algorithmic choice. In this paper, we use simulation to explore the question of profile portability, to understand how different policies regarding the handling of user profiles interact with fairness outcomes for consumers and providers.</description>

      <title>Next Point-of-interest (POI) Recommendation Model Based on Multi-modal Spatio-temporal Context Feature Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is mainly based on sequential traffic information to predict the user's next boarding point location. This is a highly regarded and widely applied research task in the field of intelligent transportation, and there have been many research results to date. Traditional POI prediction models primarily rely on short-term traffic sequence information, often neglecting both long-term and short-term preference data, as well as crucial spatiotemporal context features in user behavior. To address this issue, this paper introduces user long-term preference information and key spatiotemporal context information, and proposes a POI recommendation model based on multimodal spatiotemporal context feature embedding. The model extracts long-term preference features and key spatiotemporal context features from traffic data through modules such as spatiotemporal feature processing, multimodal embedding, and self-attention aggregation. It then uses a weighted fusion method to dynamically adjust the weights of long-term and short-term features based on users' historical behavior patterns and the current context. Finally, the fused features are matched using attention, and the probability of each location candidate becoming the next location is calculated. This paper conducts experimental verification on multiple transportation datasets, and the results show that the POI prediction model combining multiple types of features has higher prediction accuracy than existing SOTA models and methods.</description>

      <title>MTRec: Learning to Align with User Preferences via Mental Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation models are predominantly trained using implicit user feedback, since explicit feedback is often costly to obtain. However, implicit feedback, such as clicks, does not always reflect users' real preferences. For example, a user might click on a news article because of its attractive headline, but end up feeling uncomfortable after reading the content. In the absence of explicit feedback, such erroneous implicit signals may severely mislead recommender systems. In this paper, we propose MTRec, a novel sequential recommendation framework designed to align with real user preferences by uncovering their internal satisfaction on recommended items. Specifically, we introduce a mental reward model to quantify user satisfaction and propose a distributional inverse reinforcement learning approach to learn it. The learned mental reward model is then used to guide recommendation models to better align with users' real preferences. Our experiments show that MTRec brings significant improvements to a variety of recommendation models. We also deploy MTRec on an industrial short video platform and observe a 7 percent increase in average user viewing time.</description>

      <title>WARBERT: A Hierarchical BERT-based Model for Web API Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of Web 2.0 and microservices architecture, the number of Web APIs has increased dramatically, further intensifying the demand for efficient Web API recommendation. Existing solutions typically fall into two categories: recommendation-type methods, which treat each API as a label for classification, and match-type methods, which focus on matching mashups through API retrieval. However, three critical challenges persist: 1) the semantic ambiguities in comparing API and mashup descriptions, 2) the lack of detailed comparisons between the individual API and the mashup in recommendation-type methods, and 3) time inefficiencies for API retrieval in match-type methods. To address these challenges, we propose WARBERT, a hierarchical BERT-based model for Web API recommendation. WARBERT leverages dual-component feature fusion and attention comparison to extract precise semantic representations of API and mashup descriptions. WARBERT consists of two main components: WARBERT(R) for Recommendation and WARBERT(M) for Matching. Specifically, WAR-BERT(R) serves as an initial filter, narrowing down the candidate APIs, while WARBERT(M) refines the matching process by calculating the similarity between candidate APIs and mashup. The final likelihood of a mashup being matched with an API is determined by combining the predictions from WARBERT(R) and WARBERT(M). Additionally, WARBERT(R) incorporates an auxiliary task of mashup category judgment, which enhances its effectiveness in candidate selection. Experimental results on the ProgrammableWeb dataset demonstrate that WARBERT outperforms most existing solutions and achieves improvements of up to 11.7% compared to the model MTFM (Multi-Task Fusion Model), delivering significant enhancements in accuracy and effiency.</description>

      <title>From Past To Path: Masked History Learning for Next-Item Prediction in Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative recommendation, which directly generates item identifiers, has emerged as a promising paradigm for recommendation systems. However, its potential is fundamentally constrained by the reliance on purely autoregressive training. This approach focuses solely on predicting the next item while ignoring the rich internal structure of a user's interaction history, thus failing to grasp the underlying intent. To address this limitation, we propose Masked History Learning (MHL), a novel training framework that shifts the objective from simple next-step prediction to deep comprehension of history. MHL augments the standard autoregressive objective with an auxiliary task of reconstructing masked historical items, compelling the model to understand ``why'' an item path is formed from the user's past behaviors, rather than just ``what'' item comes next. We introduce two key contributions to enhance this framework: (1) an entropy-guided masking policy that intelligently targets the most informative historical items for reconstruction, and (2) a curriculum learning scheduler that progressively transitions from history reconstruction to future prediction. Experiments on three public datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, highlighting that a comprehensive understanding of the past is crucial for accurately predicting a user's future path. The code will be released to the public.</description>

      <title>Constructing Opera Seria in the Iberian Courts: Metastasian Repertoire for Spain and Portugal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exceptional reception of Pietro Metastasio's works during the eighteenth century, all over Europe and in the Iberian Peninsula in particular, is well documented. Due to that unparalleled success, it is possible to ascertain Spain and Portugal's participation in international, contemporary tastes and artistic webs, applicable to both composers and performers. However, this internationalisation needs to be nuanced, as some characteristics of the repertoire specifically written for the Peninsula indicate that their court audiences may have had expectations, both social and strictly musical, different from those of the public in opera theatres elsewhere in the continent. In this light, this article investigates in what ways the style of five composers in the international scene - Perez, Galuppi, Jommelli, Conforto, and Corselli - varied when commissioned to write opera seria for the Iberian courts. The statistical analysis of fifteen settings especially written for the court theatres in Madrid and Lisbon, in comparison to the average data extracted from a corpus of 2,404 arias from 126 versions of a select number of Metastasian librettos, allows us to evaluate some particular usages regarding key, metre, tempo, and treatment of the vocal part. In this manner, through quantitative analysis, this article places eighteenth-century Iberian music production and consumption in the context of European opera seria, while ultimately suggesting that its unique musical characteristics were also partly dependent on local musical customs, gender stereotypes, and personal idiosyncrasies alike.</description>

      <title>Semantic Representation of Processes with Ontology Design Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The representation of workflows and processes is essential in materials science engineering, where experimental and computational reproducibility depend on structured and semantically coherent process models. Although numerous ontologies have been developed for process modeling, they are often complex and challenging to reuse. Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) offer modular and reusable modeling solutions to recurring problems; however, these patterns are frequently neither explicitly published nor documented in a manner accessible to domain experts. This study surveys ontologies relevant to scientific workflows and engineering process modeling and identifies implicit design patterns embedded within their structures. We evaluate the capacity of these ontologies to fulfill key requirements for process representation in materials science. Furthermore, we propose a baseline method for the automatic extraction of design patterns from existing ontologies and assess the approach against curated ground truth patterns. All resources associated with this work, including the extracted patterns and the extraction workflow, are made openly available in a public GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>GSID: Generative Semantic Indexing for E-Commerce Product Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured representation of product information is a major bottleneck for the efficiency of e-commerce platforms, especially in second-hand ecommerce platforms. Currently, most product information are organized based on manually curated product categories and attributes, which often fail to adequately cover long-tail products and do not align well with buyer preference. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{S}emantic \textbf{I}n\textbf{D}exings (GSID), a data-driven approach to generate product structured representations. GSID consists of two key components: (1) Pre-training on unstructured product metadata to learn in-domain semantic embeddings, and (2) Generating more effective semantic codes tailored for downstream product-centric applications. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of GSID, and it has been successfully deployed on the real-world e-commerce platform, achieving promising results on product understanding and other downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Investigating Multi-layer Representations for Dense Passage Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense retrieval models usually adopt vectors from the last hidden layer of the document encoder to represent a document, which is in contrast to the fact that representations in different layers of a pre-trained language model usually contain different kinds of linguistic knowledge, and behave differently during fine-tuning. Therefore, we propose to investigate utilizing representations from multiple encoder layers to make up the representation of a document, which we denote Multi-layer Representations (MLR). We first investigate how representations in different layers affect MLR's performance under the multi-vector retrieval setting, and then propose to leverage pooling strategies to reduce multi-vector models to single-vector ones to improve retrieval efficiency. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MLR over dual encoder, ME-BERT and ColBERT in the single-vector retrieval setting, as well as demonstrate that it works well with other advanced training techniques such as retrieval-oriented pre-training and hard negative mining.</description>

      <title>Multi-Value-Product Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Industrial Product Attribute Value Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying attribute values from product profiles is a key task for improving product search, recommendation, and business analytics on e-commerce platforms, which we called Product Attribute Value Identification (PAVI) . However, existing PAVI methods face critical challenges, such as cascading errors, inability to handle out-of-distribution (OOD) attribute values, and lack of generalization capability. To address these limitations, we introduce Multi-Value-Product Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MVP-RAG), combining the strengths of retrieval, generation, and classification paradigms. MVP-RAG defines PAVI as a retrieval-generation task, where the product title description serves as the query, and products and attribute values act as the corpus. It first retrieves similar products of the same category and candidate attribute values, and then generates the standardized attribute values. The key advantages of this work are: (1) the proposal of a multi-level retrieval scheme, with products and attribute values as distinct hierarchical levels in PAVI domain (2) attribute value generation of large language model to significantly alleviate the OOD problem and (3) its successful deployment in a real-world industrial environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MVP-RAG performs better than the state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Multi-Item-Query Attention for Stable Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent instability and noise in user interaction data challenge sequential recommendation systems. Prevailing masked attention models, relying on a single query from the most recent item, are sensitive to this noise, reducing prediction reliability. We propose the Multi-Item-Query attention mechanism (MIQ-Attn) to enhance model stability and accuracy. MIQ-Attn constructs multiple diverse query vectors from user interactions, effectively mitigating noise and improving consistency. It is designed for easy adoption as a drop-in replacement for existing single-query attention. Experiments show MIQ-Attn significantly improves performance on benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>UniDex: Rethinking Search Inverted Indexing with Unified Semantic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverted indexing has traditionally been a cornerstone of modern search systems, leveraging exact term matches to determine relevance between queries and documents. However, this term-based approach often emphasizes surface-level token overlap, limiting the system's generalization capabilities and retrieval effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose UniDex, a novel model-based method that employs unified semantic modeling to revolutionize inverted indexing. UniDex replaces complex manual designs with a streamlined architecture, enhancing semantic generalization while reducing maintenance overhead. Our approach involves two key components: UniTouch, which maps queries and documents into semantic IDs for improved retrieval, and UniRank, which employs semantic matching to rank results effectively. Through large-scale industrial datasets and real-world online traffic assessments, we demonstrate that UniDex significantly improves retrieval capabilities, marking a paradigm shift from term-based to model-based indexing. Our deployment within Kuaishou's short-video search systems further validates UniDex's practical effectiveness, serving hundreds of millions of active users efficiently.</description>

      <title>Retro*: Optimizing LLMs for Reasoning-Intensive Document Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing popularity of LLM agents and RAG, it has become increasingly important to retrieve documents that are essential for solving a task, even when their connection to the task is indirect or implicit. Addressing this problem requires fine-grained reasoning to accurately assess the relevance between the task and each candidate document. This capability, however, poses a significant challenge for existing IR techniques. Despite recent progress in reasoning-enhanced IR, existing approaches still face significant challenges in applicability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose Retro*, a novel approach for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our method introduces a rubric-based relevance scoring mechanism, enabling the model to reason about the relationship between a task and a document based on explicitly defined criteria, whereby producing a fine-grained, interpretable relevance score. Retro* also supports test-time scaling by combining multiple reasoning trajectories via score integration, which produces more reliable relevance estimates. To optimize Retro*'s reasoning capabilities, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for its relevance scoring mechanism, which employs two composite rewards to fully exploit the trajectories of each training sample. Our experiments show that Retro* outperforms existing document retrieval methods with notable advantages, leading to state-of-the-art performance on the BRIGHT benchmark.</description>

      <title>Learning to Detect Relevant Contexts and Knowledge for Response Selection in Retrieval-based Dialogue Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, knowledge-grounded conversations in the open domain gain great attention from researchers. Existing works on retrieval-based dialogue systems have paid tremendous efforts to utilize neural networks to build a matching model, where all of the context and knowledge contents are used to match the response candidate with various representation methods. Actually, different parts of the context and knowledge are differentially important for recognizing the proper response candidate, as many utterances are useless due to the topic shift. Those excessive useless information in the context and knowledge can influence the matching process and leads to inferior performance. To address this problem, we propose a multi-turn \textbf{R}esponse \textbf{S}election \textbf{M}odel that can \textbf{D}etect the relevant parts of the \textbf{C}ontext and \textbf{K}nowledge collection (\textbf{RSM-DCK}). Our model first uses the recent context as a query to pre-select relevant parts of the context and knowledge collection at the word-level and utterance-level semantics. Further, the response candidate interacts with the selected context and knowledge collection respectively. In the end, The fused representation of the context and response candidate is utilized to post-select the relevant parts of the knowledge collection more confidently for matching. We test our proposed model on two benchmark datasets. Evaluation results indicate that our model achieves better performance than the existing methods, and can effectively detect the relevant context and knowledge for response selection.</description>

      <title>ADAM: A Diverse Archive of Mankind for Evaluating and Enhancing LLMs in Biographical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ADAM (A Diverse Archive of Mankind), a framework for evaluating and improving multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in biographical reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically examine LLM capabilities in biography, a critical yet underexplored dimension of factual knowledge. At its core, AdamDB is a multilingual and multimodal dataset covering over 4 million individuals across geography, time, and profession, while AdamBench provides cognitively structured evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy, spanning six reasoning levels in both English and native languages. To address hallucinations, particularly for lesser-known individuals, we propose AdamRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation system tailored to biographical contexts. Experiments show that AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits closed-source ones, with the largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval. ADAM establishes the first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally grounded biographical evaluation, advancing the development of multilingual, accurate, and hallucination-resistant MLLMs.</description>

      <title>PARROT: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs in Cross-System SQL Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMS) have shown increasing effectiveness in Text-to-SQL tasks. However, another closely related problem, Cross-System SQL Translation (a.k.a., SQL-to-SQL), which adapts a query written for one database system (e.g., MySQL) into its equivalent one for another system (e.g., ClickHouse), is of great practical importance but remains underexplored. Existing SQL benchmarks are not well-suited for SQL-to-SQL evaluation, which (1) focus on a limited set of database systems (often just SQLite) and (2) cannot capture many system-specific SQL dialects (e.g., customized functions, data types, and syntax rules). Thus, in this paper, we introduce PARROT, a Practical And Realistic BenchmaRk for CrOss-System SQL Translation. PARROT comprises 598 translation pairs from 38 open-source benchmarks and real-world business services, specifically prepared to challenge system-specific SQL understanding (e.g., LLMS achieve lower than 38.53% accuracy on average). We also provide multiple benchmark variants, including PARROT-Diverse with 28,003 translations (for extensive syntax testing) and PARROT-Simple with 5,306 representative samples (for focused stress testing), covering 22 production-grade database systems. To promote future research, we release a public leaderboard and source code at: https://code4db.github.io/parrot-bench/.</description>

      <title>Drift-Adapter: A Practical Approach to Near Zero-Downtime Embedding Model Upgrades in Vector Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upgrading embedding models in production vector databases typically requires re-encoding the entire corpus and rebuilding the Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) index, leading to significant operational disruption and computational cost. This paper presents Drift-Adapter, a lightweight, learnable transformation layer designed to bridge embedding spaces between model versions. By mapping new queries into the legacy embedding space, Drift-Adapter enables the continued use of the existing ANN index, effectively deferring full re-computation. We systematically evaluate three adapter parameterizations: Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and a compact Residual MLP, trained on a small sample of paired old and new embeddings. Experiments on MTEB text corpora and a CLIP image model upgrade (1M items) show that Drift-Adapter recovers 95-99% of the retrieval recall (Recall@10, MRR) of a full re-embedding, adding less than 10 microseconds of query latency. Compared to operational strategies like full re-indexing or dual-index serving, Drift-Adapter reduces recompute costs by over 100 times and facilitates upgrades with near-zero operational interruption. We analyze robustness to varied model drift, training data size, scalability to billion-item systems, and the impact of design choices like diagonal scaling, demonstrating Drift-Adapter's viability as a pragmatic solution for agile model deployment.</description>

      <title>ML-Asset Management: Curation, Discovery, and Utilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) assets, such as models, datasets, and metadata, are central to modern ML workflows. Despite their explosive growth in practice, these assets are often underutilized due to fragmented documentation, siloed storage, inconsistent licensing, and lack of unified discovery mechanisms, making ML-asset management an urgent challenge. This tutorial offers a comprehensive overview of ML-asset management activities across its lifecycle, including curation, discovery, and utilization. We provide a categorization of ML assets, and major management issues, survey state-of-the-art techniques, and identify emerging opportunities at each stage. We further highlight system-level challenges related to scalability, lineage, and unified indexing. Through live demonstrations of systems, this tutorial equips both researchers and practitioners with actionable insights and practical tools for advancing ML-asset management in real-world and domain-specific settings.</description>

      <title>GBSK: Skeleton Clustering via Granular-ball Computing and Multi-Sampling for Large-Scale Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To effectively handle clustering task for large-scale datasets, we propose a novel scalable skeleton clustering algorithm, namely GBSK, which leverages the granular-ball technique to capture the underlying structure of data. By multi-sampling the dataset and constructing multi-grained granular-balls, GBSK progressively uncovers a statistical "skeleton" -- a spatial abstraction that approximates the essential structure and distribution of the original data. This strategy enables GBSK to dramatically reduce computational overhead while maintaining high clustering accuracy. In addition, we introduce an adaptive version, AGBSK, with simplified parameter settings to enhance usability and facilitate deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted on standard computing hardware demonstrate that GBSK achieves high efficiency and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with up to 100 million instances across 256 dimensions. Our implementation and experimental results are available at: https://github.com/XFastDataLab/GBSK/.</description>

      <title>DocPruner: A Storage-Efficient Framework for Multi-Vector Visual Document Retrieval via Adaptive Patch-Level Embedding Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Document Retrieval (VDR), the task of retrieving visually-rich document pages using queries that combine visual and textual cues, is crucial for numerous real-world applications. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in a multi-vector paradigm, representing each document as patch-level embeddings to capture fine-grained details. While highly effective, this approach introduces a critical challenge: prohibitive storage overhead, as storing hundreds of vectors per page makes large-scale deployment costly and impractical. To address this, we introduce DocPruner, the first framework to employ adaptive patch-level embedding pruning for VDR to effectively reduce the storage overhead. DocPruner leverages the intra-document patch attention distribution to dynamically identify and discard redundant embeddings for each document. This adaptive mechanism enables a significant 50-60% reduction in storage for leading multi-vector VDR models with negligible degradation in document retrieval performance. Extensive experiments across more than ten representative datasets validate that DocPruner offers a robust, flexible, and effective solution for building storage-efficient, large-scale VDR systems.</description>

      <title>AceSearcher: Bootstrapping Reasoning and Search for LLMs via Reinforced Self-Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Search-augmented LLMs often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to ineffective multi-hop retrieval and limited reasoning ability. We propose AceSearcher, a cooperative self-play framework that trains a single large language model (LLM) to alternate between two roles: a decomposer that breaks down complex queries and a solver that integrates retrieved contexts for answer generation. AceSearcher couples supervised fine-tuning on a diverse mixture of search, reasoning, and decomposition tasks with reinforcement fine-tuning optimized for final answer accuracy, eliminating the need for intermediate annotations. Extensive experiments on three reasoning-intensive tasks across 10 datasets show that AceSearcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average exact match improvement of 7.6%. Remarkably, on document-level finance reasoning tasks, AceSearcher-32B matches the performance of the DeepSeek-V3 model using less than 5% of its parameters. Even at smaller scales (1.5B and 8B), AceSearcher often surpasses existing search-augmented LLMs with up to 9x more parameters, highlighting its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness in tackling complex reasoning tasks. Our code will be published at https://github.com/ritaranx/AceSearcher and https://huggingface.co/AceSearcher.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Text-to-SQL: Benchmarking the Limits of Language Models with Collaborative Language Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables natural access to databases, yet most benchmarks are English-only, limiting multilingual progress. We introduce MultiSpider 2.0, extending Spider 2.0 to eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese). It preserves Spider 2.0's structural difficulty while adding linguistic and dialectal variability, demanding deeper reasoning for complex SQL. On this benchmark, state-of-the-art LLMs (such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1) reach only 4\% execution accuracy when relying on intrinsic reasoning, versus 60\% on MultiSpider 1.0. Therefore, we provide a collaboration-driven language agents baseline that iteratively refines queries, improving accuracy to 15\%. These results reveal a substantial multilingual gap and motivate methods that are robust across languages and ready for real-world enterprise deployment. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/phkhanhtrinh23/Multilingual_Text_to_SQL.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sketching and Nearest Neighbor Search Algorithms for Sparse Vector Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse embeddings of data form an attractive class due to their inherent interpretability: Every dimension is tied to a term in some vocabulary, making it easy to visually decipher the latent space. Sparsity, however, poses unique challenges for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) which finds, from a collection of vectors, the k vectors closest to a query. To encourage research on this underexplored topic, sparse ANNS featured prominently in a BigANN Challenge at NeurIPS 2023, where approximate algorithms were evaluated on large benchmark datasets by throughput and accuracy. In this work, we introduce a set of novel data structures and algorithmic methods, a combination of which leads to an elegant, effective, and highly efficient solution to sparse ANNS. Our contributions range from a theoretically-grounded sketching algorithm for sparse vectors to reduce their effective dimensionality while preserving inner product-induced ranks; a geometric organization of the inverted index; and the blending of local and global information to improve the efficiency and efficacy of ANNS. Empirically, our final algorithm, dubbed Seismic, reaches sub-millisecond per-query latency with high accuracy on a large-scale benchmark dataset using a single CPU.</description>

      <title>Scaling Generalist Data-Analytic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-analytic agents are emerging as a key catalyst for automated scientific discovery and for the vision of Innovating AI. Current approaches, however, rely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source models struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and long-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This paper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe designed to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key challenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient data resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn rollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a recursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and difficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling strategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically adjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a memory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on DataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning diverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic tasks. Trained on DataMind-12K, our DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art with an average score of 71.16% on multiple data analysis benchmarks, outperforming the strongest proprietary baselines DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. Our DataMind-7B also performs best among all open-source models with a score of 68.10%. We also incorporate some empirical insights gained from our exploratory trials into the analysis experiments, aiming to provide actionable insights about agentic training for the community. We will release DataMind-12K and DataMind-7B,14B for the community's future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: jina-reranker-v3 is a 0.6B parameter multilingual document reranker that introduces a novel last but not late interaction. Unlike late interaction models such as ColBERT that perform separate encoding followed by multi-vector matching, our approach conducts causal self-attention between query and documents within the same context window, enabling rich cross-document interactions before extracting contextual embeddings from the last token of each document. This compact architecture achieves state-of-the-art BEIR performance with 61.94 nDCG@10 while being ten times smaller than generative listwise rerankers.</description>

Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) can autonomously conduct complex investigations and generate comprehensive reports, demonstrating strong real-world potential. However, existing evaluations mostly rely on close-ended benchmarks, while open-ended deep research benchmarks remain scarce and typically neglect personalized scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Personalized Deep Research Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating personalization in DRAs. It pairs 50 diverse research tasks across 10 domains with 25 authentic user profiles that combine structured persona attributes with dynamic real-world contexts, yielding 250 realistic user-task queries. To assess system performance, we propose the PQR Evaluation Framework, which jointly measures (P) Personalization Alignment, (Q) Content Quality, and (R) Factual Reliability. Our experiments on a range of systems highlight current capabilities and limitations in handling personalized deep research. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for developing and evaluating the next generation of truly personalized AI research assistants.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning for Generative Retrieval over Dynamic Corpora</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative retrieval (GR) directly predicts the identifiers of relevant documents (i.e., docids) based on a parametric model. It has achieved solid performance on many ad-hoc retrieval tasks. So far, these tasks have assumed a static document collection. In many practical scenarios, however, document collections are dynamic, where new documents are continuously added to the corpus. The ability to incrementally index new documents while preserving the ability to answer queries with both previously and newly indexed relevant documents is vital to applying GR models. In this paper, we address this practical continual learning problem for GR. We put forward a novel Continual-LEarner for generatiVE Retrieval (CLEVER) model and make two major contributions to continual learning for GR: (i) To encode new documents into docids with low computational cost, we present Incremental Product Quantization, which updates a partial quantization codebook according to two adaptive thresholds; and (ii) To memorize new documents for querying without forgetting previous knowledge, we propose a memory-augmented learning mechanism, to form meaningful connections between old and new documents. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Break the ID-Language Barrier: An Adaption Framework for LLM-based Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent breakthrough of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing has sparked exploration in recommendation systems, however, their limited domain-specific knowledge remains a critical bottleneck. Specifically, LLMs lack key pieces of information crucial for sequential recommendations, such as user behavior patterns. To address this critical gap, we propose IDLE-Adapter, a novel framework that integrates pre-trained ID embeddings, rich in domain-specific knowledge, into LLMs to improve recommendation accuracy. IDLE-Adapter acts as a bridge, transforming sparse user-item interaction data into dense, LLM-compatible representations through a Pre-trained ID Sequential Model, Dimensionality Alignment, Layer-wise Embedding Refinement, and Layer-wise Distribution Alignment. Furthermore, IDLE-Adapter demonstrates remarkable flexibility by seamlessly integrating ID embeddings from diverse ID-based sequential models and LLM architectures. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the superiority of IDLE-Adapter, achieving over 10\% and 20\% improvements in HitRate@5 and NDCG@5 metrics, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Establishing a Foundation for Tetun Ad-Hoc Text Retrieval: Stemming, Indexing, Retrieval, and Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11758v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searching for information on the internet and digital platforms requires effective retrieval solutions. However, such solutions are not yet available for Tetun, making it difficult to find relevant documents for search queries in this language. To address this gap, we investigate Tetun text retrieval with a focus on the ad-hoc retrieval task. The study begins with the development of essential language resources -- including a list of stopwords, a stemmer, and a test collection -- that serve as a foundation for Tetun text retrieval. Various strategies are evaluated using document titles and content. The results show that retrieving document titles, after removing hyphens and apostrophes but without applying stemming, improves performance compared to the baseline. Efficiency increases by 31.37\%, while effectiveness achieves an average relative gains of +9.40\% in MAP@10 and +30.35\% in NDCG@10 with DFR BM25. Beyond the top-10 cutoff point, Hiemstra LM demonstrates strong performance across multiple retrieval strategies and evaluation metrics. The contributions of this work include the development of \textit{Labadain-Stopwords} (a list of 160 Tetun stopwords), \textit{Labadain-Stemmer} (a Tetun stemmer with three variants), and \textit{Labadain-Avaliad\'or} (a Tetun test collection comprising 59 topics, 33,550 documents, and 5,900 \textit{qrels}). These resources are publicly available to support future research in Tetun information retrieval.</description>

      <title>SRA-CL: Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has shown effectiveness in improving sequential recommendation models. However, existing methods still face challenges in generating high-quality contrastive pairs: they either rely on random perturbations that corrupt user preference patterns or depend on sparse collaborative data that generates unreliable contrastive pairs. Furthermore, existing approaches typically require predefined selection rules that impose strong assumptions, limiting the model's ability to autonomously learn optimal contrastive pairs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning (SRA-CL). SRA-CL leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to generate expressive embeddings that capture both user preferences and item characteristics. These semantic embeddings enable the construction of candidate pools for inter-user and intra-user contrastive learning through semantic-based retrieval. To further enhance the quality of the contrastive samples, we introduce a learnable sample synthesizer that optimizes the contrastive sample generation process during model training. SRA-CL adopts a plug-and-play design, enabling seamless integration with existing sequential recommendation architectures. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and model-agnostic nature of our approach.</description>

      <title>KAQG: A Knowledge-Graph-Enhanced RAG for Difficulty-Controlled Question Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces Knowledge Augmented Question Generation (KAQG), an educational assessment framework that integrates Item Response Theory, abbreviated as IRT, Bloom's Taxonomy, and knowledge graphs into a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The proposed approach overcomes limitations of existing methods by enabling fine-grained control over item difficulty, psychometric calibration, and cognitive alignment. It employs multi-graph isolation to preserve domain-specific semantics and leverages a distributed agent architecture coordinated through Data Distribution Service, abbreviated as DDS, for scalable and fault-tolerant operations. Each agent specializes in tasks such as retrieval, generation, or evaluation, forming a modular and traceable pipeline. Distinctively, the framework encodes semantic hierarchies, PageRank-based concept weighting, and assessment-theory parameters directly into the generation process, ensuring that questions are both contextually grounded and cognitively calibrated. Deployed at Taiwan's National Institute of Environmental Research, the system has demonstrated practical value by reducing manual workload, improving reliability and validity, and supporting both adaptive and standardized assessments. By integrating psychometric theory with AI-driven retrieval and generation, this work establishes a scalable and cognitively aligned solution for education and professional certification.</description>

      <title>TranSUN: A Preemptive Paradigm to Eradicate Retransformation Bias Intrinsically from Regression Models in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regression models are crucial in recommender systems. However, retransformation bias problem has been conspicuously neglected within the community. While many works in other fields have devised effective bias correction methods, all of them are post-hoc cures externally to the model, facing practical challenges when applied to real-world recommender systems. Hence, we propose a preemptive paradigm to eradicate the bias intrinsically from the models via minor model refinement. Specifically, a novel TranSUN method is proposed with a joint bias learning manner to offer theoretically guaranteed unbiasedness under empirical superior convergence. It is further generalized into a novel generic regression model family, termed Generalized TranSUN (GTS), which not only offers more theoretical insights but also serves as a generic framework for flexibly developing various bias-free models. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods across data from various domains, which have been successfully deployed in two real-world industrial recommendation scenarios, i.e. product and short video recommendation scenarios in Guess What You Like business domain in the homepage of Taobao App (a leading e-commerce platform with DAU &gt; 300M), to serve the major online traffic.</description>

      <title>R1-Ranker: Teaching LLM Rankers to Reason</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning abilities in domains like mathematics, coding, and scientific problem-solving, yet their potential for ranking tasks, where prime examples include retrieval, recommender systems, and LLM routing, remains underexplored. Ranking requires complex reasoning across heterogeneous candidates, but existing LLM-based rankers are often domain-specific, tied to fixed backbones, and lack iterative refinement, limiting their ability to fully exploit LLMs' reasoning potential. To address these challenges, we propose R1-Ranker, a reasoning-incentive framework built on reinforcement learning, with two complementary designs: DRanker, which generates full rankings in one shot, and IRanker, which decomposes ranking into an iterative elimination process with step-wise rewards to encourage deeper reasoning. We evaluate unified R1-Rankers on nine datasets spanning recommendation, routing, and passage ranking, showing that IRanker-3B consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpasses larger 7B models on some tasks, and yields a 15.7% average relative improvement. Ablation and generalization experiments further confirm the critical role of reinforcement learning and iterative reasoning, with IRanker-3B improving zero-shot performance by over 9% on out-of-domain tasks and reasoning traces boosting other LLMs by up to 22.87%. These results demonstrate that unifying diverse ranking tasks with a single reasoning-driven foundation model is both effective and essential for advancing LLM reasoning in ranking scenarios.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Live Broadcast Engagement: A Multi-modal Approach to Short Video Recommendations Using MMGCN and User Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explore a multi-modal approach to enhancing live broadcast engagement by developing a short video recommendation system that incorporates Multi-modal Graph Convolutional Networks (MMGCN) with user preferences. To provide personalized recommendations tailored to individual interests, the proposed system considers user interaction data, video content features, and contextual information. With the aid of a hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques, the system can capture nuanced relationships between users, video attributes, and engagement patterns. Three datasets are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system: Kwai, TikTok, and MovieLens. Compared to baseline models, such as DeepFM, Wide &amp; Deep, LightGBM, and XGBoost, the proposed MMGCN-based model shows superior performance. A notable feature of the proposed model is that it outperforms all baseline methods in capturing diverse user preferences and making accurate, personalized recommendations, resulting in a Kwai F1 score of 0.574, a Tiktok F1 score of 0.506, and a MovieLens F1 score of 0.197. We emphasize the importance of multi-modal integration and user-centric approaches in advancing recommender systems, emphasizing the role they play in enhancing content discovery and audience interaction on live broadcast platforms.</description>

      <title>SEARA: An Automated Approach for Obtaining Optimal Retrievers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a core approach for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), where the effectiveness of the retriever largely determines the overall response quality of RAG systems. Retrievers encompass a multitude of hyperparameters that significantly impact performance outcomes and demonstrate sensitivity to specific applications. Nevertheless, hyperparameter optimization entails prohibitively high computational expenses. Existing evaluation methods suffer from either prohibitive costs or disconnection from domain-specific scenarios. This paper proposes SEARA (Subset sampling Evaluation for Automatic Retriever Assessment), which addresses evaluation data challenges through subset sampling techniques and achieves robust automated retriever evaluation by minimal retrieval facts extraction and comprehensive retrieval metrics. Based on real user queries, this method enables fully automated retriever evaluation at low cost, thereby obtaining optimal retriever for specific business scenarios. We validate our method across classic RAG applications in rednote, including knowledge-based Q\&amp;A system and retrieval-based travel assistant, successfully obtaining scenario-specific optimal retrievers.</description>

      <title>LexSemBridge: Fine-Grained Dense Representation Enhancement through Token-Aware Embedding Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As queries in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines powered by large language models (LLMs) become increasingly complex and diverse, dense retrieval models have demonstrated strong performance in semantic matching. Nevertheless, they often struggle with fine-grained retrieval tasks, where precise keyword alignment and span-level localization are required, even in cases with high lexical overlap that would intuitively suggest easier retrieval. To systematically evaluate this limitation, we introduce two targeted tasks, keyword retrieval and part-of-passage retrieval, designed to simulate practical fine-grained scenarios. Motivated by these observations, we propose LexSemBridge, a unified framework that enhances dense query representations through fine-grained, input-aware vector modulation. LexSemBridge constructs latent enhancement vectors from input tokens using three paradigms: Statistical (SLR), Learned (LLR), and Contextual (CLR), and integrates them with dense embeddings via element-wise interaction. Theoretically, we show that this modulation preserves the semantic direction while selectively amplifying discriminative dimensions. LexSemBridge operates as a plug-in without modifying the backbone encoder and naturally extends to both text and vision modalities. Extensive experiments across semantic and fine-grained retrieval tasks validate the effectiveness and generality of our approach. All code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Jasaxion/LexSemBridge/</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemistry is an example of a discipline where the advancements of technology have led to multi-level and often tangled and tricky processes ongoing in the lab. The repeatedly complex workflows are combined with information from chemical structures, which are essential to understand the scientific process. An important tool for many chemists is Chemotion, which consists of an electronic lab notebook and a repository. This paper introduces a semantic pipeline for constructing the BFO-compliant Chemotion Knowledge Graph, providing an integrated, ontology-driven representation of chemical research data. The Chemotion-KG has been developed to adhere to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles and to support AI-driven discovery and reasoning in chemistry. Experimental metadata were harvested from the Chemotion API in JSON-LD format, converted into RDF, and subsequently transformed into a Basic Formal Ontology-aligned graph through SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries. The source code and datasets are publicly available via GitHub. The Chemotion Knowledge Graph is hosted by FIZ Karlsruhe Information Service Engineering. Outcomes presented in this work were achieved within the Leibniz Science Campus ``Digital Transformation of Research'' (DiTraRe) and are part of an ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration.</description>

      <title>Grocery to General Merchandise: A Cross-Pollination Recommender using LLMs and Real-Time Cart Context</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern e-commerce platforms strive to enhance customer experience by providing timely and contextually relevant recommendations. However, recommending general merchandise to customers focused on grocery shopping -- such as pairing milk with a milk frother -- remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. This paper introduces a cross-pollination (XP) framework, a novel approach that bridges grocery and general merchandise cross-category recommendations by leveraging multi-source product associations and real-time cart context. Our solution employs a two-stage framework: (1) A candidate generation mechanism that uses co-purchase market basket analysis and LLM-based approach to identify novel item-item associations; and (2) a transformer-based ranker that leverages the real-time sequential cart context and optimizes for engagement signals such as add-to-carts. Offline analysis and online A/B tests show an increase of 36\% add-to-cart rate with LLM-based retrieval on the item page, and 15\% lift in add-to-cart using cart context-based ranker on the cart page. Our work contributes practical techniques for cross-category recommendations and broader insights for e-commerce systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present TalkPlayData 2, a synthetic dataset for multimodal conversational music recommendation generated by an agentic data pipeline. In the proposed pipeline, multiple large language model (LLM) agents are created under various roles with specialized prompts and access to different parts of information, and the chat data is acquired by logging the conversation between the Listener LLM and the Recsys LLM. To cover various conversation scenarios, for each conversation, the Listener LLM is conditioned on a finetuned conversation goal. Finally, all the LLMs are multimodal with audio and images, allowing a simulation of multimodal recommendation and conversation. In the LLM-as-a-judge and subjective evaluation experiments, TalkPlayData 2 achieved the proposed goal in various aspects related to training a generative recommendation model for music. TalkPlayData 2 and its generation code are open-sourced at https://talkpl.ai/talkplaydata2.html.</description>

      <title>Denoising Neural Reranker for Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: For multi-stage recommenders in industry, a user request would first trigger a simple and efficient retriever module that selects and ranks a list of relevant items, then the recommender calls a slower but more sophisticated reranking model that refines the item list exposure to the user. To consistently optimize the two-stage retrieval reranking framework, most efforts have focused on learning reranker-aware retrievers. In contrast, there has been limited work on how to achieve a retriever-aware reranker. In this work, we provide evidence that the retriever scores from the previous stage are informative signals that have been underexplored. Specifically, we first empirically show that the reranking task under the two-stage framework is naturally a noise reduction problem on the retriever scores, and theoretically show the limitations of naive utilization techniques of the retriever scores. Following this notion, we derive an adversarial framework DNR that associates the denoising reranker with a carefully designed noise generation module. The resulting DNR solution extends the conventional score error minimization loss with three augmented objectives, including: 1) a denoising objective that aims to denoise the noisy retriever scores to align with the user feedback; 2) an adversarial retriever score generation objective that improves the exploration in the retriever score space; and 3) a distribution regularization term that aims to align the distribution of generated noisy retriever scores with the real ones. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets and an industrial recommender system, together with analytical support, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed DNR.</description>

      <title>Documentation Retrieval Improves Planning Language Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certain strong LLMs have shown promise for zero-shot formal planning by generating planning languages like PDDL. Yet, the performance of most open-source models under 50B parameters has been reported to be close to zero due to the low-resource nature of these languages. We significantly improve their performance via a series of lightweight pipelines that integrates documentation retrieval with modular code generation and error refinement. With models like Llama-4-Maverick, our best pipeline improves plan correctness from 0% to over 80% on the common BlocksWorld domain. However, while syntactic errors are substantially reduced, semantic errors persist in more challenging domains, revealing fundamental limitations in current models' reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Multi-Head RAG: Solving Multi-Aspect Problems with LLMs</title>

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Reversed in Time: A Novel Temporal-Emphasized Benchmark for Cross-Modal Video-Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-modal (e.g. image-text, video-text) retrieval is an important task in information retrieval and multimodal vision-language understanding field. Temporal understanding makes video-text retrieval more challenging than image-text retrieval. However, we find that the widely used video-text benchmarks have shortcomings in comprehensively assessing abilities of models, especially in temporal understanding, causing large-scale image-text pre-trained models can already achieve comparable zero-shot performance with video-text pre-trained models. In this paper, we introduce RTime, a novel temporal-emphasized video-text retrieval dataset. We first obtain videos of actions or events with significant temporality, and then reverse these videos to create harder negative samples. We then recruit annotators to judge the significance and reversibility of candidate videos, and write captions for qualified videos. We further adopt GPT-4 to extend more captions based on human-written captions. Our RTime dataset currently consists of 21k videos with 10 captions per video, totalling about 122 hours. Based on RTime, we propose three retrieval benchmark tasks: RTime-Origin, RTime-Hard, and RTime-Binary. We further enhance the use of harder-negatives in model training, and benchmark a variety of video-text models on RTime. Extensive experiment analysis proves that RTime indeed poses new and higher challenges to video-text retrieval. We release our RTime dataset https://github.com/qyr0403/Reversed-in-Time to further advance video-text retrieval and multimodal understanding research.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Customized Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of tasks, yet their application to specialized domains remains challenging due to the need for deep expertise. Retrieval-Augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to customize LLMs for professional fields by seamlessly integrating external knowledge bases, enabling real-time access to domain-specific expertise during inference. Despite its potential, traditional RAG systems, based on flat text retrieval, face three critical challenges: (i) complex query understanding in professional contexts, (ii) difficulties in knowledge integration across distributed sources, and (iii) system efficiency bottlenecks at scale. This survey presents a systematic analysis of Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG), a new paradigm that revolutionizes domain-specific LLM applications. GraphRAG addresses traditional RAG limitations through three key innovations: (i) graph-structured knowledge representation that explicitly captures entity relationships and domain hierarchies, (ii) efficient graph-based retrieval techniques that enable context-preserving knowledge retrieval with multihop reasoning ability, and (iii) structure-aware knowledge integration algorithms that leverage retrieved knowledge for accurate and logical coherent generation of LLMs. In this survey, we systematically analyze the technical foundations of GraphRAG and examine current implementations across various professional domains, identifying key technical challenges and promising research directions. All the related resources of GraphRAG, including research papers, open-source data, and projects, are collected for the community in https://github.com/DEEP-PolyU/Awesome-GraphRAG.</description>

      <title>Automatically Advancing LLM Expertise in Technology Judgment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12452v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming core tools for science, engineering, and innovation. Their promise lies not just in remembering facts, but in putting knowledge to work. Despite their impressive ability to answer increasingly difficult questions, it remains unclear whether LLMs truly use their knowledge when confronted with new and challenging tasks. We address this question with a patent classification task that requires deep conceptual understanding: distinguishing objectively different but semantically similar patents. To evaluate this approach, we introduce a challenging new benchmark of 1.3 million post-2015 computer science patent pairs, characterized by dense technical jargon and strategically complex writing. We find that LLMs often fail our benchmark and struggle to distinguish among semantically similar patents. To probe this failure, we introduce a novel framework that decomposes model errors into two sources: missing and unused knowledge. Our approach asks models to generate clarifying questions to improve their understanding, and then compares three settings: raw performance, self-answered questions, and externally supplied answers. This decomposition reveals that LLMs often possess the relevant knowledge internally but fail to deploy it, while a smaller share of errors arises from genuine knowledge gaps. We then ask whether the ability of models to construct a task-specific database of questions and answers differs across models. We find that smaller models generate simpler, broadly transferable questions, while larger models propose more complex but less generalizable ones. This suggests new strategies for combining strengths across models. Our findings highlight a critical limitation of current LLMs and their evaluation: models often know more than they can use. LLM evaluation should shift from recall of static facts to application of dynamic knowledge.</description>

      <title>From Drawings to Decisions: A Hybrid Vision-Language Framework for Parsing 2D Engineering Drawings into Structured Manufacturing Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering drawings is essential for advancing digital manufacturing workflows. Such information includes geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&amp;T), measures, material specifications, and textual annotations. Manual extraction is slow and labor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts, engineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable outputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that integrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a transformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies YOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB) patches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned, lightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D mechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is trained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These are parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are lightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited computational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated dataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a comparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four key metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2% recall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%. Finally, a case study demonstrates how the extracted structured information supports downstream manufacturing tasks such as process and tool selection, showcasing the practical utility of the proposed framework in modernizing 2D drawing interpretation.</description>

      <title>RED: Robust Event-Guided Motion Deblurring with Modality-Specific Disentangled Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-resolution motion information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. However, the delicate events are highly susceptible to noise. Although noise can be reduced by raising the threshold of Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), this inevitably causes under-reporting of events. Most existing event-guided deblurring methods overlook this practical trade-off, and the indiscriminate feature extraction and naive fusion result in unstable and mixed representations and ultimately unsatisfactory performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that mimics various DVS thresholds, exposing RED to diverse under-reporting patterns and thereby fostering robustness under unknown conditions. With an adaption to RPS, a Modality-specific Representation Mechanism (MRM) is designed to explicitly model semantic understanding, motion priors, and cross-modality correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two interactive modules are presented to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry images and inject semantic context into under-reporting event representations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and robustness.</description>
