      <title>Hodge structures of the surface of planes in a cubic 5-fold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometry of the moduli space of planes in a general cubic 5-fold and its deformation. We show that this moduli space is a smooth projective surface whose canonical bundle is ample. We also show that the variation of degree 1 Hodge structures of a particular family of such surfaces is maximal. The main technical input is the hyper-Kahler geometry and an elaborated calculation of the Hodge numbers of such surfaces Keywords: Cubic hypersurfaces, Hyper-Kahler manifolds, Schubert calculus, Variation of Hodge structures</description>

      <title>Enumerating log rational curves on some toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The genus 0, fixed-domain log Gromov-Witten invariants of a smooth, projective toric variety X enumerate maps from a general pointed rational curve to a smooth, projective toric variety passing through the maximal number of general points and with prescribed multiplicities along the toric boundary. We determine these invariants completely for the projective bundle X=P_{P^r}(O^s+O(-a)), proving a conjecture of Cela--Iribar L\'opez. A different conjecture when X is the blow-up of P^r at r points is disproven. Whereas the conjectures were predicted using tropical methods, we give direct intersection-theoretic calculations on moduli spaces of "naive log quasimaps."</description>

      <title>Weighted surfaces with maximal Picard number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An algorithm due to Shioda computes the Picard number for certain surfaces which are defined by a single equation with exactly four monomials, called Delsarte surfaces. We consider this method for surfaces in weighted projective $3$-space with quotient singularities. We give a criterion for such a weighted Delsarte surface $X$ to have maximal Picard number. This condition is surprisingly related to the automorphism group of $X$. For every positive integer $s$, we find a weighted Delsarte surface with geometric genus $s$ and maximal Picard number. We show that these examples are elliptic surfaces, proving that elliptic surfaces of maximal Picard number and arbitrary geometric genus may be embedded as quasismooth hypersurfaces in weighted projective space.</description>

      <title>Linear Geometry and Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear Geometry studies geometric properties which can be expressed via the notion of a line. All information about lines is encoded in a ternary relation called a line relation. A set endowed with a line relation is called a liner. So, Linear Geometry studies liners. Imposing some additional axioms on a liner, we obtain some special classes of liners: regular, projective, affine, proaffine, etc. Linear Geometry includes Affine and Projective Geometries and is a part of Incidence Geometry. The aim of this book is to present a self-contained logical development of Linear Geometry, starting with some intuitive acceptable geometric axioms and ending with algebraic structures that necessarily arise from studying the structure of geometric objects that satisfy those simple and intuitive geometric axioms. We shall meet many quite exotic algebraic structures that arise this way: magmas, loops, ternary-ring, quasi-fields, alternative rings, procorps, profields, etc. We strongly prefer (synthetic) geometric proofs and use tools of analytic geometry only when no purely geometric proof is available. Liner Geometry has been developed by many great mathematicians since times of Antiquity (Thales, Euclides, Proclus, Pappus), through Renaissance (Descartes, Desargues), Early Modernity (Playfair, Gauss, Lobachevski, Bolyai, Poncelet, Steiner, M\"obius), Late Modernity Times (Steinitz, Klein, Hilbert, Moufang, Hessenberg, Jordan, Beltrami, Fano, Gallucci, Veblen, Wedderburn, Lenz, Barlotti) till our contempories (Hartshorne, Hall, Buekenhout, Gleason, Kantor, Doyen, Hubault, Dembowski, Klingenberg, Grundh\"ofer).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a smooth rationally connected projective threefold of Picard number two is toric if and only if it admits an int-amplified endomorphism. As a corollary, we show that a totally invariant smooth curve of a non-isomorphic surjective endomorphism of $\mathbb{P}^3$ must be a line when it is blowup-equivariant.</description>

      <title>The refined local Donaldson-Thomas theory of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the $K$-theoretically refined Donaldson-Thomas theory of local curves. Our results avoid degeneration techniques, but rather exploit direct localisation methods to reduce the refined Donaldson-Thomas partition function to the equivariant intersection theory of skew nested Hilbert schemes on smooth projective curves. We show that the latter is determined, for every Young diagram, by three universal series, which we compute in terms of the 1-leg $K$-theoretic equivariant vertex. In the refined limit, our results establish a formula for the refined topological string partition function of local curves proposed by Aganagic-Schaeffer. In the second part, we show that analogous structural results hold for the refined Pandharipande-Thomas theory of local curves. As an application, we deduce the K-theoretic DT/PT correspondence for local curves in arbitrary genus, as conjectured by Nekrasov-Okounkov.
  Thanks to the recent machinery developed by Pardon, we expect our explicit results on local curves to play a key role towards the proof of the refined GW/PT conjectural correspondence of Brini-Schuler for all smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

      <title>Virtual invariants of Quot schemes of points on threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an almost perfect obstruction theory of virtual dimension zero on the Quot scheme parametrizing zero-dimensional quotients of a locally free sheaf on a smooth projective $3$-fold. This gives a virtual class in degree zero and therefore allows one to define virtual invariants of the Quot scheme. We compute these invariants proving a conjecture by Ricolfi. The computation is done by reducing to the toric case via cobordism theory and a degeneration argument. The toric case is solved by reducing to the computation on the Quot scheme of points on $\mathbb{A}^3$ via torus localization, the torus-equivariant Siebert's formula for almost perfect obstruction theories and the torus-equivariant Jouanolou trick.</description>

      <title>The kernel of the Gysin homomorphism for smooth projective curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a smooth projective connected surface over an algebraically closed field $k$ and $\Sigma$ the linear system of a very ample divisor $D$ on $S$. Let $d:=\dim(\Sigma)$ be the dimension of $\Sigma$ and $\phi_{\Sigma}: S \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^{d}$ the closed embedding of $S$ into $\mathbb{P}^{d}$, induced by $\Sigma$. For any closed point $t\in\Sigma \cong\mathbb{P}^{d^*}$, let $C_t$ be the corresponding hyperplane section on $S$, and let $ r_t:C_t\hookrightarrow S$ be the closed embedding of the curve $C_t$ into $S$. Let $\Delta:= \{t \in \Sigma: C_t \text{ is singular}\}$ be the discriminant locus of $\Sigma$ and let $U :=\Sigma\setminus \Delta$.
  For $t \in U$, the kernel of the Gysin homomorphism of the Chow groups of $0$-cycles of degree zero, from $CH_0(C_t)_{deg=0}$ to $CH_0(S)_{deg=0}$ is the countable union of shifts of a certain abelian subvariety $A_t$ inside $J(C_t)$, the Jacobian of the curve $C_t$ (\cite{PS24} for $k \cong \mathbb{C}$, \cite{SW25} for $k \cong \overline{\mathbb{F}_q((t))}$). We prove that for every closed point $t \in U$ either $A_t$ coincides with the abelian variety $B_t$ inside $J(C_t)$ corresponding to the vanishing cohomology $H^1(C_t, k')_{van}$, where $k'$ is the minimal field of definition of $k$, and then the Gysin kernel is a countable union of shifts of $B_t$, or $A_t = 0$, in which case the Gysin kernel is countable. Using the language of algebraic stacks as a generalisation of algebraic varieties this is done by constructing an increasing filtration of Zariski countable open substacks $U_i, i \in I,$ of $U$, where $I$ is a countable set and by applying a convergence argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the recent theory of Sun-Zhang on general Fano fibration (germs) which emerged from the study of non-compact Kahler-Ricci soliton metrics, primarily from an algebro-geometric perspective. In addition to reviewing the existing framework, we present new results, conjectures, and remarks. These include methods for computing weighted volumes via (restricted) volumes, Laplace transforms, and incomplete Gamma-functions, and a conjectural algebro-geometric construction (``bubbling") of asymptotically conical Fano fibrations from degenerating Fano fibrations.</description>

      <title>K3 surfaces over small number fields and Kummer constructions in families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct K3 surfaces over number fields that have good reduction everywhere. These do not exists over the rational numbers, by results of Abrashkin and Fontaine. Our surfaces exist for three quadratic number fields, and an infinite family of $S_3$-number fields. To this end we develop a theory of Kummer constructions in families, based on Romagny's notion of the effective models, here applied to sign involutions. This includes quotients of non-normal surfaces by infinitesimal group schemes in characteristic two, as developed by Kondo and myself. By the results of Brieskorn and Artin, the resulting families of normal K3 surfaces admit simultaneous resolutions of singularities, at least after suitable base-changes. These resolutions are constructed in two ways: First, by blowing-up families of one-dimensional centers that acquire embedded components. Second, by computing various l-adic local systems in terms of representation theory, and invoking Shepherd-Barrons results on the resolution functor, which is representable by a highly non-separated algebraic space.</description>

      <title>FTheoryTools: Advancing Computational Capabilities for F-Theory Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A primary goal of string phenomenology is to identify realistic four-dimensional physics within the landscape of string theory solutions. In F-theory, such solutions are encoded in the geometry of singular elliptic fibrations, whose study often requires particularly challenging and cumbersome computations. In this work, we introduce FTheoryTools, a novel software module integrated into the OSCAR computer algebra system, designed to automate the complex and tedious tasks involved in F-theory model building. Key features of FTheoryTools include the enumeration of G4-fluxes, the capability to perform blowups on arbitrary (including non-toric) loci, and a literature database of existing F-theory constructions employing a MaRDI-based data format for enhanced collaboration and reproducibility. As a demonstration of its power, we present a stress test by applying FTheoryTools to the challenging F-theory geometry with most flux vacua (arXiv:1511.03209). Our results illustrate the potential of FTheoryTools to streamline F-theory research and pave the way for future developments in the computational study of string phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Geometry of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vacuum structure of a quantum field theory is a crucial property. In theories with extended symmetries, such as supersymmetric gauge theories, the vacuum is typically a continuous manifold, called the vacuum moduli space, parametrized by the expectation values of scalar fields. Starting from the R-parity preserving superpotential at renormalizable order, we use Gr\"obner bases to determine the explicit structure, as an algebraic variety, of the vacuum geometry of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model. Gr\"obner bases have doubly exponential computational complexity (for this case, $7^{2^{1023}}$ operations); we exploit symmetry and multigrading to render the computation tractable. This geometry has three irreducible components of complex dimensions $1$, $15$, and $29$, each being a so-called rational variety. The defining equations of the components express the solutions to F-terms and D-terms in terms of the gauge invariant operators and are interpreted in terms of classical geometric constructions.</description>

      <title>The Vacuum Moduli Space of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A starting point in the study of the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is the vacuum moduli space, which is a highly complicated algebraic variety: it is the image of an affine variety $X \subset \mathbb{C}^{49}$ under a symplectic quotient map $\phi$ to $\mathbb{C}^{973}$. Previous work computed the vacuum moduli space of the electroweak sector; geometrically this corresponds to studying a restriction of $\phi$: $\mathbb{C}^{13} \stackrel{\phi^{\texttt{res}}}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{C}^{22}$. We analyze the geometry of the full vacuum moduli space for superpotentials $W_{\rm minimal}$ (without neutrinos) and $W_{\rm MSSM}$ (with neutrinos) in $\mathbb{C}^{973}$. In both cases, we prove that $X$ consists of three irreducible components $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$, and determine the images $M_i$ of the $X_i$ under $\phi$. For $W_{\rm minimal}$ we show they have, respectively, dimensions $1$, $15$, and $29$, and prove that each of the $M_i$ is a rational variety, while for $W_{\rm MSSM}$ we show that $M_3$ is the only component. Restricting the $M_i$ to the electroweak sector, we recover known results. We describe the components of the vacuum moduli space geometrically in terms of incidence varieties to a product of Segre varieties.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{E}_2$-algebra structures on the derived center of an algebraic scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an explicit interface between J. Lurie's work on higher centers, and the Hochschild cohomology of an algebraic $\mathbb{k}$-scheme within the framework of deformation quantization. We first recover a canonical solution to Deligne's conjecture on Hochschild cochains in the affine and global cases, even for singular schemes, by exhibiting the Hochschild complex as an $\infty$-operadic center. We then prove that this universal $\mathbb{E}_2$-algebra structure precisely agrees with the classical Gerstenhaber bracket and cup product on cohomology in the affine and smooth cases. This last statement follows from our main technical result which allows us to extract the Gerstenhaber bracket of any $\mathbb{E}_2$-algebra obtained from a 2-algebra via Lurie's Dunn Additivity Theorem.</description>

      <title>Examples of complete Calabi--Yau metrics on affine smoothings of irregular toric Calabi--Yau cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new examples of affine Calabi--Yau manifolds of Euclidean volume growth and quadratic curvature decay, whose tangent cones at infinity are irregular and have smooth links. In the process, we demonstrate (and provide the relevant computer code) how to explicitly compute the Reeb field and all Minkowski decompositions of a given toric Calabi--Yau cone with smooth link from the data of its toric polytope. Minkowski decompositions of this polytope into lattice segments and/or triangles give rise to smoothings of the given cone. Furthermore, we propose an effective strategy to generate smoothable Calabi--Yau cones from a given non-smoothable one by taking Minkowski sums of certain toric diagrams, and provide an example to illustrate the method.</description>

      <title>On the Residue Sequence in Logarithmic Topological Cyclic Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a localizing invariant, THH participates in localization sequences of cyclotomic spectra. We resolve a conjecture of Rognes by relating these to residue sequences in logarithmic THH. Consequently, logarithmic THH, TR, and TC serve as strict generalizations of the constructions of Hesselholt--Madsen and Blumberg--Mandell, which moreover enjoy localization sequences without the regularity hypotheses usually required for d\'evissage. Combined with work of Ramzi--Sosnilo--Winges, our results imply that there exists a stable infinity-category C such that THH(C), TR(C), and TC(C) realize the relevant logarithmic term for specific log structures, such as the natural ones on discrete valuation rings, connective complex K-theory, and truncated Brown--Peterson spectra. Finally, we conjecture that the category C can be chosen to reflect the additional structure present on the logarithmic terms, and we give evidence for this in the case of discrete valuation rings.</description>

      <title>A ringed-space-like structure on coalgebras for noncommutative algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the perspective of Reyes' noncomutative spectral theory, we attempt to develop noncommutative algebraic geometry by introducing ringed coalgebras, which can be thought of as a noncommutative generalization of schemes over a field $k$. These objects arise from fully residually finite-dimensional(RFD) algebras introduced by Reyes and from schemes locally of finite type over $k$. The construction uses the Heyneman-Sweedler finite dual coalgebra and the Takeuchi underlying coalgebra. When $k$ is algebraically closed, the formation of ringed coalgebras gives a fully faithful functor out of the category of fully RFD algebras, as well as a fully faithful functor out of the category of schemes locally of finite type. The restrictions of these two functors to the category of (commutative) finitely generated algebras are isomorphic. Finally, we introduce modules over ringed coalgebras and show that the category of finitely generated modules on a fully RFD algebra and that of coherent sheaves on a scheme locally of finite type can, if $k$ is algebraically closed, be fully faithfully embedded into the category of modules over the corresponding ringed coalgebras.</description>

      <title>Volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces with cone points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13701v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic, cusp and cone boundary components. We compute the volumes in some new cases, in particular when there exists a large cone angle. This allows us to give geometric meaning to Mirzakhani's polynomials under substitution of imaginary valued boundary lengths, corresponding to hyperbolic cone angles, and to study the behaviour of the volume under the $2\pi$ limit of a cone angle.</description>

      <title>Filtrations on the derived category of twisted K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study the Shen-Yin-Zhao filtration on derived categories of twisted K3 surfaces. A main contribution is the construction of a twisted Beauville-Voisin class $\mathfrak{o}_{\mathscr{X}} \in \operatorname{CH}_0(X)$ that extends fundamental results of O'Grady and Shen-Yin-Zhao \cite{OG13, SYZ20} to twisted settings. This class enables: \begin{itemize}
  \item A derived equivalence-invariant filtration $\mathbf{S}_\bullet(\mathrm{D}^{(1)}(\mathscr{X}))$ preserved under Fourier-Mukai transforms,
  \item A birational invariant filtration $\mathbf{S}^{\mathrm{SYZ}}_\bullet \operatorname{CH}_0$ on Bridgeland moduli spaces. \end{itemize} We prove $\mathbf{S}^{\mathrm{SYZ}}_\bullet \operatorname{CH}_0$ coincides with Voisin's filtration $\mathbf{S}^{\mathrm{BV}}_\bullet\operatorname{CH}_0$ (Theorem \ref{mainthm3}), providing a canonical candidate for the conjectural Beauville-Voisin filtration. Applications include Bloch's conjecture for (anti)-symplectic automorphisms and existence of algebraically coisotropic subvarieties.</description>

      <title>The Bieri-Neumann-Strebel sets of quasi-projective groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06250v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth complex quasi-projective variety and $\Gamma=\pi_1(X)$. Let $\chi \colon \Gamma \to \mathbb{R}$ be an additive character. We prove that the ray $[\chi]$ does not belong to the BNS set $\Sigma(\Gamma)$ if and only if it comes as a pullback along an algebraic fibration $f \colon X \to \mathcal{C}$ over a quasi-projective hyperbolic orbicurve $\mathcal{C}$. We also prove that if $\pi_1(X)$ admits a solvable quotient which is not virtually nilpotent, there exists a finite \'etale cover $X_1 \to X$ and a fibration $f \colon X_1 \to \mathcal{C}$ over a quasi-projective hyperbolic orbicurve $\mathcal{C}$. Both of these results were proved by Delzant in the case when $X$ is a compact K\"ahler manifold. We deduce that $\Gamma$ is virtually solvable if and only if it is virtually nilpotent, generalising the theorems of Delzant and Arapura-Nori. As a byproduct, we prove a version of Simpson's Lefschetz Theorem for the integral leaves of logarithmic $1$-forms that do not extend to any partial compactification. We give two applications of our results. First, we strengthen the recent theorem of Cadorel-Deng-Yamanoi on virtual nilpotency of fundamental groups of quasi-projective $h$-special and weakly special manifolds. Second, we prove the sharpness of Suciu's tropical bound for the fundamental groups of smooth quasi-projective varieties and answer a question of Suciu on the topology of hyperplane arrangements.</description>

      <title>Commensurability Among Deligne-Mostow Monodromy Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper gives the commensurability classification of Deligne--Mostow ball quotients and shows that the 104 Deligne--Mostow lattices form 38 commensurability classes. First, we find commensurability relations among Deligne--Mostow monodromy groups, which are not necessarily discrete. This generalizes previous work by Sauter and Deligne--Mostow in dimension two. In this part, we consider certain projective surfaces with two fibrations over the projective line, which induce two sets of Deligne--Mostow data. Correspondences between moduli spaces provide a geometric realization of commensurability relations. Secondly, we obtain commensurability invariants from conformal classes of Hermitian forms and toroidal boundary divisors. This completes the commensurability classification of Deligne--Mostow lattices and provides an alternative approach to the results of Kappes--M{\"o}ller and McMullen on non-arithmetic Deligne--Mostow lattices.</description>

      <title>Homology of spaces of curves on blowups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the space of holomorphic maps from a compact Riemann surface to a projective space blown up at finitely many points. We show that the homology of this mapping space equals that of the space of continuous maps that intersect the exceptional divisors positively, once the degree of the maps is sufficiently positive compared to the degree of homology. The proof uses a version of Vassiliev's method of simplicial resolution. As a consequence, we obtain a homological stability result for rational curves on the degree $5$ del Pezzo surface, which is analogous to a case of the Batyrev--Manin conjectures on rational point counts.</description>
