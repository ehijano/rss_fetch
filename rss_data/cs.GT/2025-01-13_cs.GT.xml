      <title>A Direct Proof of the Short-Side Advantage in Random Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stable matching problem under the random matching model where the preferences of the doctors and hospitals are sampled uniformly and independently at random. In a balanced market with $n$ doctors and $n$ hospitals, the doctor-proposal deferred-acceptance algorithm gives doctors an expected rank of order $\log n$ for their partners and hospitals an expected rank of order $\frac{n}{\log n}$ for their partners. This situation is reversed in an unbalanced market with $n+1$ doctors and $n$ hospitals, a phenomenon known as the short-side advantage. The current proofs of this fact are indirect, counter-intuitively being based upon analyzing the hospital-proposal deferred-acceptance algorithm. In this paper we provide a direct proof of the short-side advantage, explicitly analyzing the doctor-proposal deferred-acceptance algorithm. Our proof sheds light on how and why the phenomenon arises.</description>

      <title>Each of those eight coalition logics is also determined by six other kinds of models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coalition Logic is a central logic in logical research on strategic reasoning. In two recent papers, Li and Ju argued that generally, concurrent game models, models of Coalition Logic, have three too strong assumptions: seriality, independence of agents, and determinism. They presented eight coalition logics based on eight classes of general concurrent game models, determined by which of the three assumptions they meet. In this paper, we show that each of the eight coalition logics is also determined by the following six kinds of models, with the respective properties: single-coalition-first action models; single-coalition-first neighborhood models; clear grand-coalition-first action models; clear single-coalition-first neighborhood models; tree-like grand-coalition-first action models; tree-like single-coalition-first neighborhood models.</description>

      <title>Fully Decentralized Computation Offloading in Priority-Driven Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel framework for fully decentralized offloading policy design in multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems. The system comprises $N$ power-constrained user equipments (UEs) assisted by an edge server (ES) to process incoming tasks. Tasks are labeled with urgency flags, and in this paper, we classify them under three urgency levels, namely, high, moderate, and low urgency. We formulate the problem of designing computation decisions for the UEs within a large population noncooperative game framework, where each UE selfishly decides on how to split task execution between its local onboard processor and the ES. We employ the weighted average age of information (AoI) metric to quantify information freshness at the UEs. Increased onboard processing consumes more local power, while increased offloading may potentially incur a higher average AoI due to other UEs' packets being offloaded to the same ES. Thus, we use the mean-field game (MFG) formulation to compute approximate decentralized Nash equilibrium offloading and local computation policies for the UEs to balance between the information freshness and local power consumption. Finally, we provide a projected gradient descent-based algorithm to numerically assess the merits of our approach.</description>

      <title>Metric distortion Under Probabilistic Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metric distortion in social choice is a framework for assessing how well voting rules minimize social cost when voters and candidates exist in a shared metric space and voters' cost from a candidate is their metric distance. Voters submit rankings, and the rule aggregates these votes into a winner. We generalize this framework to include probabilistic voting to account for the fact that voters, in the real world, have randomness in their voting behaviour. Our extension encompasses a broad range of probability functions, including the widely studied Plackett-Luce (PL) model.
  We show that the distortion results under probabilistic voting better correspond with conventional intuitions regarding popular voting rules such as \textsc{Plurality}, \textsc{Copeland}, \textsc{Random Dictator} and \textsc{Borda} than those under deterministic voting. For example, in the PL model with candidate strength inversely proportional to the square of their metric distance from a voter, we show that \textsc{Copeland}'s distortion is at most 2, whereas that of \textsc{RandomDictator} is $\Omega(\sqrt{m})$ in large elections, where $m$ is the number of candidates. This contrasts sharply with the classical model, where \textsc{RandomDictator} beats \textsc{Copeland} with a distortion of 3 versus 5. In the PL model where the candidate strength is inversely proportional to the distance raised to power $\theta$, the distortion under \textsc{Borda} is $\Theta(m^{1-2/\theta})$ when $\theta&gt;2$ and $\Theta(1)$ otherwise. This generalizes the classical deterministic voting model where the distortion of \textsc{Borda} is $2m-1$. Overall, our work opens a new frontier for analysing voting rules.</description>

      <title>Prophet Inequalities: Competing with the Top $\ell$ Items is Easy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a prophet inequality problem, where the values of a sequence of items are drawn i.i.d. from some distribution, and an online decision maker must select one item irrevocably. We establish that $\mathrm{CR}_{\ell}$ the worst-case competitive ratio between the expected optimal performance of an online decision maker compared to that of a prophet who uses the average of the top $\ell$ items is exactly the solution to an integral equation. This quantity $\mathrm{CR}_{\ell}$ is larger than $1-e^{-\ell}$. This implies that the bound converges exponentially fast to $1$ as $\ell$ grows. In particular for $\ell=2$, $\mathrm{CR}_{2} \approx 0.966$ which is much closer to $1$ than the classical bound of $0.745$ for $\ell=1$. Additionally, we prove asymptotic lower bounds for the competitive ratio of a more general scenario, where the decision maker is permitted to select $k$ items. This subsumes the $k$ multi-unit i.i.d. prophet problem and provides the current best asymptotic guarantees, as well as enables broader understanding in the more general framework. Finally, we prove a tight asymptotic competitive ratio when only static threshold policies are allowed.</description>
