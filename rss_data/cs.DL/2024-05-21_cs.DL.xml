      <title>Amplifying Academic Research through YouTube: Engagement Metrics as Predictors of Citation Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the interplay between YouTube engagement metrics and the academic impact of cited publications within video descriptions, amid declining trust in traditional journalism and increased reliance on social media for information. By analyzing data from Altmetric.com and YouTube's API, it assesses how YouTube video features relate to citation impact. Initial results suggest that videos citing scientific publications and garnering high engagement-likes, comments, and references to other publications-may function as a filtering mechanism or even as a predictor of impactful research.</description>

      <title>Scientific discourse on YouTube: Motivations for citing research in comments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: YouTube is a valuable source of user-generated content on a wide range of topics, and it encourages user participation through the use of a comment system. Video content is increasingly addressing scientific topics, and there is evidence that both academics and consumers use video descriptions and video comments to refer to academic research and scientific publications. Because commenting is a discursive behavior, this study will provide insights on why individuals post links to research publications in comments. For this, a qualitative content analysis and iterative coding approach were applied. Furthermore, the reasons for mentioning academic publications in comments were contrasted with the reasons for citing in scholarly works and with reasons for commenting on YouTube. We discovered that the primary motives for sharing research links were (1) providing more insights into the topic and (2) challenging information offered by other commentators.</description>

      <title>GotFunding: A grant recommendation system based on scientific articles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining funding is an important part of becoming a successful scientist. Junior faculty spend a great deal of time finding the right agencies and programs that best match their research profile. But what are the factors that influence the best publication--grant matching? Some universities might employ pre-award personnel to understand these factors, but not all institutions can afford to hire them. Historical records of publications funded by grants can help us understand the matching process and also help us develop recommendation systems to automate it. In this work, we present \textsc{GotFunding} (Grant recOmmendaTion based on past FUNDING), a recommendation system trained on National Institutes of Health's (NIH) grant--publication records. Our system achieves a high performance (NDCG@1 = 0.945) by casting the problem as learning to rank. By analyzing the features that make predictions effective, our results show that the ranking considers most important 1) the year difference between publication and grant grant, 2) the amount of information provided in the publication, and 3) the relevance of the publication to the grant. We discuss future improvements of the system and an online tool for scientists to try.</description>
