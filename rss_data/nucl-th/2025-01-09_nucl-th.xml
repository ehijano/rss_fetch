      <title>Clusterization aspects in the states of non-rotating and fast rotating nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The understanding of clustering aspects at the ground state of nuclei and in fast rotating ones within the framework of covariant density functional theory has been reviewed and reanalyzed. The appearance of many exotic nuclear shapes in nuclear chart can be inferred from combined analysis of nodal structure of the densities of the single-particle states and the evolution of such states in the Nilsson diagram with deformation and particle number. Such analysis which is supported by fully self-consistent calculations allows to predict the existence of nuclear configurations with specific shape or cluster properties at ground state and at high spin. For example, it indicates that in a given shell with principal quantum number $N$ only the lowest in energy two-fold degenerate deformed state can contribute to the formation of linear chain $\alpha$ cluster structures.</description>

      <title>Dark matter effects on the properties of quark stars and the implications for the peculiar objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the observable properties of dark matter-admixed quark stars (DQSs) using the confined-isospin-density-dependent-mass model in combination with the generic bosonic self-interacting dark matter model. Our results show that the dark matter (DM) can significantly influence the properties of quark stars including the mass, radius, and the central pressure at the maximum mass configurations. Moreover, we observe that the mass of DMparticles and the DMfraction significantly affect the types of stellar configurations, and we study these configurations in detail under various scenarios and predict the possibility that two recently observed peculiar objects HESS J1731-347 and PSR J014-4002E are DQSs.</description>

      <title>Effective action for relativistic hydrodynamics from Crooks fluctuation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new effective theory framework for fluctuating hydrodynamics in the relativistic regime is derived using standard thermodynamical principles and general properties of non-equilibrium stochastic dynamics. For the first time, we establish clear and concise conditions for ensuring that the resulting effective theories are causal, stable, and well-posed within general relativity. These properties are independent of spacetime foliation and are valid in the full nonlinear regime. Out-of-equilibrium fluctuations are constrained by a relativistically covariant version of Crooks fluctuation theorem, which determines how the entropy production is distributed even when the system is driven by an external force. This leads to an emerging $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry responsible for imposing fluctuation-dissipation relations for n-point correlation functions, which matches the standard constraints for the Schwinger-Keldysh effective action.</description>

      <title>Decay spectroscopy of heavy and superheavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After more than half a century afte the first predictions of the so-called {\it "island of stability of superheavy nuclei"}, exploring the limits of nuclear stability at highest atomic numbers is still one of the most prominent challenges in low-energy nuclear physics. These exotic nuclear species reveal their character and details of some of their properties by their induced or spontaneous disintegration. The achievements in the field superheavy nuclei (SHN) research have been reported in a number of review papers throughout the decades. This review is an attempt to summarize the progress that has been made in recent years by employing the versatile tool park of Decay Spectroscopy After Separation (DSAS) for the heaviest isotopes from $Z$=99 (einsteinium) to $Z$=118 (oganesson). In addition, references to earlier reviews and the relevant papers, together with the major decay properties of all these isotopes are given.</description>

      <title>A novel BPS bound with a first order BPS system in the $2D$ Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel BPS bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bound from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but ``dressed'' by the condensate profile) and the second to the ``skewness'' of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations which satisfy a system of two first-order PDE: when such BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are satisfied as well. The analytic solutions of this BPS system constructed in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed. The implications of these results are outlined.</description>

      <title>Two-loop form factors for $P$-wave quarkonium production and decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the analytical results for the two-loop form factors needed for $\chi_{Q,J}$ production and decay. We consider the two-loop corrections to the process $\gamma \gamma \leftrightarrow {^3 P_J^{[1]}}$, that has been known only numerically before, and the processes $gg \leftrightarrow {^3 P_J^{[1]}}$, $\gamma g \leftrightarrow {^3 P_J^{[8]}}$ and $gg \leftrightarrow {^3 P_J^{[8]}}$, which have not been computed before. We observe that the NRQCD pole structure of the two-loop amplitude in the $gg$ channel is more involved for the spin-triplet $P$-wave case than for the pseudo-scalar $S$-wave case. It involves in addition to the standard Coulomb singularity also a new singularity whose cancellation requires the inclusion of the $gg \leftrightarrow {^3S_1^{[8]}}$ form factor. We give the high precision numerical results for the hard functions that can be used to compute $\chi_{Q,J}$ production and decay up to NNLO accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unveil the impact of the $\theta$-angle on the QCD phase diagram at nonzero isospin and strangeness chemical potentials for three light flavors and different quark mass ratios. We establish the phase boundaries as well as the nature of the associated phase transitions. The order parameters and the physical spectrum in the different phases are determined. We further elucidate the physics around $\theta=\pi$ where we discover a novel parity-preserving superfluid phase. Finally, we comment on Dashen's phenomenon in the superfluid phases when varying the number of light flavors.</description>

      <title>Understanding the approach to thermalization in a non-Abelian gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the maximal Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L$ of physical states in a SU(2) gauge theory both in and out-of-thermal equilibrium conditions using ab-initio lattice techniques. A non-equilibrium state is realized starting from an over-occupied initial condition for low momentum, soft gluons whereas the thermal state comprises of strongly interacting soft gluons at temperatures where these are well separated from the hard momentum modes. A spectra of positive Lyapunov exponents is observed in both these states, similar to a chaotic dynamical system. From the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate measured in terms of this spectrum, we estimate the typical time-scale of $\sim 0.50(3)$ fm/c to achieve thermalization at $T\sim 600$ MeV starting from the non-thermal state. We also measure, for the first time, the $\lambda_L$ for long wavelength critical modes of SU(2) using the out-of-time-ordered correlation functions of a classical $Z_2$ scalar field theory, which shares the same universal behavior near the deconfinement phase transition. The $\lambda_L$ is observed to maximize at the transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Isospin strikes back</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04449v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming isospin conservation, the decay of a $c\bar c$ vector meson into the $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ final state is purely electromagnetic. At the leading order, the $c\bar c$ vector meson first converts into a virtual photon that, then produces the $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ final state. Moreover, such a mechanism, i.e., the virtual photon coupling to $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$, is the solely intermediate process through which, in Born approximation, the reaction $e^+e^-\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ does proceed. It follows that any significant difference between the amplitudes of the processes $c\bar c\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ and $e^+e^-\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ at the $c\bar c$ mass must be ascribed to an isospin-violating contribution in the $c\bar c$ decay. In Eur. Phys. J. C $\boldsymbol{80}$, 903 (2020) we studied the decay of the $\psi(2S)$ vector meson into $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ and, on the light of the large branching fraction ${\rm BR}_{18}(\psi(2S)\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.})=(1.23\pm0.24)\times 10^{-5}$, published in the 2018 edition of the Review of Particle Physics Phys. Rev. D $\boldsymbol{98}$, 030001 (2018), we claimed either the presence of a significant isospin-violating contribution or, with a lesser emphasis, a "not complete reliability of the only available datum". In any case, we propose a new measurement. Apparently, our second and considered less serious hypothesis was the right one, indeed the branching fraction published in the 2024 edition of the Review of Particle Physics Phys. Rev. D $\boldsymbol{110}$, 030001 (2024) is $ {\rm BR}(\psi(2S)\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.})=(1.6\pm0.7)\times 10^{-6}$, more than seven times lower with the error that increased from $\sim 20\%$ to $\sim 45\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First-principles simulations of many-fermion systems are commonly limited by the computational requirements of processing large data objects. As a remedy, we propose the use of low-rank approximations of three-body interactions, which are the dominant such limitation in nuclear physics. We introduce a novel randomized decomposition technique to handle the excessively large matrix dimensions and study the sensitivity of low-rank properties to interaction details. The developed low-rank three-nucleon interactions are benchmarked in ab initio simulations of few- and many-body systems. Exploiting low-rank properties provides a promising route to extend the microscopic description of atomic nuclei to large systems where storage requirements exceed the computational capacities of the most advanced high-performance computing facilities.</description>

      <title>Contrasting Features of Parton Energy Loss in Heavy-ion Collisions at RHIC and the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00024v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energetic quarks and gluons lose energy as they traverse the hot and dense medium created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) of leading particles quantifies parton energy loss in such collisions, with the particle spectrum in $p+p$ collisions as a reference. Previous $R_{AA}$ measurements at RHIC energies have revealed an approximately constant trend at high transverse momenta ($p_{T}$), implying a scenario where parton energy loss, $\Delta p_{T}$, scales proportionally with $p_{T}$, a feature naively expected from energy loss dynamics in elastic collisions. In this study, we investigate the LHC $R_{AA}$ measurements which exhibit a pronounced $p_{T}$ dependence of $R_{AA}$ for various particle species, and our analysis attributes this behavior to $\Delta p_T$ being approximately proportional to $\sqrt{p_{T}}$. These distinct features are consistent with model calculations of dominant radiative energy loss dynamics at the LHC, in contrast to the dominance of collisional energy loss at RHIC. Additionally, the linear increase of fractional energy loss with medium density at different $p_{T}$ magnitudes affirms the previous empirical observation that the magnitude of the energy loss depends mostly on the initial entropy density, with no significant path-length dependence. Implications on the dynamical scenarios of parton energy loss and future experimental investigations will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Exploring the $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ interaction via femtoscopic study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very recently the Wood-Saxon (WS) type interaction in the single-folding potential approach are constructed to simulate the $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ potentials. One set of the $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ potentials are based on the first principle HAL QCD $\phi{\text -}N $ interactions in $^{4}S_{3/2}$ channel, and in another set, the $\phi$-meson-nucleus potentials were calculated by employing the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model. By utilizing these two set of $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ potentials, the two-particle momentum correlation of $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ in high-energy heavy ion collisions is explored. The numerical results show that the correlation functions at small source size (high density nuclear medium) depends on the employed potential model. Also, the correlation functions are obtained within the Lednicky-Lyuboshits (LL) formalism. For small source size, it is found that, the LL formula returns significantly different values due to the large interaction range of the $\phi{\text -}\alpha $ potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correlation function observed in high-energy collision experiments encodes critical information about the emitted source and hadronic interactions. While the proton-proton interaction potential is well constrained by nucleon-nucleon scattering data, these measurements offer a unique avenue to investigate the proton-emitting source, reflecting the dynamical properties of the collisions. In this Letter, we present an unbiased approach to reconstruct proton-emitting sources from experimental correlation functions. Within an automatic differentiation framework, we parameterize the source functions with deep neural networks, to compute correlation functions. This approach achieves a lower chi-squared value compared to conventional Gaussian source functions and captures the long-tail behavior, in qualitative agreement with simulation predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11908v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we expand the scope of the JETSCAPE framework to investigate the dependence of the jet nuclear modification factor, ${R_{AA}}$, on the jet radius parameter ($R$) for broader area jet cones, going all the way up to $R$ = 1.0. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of high-${p_{T}}$ inclusive jets extending up to 1 TeV to probe the quark-gluon plasma medium at much shorter distance scales. It focuses on quenching effects observed in the quark-gluon plasma formed during Pb-Pb collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV, particularly for the most-central (0-10\%) collisions. Jet-medium interactions represent a pivotal domain of both theoretical and experimental QGP studies, with various models offering different assumptions to describe these phenomena. To illustrate this modular approach, this work computes the nuclear modification factor for inclusive jets via coupling of the MATTER model (which simulates the high virtuality phase of the parton evolution) with the LBT model (which simulates the low virtuality phase of the parton evolution). Additionally, the two successful energy loss models: MARTINI and AdS/CFT are employed to characterize the jet-suppression effectively within the JETSCAPE framework. The results are compared with the experimental data from the ATLAS and CMS detectors, covering jet transverse momentum (${p_{T}}$) ranging from 100 GeV to 1 TeV for ATLAS and 300 GeV to 1 TeV for CMS. The predictions made by the JETSCAPE are consistent in the high ${p_{T}}$ range as well as for extreme jet cone sizes, showing deviation within 10-25\%. Our major focus is on calculating the double ratio (${R^{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{AA}}/R^{\mathrm{R=small}}_{\mathrm{AA}}}$) as a function of jet-R and jet-${p_{T}}$, where the experimental results align well with predictions from the JETSCAPE framework.</description>

Abstract: We perform microscopic simulations of the thermal relaxation of warm neutral plasmas of astrophysical importance. Using Molecular Dynamics we study the thermal relaxation of a hot neutral fluid of finite-size neutron-rich ions kept in a fixed-wall cool box. We show how the interplay among particle size, Yukawa interaction range and density are key to understand the features of the time-dependent thermal relaxation curve $T(t)$. We show that, under certain conditions, these systems exhibit faster cooling from increasingly larger initial temperature values. They also display non-Newtonian thermal behavior, including oscillations, that can be {\it effectively} interpreted as the consequence of the existence of a non-trivial system memory function. Finally, we consider the impact of multicomponent admixtures in the simulated system. We discuss these results and their possible extensions to astrophysical scenarios, where screened plasmas with Yukawa-like electrostatic potentials are usually involved.</description>

      <title>An Improved Precision Calculation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ Contact Term within Chiral Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay is an as-yet unobserved nuclear process, which stands to provide crucial insights for model-building beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Its detection would simultaneously confirm the hypothesis that neutrinos are Majorana fermions, thus violating lepton-number conservation, and provide the first measurement of the absolute neutrino mass scale. This work aims to improve the estimation within chiral effective field theory of the so-called ''contact term'' for $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay, a short-range two-nucleon effect which is unaccounted for in traditional nuclear approaches to the process. We conduct a thorough review of the justifications for this contact term and the most precise computation of its size to date ($g_\nu^{NN}$ = 1.3(6) at renormalisation point $\mu=m_\pi$), whose precision is limited by a truncation to elastic intermediate hadronic states. We then perform an extension of this analysis to a subleading class of inelastic intermediate states which we characterise, delivering an updated figure for the contact coefficient ($g_\nu^{NN}$ = 1.4(3) at $\mu=m_\pi$) with uncertainty reduced by half. Such ab initio nuclear results, especially with enhanced precision, show promise for the resolution of disagreements between estimates of $0\nu\beta\beta$ from different many-body methods.</description>
