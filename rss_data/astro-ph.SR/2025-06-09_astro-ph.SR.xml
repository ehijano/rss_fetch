      <title>Post-common Envelope Evolution of Helium-core White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helium-core white dwarfs (He WDs) formed through common envelope (CE) evolution offer valuable insight into binary interaction channels and compact remnant formation. Their cooling rates critically impact both detectability and age estimates in close binaries. Compared to He WDs formed via stable Roche-lobe overflow (SRLOF), those from the CE channel undergo markedly different mass-loss histories, resulting in distinct post-CE evolutionary behavior. We explore how the mass of the residual hydrogen envelope (Mh) shapes the cooling evolution of CE He WDs, focusing on the role of the bifurcation point in setting Mh and enabling residual hydrogen burning. Using the LPCODE stellar evolution code, we computed models of He WDs with masses from 0.20 to 0.42 solar masses, evolving from post-CE conditions to the white dwarf cooling track. Two evolutionary branches emerge: (i) non-flashing sequences, which cool rapidly with negligible hydrogen burning, and (ii) flashing sequences, where hydrogen shell flashes alter the envelope structure prior to cooling. Minimal-envelope models cool within 5-130 million years for effective temperatures between 12,000 and 27,000 K, and reach in approx. 300 million years at lower temperatures, remaining much younger than SRLOF counterparts. In contrast, models with more hydrogen retain active nuclear burning, delaying cooling and yielding ages of several billion years. Flashing sequences prolong the pre-white dwarf phase, though still shorter than in SRLOF evolution. The value of Mh also affects WD mass and surface gravity estimates, introducing systematic shifts with respect to SRLOF WDs. Our results show that CE He WDs follow distinct evolutionary paths, with important implications for interpreting the nature and fate of compact binaries hosting He WDs.</description>

      <title>The TESS Ten Thousand Catalog: 10,001 uniformly-vetted and -validated Eclipsing Binary Stars detected in Full-Frame Image data by machine learning and analyzed by citizen scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has surveyed nearly the entire sky in Full-Frame Image mode with a time resolution of 200 seconds to 30 minutes and a temporal baseline of at least 27 days. In addition to the primary goal of discovering new exoplanets, TESS is exceptionally capable at detecting variable stars, and in particular short-period eclipsing binaries which are relatively common, making up a few percent of all stars, and represent powerful astrophysical laboratories for deep investigations of stellar formation and evolution. We combed Sectors 1-82 of TESS Full-Frame Image data searching for eclipsing binary stars using a neural network that identified ~1.2 million stars with eclipse-like features. Of these, we have performed an in-depth analysis on ~60,000 targets using automated methods and manual inspection by citizen scientists. Here we present a catalog of 10001 uniformly-vetted and -validated eclipsing binary stars that passed all our ephemeris and photocenter tests, as well as complementary visual inspection. Of these, 7936 are new eclipsing binaries while the remaining 2065 are known systems for which we update the published ephemerides. We outline the detection and analysis of the targets, discuss the properties of the sample, and highlight potentially interesting systems. Finally, we also provide a list of ~900,000 unvetted and unvalidated targets for which the neural network found eclipse-like features with a score higher than 0.9, and for which there are no known eclipsing binaries within a sky-projected separation of a TESS pixel (~21 arcsec).</description>

      <title>The Observations of Magnetic Reconnection During the Interaction Process of Two Active Region Filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between two filaments (F1 and F2) and their subsequent magnetic reconnection in active region (AR) NOAA 13296 and AR NOAA 13293 on May 9, 2023, utilizing high spatial and temporal resolution and multi-wavelength observational data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, the New Vacuum Solar Telescope, and the Chinese H{\alpha} Solar Explorer. The movement of F1 from the southeast toward the northwest, driven by the motion of the positive magnetic polarity (P1), leads to a collision and reconnection with F2. This reconnection exchanges their footpoints, resulting in the formation of two new filaments (F3 and F4) consistent with "slingshot" type filament interaction. During the interaction, the current sheet moving due to the motion of F1 and the reconnection outflows moving along F3 and F4 were both observed. The current sheet is rarely observed in the slingshot type filament interaction, measuring approximately 2.17 Mm in length and 0.84 Mm in width. After the interaction, the F1 disappears whereas a portion of F2 remains, indicating that the interaction involves partial slingshot reconnection, due to the unequal magnetic flux between the filaments. The residual part of F2 will undergo another magnetic reconnection in the same interaction region with the magnetic loops connecting polarities N1 and P1. The material generated by the reconnection is continuously injected into F4, leading to its final morphology. The findings enhance our understanding of slingshot-type filament interactions, indicating that partial slingshot reconnections between filaments may be more common than full slingshot events.</description>

      <title>Comparing observations of the closely located JUICE and STEREO-A spacecraft during the widespread solar energetic particle event of 2024 May 13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JUICE was launched in April 2023, and it is now in its cruise phase to Jupiter, where it is scheduled to arrive in July 2031. JUICE carries a radiation monitor, namely the RADiation hard Electron Monitor (RADEM) to measure protons, electrons, and ions, detecting particles coming mainly from the anti-Sun direction. On 2024 May 13, a large solar energetic particle (SEP) event took place in association with an eruption close to the western limb of the Sun as seen from Earth. Providentially, at that time JUICE was located very close to STEREO-A, being separated by 0.13 au in radial distance, 0.3 deg in latitude, and 1.6 deg in longitude. Methods. We analysed the IP context using in-situ measurements and studied the proton anisotropies measured by near-Earth spacecraft and STEREO-A. We focused on an isotropic period during the decay phase of the SEP event to compute the proton energy spectrum. We fit the STEREO-A spectrum and compared it to that measured by SOHO and JUICE. Conclusions. The RADEM instrument aboard JUICE is a valuable tool for measuring SEP events in the heliosphere, providing an excellent opportunity to study and characterise the energetic particle environment in the solar wind between 0.65 and 5.2 au. The intercalibration factors between the fluxes measured by STEREO-A and JUICE at the effective energies of 6.9 MeV, 13.3 MeV, 21.6 MeV, and 31.2 MeV are 1.02, 1.23, 1.12, and 0.95 respectively. These intercalibration factors are valid only until 2024 July 10, when the configuration of the RADEM instrument was changed.</description>

      <title>The jet-feedback mechanism in common envelope evolution of planetary nebula progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we mimic the negative jet feedback mechanism in common envelope evolution (CEE) of low-mass main sequence stars, M2=0.1-0.3Mo, spiraling inward inside the envelopes of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) or red giant branch (RGB) stars and find that the jets reduced the envelope density, therefore the jets' power, by a factor of ~0.5/(M2/0.1Mo). We mimic the energy that the jets deposit into the envelope by depositing energy into the outer envelope, a process that inflates the envelope, therefore reducing the density in the vicinity of the main sequence star, the accretion rate, and the jets' power. In deriving this expression for the negative jet feedback coefficient, we assume that the actual mass accretion rate is a fraction 0.2-0.5 of the classical Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton mass accretion rate and that the jets carry a fraction 0.25-0.5 of the accretion energy onto the main sequence star. Our study is another step in establishing the major role of jets in the onset and early phase of CEE, a possible grazing envelope evolution phase, and in transient events, such as luminous red novae, which these processes can power.</description>

      <title>Properties of slow magneto-acoustic waves observed simultaneously using Hi-C 2.1 and AIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Propagating slow magneto-acoustic waves are commonly observed in different coronal structures but are most prominent in active region fan loops. Their rapid damping with damping lengths of the order of a wavelength has been investigated in the past by several authors. Although different physical mechanisms have been proposed, significant discrepancies between the theory and observations remain. Recent high-resolution observations captured simultaneously by two different instruments reveal distinct damping lengths for slow magneto-acoustic waves although their passbands are similar. These results suggest a possible contribution of instrumental characteristics on the measurement of damping lengths. Here, we analyse the behavior of slow waves using a different pair of instruments in order to check the prevalence of such results. In particular, the cotemporal observations of active region NOAA AR12712 by the High-Resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C 2.1) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) are utilised. The estimated oscillation periods of slow magneto-acoustic waves identified from these data are 2.7{\,}$\pm${\,}0.2{\,}min from SDO/AIA, and 2.8{\,}$\pm${\,}1.2{\,}min from Hi-C 2.1. The corresponding propagation speeds are found to be 46.0{\,}$\pm${\,}1.7{\,}km{\,}s$^{-1}$ and 48.1{\,}$\pm${\,}0.6{\,}km{\,}s$^{-1}$, respectively. Damping lengths were calculated by two different methods, the Phase Tracking Method (PTM) and the Amplitude Tracking Method (ATM). The obtained values from PTM are 4.0{\,}$\pm${\,}2.1{\,}Mm and 4.1{\,}$\pm${\,}0.3{\,}Mm while those from ATM are 3.4{\,}$\pm${\,}1.0{\,}Mm and 3.7{\,}$\pm${\,}0.1{\,}Mm, respectively, for the AIA and Hi-C data. Our results do not indicate any notable difference in damping lengths between these instruments.</description>

      <title>Investigation of $^{31}$P levels near the proton threshold by Nuclear Resonance Fluorescence and the impact on the $^{30}$Si(p,$\gamma$)$^{31}$P thermonuclear rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the nuclear structure of $^{31}$P near the proton threshold using Nuclear Resonance Fluorescence (NRF) to refine the properties of key resonances in the $^{30}$Si(p,$\gamma$)$^{31}$P reaction, which is critical for nucleosynthesis in stellar environments. Excitation energies and spin-parities were determined for several states, including two unobserved resonances at $E_r$ $=$ $18.7$~keV and $E_r$ $=$ $50.5$~keV. The angular correlation analysis enabled the first unambiguous determination of the orbital angular momentum transfer for these states. These results provide a significant update to the $^{30}$Si(p,$\gamma$)$^{31}$P thermonuclear reaction rate, with direct implications for models of nucleosynthesis in globular clusters and other astrophysical sites. The revised rate is substantially lower than previous estimates at temperatures below $200$~MK, affecting predictions for silicon isotopic abundances in stellar environments. Our work demonstrates the power of NRF in constraining nuclear properties, and provides a framework for future studies of low-energy resonances relevant to astrophysical reaction rates.</description>

      <title>Detection of multiple X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations in IGR J19294+1816 with Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the timing results with Insight-HXMT observations of X-ray binary IGR J19294+1816 during its 2019 Type I outburst at the decline phase shortly following its peak. We analyze the light curves and power density spectrum (PDS) of the 2019 observations and reveal a peak at approximately $\nu_{NS} \sim 80.2$ mHz, corresponding to X-ray pulsations from the neutron star. In addition, a significant quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) feature is observed at around $\nu_{QPO} \sim 30.2$ mHz from 10-50 keV, with the rms amplitude increasing with energy. Furthermore, we detect two QPOs at the frequency of $\sim 51.1$ mHz and $113.7$ mHz (corresponding to sidebands near $\nu_{NS} \pm \nu_{QPO}$) in 25-50 keV, exhibiting an rms amplitude of around 12$\%$. Wavelet analysis also shows multiple QPOs at the frequency of $\sim 30$ mHz, $50$ mHz and $ 110$ mHz and these QPO features show transient behaviors, the centroid frequencies of $\sim 30$ mHz remain nearly constant for different luminosities. Our research identifies IGR J19294+1816 as the second strong magnetic-field pulsar with significant sideband signals around the spin frequency. We explore various physical origins that could explain the presence of multiple QPOs.</description>

      <title>On the effect of the light bending phenomenon for a pulsar in a binary with a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of light-bending on the signal of a pulsar in binaries with rotating black hole companions, focusing on stellar mass black holes. We show that the impacts of various parameters on the bending delays visually match with those observed for a non-rotating black holes, because the magnitude of the spin as well as the orientation of the spin axis of the black hole introduce changes in the nanosecond order and other parameters do so in the microsecond order. Consequently, the distortion of the beam and the resulting changes in the pulse shape are minimally influenced by spin-related parameters of the black hole. We also investigate the impact of various parameters on the difference of the delays with and without the spin of the black hole and notice nanosecond scale discontinuities at orbital phases where the path of the light ray changes its direction with respect to the direction of the spin of the black hole. Moreover, as in the Schwarzschild case, the bending delays become irregular (on the microsecond scale) near the superior conjunction. We also explore the effect of bending on the pulse profiles and bending delays if the companion of the pulsar is a rotating super-massive black hole. We find significant enhancement and change in the shape of the profiles at and near the superior conjunction in comparison to stellar mass black holes. Moreover, bending delays are about three orders of magnitude higher than those in case of the stellar mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Disk Evolution Study Through Imaging of Nearby Young Stars (DESTINYS): Evidence of planet-disk interaction in the 2MASSJ16120668-3010270 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The architectures of exoplanet systems are likely set during the initial planet-formation phase in the circumstellar disk. To understand this process, we have to study the earliest phases of planet formation. Complex sub-structures, believed to be driven by embedded planets, have been detected in a significant portion of disks observed at high angular resolution. We aim to extend the sample of such disks to low stellar masses and to connect the disk morphology to the expected proto-planet properties.
  We resolve the disk in the 2MASSJ16120668-3010270 system for the first time in scattered near-infrared light on scales of 10 au using VLT/SPHERE and reveal an exceptionally structured disk. We find an inner disk (inside 40 au) with two spiral arms, separated by a gap from an outer ring. By comparison with hydrodynamic models, we find that these structures are consistent with the presence of an embedded gas giant with a mass range between 0.1 and 5 MJup depending on the employed model. Our SPHERE observations find a tentative candidate point source within the disk gap, which may be consistent with this mass range if it indeed traces thermal emission by an embedded planet. This interpretation is somewhat strengthened by the proximity of this signal to compact mm continuum emission in the disk gap, which may trace circumplanetary material. It is, however, unclear if this tentative companion candidate could be responsible for the observed disk gap size, given its close proximity to the inner disk.
  The 2MASSJ16120668-3010270 system is one of only a few systems that shows this exceptional morphology of spiral arms located inside a scattered light gap and ring. We speculate that this may have to do with a higher disk viscosity compared with other systems such as PDS 70.</description>

      <title>Impact of initial mass function on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star formation and metal enrichment in galaxies are regulated by supernova (SN) explosions and metal yields from massive stars, which are sensitive to the high-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF). Recent JWST observations have reached a consensus on an invariant relation between stellar mass, metallicity, and star formation rate up to $z\sim 8$ and its breakdown at higher redshifts. It is crucial to understand the underlying physics, especially the role played by the IMF. We explore the impact of IMF on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies and the interplay between IMF and galactic outflows. The ultimate goal is to constrain the high-mass end of the IMF by the cosmic star formation history and stellar mass-metallicity-star formation rate relation (MZSFR) inferred from observations at $z\sim 4-10$. Using the semi-analytical galaxy evolution code A-SLOTH, we follow galactic baryon cycles along merger trees built from cosmological simulations. Stellar feedback is modeled with up-to-date stellar evolution tracks covering the full metallicity range ($Z \sim 10^{-11} - 0.03$) and a broad stellar mass range ($m_\star\sim2 - 600\ \rm M_\odot$) including the metal yields from stellar winds, core-collapse SNe, (pulsational) pair-instability SNe, and Type Ia SNe. Assuming that the IMF follows a Kroupa-like shape with a varying upper mass limit $m_{\max}$, we find $m_{\max} \gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$ is required to reproduce the observed MZSFR. Observational data at $z\gtrsim 6$ favor a galactic outflow model where the outflow mass is proportional to the ratio of supernova energy to halo binding energy. We conclude that very massive ($\gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$) stars can play important roles in the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of high-$z$ galaxies. We also discuss their implications for transient sources of both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>A Low Metallicity Massive Contact Binary Star System Candidate in WLM identified by Hubble and James Webb Space Telescope imaging</title>

Abstract: We present archival HST and JWST ultraviolet through near infrared time series photometric observations of a massive minimal-contact binary candidate in the metal-poor galaxy WLM ($Z = 0.14 Z_{\odot}$). This discovery marks the lowest metallicity contact binary candidate observed to date. We determine the nature of the two stars in the binary by using the eclipsing binary modeling software (PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs; PHOEBE) to train a neural network to fit our observed panchromatic multi-epoch photometry. The best fit model consists of two hot MS stars ($T_1=29800^{+2300}_{-1700}$ K, $M_1=16^{+2}_{-3}~M_{\odot}$, and $T_2=18000^{+5000}_{-5000}$ K, $M_2=7^{+5}_{-3}~M_{\odot}$). We discuss plausible evolutionary paths for the system, and suggest the system is likely to be currently in a contact phase before ultimately ending in a merger. Future spectroscopy will help to further narrow down evolutionary pathways. This work showcases a novel use of data of JWST and HST imaging originally taken to characterize RR Lyrae. We expect time series imaging from LSST, BlackGEM, etc. to uncover similar types of objects in nearby galaxies.</description>

      <title>Triple-$\alpha$ reaction rates below $T_9=3$ by a non-adiabatic three-body model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The triple-$\alpha$ reaction from the ternary continuum states at off-resonant energies, $\alpha+\alpha+\alpha\rightarrow^{12}$C, remains an open question. This direct process is scrutinized using a non-adiabatic Faddeev hyperspherical harmonics $R$-matrix expansion method, and the derived reaction rates are discussed. After reviewing the model, the resultant photo-disintegration of $^{12}$C($2^+_1\rightarrow 0^+$) is shown to be much smaller than the values predicted by the adiabatic models for $0.15 \le E \le 0.35$ MeV. Despite the large difference, the derived reaction rates are illustrated to be concordant with the current evaluated rates for $0.08 \le T_9 \le 3$. The difference below $E=0.20$ MeV can be seen in the rates for $T_9 \le 0.07$. In comparison with the calculations, the rates are found to be reduced by about 10$^{-4}$ at $T_9=0.05$, because of an accurate description for $^8$Be break-up. Uncertainties of the rates are also estimated by examining sensitivity to 3$\alpha$ potentials. With introducing three-body $S$-factors and a resonant term, the present rates are expressed in an analytic form, and they are provided in a tabular form for astrophysical applications. To update the evaluated rates, non-resonant sequential process between $\alpha+^8$Be could be deleted by hand. The astrophysical impact is not expected to be large, although the rates are reduced around $T_9=0.05$.</description>
