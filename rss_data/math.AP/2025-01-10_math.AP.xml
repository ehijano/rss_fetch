      <title>Interacting free boundaries in obstacle problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study obstacle problems governed by two distinct types of diffusion operators involving interacting free boundaries. We obtain a somewhat surprising coupling property, leading to a comprehensive analysis of the free boundary. More precisely, we show that near regular points of a coordinate function, the free boundary is analytic, whereas singular points lie on a smooth manifold. Additionally, we prove that uncoupled free boundary points are singular, indicating that regular points lie exclusively on the coupled free boundary. Furthermore, optimal regularity, non-degeneracy, and lower dimensional Hausdorff measure estimates are obtained. Explicit examples illustrate the sharpness of assumptions.</description>

      <title>Normalized Solutions on large smooth domains to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with potential and general nonlinearity: Mass super-critical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence and multiplicity of prescribed mass solutions to the following nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with general nonlinearity: Mass super-critical case: \[\begin{cases} -\Delta u+V(x)u+\lambda u=g(u),\\ \|u\|_2^2=\int|u|^2\mathrm{d}x=c, \end{cases} \] both on large bounded smooth star-shaped domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ and on $\mathbb{R}^N$, where $V(x)$ is the potential and the nonlinearity $g(\cdot)$ considered here are very general and of mass super-critical. The standard approach based on the Pohozaev identity to obtain normalized solutions is invalid as the presence of potential $V(x)$. In addition, our study can be considered as a complement of Bartsch-Qi-Zou (Math Ann 390, 4813--4859, 2024), which has addressed an open problem raised in Bartsch et al. (Commun Partial Differ Equ 46(9):1729--1756, 2021).</description>

      <title>On a reaction-diffusion virus model with general boundary conditions in heterogeneous environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To describe the propagation of West Nile virus and/or Zika virus, in this paper, we propose and study a time-periodic reaction-diffusion model with general boundary conditions in heterogeneous environments and with four unknowns: susceptible host, infectious host, susceptible vector and infectious vector. We can prove that such problem has a positive time periodic solution if and only if host and vector persist and the basic reproduction ratio is greater than one, and moreover the positive time periodic solution is unique and globally asymptotically stable when it exists.</description>

      <title>On $p$-fractional weakly-coupled system with critical nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the following nonlocal system of equations: \begin{equation}
  \tag{$\mathcal S$}\label{MAT1}
  \begin{cases}
  (-\Delta_p)^s u = \frac{\alpha}{p_s^*}|u|^{\alpha-2}u|v|^{\beta}+f(x)\;\;\text{in}\;\mathbb{R}^{d}, \,
  (-\Delta_p)^s v = \frac{\beta}{p_s^*}|v|^{\beta-2}v|u|^{\alpha}+g(x)\;\;\text{in}\;\mathbb{R}^{d},\,
  u,v &gt;0\, \mbox{ in }\,\mathbb{R}^{d},
  \end{cases} \end{equation} where $s\in(0,1)$, $p\in(1,\infty)$, $d&gt;sp$, $\alpha,\beta&gt;1$, $\alpha+\beta=dp/(d-sp)$, and $f,\, g$ are nonnegative functionals in the dual space of $\mathcal{D}^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$. When $f=g=0$, we prove a uniqueness result for the ground state solution of \eqref{MAT1}. On the other hand, when $f \not \equiv 0, g \not \equiv 0$, the primary objective is to present a global compactness result that offers a complete characterization of the Palais-Smale sequences of the energy functional associated with \eqref{MAT1}. Using this characterization, within a certain range of $s$, we establish the existence of a solution with negative energy for \eqref{MAT1} when $\ker(f)=\ker(g)$.</description>

      <title>The existence and stability of viscosity solutions to perturbed contact Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a contact Hamiltonian $H(x,p,u)$ with certain dependence on the contact variable $u$. If $u_{-}$ is a viscosity solution of the contact Hamilton-Jacobi equation
  \[H(x,D_{x}u(x),u(x))=0,\quad x\in M,\]
  and $u_{-}$ is locally Lyapunov asymptotically stable, we prove that the perturbed equation
  \[H(x,D_{x}u(x),u(x))+\varepsilon P(x,D_{x}u(x),u(x))=0,\quad x\in M,\] 
  does exist viscosity solution $u_{-}^{\varepsilon}$ which converges uniformly to $u_{-}$, as perturbation parameter $\varepsilon$ converges to 0. Moreover, we give a case that in a neighborhood of viscosity solution $u_-$, the perturbed equation has an unique viscosity solution $u_{-}^{\varepsilon}$. Furthermore, $u_{-}^{\varepsilon}$ keeps locally Lyapunov asymptotically stability.</description>

      <title>Incompressible and vanishing vertical viscosity limit for the compressible Navier-Stokes system with Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show the incompressible and vanishing vertical viscosity limits for the strong solutions to the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes system with anistropic dissipation, in a domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions in the general setting of ill-prepared initial data. We establish the uniform regularity estimates with respect to the Mach number $\epsilon$ and the vertical viscosity $\nu$ so that the solution exists on a uniform time interval $[0,T_0]$ independent of these parameters. The key steps toward this goal are the careful construction of the approximate solution in the presence of both fast oscillations and two kinds of boundary layers together with the stability analysis of the remainder. In the process, it is also shown that the solutions of the compressible systems converge to those of the incompressible system with only horizontal dissipation, after removing the fast waves whose horizontal derivative is bounded in $L_{T_0}^2L_x^2$ by $\min\{1, (\epsilon/\nu)^{\frac14}\}.$</description>

      <title>Existence and multiplicity of solutions for a critical Kirchhoff type elliptic equation with a logarithmic perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the following critical Kirchhoff type elliptic equation with a logarithmic perturbation \begin{equation}\label{eq0} \begin{cases} -\left(1+b\int_{\Omega}|\nabla{u}|^2\mathrm{d}x\right) \Delta{u}=\lambda u+\mu u\log{u^2}+|u|^{2^{*}-2}u, &amp;x\in\Omega,\\ u=0,&amp;x\in\partial\Omega, \end{cases} \end{equation} where $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{N}(N\geq3)$ with smooth boundary $\partial \Omega$, $b$, $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are parameters and $2^{*}=\frac{2N}{N-2}$ is the critical Sobolev exponent. The presence of a nonlocal term, together with a critical nonlinearity and a logarithmic term, prevents to apply in a straightforward way the classical critical point theory. Moreover, the geometry structure of the energy functional changes as the space dimension $N$ varies, which has a crucial influence on the existence of solutions to the problem. On the basis of some careful analysis on the structure of the energy functional, existence and (or) multiplicity results are obtained by using variational methods. More precisely, if $N=3$, the problem admits a local minimum solution, a ground state solution and a sequence of solutions with their $H_0^1(\Omega)$-norms converging to $0$. If $N=4$, the existence of infinitely many solutions is also obtained. When $N\geq5$, the problem admits a local minimum solution with negative energy. Sufficient conditions are also derived for the local minimum solution to be a ground state solution.</description>

      <title>Regularity and well-posedness of the Euler system in gas dynamics for dissipative solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any dissipative (measure-valued) solution of the compressible Euler system that complies with Dafermos' criterion of maximal dissipation is necessarily an admissible weak solution. In addition, we propose a simple, at most two step, selection procedure to identify a unique semigroup solution in the class of dissipative solutions to the Euler system. Finally, we introduce a refined version of Dafermos' criterion yielding a unique solution of the problem for any finite energy initial data.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the defocusing nonlinear wave equation outside of a ball with radial data for $3&lt;p&lt;5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of the Dirichlet boundary value problem of nonlinear wave equation with radial data in the exterior $\Omega = \mathbb{R}^3\backslash \bar{B}(0,1)$. We combine the distorted Fourier truncation method in \cite{Bourgain98:FTM}, the global-in-time (endpoint) Strichartz estimates in \cite{XuYang:NLW} with the energy method in \cite{GallPlan03:NLW} to prove the global well-posedness of the radial solution to the defocusing, energy-subcriticial nonlinear wave equation outside of a ball in $\left(\dot H^{s}_{D}(\Omega) \cap L^{p+1}(\Omega) \right)\times \dot H^{s-1}_{D}(\Omega)$ with $1-\frac{(p+3)(1-s_c)}{4(2p-3)}&lt;s&lt;1$, $s_c=\frac{3}{2}-\frac{2}{p-1} $, which extends the result for the cubic nonlinearity in \cite{XuYang:NLW} to the case $3&lt;p&lt;5$. Except from the argument in \cite{XuYang:NLW}, another new ingredient is that we need make use of the radial Sobolev inequality to deal with the super-conformal nonlinearity in addition to the Sobolev inequality.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric inequalities for the fractional composite membrane problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate some isoperimetric-type inequalities related to the first eigenvalue of the fractional composite membrane problem. First, we establish an analogue of the renowned Faber-Krahn inequality for the fractional composite membrane problem. Next, we investigate an isoperimetric inequality for the first eigenvalue of the fractional composite membrane problem on the intersection of two domains-a problem that was first studied by Lieb [23] for the Laplacian. Similar results in the local case were previously obtained by Cupini-Vecchi [9] for the composite membrane problem. Our findings provide further insights into the fractional setting, offering a new perspective on these classical inequalities.</description>

      <title>Hidden convexity and Dafermos' principle for some dispersive equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover an abstract structure behind several nonlinear dispersive equations (including the NLS, NLKG and GKdV equations with generic defocusing power-law nonlinearities) that is reminiscent of hyperbolic conservation laws. The underlying abstract problem admits an "entropy" that is formally conserved. The entropy is determined by a strictly convex function that naturally generates an anisotropic Orlicz space. For such problems, we introduce the dual matrix-valued variational formulation in the spirit of [Y. Brenier. Comm. Math. Phys. (2018) 364(2) 579-605] and prove several results related to existence, uniqueness and consistency on large time intervals. As an application, we show that no subsolution of the problems that fit into our framework is able to dissipate the total entropy earlier or faster than the strong solution on the interval of existence of the latter. This result (we call it Dafermos' principle) is new even for "isotropic" problems such as the incompressible Euler system.</description>

      <title>A class of enhanced physics-informed neural networks for data-driven solitons and parameters discovery to (2+ 1)-dimensional coupled nonlinear Schrodinger systems with variable coefficients: vector dark and anti-dark one- and two-solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates data-driven solutions and parameter discovery to (2+ 1)-dimensional coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations with variable coefficients (VC-CNLSEs), which describe transverse effects in optical fiber systems under perturbed dispersion and nonlinearity. By setting different forms of perturbation coefficients, we aim to recover the dark and anti-dark one- and two-soliton structures by employing an enhanced physics-based deep neural network algorithm, namely a physics-informed neural network (PINN). The enhanced PINN algorithm leverages the locally adaptive activation function mechanism to improve convergence speed and accuracy. In the lack of data acquisition, the PINN algorithms will enhance the capability of the neural networks by incorporating physical information into the training phase. We demonstrate that applying PINN algorithms to (2+ 1)-dimensional VC-CNLSEs requires distinct distributions of physical information. To address this, we propose a region-specific weighted loss function with the help of residual-based adaptive refinement strategy. In the meantime, we perform data-driven parameter discovery for the model equation, classified into two categories: constant coefficient discovery and variable coefficient discovery. For the former, we aim to predict the cross-phase modulation constant coefficient under varying noise intensities using enhanced PINN with a single neural network. For the latter, we employ a dual-network strategy to predict the dynamic behavior of the dispersion and non-linearity perturbation functions. Our study demonstrates that the proposed framework holds significant potential for studying high-dimensional and complex soliton dynamics in optical fiber systems.</description>

Abstract: We construct and classify all polynomial growth solutions to certain drift-harmonic equations on complete manifolds with paraboloidal asymptotics. These encompass the natural drift-harmonic equations on certain steady gradient Ricci solitons. Specifically, we show that all drift-harmonic functions with polynomial growth asymptotically separate variables, and the dimension of the space of drift-harmonic functions with a given polynomial growth rate is finite.</description>

      <title>Sedimentation of particles with very small inertia I: Convergence to the transport-Stokes equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04637v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the sedimentation of $N$ spherical particles with identical radii $R$ in a Stokes flow in $\mathbb R^3$. The particles satisfy a no-slip boundary condition and are subject to constant gravity. The dynamics of the particles is modeled by Newton's law but with very small particle inertia as $N$ tends to infinity and $R$ to $0$. In a mean-field scaling, we show that the particle evolution is well approximated by the transport-Stokes system which has been derived previously as the mean-field limit of inertialess particles. In particular this justifies to neglect the particle inertia in the microscopic system, which is a typical modelling assumption in this and related contexts. The proof is based on a relative energy argument that exploits the coercivity of the particle forces with respect to the particle velocities in a Stokes flow. We combine this with an adaptation of Hauray's method for mean-field limits to $2$-Wasserstein distances. Moreover, in order to control the minimal distance between particles, we prove a representation of the particle forces. This representation makes the heuristic \enquote{Stokes law} rigorous that the force on each particle is proportional to the difference of the velocity of the individual particle and the mean-field fluid velocity generated by the other particles.</description>

      <title>Classical solutions to the thin-film equation with general mobility in the perfect-wetting regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove well-posedness, partial regularity, and stability of a thin-film equation $h_t + (m(h) h_{zzz})_z = 0$ with general mobility $m(h) = h^n$ and mobility exponent $n\in (1,\tfrac{3}{2})\cup (\tfrac{3}{2},3)$ in the regime of perfect wetting (zero contact angle). After a suitable coordinate transformation to fix the free boundary (the contact line where liquid, air, and solid coalesce), the thin-film equation is rewritten as an abstract Cauchy problem and we obtain maximal $L^{p}_t$-regularity for the linearized evolution. Partial regularity close to the free boundary is obtained by studying the elliptic regularity of the spatial part of the linearization. This yields solutions that are non-smooth in the distance to the free boundary, in line with previous findings for source-type self-similar solutions. In a scaling-wise quasi-minimal norm for the initial data, we obtain a well-posedness and asymptotic stability result for perturbations of traveling waves. The novelty of this work lies in the usage of $L^{p}$ estimates in time, where $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$, while the existing literature mostly deals with $p = 2$ at least for nonlinear mobilities. This turns out to be essential to obtain for the first time a well-posedness result in the perfect-wetting regime for all physical nonlinear slip conditions except for a strongly degenerate case at $n = \tfrac 3 2$ and the well-understood perfect-slip case $n = 1$. Furthermore, compared to [J. Differential Equations, 257(1):15-81, 2014] by Giacomelli, the first author of this paper, Kn\"upfer, and Otto, where a PDE-approach yields $L^2_t$-estimates, well-posedness, and stability for $1.8384 \approx \tfrac{3}{17}(15-\sqrt{21}) &lt; n &lt; \tfrac{3}{11}(7+\sqrt{5}) \approx 2.5189$, our functional-analytic approach is significantly shorter while at the same time giving a more general result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the linear Zakharov--Kuznetsov equation with periodic boundary conditions. Employing some tools from the nonharmonic Fourier series we obtain several internal observability theorems. Then we prove various exact controllability and rapid uniform stabilization results by applying a duality principle and a general feedback construction. The method presented here introduces a new insight into the control of dispersive equations in two-dimensional cases and may be adapted to more general equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08188v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a parabolic-elliptic type of Keller-Segel equations with generalized diffusion and logistic source under homogeneous Neumann-Neumann boundary conditions. We construct bounded weak solutions globally in time in an unbalanced optimal transport framework, provided that the magnitude of the chemotactic sensitivity can be restricted depending on parameters. In the case of subquadratic degradation of the logistic source, we quantify the chemotactic sensitivity, in particular, in terms of the power of degradation and the pointwise bound of the initial density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with solvability of the boundary value problem $$-\left[ \phi(u^{\prime}) \right] ^{\prime}=\nabla_u F(t,u), \quad \left ( \phi \left( u^{\prime }\right)(0), -\phi \left( u^{\prime }\right)(T)\right )\in \partial j(u(0), u(T)),$$ where $\phi$ is a homeomorphism from $B_a$ -- the open ball of radius $a$ centered at $0_{\mathbb{R}^N},$ onto $\mathbb{R}^N$, satisfying $\phi(0_{\mathbb{R}^N})=0_{\mathbb{R}^N}$, $\phi =\nabla \Phi$, with $\Phi: \overline{B}_a \to (-\infty, 0]$ of class $C^1$ on $B_a$, continuous and strictly convex on $\overline{B}_a.$ The potential $F:[0,T] \times \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$ is of class $C^1$ with respect to the second variable and $j:\mathbb{R}^N \times \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow (-\infty, +\infty]$ is proper, convex and lower semicontinuous. We first provide a variational formulation in the frame of critical point theory for convex, lower semicontinuous perturbations of $C^1$-functionals. Then, taking the advantage of this key step, we obtain existence of minimum energy as well as saddle-point solutions of the problem. Some concrete illustrative examples of applications are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of a two-phase viscoelastic material at finite strains. The phase evolution is assumed to be irreversible: One phase accretes in time in its normal direction, at the expense of the other. Mechanical response depends on the phase. At the same time, growth is influenced by the mechanical state at the boundary of the accreting phase, making the model fully coupled. This setting is inspired by the early stage development of solid tumors, as well as by the swelling of polymer gels. We formulate the evolution problem by coupling the balance of momenta in weak form and the growth dynamics in the viscosity sense. Both a diffused- and a sharp-interface variant of the model are proved to admit solutions and the sharp-interface limit investigated.</description>

      <title>Two direct sampling methods for an anisotropic scatterer with a conductive boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the inverse scattering problem associated with an anisotropic medium with a conductive boundary condition. We will assume that the corresponding far--field pattern or Cauchy data is either known or measured. The conductive boundary condition models a thin coating around the boundary of the scatterer. We will develop two direct sampling methods to solve the inverse shape problem by numerically recovering the scatterer. To this end, we study direct sampling methods by deriving that the corresponding imaging functionals decay as the sampling point moves away from the scatterer. These methods have been applied to other inverse shape problems, but this is the first time they will be applied to an anisotropic scatterer with a conductive boundary condition. These methods allow one to recover the scatterer by considering an inner--product of the far--field data or the Cauchy data. Here, we will assume that the Cauchy data is known on the boundary of a region $\Omega$ that completely encloses the scatterer $D$. We present numerical reconstructions in two dimensions to validate our theoretical results for both circular and non-circular scatterers.</description>

      <title>Heat Kernel Estimates for Schr\"odinger Operators with Decay at Infinity on Parabolic Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give estimates for positive solutions for the Schr\"odinger equation $(\Delta_\mu+W)u=0$ on a wide class of parabolic weighted manifolds $(M, d\mu)$ when $W$ decays to zero at infinity faster than quadratically. These can be combined with results of Grigor'yan to give matching upper and lower bounds for the heat kernel of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator $\Delta_\mu+W$. In particular, this appears to complement known results for Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbf{R}^2$.</description>

      <title>Mean field limits of co-evolutionary signed heterogeneous networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.01742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many science phenomena are modelled as interacting particle systems (IPS) coupled on static networks. In reality, network connections are far more dynamic. Connections among individuals receive feedback from nearby individuals and make changes to better adapt to the world. Hence, it is reasonable to model myriad real-world phenomena as co-evolutionary (or adaptive) networks. These networks are used in different areas including telecommunication, neuroscience, computer science, biochemistry, social science, as well as physics, where Kuramoto-type networks have been widely used to model interaction among a set of oscillators. In this paper, we propose a rigorous formulation for limits of a sequence of co-evolutionary Kuramoto oscillators coupled on heterogeneous co-evolutionary networks, which receive both positive and negative feedback from the dynamics of the oscillators on the networks. We show under mild conditions, the mean field limit (MFL) of the co-evolutionary network exists and the sequence of co-evolutionary Kuramoto networks converges to this MFL. Such MFL is described by solutions of a generalized Vlasov equation. We treat the graph limits as signed graph measures, motivated by the recent work in [Kuehn, Xu. Vlasov equations on digraph measures, JDE, 339 (2022), 261--349]. In comparison to the recently emerging works on MFLs of IPS coupled on non-co-evolutionary networks (i.e., static networks or time-dependent networks independent of the dynamics of the IPS), our work seems the first to rigorously address the MFL of a co-evolutionary network model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study time integration schemes for $\dot H^1$-solutions to the energy-(sub)critical semilinear wave equation on $\mathbb{R}^3$. We show first-order convergence in $L^2$ for the Lie splitting and convergence order $3/2$ for a corrected Lie splitting. To our knowledge this includes the first error analysis performed for scaling-critical dispersive problems. Our approach is based on discrete-time Strichartz estimates, including one (with a logarithmic correction) for the case of the forbidden endpoint. Our schemes and the Strichartz estimates contain frequency cut-offs.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the mean-field flow for learning subspace-sparse polynomials using stochastic gradient descent and two-layer neural networks, where the input distribution is standard Gaussian and the output only depends on the projection of the input onto a low-dimensional subspace. We establish a necessary condition for SGD-learnability, involving both the characteristics of the target function and the expressiveness of the activation function. In addition, we prove that the condition is almost sufficient, in the sense that a condition slightly stronger than the necessary condition can guarantee the exponential decay of the loss functional to zero.</description>

The derived convergence rate is exemplified by a number of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusive Central Limit Theorem for the Stochastic Burgers Equation at the critical dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Stochastic Burgers Equation (SBE) is a singular, non-linear Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) that describes, on mesoscopic scales, the fluctuations of stochastic driven diffusive systems with a conserved scalar quantity. In space dimension d = 2, the SBE is critical, being formally scale invariant under diffusive scaling. As such, it falls outside of the domain of applicability of the theories of Regularity Structures and paracontrolled calculus. In apparent contrast with the formal scale invariance, we fully prove the conjecture first appeared in [H. van Beijeren, R. Kutner, &amp; H. Spohn, Phys. Rev. Lett., 1986] according to which the 2d-SBE is logarithmically superdiffusive, i.e. its diffusion coefficient diverges like $(\log t)^{2/3}$ as $t\to\infty$, thus removing subleading diverging multiplicative corrections in [D. De Gaspari &amp; L. Haunschmid-Sibitz, Electron. J. Probab., 2024] and in [H.-T. Yau, Ann. of Math., 2004] for 2d-ASEP. We precisely identify the constant prefactor of the logarithm and show it is proportional to $\lambda^{4/3}$, for $\lambda&gt;0$ the coupling constant, which, intriguingly, turns out to be exactly the same as for the one-dimensional Stochastic Burgers/KPZ equation. More importantly, we prove that, under super-diffusive space-time rescaling, the SBE has an explicit Gaussian fixed point in the Renormalization Group sense, by deriving a superdiffusive central limit-type theorem for its solution.
  This is the first scaling limit result for a critical singular SPDE, beyond the weak coupling regime, and is obtained via a refined control, on all length-scales, of the resolvent of the generator of the SBE. We believe our methods are well-suited to study other out-of-equilibrium driven diffusive systems at the critical dimension, such as 2d-ASEP, which, we conjecture, have the same large-scale Fixed Point as SBE.</description>
