      <title>Asymptotics of Fubini-Study Currents for Sequences of Line Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Fubini-Study currents and equilibrium metrics of continuous Hermitian metrics on sequences of holomorphic line bundles over a fixed compact K\"ahler manifold. We show that the difference between the Fubini-Study currents and the curvature of the equilibrium metric, when appropriately scaled, converges to 0 in the sense of currents. As a consequence, we obtain sufficient conditions for the scaled Fubini-Study currents to converge weakly.</description>

      <title>Global Newlander-Nirenberg theorem on domains with finite smooth boundary in complex manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a relatively compact $C^2$ domain in a complex manifold $\mathcal M$ of dimension $n$. Assume that $H^{1}(M,\Theta)=0$ where $\Theta$ is the sheaf of germs of holomorphic tangent fields of $M$. Suppose that the Levi-form of the boundary of $M$ has at least 3 negative eigenvalues or at least $n-1$ positive eigenvalues pointwise. We will first construct a homotopy formula for $\Theta$-valued $(0,1)$-forms on $\overline M$. We then apply a Nash-Moser iteration scheme to show that if a formally integrable almost complex structure of the H\"{o}lder-Zygmund class $\Lambda^r$ on $\overline M$ is sufficiently close to the complex structure on $ M$ in the H\"{o}lder-Zygmund norm $\Lambda^{r_0}(\overline M)$ for some $r_0&gt;5/2$, then there is a diffeomorphism $F$ from $\overline M$ into $\mathcal M$ that transforms the almost complex structure into the complex structure on $F(M)$, where $F \in \Lambda^s(M)$ for all $s&lt;r+1/2$.</description>

      <title>The Unified Transform Method: beyond circular or convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new transform approach that can be used to solve mixed boundary value problems for Laplace's equation in non-convex and other planar domains, is presented. This work is an extension of Crowdy (2015, CMFT, 15, 655--687), where new transform-based techniques were developed for boundary value problems for Laplace's equation in circular domains. The key ingredient of the present method is the exploitation of the properties of the Szeg\H o kernel and its connection with the Cauchy kernel to obtain transform pairs for analytic functions in such domains. Several examples are solved in detail and numerically implemented to illustrate the application of the new transform pairs.</description>

Abstract: Let $M$ be a Riemann surface which admits an exhaustion by open subsets $M_j$ each of which is biholomorphic to a fixed domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}$. We describe $M$ in terms of $\Omega$ under various assumptions on the boundary components of $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Sobolev regularity of the Bergman and Szeg\"{o} projections in terms of $\overline{\partial}\oplus\overline{\partial}^{*}$ and $\overline{\partial}_{b}\oplus\overline{\partial}_{b}^{*}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$. It is shown that for $0\leq q\leq n$, $s\geq 0$, the embedding $j_{q}: dom(\overline{\partial})\cap dom(\overline{\partial}^{*}) \hookrightarrow L^{2}_{(0,q)}(\Omega)$ is continuous in $W^{s}(\Omega)$--norms if and only if the Bergman projection $P_{q}$ is (see below for the modification needed for $j_{0}$). The analogous result for the operators on the boundary is also proved (for $n\geq 3$). In particular, $j_{1}$ is always regular in Sobolev norms in $\mathbb{C}^{2}$, notwithstanding the fact that $N_{1}$ need not be.</description>

      <title>Pick Functions as Cauchy Transforms of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a two variable Nevanlinna representation for rational Pick functions can be viewed as the Cauchy transform of a simple undirected graph with variables assigned to the vertices. We give relations between representing functions of certain products of such graphs by way of Schur complements applied to adjacency matrices. We also study the connection between the structure of the graph and the regularity of the representing function at a boundary singularity.</description>

      <title>Inducing recurrent flows by twisting on infinite surfaces with unbounded cuffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Riemann surface $X$ is parabolic if and only if the geodesic flow (for the hyperbolic metric) on the unit tangent bundle of $X$ is ergodic. Consider a Riemann surface $X$ with a single topological end and a sequence $\alpha_n$ of pairwise disjoint, simple closed geodesics converging to the end, called {\it cuffs}. Basmajian, the first and the third author, proved that when the lengths $\ell (\alpha_n)$ of cuffs are at most $2\log n$, the surface $X$ is parabolic. One could expect that having arbitrary large cuff lengths $\ell (\alpha_n)$ (think of $\ell (\alpha_n)=n!^{n!}$) would allow the geodesic flow to escape to infinity, thus making $X$ not parabolic.
  Contrary to this and motivated by their proof of the Surface Subgroup Theorem, Kahn and Markovi\'c conjectured that for every choice of lengths $\ell (\alpha_n)$, there is a choice of twists that would make $X$ parabolic. We show that their conjecture is essentially true. Namely, for any sequence of positive numbers $\{ a_n\}$, there is a choice of lengths $\ell (\alpha_n)\geq a_n$ such that the (relative) twists by $1/2$ make $X$ parabolic. This result extends to the surfaces with countably many ends while it does not hold for uncountably many ends.</description>

      <title>Hilbert function spaces and multiplier algebras of analytic discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thesis is devoted to two related problems.
  1. The isomorphism problem for analytic discs: Suppose $V$ is the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ embedded in the $d$-dimensional unit ball $\mathbb{B}_d$ and attached to the unit sphere. Consider the space $\mathcal{H}_V$, the restriction of the Drury-Arveson space to the variety $V$, and its multiplier algebra $\mathcal{M}_V = \operatorname{Mult}(\mathcal{H}_V)$. The isomorphism problem is the following: Is $V_1 \cong V_2$ equivalent to $\mathcal{M}_{V_1} \cong \mathcal{M}_{V_2}$?
  A theorem of Alpay, Putinar and Vinnikov states that for $V$ without self-crossings on the boundary $\mathcal{M}_V$ is the space of bounded analytic functions on $V$. We consider what happens when there are self-crossings on the boundary and prove that if $\mathcal{M}_{V_1} \cong \mathcal{M}_{V_2}$ algebraically, then $V_1$ and $V_2$ must have the same self-crossings up to a unit disc automorphism. We prove that an isomorphism between $\mathcal{M}_{V_1}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{V_2}$ can only be given by a composition with a map from $V_1$ to $V_2$. In the case of a single self-crossing we show that there are only two possible candidates for this map and find these candidates.
  2. The embedding dimension for complete Pick spaces: A Theorem of Agler and McCarthy states that any complete Pick space can be realized as $\mathcal{H}_V$, for some $V$ in $\mathbb{B}_d$, where $d$ can be infinite. The smallest such $d$ is called the embedding dimension. Given a complete Pick space can we find its embedding dimension? Can we at least determine if it is finite or infinite?
  We look into this problem for rotation-invariant spaces on the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$. We prove a general result which explicitly relates the embedding dimension with the kernel of the space. This allows us to prove that the embedding dimension for certain weighted Hardy-type spaces is infinite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\varphi_j$, $j=1,2, \dots, N$, be holomorphic self-maps of the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$ of $\mathbb{C}$. We prove that the compactness of a linear combination of the composition operators $C_{\varphi_j}: f\mapsto f\circ\varphi_j$ on the Hardy space $H^p(\mathbb{D})$ does not depend on $p$ for $0&lt;p&lt;\infty$. This answers a conjecture of Choe et al. about the compact differences $C_{\varphi_1} - C_{\varphi_2}$ on $H^p(\mathbb{D})$, $0&lt;p&lt;\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to construct a class of smooth bounded pseudoconvex domains whose boundary contains a given Stein manifold with strongly pseudoconvex boundary, having a prescribed codimension and D'Angelo class (a cohomological invariant measuring the "winding" of the boundary of the domain around the submanifold). Some open questions in the regularity theory of the $\overline\partial$-Neumann problem are discussed in the setting of these domains.</description>

      <title>New degeneration phenomenon for infinite-type Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the Teichm\"uller space of a surface $R$ is a deformation space of complex structures defined on $R$, its Bers boundary describes the degeneration of complex structures in a certain sense. In this paper, constructing a concrete example, we prove that if S is a Riemann surface of infinite type, there exists a Riemann surface with the marking, which is homeomorphic to the surface $R$ in the Bers boundary. We also show that many such degenerations exist in the Bers boundary.</description>
