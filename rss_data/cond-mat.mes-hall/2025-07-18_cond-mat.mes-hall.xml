      <title>Nonreciprocal magnetic-field-induced second harmonic generation of exciton polaritons in ZnSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the optical second harmonic generation (SHG) on the 1S exciton-polariton resonance in bulk ZnSe that is subject to an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the light wave vector $\mathbf k$ (Voigt geometry). For the symmetry allowed geometry with the $\mathbf{k}\parallel[111]$ crystal axes, the nonreciprocal dependence of the SHG intensity on the magnetic field direction is found. It is explained by an interference of the crystallographic and magnetic-field-induced SHG signals. Relative phases of these signals are evaluated from the rotational anisotropy diagrams. Phenomenological and microscopic models of the effect are developed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental observation of the nonreciprocal SHG in semiconductor crystals, and the first one for exciton-polaritons.</description>

      <title>Spin Polarization driven by Itinerant Orbital Angular Momentum in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the possibility of manipulating magnetic materials by using itinerant orbital angular momentum to produce out-of-plane spin polarization in van der Waals heterostructures. Employing a real-space formulation of the OAM operator within linear response theory, we demonstrate that in low-symmetry transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers, such as 1$T{}_d$-MoTe2, the current-induced itinerant OAM exceeds the spin response by three orders of magnitude. When TMDs are coupled with ferromagnets with negligible intrinsic orbital responses, the itinerant OAM generated by the orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect transfers across the interface, generating spin densities capable of inducing magnetization dynamics inside the ferromagnet. Our findings highlight the previously overlooked role of itinerant OAM in the generation of out-of-plane spin densities, which serves as an emerging mechanism for efficient electrical control of magnetization in low-power, ultracompact storage devices.</description>

      <title>Spin relaxation in a polariton fluid: quantum hydrodynamic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity polaritons, the elementary excitations appearing in quantum microcavities in the strong-coupling regime, reveal clear signatures of quantum collective behavior. The combination of unique spin structure and strong nonlinear response opens the possibility of direct experimental observation of a plethora of nontrivial optical polarization phenomena. Spin relaxation processes are of crucial importance here. However, a mathematical formalism for their coherent description is still absent. In the present paper, based on the quantum hydrodynamics approach for a two-component liquid, we derive the set of the corresponding equations where both energy and spin relaxation terms appear naturally. We analyze in detail how these terms affect the dynamics of spinor polariton droplets in the external magnetic field and the dispersion of elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of spinor bosonic condensates, where the processes of spin relaxation play a major role.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Indistinguishable Photon Emission from a GaAs Quantum Dot via Charge Noise Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of indistinguishable single photons is a fundamental requirement for future quantum technologies, particularly in quantum repeater networks and for distributed quantum computing based on entanglement distribution. However, spectral jitter, often induced by charge noise in epitaxial quantum dots, leads to exciton dephasing, thereby limiting their practical usage in quantum applications. We present a straightforward approach to mitigate charge noise-induced decoherence in droplet-etched GaAs quantum dots embedded in an n-i-p diode structure and integrated deterministically into an electrically contacted circular Bragg grating resonator for emission enhancement. The quantum device allows for the stabilization of the charge environment by applying an external electrical field while producing a photon extraction efficiency of approximately (37 +- 2)%. Hong-Ou-Mandel two-photon interference measurements reveal a strong voltage dependence of the exciton dephasing time and interference visibility on the applied bias in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions. Notably, the reduction in visibility from a maximum, charge-stabilized corrected value of 97 percent at the optimum bias point follows an inverse square dependence (proportional to 1/I^2) with increasing diode current (I) in forward direction. Under a quasi-resonant excitation scheme, we achieve a maximum exciton dephasing time (T2*) of approximately (6.8 +-0.5) ns, reaching nearly the Fourier limit (T2 = 2T1) without the need for complex echo schemes like Ramsey or Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequences. These findings are consistent with theoretical predictions from rate equation modeling and quantum optical analysis as well as voltage-dependent linewidth measurements, demonstrating optimized electrical control of exciton dephasing.</description>

      <title>Collinear Antiferromagnetic Tunnel Junctions Implemented in Van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are crucial components in high-performance spintronic devices. Traditional MTJs rely on ferromagnetic (FM) materials but significant improvements in speed and packing density could be enabled by exploiting antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds instead. Here, we report all-collinear AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) fabricated with van der Waals A-type AFM metal (Fe0.6Co0.4)5GeTe2 (FCGT) electrodes and nonmagnetic semiconducting WSe2 tunnel barriers. The AFMTJ heterostructure device achieves a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of up to 75% in response to magnetic field switching. Our results demonstrate that the TMR exclusively emerges in the AFM state of FCGT, rather than during the AFM-to-FM transition. By engineering FCGT electrodes with either even- or odd-layer configurations, volatile or non-volatile TMR could be selected, consistent with an entirely interfacial effect. TMR in the even-layer devices arose by N\'eel vector switching. In the odd-layer devices, TMR stemmed from interfacial spin-flipping. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal a new TMR mechanism associated with interface-driven spin-polarized transport, despite the spin-independent nature of bulk FCGT. Our work demonstrates that all-collinear AFMTJs can provide comparable performance to conventional MTJs and introduces a new paradigm for AFM spintronics, in which the spin-dependent properties of AFM interfaces are harnessed.</description>

      <title>Probing nontrivial fusion of Majorana zero modes via near-adiabatic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and simulate a near-adiabatically coupling probing scheme for nontrivial fusion of a pair of Majorara zero modes (MZMs). The scheme can avoid the complexity of oscillating charge occupation in the probing quantum dot, making thus practical measurements more feasible. We also show how to extract the information of nonadiabatic transition and fermion parity violation caused during moving the MZMs together to fuse, from the initial states prepared with definite fermion parity. All the simulations, including the effective coupling between the fusing MZMs, and their coupling to the probing quantum dot, are based on the lattice model of a Rashba quantum wire in proximity contact with an s-wave superconductor, under the modulation of mini-gate voltage control.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional spinless Euler insulators with rotational symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euler class is a $\mathbb{Z}$-valued topological invariant that characterizes a pair of real bands in a two-dimensional Brillouin zone. One of the symmetries that permits its definition is $C_{2z}T$, where $C_{2z}$ denotes a twofold rotation about the $z$ axis and $T$ denotes time-reversal symmetry. Here, we study three-dimensional spinless insulators characterized by the Euler class, focusing on the case where additional $C_{4z}$ or $C_{6z}$ rotational symmetry is present, and investigate the relationship between the Euler class of the occupied bands and their rotation eigenvalues. We first consider two-dimensional systems and clarify the transformation rules for the real Berry connection and curvature under point group operations, using the corresponding sewing matrices. Applying these rules to $C_{4z}$ and $C_{6z}$ operations, we obtain explicit formulas that relate the Euler class to the rotation eigenvalues at high-symmetry points. We then extend our analysis to three-dimensional systems, focusing on the difference in the Euler class between the two $C_{2z}T$-invariant planes. We derive analytic expressions that relate the difference in the Euler class to two types of representation-protected invariants and analyze their phase transitions. We further construct tight-binding models and perform numerical calculations to support our analysis and elucidate the bulk-boundary correspondence.</description>

      <title>Coulomb-mediated single-electron heat transfer statistics across capacitively coupled silicon nanodots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat transfer mediated by the Coulomb interaction reveals unconventional thermodynamic behavior and broadens thermodynamics research into fields such as quantum dynamics and information engineering. Although some experimental demonstrations of phenomena utilizing Coulomb-mediated heat transfer have been reported, estimations of their performance, such as efficiency, and their theoretical evaluations necessitate qualitative evaluation of the transfer mechanism itself, which remains challenging. We present an experiment investigating single-electron dynamics in two electrostatically coupled silicon nanodots to quantify Coulomb-mediated heat transfer at the nanoscale. By estimating the Coulomb interaction strength between the dots using the cross-correlation measurements of the single-electron dynamics, we convert the single-electron dynamics into the statistics of Coulomb-mediated heat transfer. Conducting the experiment at equilibrium enabled us to obtain a fluctuating net-zero heat transfer between the dots. These heat transfer statistics are essential for exploring device functionalities from the perspective of stochastic thermodynamics and for verifying universal relations in nonequilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric multiferroics: from fundamentals to transformative applications -- a mini review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroics, combining ferroelectric and magnetic orders, enable magnetoelectric (ME) coupling for advanced applications. This mini review explores single-phase and composite multiferroics, examining phenomenological, microscopic, nanostruc-tured, and quantum mechanisms driving ME effects. Phenomenological models quantify coupling coefficients, while microscopic approaches reveal spin-lattice in-teractions, including frustrated spin states and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya contributions. Nanostructured systems, such as plasmonic skyrmion lattices and metasurfaces, en-hance ME effects for tunable birefringence and electromagnon amplification. Quan-tum heat engines utilize spin entanglement and topological protection in chiral chains and skyrmion lattices for efficient energy conversion. Applications include high-sensitivity magnetic sensors, tunable radio-frequency devices, energy-efficient MERAM, energy harvesters, quantum heat engines, and thermal diodes. Future re-search aims to optimize room-temperature ME coupling, scalability, coherence, and biocompatibility for innovations in sensing, quantum computing, and sustainable energy.</description>

      <title>Harmonic generation of graphene quantum dots in Hartree-Fock approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate harmonic generation in graphene quantum dots under linearly polarized optical pulses, focusing on excitonic effects. Combining the tight-binding model and the single-particle density matrix approach, we derive a semiconductor Bloch equation under a static-screened Hartree-Fock approximation. This framework characterizes the electron-electron interaction through local Hartree potentials for direct Coulomb interaction and nonlocal Fock potentials for exchange interaction. Distinct confgurations of Hartree and Fock terms yield various approximation methods, including independent-particle approximation, mean-feld approximation, random phase approximation, and excitonic effects. We thoroughly analyze how these approximation methods affect the electronic energy levels, linear optical absorption, and nonlinear harmonic generation. Within excitonic effects, we present the dependence of harmonic generation on the geometric variations of graphene quantum dots (sizes, triangular/hexagonal shapes, and armchair/zigzag edges) and the amplitude and polarization of electric fields. Our findings show that excitonic effects significantly enhance optical responses of graphene nanostructures. For a dot ensemble formed by randomly oriented graphene quantum dots,
  only odd-order harmonics exist along the polarization direction of the incident light. Crucially, harmonic generation in graphene quantum dots exhibits high tunability via geometric configuration, making them promising candidates for nonlinear optical nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Phonon-Assisted Tunneling in Metal -- Twisted Bilayer Graphene Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report planar tunneling spectroscopy measurements on metal-WSe$_2$-twisted bilayer graphene heterostructures across a broad range of gate and bias voltages. The observed experimental features are attributed to phonon-assisted tunneling and the significantly high density of states within the moir\'e bands. A notable finding is the enhanced phonon-assisted tunneling in twisted bilayer graphene compared to Bernal bilayer graphene, which arises from a more relaxed in-plane momentum matching criterion. Theoretical calculations of phonon dispersions enable us to identify low-energy phonon modes in both Bernal and twisted bilayers of graphene, thereby elucidating the underlying mechanism of tunneling. Our results establish planar tunneling as a versatile tool to further understand electron-phonon coupling in twisted van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast thermal boundary conductance under large temperature discontinuities of ultrathin epitaxial Pb films on Si(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat transfer is a critical aspect of modern electronics, and a deeper understanding of the underlying physics is essential for building faster, smaller, and more powerful devices with an improved performance and efficiency. In such nanoscale structures the heat transfer between two materials is limited by the finite thermal boundary conductance across their interface. Using ultrafast electron diffraction under grazing incidence we investigated the heat transfer from ultrathin epitaxial Pb films to an Si(111) substrate under strong non-equilibrium conditions. Applying an intense femtosecond laser pulse, the 5-7 ML thin Pb film experiences a strong heat up by 10-120 K while the Si substrate remains cold at $\approx$ 10 K. At such large temperature discontinuities we observe a significantly faster cooling for stronger excited Pb films. The decrease of the corresponding cooling time constant is explained through the thermal boundary conductance in the framework of the diffuse mismatch model. The thermal boundary conductance is reduced by more than a factor of three in comparison with Pb films grown on H-terminated substrates, pointing out the importance of the morphology of substrate, film and their interface.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Strain-Engineered Thermoelectric Performance of 2D-Xene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for efficient and scalable thermoelectric materials has catalyzed intense interest in quasi 1D nanoribbons, where reduced dimensionality and structural tunability can decouple key transport parameters to enhance energy conversion. In this work, we present a unified comparative study of the thermopower in armchair nanoribbons derived from five archetypal 2D materials: graphene, silicene, germanene, stanene and phosphorene. Using a tight binding model parametrized by first principles inputs and solved within the Landauer Buttiker formalism, we compute strain and width dependent thermopower across nanoribbons classified by width families (3p, 3p+1, 3p+2) over a wide range of uniaxial tensile strain. Our results reveal that thermoelectric behavior is governed by a complex interplay of bandgap evolution, chemical potential asymmetry, and quantum confinement. While graphene and silicene exhibit pronounced family and width sensitive thermopower enhancement under moderate strain, heavier Xenes such as germanene and stanene show diminished responses. In particular, phosphorene nanoribbons emerge as exceptional, exhibiting remarkably high thermopower (62 kB/e), a consequence of their large, persistent bandgap and anisotropic electronic structure. Across all systems, the 3p+2 family transitions from near-metallic to semiconducting under strain, enabling dramatic activation of thermopower in previously inactive configurations. This systematic cross material analysis delineates the design principles for the optimization of TE in 1D nanoribbons, highlighting the strategic use of width control and strain engineering. Our findings identify phosphorene as an intrinsically superior thermoelectric material and position strained Xene nanoribbons as promising candidates for tunable, low-dimensional thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Improving photovoltaics by adding extra terminals to extract hot carriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photovoltaic cells usually have two terminals, one collecting electrons and the other collecting holes. Can more terminals improve such solar cells? Energy-filtering terminals could collect "hot" carriers (electrons or holes not yet relaxed to the band edge), with other terminals for low-energy carriers. For collection faster than carrier-phonon relaxation, we predict four-terminal cells with higher power output than optimal two-terminal cells -- more than 40% higher for fast carrier collection. Similar effects will occur in multi-terminal thermoelectrics exploiting non-equilibrium distributions</description>

      <title>Impact of electronic correlations on the superconductivity of high-pressure CeH9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth superhydrides have attracted considerable attention because of their high critical superconducting temperature under extreme pressures. They are known to have localized valence electrons, implying strong electronic correlations. However, such many-body effects are rarely included in first-principles studies of rare-earth superhydrides because of the complexity of their high-pressure phases. In this work, we use a combined density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory approach to study both electrons and phonons in the prototypical rare-earth superhydride CeH$_9$, shedding light on the impact of electronic correlations on its critical temperature for phonon-mediated superconductivity. Our findings indicate that electronic correlations result in a larger electronic density at the Fermi level, a bigger superconducting gap, and softer vibrational modes associated with hydrogen atoms. Together, the inclusion of these correlation signatures increases the Migdal-Eliashberg superconducting critical temperature from 47 K to 96 K, close to the measured 95 K. Our results reconcile experimental observations and theoretical predictions for CeH$_9$ and herald a path towards the quantitative modeling of phonon-mediated superconductivity for interacting electron systems.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of Vacancy-Assisted Reversible Phase Transition in Monolayer MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the kinetics of phase transition between the 2H and 1T$^\prime$ phases in monolayer MoTe$_2$ using atomistic simulations based on a machine learning interatomic potential trained on SCAN-DFT data, combined with mean field kinetic theory to interpret the underlying mechanisms. The transition is found to involve both diffusive and diffusionless mechanisms. Nucleation of 1T$^\prime$ phase is initiated by the coalescence of neighboring Te monovacancies into divacancies, which are found to be mobile and can interact with other Te vacancies to form small triangular 1T$^\prime$ islands. Growth of these islands proceeds either by incorporating pre-existing vacancies at the phase boundaries or, in their absence, by absorbing divacancies that migrate from the surrounding lattice. Once a critical island size is reached, vacancy-free growth becomes possible although with a higher activation barrier. Upon removal of external stimuli, the system reverts to 2H phase, during which Te vacancies reorganize into three-fold spoke-like vacancy lines at the island center. This reverse process and the subsequent 1T$^\prime$$\leftrightarrow$2H reversible transitions are diffusionless, rapid, do not require additional vacancies and can be driven by mild external stimuli. Although our analysis focuses on strain-induced transitions, the kinetic mechanisms are expected to be generalizable to other types of stimuli.</description>

      <title>Low-energy domain wall racetracks with multiferroic topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional racetrack memories move information by pushing magnetic domain walls or other spin textures with spin-polarized currents, but the accompanying Joule heating inflates their energy budget and can hamper scaling. Here we present a voltage-controlled, magnetoelectric racetrack in which transverse electric fields translate coupled ferroelectric-antiferromagnetic walls along BiFeO3 nanostrips at room temperature. Because no charge traverses the track, the switching dissipates orders of magnitude less energy than the most efficient spin-torque devices with more favourable scaling, making the scheme significantly more attractive at the nanoscale. We further uncover noncollinear topological magnetoelectric textures that emerge at domain walls in BiFeO3, where the nature of these topologies influences their stability upon translation. Among these are polar bi-merons and polar vertices magnetoelectrically coupled with magnetic cycloid disclinations and previously unobserved, topological magnetic cycloid twist topologies. We observe domain wall velocities of at least kilometres per second - matching or surpassing the fastest ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic racetracks and approaching the acoustic-phonon limit of BiFeO3 - while preserving these topologies over tens of micrometres. The resulting high velocity, low-energy racetrack delivers nanosecond access times without the thermal overhead of current-driven schemes, charting a path toward dense, ultralow-power racetrack devices which rely on spin texture translation.</description>

      <title>Walking on Archimedean Lattices: Insights from Bloch Band Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Returning walks on a lattice are sequences of moves that start at a given lattice site and return to the same site after $n$ steps. Determining the total number of returning walks of a given length $n$ is a typical graph-theoretical problem with connections to lattice models in statistical and condensed matter physics. We derive analytical expressions for the returning walk numbers on the eleven two-dimensional Archimedean lattices by developing a connection to the theory of Bloch energy bands. We benchmark our results through an alternative method that relies on computing the moments of adjacency matrices of large graphs, whose construction we explain explicitly. As a condensed matter physics application, we use our formulas to compute the density of states of tight-binding models on the Archimedean lattices. While the Archimedean lattices provide a sufficiently rich structure and are chosen here for concreteness, our techniques can be generalized straightforwardly to other two- or higher-dimensional Euclidean lattices.</description>

      <title>Extreme Thermal Insulation in Nano-Bubble Wrap Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving ultra-low thermal conductivity under ambient conditions is a fundamental challenge constrained by classical heat transport limits and material design trade-offs. Here, we introduce a new class of nano-bubble wrap architectures that achieve exceptionally low thermal conductivity by integrating nanoscale gas confinement with atomically thin, weakly coupled van der Waals solids. Using scalable patterning of 2D monolayers into periodic nano-bubbles and nano-wrinkles, we construct materials with structural analogies to macroscopic bubble wrap but engineered at length scales much shorter than the mean free path of air and the mean free path of phonons in the atomically thin monolayers. Time-domain thermoreflectance measurements reveal out-of-plane thermal conductivities nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of air and commercial aerogels, reaching critical values below 0.001 W $\cdot$ M$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ under room temperature and atmospheric pressure. This extreme thermal resistance arises from the combined suppression of gas-phase conduction, phonon transport, and interfacial coupling. Our findings establish nano-bubble wraps as a versatile platform for tuning heat flow in ultrathin materials and open new pathways for designing thermal metamaterials and energy-efficient technologies.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic magnetization dynamics in tensile-strained ultrathin yttrium iron garnets with tunable magnetic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a significant reduction of low-temperature damping losses in tensile-strained, ultrathin Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) films grown by pulsed laser deposition, exhibiting ultralow damping constants and tunable magnetic anisotropy. Comparative broadband FMR measurements show that tensile-strained YIG films on Gd3Sc2Ga3O12 (GSGG) retain low damping even at nanometer thicknesses and cryogenic temperatures, outperforming relaxed films on Gd3Ga5O12. Based on static magnetometry measurements and microstructural characterization, we attribute these enhanced dynamic properties to the suppression of interdiffusion across the YIG/GSGG interface, resulting from enhanced chemical stability and favorable growth kinetics by the presence of Sc. Our findings highlight the importance of chemical and kinetic factors in achieving few-nanometer-thick YIG film with negligible low-temperature damping dissipation and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for cryogenic spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometrical bound relations for observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) provides nontrivial bound relations among physical quantities, as exemplified by the metric-curvature inequality. In this paper, we investigate various bound relations for different observables through certain generalizations of the QGT. First, by generalizing the parameter space, we demonstrate that bound relations hold for all linear responses. As an application, we show the thermodynamic inequality originating from the convexity of free energy can be further tightened. Second, by extending the projection operator, we establish a bound relation between the Drude weight and the orbital magnetization. The equality is exactly satisfied in the Landau level system, and systems with nearly flat bands tend to approach equality as well. We apply the resulting inequality to two orbital ferromagnets and support that the twisted bilayer graphene system is close to the Landau level system. Moreover, we show that an analogous inequality also holds for a higher-order multipole, magnetic quadrupole. Finally, we discuss the analogy between the QGT and the uncertainty principle, emphasizing that the existence of nontrivial bound relations necessarily reflects quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Current-based metrology with two-terminal mesoscopic conductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional approach to quantum parameter estimation focuses on the quantum state, deriving fundamental bounds on precision through the quantum Fisher information. In most experimental settings, however, performing arbitrary quantum measurements is highly unfeasible. In open quantum systems, an alternative approach to metrology involves the measurement of stochastic currents flowing from the system to its environment. However, the present understanding of current-based metrology is mostly limited to Markovian master equations. Considering a parameter estimation problem in a two-terminal mesoscopic conductor, we identify the key elements that determine estimation precision within the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism. Crucially, this approach allows us to address arbitrary coupling and temperature regimes. Furthermore, we obtain analytical results for the precision in linear-response and zero-temperature regimes. For the specific parameter estimation task that we consider, we demonstrate that the boxcar transmission function is optimal for current-based metrology in all parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Triple-q State in Antiferromagnetic Monolayer Interfaced with Bismuthene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have successfully fabricated the bismuthene covered Mn monolayer on Ag(111) by evaporating Mn atoms onto (pxroot3)-Bi/Ag(111) at room temperature. By using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM), we have resolved the magnetic triple-q (3Q) state. In combination with density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, the 3Q3-like spin texture is the magnetic ground state for the bismuthene covered Mn monolayer/Ag(111). Interestingly, the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of 3Q3 state triggered by the bismuthene on top of Mn monolayer/Ag(111) has been revealed, which is consistent with the switching of 3Q3up and 3Q3down domains observed by SP-STM measurements with external magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>A superinductor in a deep sub-micron integrated circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superinductors are circuit elements characterised by an intrinsic impedance in excess of the superconducting resistance quantum ($R_\text{Q}\approx6.45~$k$\Omega$), with applications from metrology and sensing to quantum computing. However, they are typically obtained using exotic materials with high density inductance such as Josephson junctions, superconducting nanowires or twisted two-dimensional materials. Here, we present a superinductor realised within a silicon integrated circuit (IC), exploiting the high kinetic inductance ($\sim 1$~nH/$\square$) of TiN thin films native to the manufacturing process (22-nm FDSOI). By interfacing the superinductor to a silicon quantum dot formed within the same IC, we demonstrate a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rfSET), the most widely used sensor in semiconductor-based quantum computers. The integrated nature of the rfSET reduces its parasitics which, together with the high impedance, yields a sensitivity improvement of more than two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art, combined with a 10,000-fold area reduction. Beyond providing the basis for dense arrays of integrated and high-performance qubit sensors, the realization of high-kinetic-inductance superconducting devices integrated within modern silicon ICs opens many opportunities, including kinetic-inductance detector arrays for astronomy and the study of metamaterials and quantum simulators based on 1D and 2D resonator arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of topology on the magnetic response of inductively coupled superconducting flux-qubit networks. Using exact diagonalization methods and linear response theory, we compare the magnetic response of linear and cross-shaped array geometries, used as paradigmatic examples. We find that the peculiar coupling matrix in cross-shaped arrays yields a significant enhancement of the magnetic flux response compared to linear arrays, this network-topology effect arising from cooperative coupling among the central and the peripheral qubits. These results establish quantitative design criteria for function-oriented superconducting quantum circuits, with direct implications for advancing performance in both quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Concerning the latter, by exploiting the non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics of such arrays, we demonstrate their suitability for quantum reservoir computing technology. This dual functionality suggests a novel platform in which the same device serves both as a quantum-limited electromagnetic sensor and as a reservoir capable of signal processing, enabling integrated quantum sensing and processing architectures.</description>

      <title>Entanglement properties of photon-magnon crystal from nonlinear perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying the entanglement between two continuous bosonic modes, such as magnons and photons, is not trivial. The logarithmic negativity, calculated through the quantum Langevin equations is subjected to thermal noise. However this method requires further approximation. The phase space of a generic nonlinear system contains topologically different regions, and the steady state may correspond to the different types of fixed points, such as Saddle Points, Stable or unstable Spirals, and Nodes. In the present work, we propose a new procedure. Namely, we derived the complete set of nonlinear equations, which includes equations for the magnon and photon number operators and phases. We show that not only number operators but also phases are important for exploring the character of the fixed point, and magnon-photon entanglement. We showed that methods of the qualitative theory of nonlinear differential equations are also relevant for photon-magnon entanglement problems. Our main finding is that entanglement is not defined in the Saddle Point region. On the other hand, the maximum of the entanglement corresponds to the region near the border between the Stable node and Stable spiral regions. Our approach is quite general. However, we did calculations for a particular system: photon-magnon crystal based on the yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film with the periodic air holes drilled in the film. Our interest focuses on magnons with a particular wavelength and frequency corresponding to the magnon condensate. Those magnons couple strongly with the photons of similar frequency. We discuss in detail the interaction between magnons and photons originating from the magneto-electric coupling and the effective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We show that this interaction is responsible for the robust photon-magnon entanglement in the system.</description>

Abstract: Optical detection of magnetic resonance using quantum spin sensors (QSS) provides a spatially local and sensitive technique to probe spin dynamics in magnets. However, its utility as a probe of antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) remains an open question. We report the first experimental demonstration of optically detected AFMR in layered van der Waals antiferromagnets (AF) up to frequencies of 24 GHz. We leverage QSS spin relaxation due to low-frequency magnetic field fluctuations arising from collective dynamics of magnons excited by the uniform AFMR mode. First, through AFMR spectroscopy we characterize the intrinsic exchange fields and magnetic anisotropies of the AF. Second, using the localized sensitivity of the QSS we demonstrate magnon transport over tens of micrometers. Finally, we find that optical detection efficiency increases with increasing frequency. This showcases the dual capabilities of QSS as detectors of high frequency magnetization dynamics and magnon transport, paving the way for understanding and controlling the magnetism of antiferromagnets.</description>

Abstract: Featuring exotic quantum transport and surface states, topological semimetals can be classified into nodal-point, nodal-line, and nodal-surface semimetals according to the degeneracy and dimensionality of their nodes. However, a topological semimetal that possesses both nodal points and nodal lines is rarely reported. Here, we propose a scheme to construct this type of topological semimetal, which simultaneously exhibits hinge Fermi arcs and drumhead surface states. Then, by applying periodic driving on the system, we find a hybrid-order topological semimetal with nodal points and rich nodal-line structures and its conversion into a first-order topological semimetal, which are absent in a static system. Our results enrich the family of topological semimetals, and establish a foundation for further exploration of their potential applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography of the superfluid-insulator transition for a mesoscopic atomtronic ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a phase-space perspective for the analysis of the superfluid-insulator transition for finite-size Bose-Hubbard circuits. We explore how the eigenstates parametrically evolve as the inter-particle interaction is varied, paying attention to the fingerprints of chaos at the quantum phase-transition. Consequently, we demonstrate that the tomographic spectrum reflects the existence of mixed-regions of chaos and quasi-regular motion in phase-space. This tomographic semiclassical approach is much more efficient and informative compared to the traditional "level statistics" inspection. Of particular interest is the characterization of the fluctuations that are exhibited by the many-body eigenstates. In this context, we associate with each eigenstate a Higgs measure for the identification of amplitude modes of the order-parameter. Finally we focus on the formation of the lowest Goldstone and Higgs bands.</description>

      <title>Enantiosensitive locking of photoelectron spin and cation orientation</title>

Abstract: Chirality describes the asymmetry between an object and its mirror image, underpinning diverse functionalities across all scales of matter - from molecules and aggregates to thin films and bulk chiral materials. A particularly intriguing example is chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where chiral structures orient electron spins enantio-sensitively. Despite extensive research, the fundamental origin of spin-chirality coupling, the unexpectedly large magnitude of the CISS effect, and the possible role of electromagnetic fields remain unclear. Here, we address these issues by examining the simplest scenario: spin-resolved photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules. We uncover two universal geometric mechanisms of spin-selective photodynamics, arising solely from electric-dipole interactions and previously unrecognized. These mechanisms operate effectively even in amorphous chiral media under isotropic illumination and persist at weak spin-orbit coupling, underscoring fundamental aspects of spin-chirality interplay. We further identify an unreported phenomenon central to CISS: locking of photoelectron spin orientation to molecular geometry. Our findings provide a unified geometric framework with broad implications, extending from CISS and asymmetric catalysis to spin textures in chiral crystals and chiral quantum materials such as Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Electrically reconfigurable extended lasing state in an organic liquid-crystal microcavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small-footprint, low-power arrays of coupled coherent emitters with the capability of near- and far-field engineering and coherence control are highly sought after to meet modern nanophotonics evolving needs. Between existing solutions based on vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, phase masks in bulk traditional cavity-based systems, and lattices of exciton-polariton condensates, only the strongly light-matter coupled systems were shown to be capable of controlled on-chip interaction between the individual coherent states while often operating at cryogenic temperatures. Here we demonstrate electrically controlled in-plane interaction between optically reconfigurable spatially separated lasing states, operating at room temperature in the weak light-matter coupling regime. We show spatially extended coherent lasing state or "supermode" with wide-range micro-scale control of near-field, far-field and on-chip phase-locking tuning functionality. An extended lasing state appears due to near-field transverse coupling between distinct spatially pumped lasing states in the plane of an organic liquid crystal-filled microcavity. We realize electrical control over the interaction strength between lasing states and corresponding mutual coherence going beyond nearest neighbours through electrical tuning of the microcavity optical modes with external voltage, and a spin-selective directional coupling regime by using a photonic analogue of the Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <title>SOT Enabled 3D Magnetic Field Sensor with Low Offset and High Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we demonstrate a spin-orbit torque (SOT) magnetic field sensor, designed as a Ta/CoFeB/MgO structure, with high sensitivity and capable of active offset compensation in all three spatial directions. This is described and verified in both experiment and simulation. The measurements of magnetic fields showed an offset of 36, 50, and 37$\mathrm{\mu T}$ for x-, y-, and z-fields. Furthermore, the sensitivities of these measurements had values of 590, 580, and 490$\mathrm{V\,A^{-1}\,T^{-1}}$ in the x-, y-, and z-direction. In addition, the robustness to bias fields is demonstrated via experiments and single spin simulations by applying bias fields in y-direction. Cross sensitivities were further analyzed via single spin simulations performing a parameter sweep of different bias fields in the y- and z-direction up to $\pm$1mT. Finally, the extraction of the SOT parameters $\eta_\mathrm{DL}$ and $\eta_\mathrm{FL}$ is shown via optimization of a single-spin curve to the experimental measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The family of anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) emerging materials is rapidly evolving due to their low crystal symmetry and in-plane structural anisotropy. Among these, 2D tin sulfide (SnS) has gained significant attention because of its distinctive crystalline symmetry and the resulting extraordinary anisotropic physical properties. This perspective explores recent developments in anisotropic 2D SnS. In particular, it highlights advances in isolating high-quality SnS monolayers (1L-SnS) and in applying advanced techniques for anisotropic characterization. The discussion continues with an overview of the anisotropic optical and electronic properties of SnS, followed by recent progress in emerging electronic device applications, including energy conversion &amp; storage, neuromorphic (synaptic) systems, spintronics and quantum technologies. In addition to presenting significant research findings on SnS, this perspective outlines current limitations and discusses emerging opportunities and future prospects for its application in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Light-hole states and hyperfine interaction in electrically-defined Ge/GeSn quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate hole spins confined in a gate-defined quantum dot (QD) embedded in GeSn/Ge/GeSn quantum well (QW) structure. Owing to the tensile strain in the Ge layer, the system effectively realizes a light-hole qubit. We systematically study how various morphological parameters influence the energy spectrum, g-factors, and the hyperfine coupling to the nuclear spin bath. The simulations are carried out using a realistic, fully atomic sp$^3$d$^5$s$^*$ tight-binding model. We also perform complementary DFT calculations of wave functions near the atomic cores and use them to parameterize the hyperfine-interaction Hamiltonian. We evaluate the Overhauser field fluctuations and demonstrate that the strength of the hyperfine coupling for the lowest hole doublet crucially depends on the Sn content in the barrier. We highlight the conduction-valence band mixing, which leads to considerable $s$-type admixtures to the hole states, providing the dominant channel of hyperfine coupling due to the Fermi contact interaction.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian entanglement dip from scaling-induced exceptional criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well established that the entanglement entropy of a critical system generally scales logarithmically with system size. Yet, in this work, we report a new class of non-Hermitian critical transitions that exhibit dramatic divergent dips in their entanglement entropy scaling, strongly violating conventional logarithmic behavior. Dubbed scaling-induced exceptional criticality (SIEC), it transcends existing non-Hermitian mechanisms such as exceptional bound states and non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)-induced gap closures, which are nevertheless still governed by logarithmic entanglement scaling. Key to SIEC is its strongly scale-dependent spectrum, where eigenbands exhibit an exceptional crossing only at a particular system size. As such, the critical behavior is dominated by how the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) sweeps through the exceptional crossing with increasing system size, and not just by the gap closure per se. We provide a general approach for constructing SIEC systems based on the non-local competition between heterogeneous NHSE pumping directions, and show how a scale-dependent GBZ can be analytically derived to excellent accuracy. Beyond 1D free fermions, SIEC is expected to occur more prevalently in higher-dimensional or even interacting systems, where antagonistic NHSE channels generically proliferate. SIEC-induced entanglement dips generalize straightforwardly to kinks in other entanglement measures such as Renyi entropy, and serve as spectacular demonstrations of how algebraic and geometric singularities in complex band structures manifest in quantum information.</description>

      <title>Dislocations saturation in slip rate-driven processes and initial microstructure effects for large plastic deformation of crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dislocation-density-based crystal plasticity (CP) models are introduced to account for the microstructural changes throughout the deformation process, enabling more quantitative predictions of the deformation process compared to slip-system resistance-based plasticity models. In this work, we present a stability analysis of slip rate-driven processes for some established dislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model and its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation density model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of such systems. We point out the existence of saturation dislocation densities and the role played by the initial dislocation density which significantly influences material hardening or softening responses. Since the initial micro-structure, modeled through the dislocation density, could be related to the size or the sample preparation process, implicit size-dependent effects can also be conjectured.
  To further explore these phenomena, we conduct numerical simulations of pillar compression using an Eulerian crystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based CP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale materials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical devices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetic (AM) states have compensated collinear magnetic configurations that are invariant under a combination of real-space rotation and time reversal. While these symmetries forbid a direct bilinear coupling of the AM order parameter with a magnetic field, they generally enable piezomagnetism, manifested as a trilinear coupling with magnetic field and strain. Here, we show that, because of this coupling, in an altermagnet subjected to random strain, the magnetic field triggers an effective random field conjugate to the AM order parameter, providing a rare realization of a tunable random-field Ising model. Specifically, we find two competing effects promoted by an external magnetic field: an increasing random-field disorder, which suppresses long-range AM order, and an enhanced coupling to elastic fluctuations, which favors AM order. By solving the corresponding random-field transverse-field Ising model via a mean-field approach, we obtain the temperature-magnetic field phase diagram of an inhomogeneous AM state for different strengths of random-strain disorder, unveiling the emergence of a field-induced reentrant AM phase. We also discuss the fingerprints of this rich behavior on several experimentally-accessible quantities, such as the shear modulus, the elasto-caloric effect coefficient, and the AM order parameter. Our results reveal an unusual but experimentally-feasible path to tune AM order with uniform magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Surface hopping simulations show valley depolarization driven by exciton-phonon resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonances between excitonic transitions and nuclear coordinates have been shown to drive a variety of excited-state dynamical phenomena in molecular systems. Here, we report mixed quantum--classical simulations showing similar resonances to primarily contribute to valley depolarization in monolayer MoS$_2$. The applied simulation framework combines reciprocal-space surface hopping with microscopic models of the quasiparticle band structure, electron--hole interactions, and carrier--phonon interactions, parametrized against ab initio calculations. This enables low-cost excited-state dynamics simulations that are microscopic, non-Markovian, and non-perturbative in the carrier--phonon interaction. The framework furthermore retains explicit information on transient phonon occupancies, through which we show a resonance between the dominant optical phonon branch and the lowest exciton band to largely drive valley depolarization, by activating a Maialle--Silva--Sham mechanism. Resulting valley polarization times are consistent with experimental measurements across temperatures.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Chiral Superconductivity via Impurity Bound States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the symmetry of Cooper pairs remains a central challenge in the study of unconventional superconductors, particularly for chiral states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate that point-like impurities in chiral superconductors generate in-gap bound states with a distinctive asymmetry: the local density of states at the impurity site vanishes at one bound-state energy, but not at its particle-hole conjugate. We prove this behavior analytically in generic two-dimensional, single-band chiral superconductors, showing it arises from a fundamental interplay between pairing chirality and crystalline rotation symmetry. Our numerical simulations confirm that this diagnostic feature persists in multiband systems and for spatially extended impurities. Our results establish a symmetry-enforced real-space diagnostic for chiral superconductivity at the atomic scale.</description>
