      <title>Weighted fractional Hardy inequalities with singularity on any flat submanifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the work of Dyda and Kijaczko by establishing the corresponding weighted fractional Hardy inequalities with singularities on any flat submanifolds. While they derived weighted fractional Hardy inequalities with singularities at a point and on a half-space, we generalize these results to handle singularities on any flat submanifold of codimension $k$, where $1&lt;k&lt;d$. Furthermore, we also address the critical case $sp=k+\alpha+ \beta$ and establish weighted fractional Hardy inequality with appropriate logarithmic weight function.</description>

      <title>An elliptic equation with power nonlinearity and degenerate coercivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the existence and regularity of solutions to the following Dirichlet problem: $$\begin{equation} \begin{cases} -\textrm{div}\left(\frac{Du}{(1+|u|)^{\theta}}\right)= -\textrm{div}\left(u^{\gamma}E(x)\right)+f(x) \qquad &amp; \mbox{in } \Omega,\\ u (x) = 0 &amp; \mbox{on } \partial \Omega, \end{cases} \end{equation}$$ where $\theta,\gamma&gt;0$. An interesting feature of this problem is the interplay between the two nonlinearities, the degeneracy and the power nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Limits of non-local approximations to the Eikonal equation on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a non-local approximation of the time-dependent Eikonal equation defined on a Riemannian manifold. We show that the local and the non-local problems are well-posed in the sense of viscosity solutions and we prove regularity properties of these solutions in time and space. If the kernel is properly scaled, we then derive error bounds between the solution to the non-local problem and the one to the local problem, both in continuous-time and Forward Euler discretization. Finally, we apply these results to a sequence of random weighted graphs with n vertices. In particular, we establish that the solution to the problem on graphs converges almost surely uniformly to the viscosity solution of the local problem as the kernel scale parameter decreases at an appropriate rate when the number of vertices grows and the time step vanishes.</description>

      <title>Blow-up dynamics for radial self-dual Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger equation with prescribed asymptotic profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct finite energy blow-up solutions for the radial self-dual Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger equation with a continuum of blow-up rates. Our result stands in stark contrast to the rigidity of blow-up of $H^{3}$ solutions proved by the first author for equivariant index $m \geq 1$, where the soliton-radiation interaction is too weak to admit the present blow-up scenarios. It is optimal (up to an endpoint) in terms of the range of blow-up rates and the regularity of the asymptotic profiles in view of the authors' previous proof of $H^{1}$ soliton resolution for the self-dual Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger equation in any equivariance class.
  Our approach is a backward construction combined with modulation analysis, starting from prescribed asymptotic profiles and deriving the corresponding blow-up rates from their strong interaction with the soliton. In particular, our work may be seen as an adaptation of the method of Jendrej-Lawrie-Rodriguez (developed for energy critical equivariant wave maps) to the Schr\"odinger case.</description>

      <title>Global existence for wave equations with scale-invariant time-dependent damping and time derivative nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the Cauchy problem for wave equations with scale-invariant time-dependent damping and nonlinear time-derivative terms, modeled as $$\partial_{t}^2u- \Delta u +\frac{\mu}{1+t}\partial_tu= f(\partial_tu), \quad x\in \mathbb{R}^n, t&gt;0,$$ where $f(\partial_tu)=|\partial_tu|^p $ or $|\partial_tu|^{p-1}\partial_tu$ with $p&gt;1$ and $\mu&gt;0$. We prove global existence of small data solutions in low dimensions $1\leq n\leq 3$ by using energy estimates in appropriate Sobolev spaces. Our primary contribution is an existence result for $p&gt;1+\frac2{\mu}$, in the one-dimensional case, when $\mu \le 2$, which in conjunction with prior blow-up results from \cite{Our2}, establish that the critical exponent for small data solutions in one dimension is $p_G(1,\mu)=1+\frac2{\mu}$, when $\mu \le 2$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first identification of the critical exponent range for the time-dependent damped wave equations with scale-invariant and time-derivative nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>An Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation for compressible Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation for the compressible isentropic Euler equations with a general pressure law. Using the developed Lagrangian formulation, we show a short-time solution which is unique in the framework of Bessel space $H_{p}^{\beta}(\mathbb{T}^{d})$ for $\beta&gt;\frac{d}{p}+1$.
  The proof is precise, relatively simple, and the result can be stated economically. It relies on the application of the Implicit Function Theorem on Banach spaces. To our knowledge, this is the first time the Lagrangian formulation has been employed to show local wellposedness for compressible Euler equations. Moreover, it can be adaptable to $C^{k,\alpha}$ spaces, Sobolev spaces, and notably, Besov spaces.</description>

      <title>Local existence and conditional regularity for the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system driven by inhomogeneous boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with general inhomogeneous Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions. We propose a new approach to the local well-posedness problem based on conditional regularity estimates. By conditional regularity we mean that any strong solution belonging to a suitable class remains regular as long as its amplitude remains bounded. The result holds for general Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions provided the material derivative of the velocity field vanishes on the boundary of the physical domain. As a corollary of this result we obtain:
  Blow up criteria for strong solutions,
  Local existence of strong solutions in the optimal L^p-L^q framework,
  Alternative proof of the existing results on local well posedness.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic properties of discretely self-similar Navier-Stokes solutions with rough data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the extent to which discretely self-similar (DSS) solutions to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations with rough data almost have the same asymptotics as DSS flows with smoother data. In a previous work, we established algebraic spatial decay rates for data in $L^q_{loc}(\mathbb{R}^3\setminus\{0\})$ for $q\in (3,\infty]$. The optimal rate occurs when $q=\infty$ and rates degrade as $q$ decreases. In this paper, we show that these solutions can be further decomposed into a term satisfying the optimal $q=\infty$ decay rate -- i.e.~have asymptotics like $(|x|+\sqrt t)^{-1}$ -- and a term with the $q&lt;\infty$ decay rate multiplied by a prefactor which can be taken to be arbitrarily small. This smallness property is new and implies the $q&lt;\infty$ asymptotics should be understood in a little-o sense. The decay rates in our previous work broke down when $q=3$, in which case spatial asymptotics have not been explored. The second result of this paper shows that DSS solutions with data in $L^3_{loc}(\mathbb{R}^3\setminus\{0\})$ can be expanded into a term satisfying the $(|x|+\sqrt t)^{-1}$ decay rate and a term that can be taken to be arbitrarily small in a scaling invariant class. A Besov space version of this result is also included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the course of the last decade, there has been a significant level of interest in the analysis of Keller-Segel models incorporating tensorial flux. Despite this interest, the question of whether finite-time blowup solutions exist remains a topic of ongoing research. Our study provides evidence that solutions of this nature are indeed possible in dimensions $n\geq3,$ when utilizing a tensorial flux expressed in the form of $A\nabla v$, where $A$ denotes a matrix with constant components</description>

      <title>Space-Time Statistical Solutions of the Incompressible Euler Equations and Landau-Lifshitz Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rigorously the infinite Reynolds limit of the solutions of the Landau-Lifschitz equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics for an incompressible fluid on a $d$-dimensional torus for $d\geq 2.$ These equations, which model the effects of thermal fluctuations in fluids, are given a standard physical interpretation as a low-wavenumber ``effective field theory'', rather than as stochastic partial differential equations. We study in particular solutions which enjoy some a priori Besov regularity in space, as expected for initial data chosen from a driven, turbulent steady-state ensemble. The empirical basis for this regularity hypothesis, uniform in Reynolds number, is carefully discussed, including evidence from numerical simulations of turbulent flows that incorporate thermal fluctuations. Considering the initial-value problem for the Landau-Lifschitz equations, our main result is that the infinite Reynolds number limit is a space-time statistical solution of the incompressible Euler equations in the sense of Vishik \&amp; Fursikov. Such solutions are described by a probability measure on space-time velocity fields whose realizations are weak or distributional solutions of the incompressible Euler equations, each with the same prescribed initial data. In conjunction with recent numerical evidence that these probability measures are non-trivial, our theorem shows that the mathematical non-uniqueness of the solutions of the Cauchy problem for Euler, as revealed by convex integration studies, may be physically realized. In support of the theory of spontaneous stochasticity, any persistent randomness in the infinite-Reynolds limit is associated to a nontrivial probability distribution over non-unique solutions of the ideal Euler equations.</description>

      <title>Analysis of any order Runge-Kutta Spectral Volume Schemes for 1D Hyperbolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze any-order Runge-Kutta spectral volume schemes (RKSV(s,k)) for solving the one-dimensional scalar hyperbolic equation. The RKSV(s,k) was constructed by using the $s$-th explicit Runge-Kutta method in time-discretization which has {\it strong-stability-preserving} (SSP) property, and by letting a piecewise $k-$th degree($k\geq 1 $ is an arbitrary integer) polynomial satisfy the local conservation law in each control volume designed by subdividing the underlying mesh with $k$ Gauss-Legendre points (LSV) or right-Radau points (RRSV).For the RKSV(s,k), we would like to establish a general framework which use the matrix transferring process technique for analyzing the stability and the convergence property. The framework for stability is evolved based on the energy equation, while the framework for error estimate is evolved based on the error equation. And the evolution process is represented by matrices.After the evolution is completed, three key indicative pieces of information are obtained: the termination factor $\zeta$, the indicator factor $\rho$, and the final evolved matrix. We prove that for the RKSV(s,k), the {\it stability } holds and the $L_2$ norm error estimate is $\mathcal{O}(h^{k+1}+\tau^s)$, provided that the CFL condition is satisfied. Our theoretical findings have been justified by several numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00988v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the stability of an abstract thermoelastic system with Cattaneo's law, which describes finite heat propagation speed in a medium. We introduce a region of parameters containing coupling, thermal dissipation, and possible inertial characteristics. The region is partitioned into distinct subregions based on the spectral properties of the generator of the corresponding semigroup. By a careful estimation of the resolvent operator on the imaginary axis, we obtain distinct polynomial decay rates for systems with parameters located in different subregions. Furthermore, the optimality of these decay rates is proved. Finally, we apply our results to several coupled systems of partial differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For general second order evolution equations, we prove an optimal condition on the degree of unboundedness of the damping, that rules out finite-time extinction. We show that control estimates give energy decay rates that explicitly depend on the degree of unboundedness, and establish a dilation method to turn existing control estimates for one propagator into those for another in the functional calculus. As corollaries, we prove Schr\"odinger observability gives decay for unbounded damping, weak monotonicity in damping, and quantitative unique continuation and optimal propagation for fractional Laplacians. As applications, we establish a variety of novel and explicit energy decay results to systems with unbounded damping, including singular damping, linearised gravity water waves and Euler--Bernoulli plates.</description>

      <title>Liouville theorems for conformally invariant fully nonlinear equations. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental theorem of Liouville asserts that positive entire harmonic functions in Euclidean spaces must be constant. A remarkable Liouville-type theorem of Caffarelli-Gidas-Spruck states that positive entire solutions of $-\Delta u=u^{ {(n+2)}/{(n-2)} }$, $n\ge 3$, are unique modulo M\"obius transformations. Far-reaching extensions were established for general fully nonlinear conformally invariant equations through the works of Chang-Gursky-Yang, Li-Li, Li, and Viaclovsky. In this paper, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the validity of such Liouville-type theorems. This leads to necessary and sufficient conditions for local gradient estimates of solutions to hold, assuming a one-sided bound on the solutions, for a wide class of fully nonlinear elliptic equations involving Schouten tensors. A pivotal advancement in proving these Liouville-type theorems is our enhanced understanding of solutions to such equations near isolated singularities. In particular, we utilize earlier results of Caffarelli-Li-Nirenberg on lower- and upper-conical singularities. For general conformally invariant fully nonlinear elliptic equations, we prove that a viscosity super- (sub-)solution can be extended across an isolated singularity if and only if it is a lower- (upper-)conical singularity. We also provide necessary and sufficient conditions for lower- (upper-)conical behavior of a function near isolated singularities in terms of its conformal Hessian.
  As an application of our Liouville theorems and local gradient estimates, we establish new existence and compactness results for conformal metrics on a closed Riemannian manifold with prescribed symmetric functions of the Schouten (Ricci) tensor, allowing the scalar curvature of the conformal metrics to have varying signs.</description>

Abstract: We consider solutions to $$ - \Delta_{p} u = f(x) \quad \text{in } \Omega\, ,$$ when $p$ approaches the semilinear limiting case $p=2$ and we get third order estimates. As a consequence we deduce improved regularity properties of the stress field.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and linearization for a semilinear wave equation with spatially growing nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the initial value problem for a defocusing semi-linear wave equation with spatially growing nonlinearity. Our analysis leads to global well-posedness in the energy space. Furthermore, we obtain the linearization of energy-bounded solutions using the methodology outlined in [8]. The proof hinges on Moser-Trudinger type inequalities and Strichartz estimates.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the quintic wave equation with nonlocal weak damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a new scheme for studying the dynamics of a quintic wave equation with nonlocal weak damping in a 3D smooth bounded domain. As an application, the existence and structure of weak, strong, and exponential attractors for the solution semigroup of this equation are obtained. The investigation sheds light on the well-posedness and long-time behavior of nonlinear dissipative evolution equations with nonlinear damping and critical nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-driven flows in a non-linear stratified fluid layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-driven flow is a boundary layer flow arising from the interplay of gravity and diffusion in density-stratified fluids when a gravitational field is non-parallel to an impermeable solid boundary. This study investigates diffusion-driven flow within a nonlinearly density-stratified fluid confined between two tilted parallel walls. We introduce an asymptotic expansion inspired by the center manifold theory, where quantities are expanded in terms of derivatives of the cross-sectional averaged stratified scalar (such as salinity or temperature). This technique provides accurate approximations for velocity, density, and pressure fields. Furthermore, we derive an evolution equation describing the cross-sectional averaged stratified scalar. This equation takes the form of the traditional diffusion equation but replaces the constant diffusion coefficient with a positive-definite function dependent on the solution's derivative. Numerical simulations validate the accuracy of our approximations. Our investigation of the effective equation reveals that the density profile depends on a non-dimensional parameter denoted as $\gamma$ representing the flow strength. In the large $\gamma$ limit, the system is approximated by a diffusion process with an augmented diffusion coefficient of $1+\cot^{2}\theta$, where $\theta$ signifies the inclination angle of the channel domain. This parameter regime is where diffusion-driven flow exhibits its strongest mixing ability. Conversely, in the small $\gamma$ regime, the density field behaves like pure diffusion with distorted isopycnals. Lastly, we show that the classical thin film equation aligns with the results obtained using the proposed expansion in the small $\gamma$ regime but fails to accurately describe the dynamics of the density field for large $\gamma$.</description>
