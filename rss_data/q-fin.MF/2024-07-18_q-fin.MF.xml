      <title>A Mean Field Game approach for pollution regulation of competitive firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a model based on mean-field games of competitive firms producing similar goods according to a standard AK model with a depreciation rate of capital generating pollution as a byproduct. Our analysis focuses on the widely-used cap-and-trade pollution regulation. Under this regulation, firms have the flexibility to respond by implementing pollution abatement, reducing output, and participating in emission trading, while a regulator dynamically allocates emission allowances to each firm. The resulting mean-field game is of linear quadratic type and equivalent to a mean-field type control problem, i.e., it is a potential game. We find explicit solutions to this problem through the solutions to differential equations of Riccati type. Further, we investigate the carbon emission equilibrium price that satisfies the market clearing condition and find a specific form of FBSDE of McKean-Vlasov type with common noise. The solution to this equation provides an approximate equilibrium price. Additionally, we demonstrate that the degree of competition is vital in determining the economic consequences of pollution regulation.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Hedging with Iterated Integrals and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the Wiener-Ito chaos decomposition to the class of continuous semimartingales that are exponentially integrable, which includes in particular affine and some polynomial diffusion processes. By omitting the orthogonality in the expansion, we are able to show that every $p$-integrable functional of the semimartingale, for $p \in [1,\infty)$, can be represented as a sum of iterated integrals thereof. Using finitely many terms of this expansion and (possibly random) neural networks for the integrands, whose parameters are learned in a machine learning setting, we show that every financial derivative can be approximated arbitrarily well in the $L^p$-sense. In particular, for $p = 2$, we recover the optimal hedging strategy in the sense of quadratic hedging. Moreover, since the hedging strategy of the approximating option can be computed in closed form, we obtain an efficient algorithm to approximately replicate any sufficiently integrable financial derivative within short runtime.</description>
