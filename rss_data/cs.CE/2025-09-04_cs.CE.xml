      <title>Fast Evaluation of Derivatives of Green's Functions Using Recurrences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order derivatives of Green's functions are a key ingredient in Taylor-based fast multipole methods, Barnes-Hut $n$-body algorithms, and quadrature by expansion (QBX). In these settings, derivatives underpin either the formation, evaluation, and/or translation of Taylor expansions.
  In this article, we provide hybrid symbolic-numerical procedures that generate recurrences to attain an $O(n)$ cost for the the computation of $n$ derivatives (i.e. $O(1)$ per derivative) for arbitrary radially symmetric Green's functions. These procedures are general--only requiring knowledge of the PDE that the Green's function solves. We show that the algorithm has controlled, theoretically-understood error.
  We apply these methods to the method of quadrature by expansion, a method for the evaluation of singular layer potentials, which requires higher-order derivatives of Green's functions. In doing so, we contribute a new rotation-based method for target-specific QBX evaluation in the Cartesian setting that attains dramatically lower cost than existing symbolic approaches.
  Numerical experiments support our claims of accuracy and cost.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Energy-Based Hysteresis Model for Pulsed-Operated Fast-Ramping Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the strongly nonlinear behavior of ferromagnetic yokes, the numerical analysis of fast-ramping magnets is highly cumbersome and, therefore, in practice overly simplified by means of anhysteretic material descriptions and a posteriori loss formulae. This paper establishes the use of a dynamic ferromagnetic model combining a preconditioned energy-based hysteresis description and a thin-sheet eddy-current model in time-domain. The model was successfully employed in the analysis of a normal-conducting bending magnet in order to precisely calculate losses and fields.</description>

      <title>COBRA: Multimodal Sensing Deep Learning Framework for Remote Chronic Obesity Management via Wrist-Worn Activity Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic obesity management requires continuous monitoring of energy balance behaviors, yet traditional self-reported methods suffer from significant underreporting and recall bias, and difficulty in integration with modern digital health systems. This study presents COBRA (Chronic Obesity Behavioral Recognition Architecture), a novel deep learning framework for objective behavioral monitoring using wrist-worn multimodal sensors. COBRA integrates a hybrid D-Net architecture combining U-Net spatial modeling, multi-head self-attention mechanisms, and BiLSTM temporal processing to classify daily activities into four obesity-relevant categories: Food Intake, Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Daily Living. Validated on the WISDM-Smart dataset with 51 subjects performing 18 activities, COBRA's optimal preprocessing strategy combines spectral-temporal feature extraction, achieving high performance across multiple architectures. D-Net demonstrates 96.86% overall accuracy with category-specific F1-scores of 98.55% (Physical Activity), 95.53% (Food Intake), 94.63% (Sedentary Behavior), and 98.68% (Daily Living), outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 1.18% in accuracy. The framework shows robust generalizability with low demographic variance (&lt;3%), enabling scalable deployment for personalized obesity interventions and continuous lifestyle monitoring.</description>

      <title>Accurate and scalable deep Maxwell solvers using multilevel iterative methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have promise as surrogate partial differential equation (PDE) solvers, but it remains a challenge to use these concepts to solve problems with high accuracy and scalability. In this work, we show that neural network surrogates can combine with iterative algorithms to accurately solve PDE problems featuring different scales, resolutions, and boundary conditions. We develop a subdomain neural operator model that supports arbitrary Robin-type boundary condition inputs, and we show that it can be utilized as a flexible preconditioner to iteratively solve subdomain problems with bounded accuracy. We further show that our subdomain models can facilitate the construction of global coarse spaces to enable accelerated, large scale PDE problem solving based on iterative multilevel domain decomposition. With two-dimensional Maxwell's equations as a model system, we train a single network to simulate large scale problems with different sizes, resolutions, wavelengths, and dielectric media distribution. We further demonstrate the utility of our platform in performing the accurate inverse design of multi-wavelength nanophotonic devices. Our work presents a promising path to building accurate and scalable multi-physics surrogate solvers for large practical problems.</description>

      <title>A Linear Time Quantum Algorithm for Pairwise Sequence Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequence Alignment is the process of aligning biological sequences in order to identify similarities between multiple sequences. In this paper, a Quantum Algorithm for finding the optimal alignment between DNA sequences has been demonstrated which works by mapping the sequence alignment problem into a path-searching problem through a 2D graph. The transition, which converges to a fixed path on the graph, is based on a proposed oracle for profit calculation. By implementing Grover's search algorithm, our proposed approach is able to align a pair of sequences and figure out the optimal alignment within linear time, which hasn't been attained by any classical deterministic algorithm. In addition to that, the proposed algorithm is capable of quadratic speeding up to any unstructured search problem by finding out the optimal paths accurately in a deterministic manner, in contrast to existing randomized algorithms that frequently sort out the sub-optimal alignments, therefore, don't always guarantee of finding out the optimal solutions.</description>
