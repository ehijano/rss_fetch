      <title>A Stable Measure of Chaos in Dynamical Systems Using Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world dynamics exhibit chaos, a phenomenon in which neighboring trajectories in the state space of a dynamical system diverge exponentially over time. A common measure used for measuring the degree of this divergence is the Lyapunov exponent, which relies on pairwise Euclidean distances between the trajectories at each time. The main limitation of the Lyapunov exponent is its sensitivity to small perturbations in input data. Since many real-world dynamics are likely to contain some degree of inherent noise, we are motivated to construct a chaos measure that is robust to small trajectory perturbations. Persistent homology has been used for proving theoretical stability guarantees under such added noise in the data. As such, we introduce a novel, persistent homology based measure of chaos termed the persistence exponent and prove its theoretical stability. We also prove the existence of an upper bound on our measure, and show its greater experimental stability on the Lorenz and Rossler systems describing fluid convection and taffy pulling. We present an algorithm for computing the persistence exponent given a single time series with N points from a dynamical system that runs in O(N^2 log N) time. We finally show the greater experimental stability of the persistence exponent on time series data depicting a Belousov Zhabotinsky chemical reaction, which transitions from periodicity to chaos and back as the system evolves in time.</description>

      <title>Topological CoHochschild Homology and Thom Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an $\E$-ring spectrum $R$ and a map $f:X\to Pic(R)$ of spaces, the Thom spectrum $\T f$ is a comodule over $R\otimes\Si X$. In this parper we study the topological coHochschild homology of $R\otimes\Si X$ with coefficient $\T f$. More concretely, for a simply connected space $X$, we will give a filtration on $\mathrm{coTHH}^R(\T f;R\otimes\Si X)$ via the cellular structure of $X$. Furthermore, we will reduce the computation of $\mathrm{coTHH}^R(\T f;R\otimes\Si X)$ to that of $\mathrm{coTHH}^R(R\otimes\Si G)$ for some group-like $\mathbb{E}_1$-spaces. Finally, we will use these results to study properties of $\mathrm{coTHH}(\T f;R\otimes\Si X)$.</description>

      <title>New Applications and Computations of the Lefschetz Number of Homeomorphisms and Open Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the combinatorial Lefschetz number is a topological invariant. This is an important result in itself; in order to point it out, we will also work here several relevant consequences in different directions. The first of them is a significant simplification of the computations involved in obtaining the Lefschetz number of certain maps, as well as some new Lefschetz fixed-point theorems for unbounded spaces. Indeed, these ideas allow us to obtain a clear lower bound for the Nielsen number of a triad in some spaces, such as, for example, the connected sum of two p-tori (p greater than 2). Another consequence, in the case of homeomorphisms, is that, in the classical axiomatic definition of the Lefschetz number, the wedge-of-circles axiom and the cofibration axiom can be replaced by the single axiom of topological invariance of the combinatorial Lefschetz number. Using the invariance of the combinatorial Lefschetz number we also generalize O'Neill's classical result about topological invariance of the fixed-point index and we prove a topological-invariance result for the relative Lefschetz number. We also generalize the combinatorial Lefschetz number from homeomorphisms to open maps and we obtain a new fixed-point theorem.</description>

      <title>SuPerPoV: Score and evolution of the stratospheric polar vortex via persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifying the stratospheric polar vortex provides predictability for surface weather on extended-range timescales definitions of these events proposed in over 60 years of study depend on empirically chosen parameters and yield different results when one of them changes. Moreover, as previous definitions are based on static thresholds, it is not straightforward to use them to study the spatiotemporal evolution of the vortexe introduce SuPerPoV, a score system that computes displacement and split ratiossing tools from applied topology. The computation is entirely threshold-free, open source, and does not require familiarity with applied topology. The scores generally recovers previous definitions and are output for a user-defined number of days, thus showing the evolution of the event. SuPerPoV offers a paradigm shift in the study of the polar vortex, hopefully bringing a deeper understanding of the polar vortex and related extreme events, such as sudden stratospheric warmings.</description>

      <title>Quasi-unitial Inner Kan Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that semi-simplicial spaces that i) admit inner horn fillers up to homotopy and ii) possess units in a weak sense provide a viable model for $\infty$-categories. The existence of units can be expressed through various quasi-unitality conditions, and we compare the natural generalization of three such conditions found in the literature. This work is motivated by applications in Floer homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>Algebraic K-theory of Geometric Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3349</link>
      <description>arXiv:1305.3349v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a homotopy theoretic technique for proving that the $K$-theoretic assembly map is an equivalence. It is an extension of the methods used to prove split injectivity of the assembly and applies to any geometrically finite group. Our result is that there are two requirements which need to hold. The first is that the assembly map for the group regarded as a metric space is an equivalence. This is a non-equivariant condition and depends only on the coarse type of the word metric on the group. The second is that the group ring satisfies an algebraic coherence condition, which currently can be verified for all known groups for which the split injectivity statement for the assembly holds. The two conditions extend very broadly. In particular, both conditions hold for groups of finite asymptotic dimension.
  To state the main theorem precisely, given a regular Noetherian ring $A$ of finite global dimension and a group $\Gamma$ with finite $K(\Gamma,1)$ and finite asymptotic dimension, we prove that the $K$-theoretic assembly map is an equivalence. Therefore, in all dimensions the $K$-theory of $A[\Gamma]$ is the group homology of $\Gamma$ with coefficients in the $K$-theory spectrum of $A$. One of the many geometric consequences of this theorem is vanishing of the Whitehead group of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a topological Azumaya algebra of degree $mn$ with an orthogonal involution over a CW complex $X$ of dimension less than or equal to $\min\{m,n\}$. We give conditions for the positive integers $m$ and $n$ so that $\mathcal{A}$ can be decomposed as the tensor product of topological Azumaya algebras of degrees $m$ and $n$ with orthogonal involutions.</description>

      <title>Variations on cohomology rings and zero schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the theorem of Hausel and the author from arXiv:2212.11836 that relates equivariant cohomology rings and algebras of functions on zero schemes. This paper combines three separate results. We prove that for a reductive group G acting on a smooth projective variety one can see the equivariant cohomology ring as the ring of functions on the zero scheme over the Kostant section, provided that some transversality condition is satisfied. In particular, we show that the conclusion holds for spherical varieties. We then show a version for singular varieties, e.g. discriminant varieties, where in general we only recover a part of equivariant cohomology ring, generated by Chern classes. We also show that an analogous result, connecting equivariant K-theory to the ring of functions on the fixed-point scheme, holds for GKM spaces.
  This is a concise version of some results from the PhD thesis arXiv:2407.14659, which contains a broader introduction to the topic.</description>
