      <title>Properties of $\mathrm{H_2O}$ masers and their associated sources in Sagittarius B2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations of the 22 GHz $\mathrm{H_2O}$ maser line in the extended Sagittarius B2 cloud. We detect 499 $\mathrm{H_2O}$ masers across the observed velocities between -39 and 172 km s$^{-1}$. To investigate the nature of the masers, we analyze their spatial distribution and cross-match with catalogs of HII regions and protostellar cores. 62% of masers are associated with protostellar cores and 32% with HII regions. The nature of the remaining 6% of sources was not established, but is likely associated with protostellar cores. Based on the spatial extent of the groups of masers, we classify them as either outflow-associated or young stellar object (YSO)-associated. We identify 144 unique sites of maser emission: 23 are associated with HII regions and 94 with protostellar cores, of which 33 are associated with protostellar outflows and 18 with YSOs.
  The outflow-associated $\mathrm{H_2O}$ maser emission is confined to within $&lt;2000$ au of the central continuum source, despite shocked SiO emission extending over tens of thousands of au. The YSO-associated masers show a lack of detections at $5 &lt; V_{rel} &lt; 30$ km s$^{-1}$, which we suggest may be due to maser self-absorption. We show how $\mathrm{H_2O}$ masers trace the large-scale material flow in Sgr B2 N (North) also seen in SiO and mm continuum emission. Finally, we find that protostellar cores with associated $\mathrm{H_2O}$ masers tend to have brighter 3 mm continuum emission on average, although there is no strong correlation between maser brightness and continuum flux.</description>

      <title>Bar-driven dispersal of Galactic substructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic archaeologists often assume that integrals of motion (IoMs) such as $L_z$ and $E$ are conserved, so substructure remains frozen in IoM space over many Gyr. However, this is not true in the Milky Way due in part to its rotating bar. In this study we quantify the effects of the bar on the dynamics of substructure. We employ three different theoretical models: an analytical toy model; a set of test particle simulations with steady and slowing bars; and a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy. Each model predicts that the bar increases the angular momentum and energy spread of low-energy substructures by a factor of $\sim10-100$, so they cannot remain tightly clustered. We derive a criterion for determining when this effect is important. The most affected orbits are low energy ($E\lesssim E_\odot$, $r_\mathrm{apo}&lt;40$ kpc), prograde, eccentric, or low inclination. This includes $\sim3/4$ of Galactic globular clusters and $\sim1/4$ of known stellar streams. We predict the presence of abundant bar-dispersed substructure. The structures remain much more tightly clustered in the space of metallicity and Jacobi integral $H_\mathrm{J}=E-\Omega_\mathrm{b}L_z$. We therefore propose using $H_\mathrm{J}$ and chemistry instead of traditional IoMs when searching for inner halo substructure. In $(L_z,E)$ space the dispersal of the structures is along a principal direction with gradient $\mathrm{d}E/\mathrm{d}L_z$ equal to the bar's pattern speed $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$. Bar-dispersed substructure should therefore allow the past evolution of $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$ to be constrained.</description>

      <title>Tiny galaxies and dark substructures: exploring the "dark" subhaloes in TNG50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter haloes and subhaloes that host no luminous counterpart are predicted within our current understanding of galaxy formation within a $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Observational tests, such as gravitational lensing, have made potential detections of such objects around individual galaxies as well as in galaxy groups and clusters. The question of whether or not a dim counterpart might reside in these objects remains an open question. We investigate this point using the TNG50-1 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project. Under the assumption of TNG50's galaxy formation model, we do not find haloes or subhaloes above a total mass of $\rm 10^{9.7} \ M_{\odot}$ that are entirely dark. However, under realistic effective surface brightness cuts of $\rm \leq 29 \ mag \ arcsec^{-2}$, the inference of the most massive dark subhalo in galaxy groups and clusters becomes $\rm M_{DM} \gtrsim 2 \times 10^{10} \ M_{\odot}$. Concentrating on galaxy groups and clusters, we find that dark subhaloes are ubiquitous with more massive dark subhaloes tending to preferentially reside further from the centers of clusters. We find that subhaloes in the mass range of $\rm 4.5 \times 10^{7} \leq M_{DM}/M_{\odot} \leq 2.1\times 10^{8}$ tend to be the most likely to reside in the strong lensing regions of galaxy groups and clusters, and argue that future dark subhalo searches should investigate this mass range.</description>

      <title>The hot circumgalactic medium in stacked X-rays: observations vs simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current cosmological simulations rely on active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback to quench star formation and match observed stellar mass distributions, but models for AGN feedback are poorly constrained. The circumgalactic medium (CGM) provides a helpful laboratory to study this process, as its metallicity, temperature, and density distributions are directly impacted by AGN. Recent observations from the eROSITA instrument provide constraints on these distributions through measurements of extended soft X-ray emission. Here, we generate synthetic eROSITA observations from the EAGLE and SIMBA cosmological simulations, comparing them against observations of galaxies stacked by stellar mass, halo mass, and star-formation rate. SIMBA outperforms EAGLE in matching observed surface brightness profiles in general, but neither simulation consistently agrees with observations across the full range of galaxy properties we studied. We find that variations in CGM X-ray emission between simulations are driven by density differences at $R \lesssim 0.2 R_{200c} $, and temperature and metallicity changes at larger radii. We directly model predicted contributions from X-ray binaries (XRBs), finding that the hot plasma contributes $\approx$ 20 times more to the CGM X-ray luminosity than XRBs, except at $M_*&lt;10^{11} M_\odot$, where the contamination from XRBs becomes more significant.</description>

      <title>Constraining resolved extragalactic $R_{21}$ variation with well calibrated ALMA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) are commonly used as bulk molecular gas tracers. The CO line ratios (especially CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) - $R_{21}$) vary within and among galaxies, yet previous studies on $R_{21}$ and alike often rely on measurements constructed by combining data from facilities with substantial relative calibration uncertainties that have the same order as physical line ratio variations. Hence robustly determining systematic $R_{21}$ variations is challenging. Here, we compare CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) mapping data from ALMA for 14 nearby galaxies, at a common physical resolution of 1.7 kpc. Our dataset includes new ALMA (7m+TP) CO(1-0) maps of 12 galaxies. We investigate $R_{21}$ variation to understand its dependence on global galaxy properties, kpc-scale environmental factors, and its correlation with star formation rate (SFR) surface density and metallicity. We find that the galaxy-to-galaxy scatter is 0.05 dex. This is lower than previous studies which reported over 0.1 dex variation, likely reflecting significant flux calibration uncertainties in single-dish surveys. Within individual galaxies, $R_{21}$ has a typical mean value of ~0.64 and 0.1 dex variation, with an increase to ~0.75 towards galactic centers. We find strong correlations between $R_{21}$ and various galactic parameters, particularly SFR surface density, which shows a power-law slope of 0.10-0.11 depending on the adopted binning/fitting methods. Our findings suggest that, for studies covering main sequence galaxy samples, assuming a fixed $R_{21}$=0.64 does not significantly bias kpc-scale molecular gas mass estimates from CO(2-1). Instead, systematic uncertainties from flux calibration and the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor account for more systematic scatter of CO-derived molecular gas properties.</description>

      <title>Mergers of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of our Universe is strongly influenced by the attractive force of gravity. A key aspect of this evolution, therefore, is the merging of galaxies. Here, we explore the role of mergers in shaping the properties of massive galaxies over cosmic time. Observational methods of finding mergers include identifying galaxy pairs in close proximity, visual inspection of galaxy images to identify signatures of mergers (e.g. tidal features) and using morphological parameters such as Asymmetry and the Gini coefficient. The fraction of merging galaxies increases with redshift, potentially out to z~6. The principal impact of merging is to transform the morphological mix of massive galaxies, from largely rotationally-supported systems at high redshift to more dispersion-dominated systems in the nearby Universe. Mergers also drive gas towards the central regions of the remnant, fuelling starbursts and feeding supermassive black holes. However, only around a third of the stellar and black hole mass at the present day is directly attributable to merging.</description>

      <title>Beyond Traditional Diagnostics: Identifying Active Galactic Nuclei with Spectral Energy Distribution Fitting in DESI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are typically identified through their distinctive X-ray or radio emissions, mid-infrared (MIR) colors, or emission lines. However, each method captures different subsets of AGN due to signal-to-noise (SNR) limitations, redshift coverage, and extinction effects, underscoring the necessity for a multi-wavelength approach for comprehensive AGN samples. This study explores the effectiveness of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting as a robust method for AGN identification.
  Using {\tt CIGALE} optical-MIR SED fits on DESI Early Data Release galaxies, we compare SED-based AGN selection ({\tt AGNFRAC} $\geq0.1$) with traditional methods including BPT diagrams, WISE colors, X-ray, and radio diagnostics.
  SED fitting identifies $\sim 70\%$ of narrow/broad-line AGN and 87\% of WISE-selected AGN. Incorporating high SNR WISE photometry reduces star-forming galaxy contamination from 62\% to 15\%. Initially, $\sim50\%$ of SED-AGN candidates are undetected by standard methods, but additional diagnostics classify $\sim85\%$ of these sources, revealing LINERs and retired galaxies potentially representing evolved systems with weak AGN activity. Further spectroscopic and multi-wavelength analysis will be essential to determine the true AGN nature of these sources.
  SED fitting provides complementary AGN identification, unifying multi-wavelength AGN selections. This approach enables more complete -- albeit with some contamination -- AGN samples essential for upcoming large-scale surveys where spectroscopic diagnostics may be limited.</description>

      <title>Secular Attrition of Classical Bulges by Stellar Bars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical bulges and stellar bars are common features in disk galaxies and serve as key tracers of galactic evolution. Angular momentum exchange at bar resonances drives secular morphological changes throughout the disk, including bar slowing and lengthening, and affects the structure of accompanying bulges. In this study, using a suite of N-body simulations, we quantify the secular reconfiguration of classical bulges through resonant trapping by evolving stellar bars. We use orbital frequency analysis to identify bar-resonant populations and find that up to 50% of the initial bulge stars become trapped in 2:1 resonant orbits and adopt disk-like kinematics. This transformation renders much of the classical bulge observationally indistinguishable from the disk. We compare these results with a sample of 210 MaNGA disk galaxies, finding that slow bars--indicative of older systems--are preferentially associated with weaker bulges. These results suggest that long-lived bars can significantly reshape classical bulges, potentially explaining their scarcity in the local universe and the low classical bulge fraction found in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Born to be Starless: Revisiting the Missing Satellite Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The massive Local Group galaxies both host substantially fewer satellites than the subhalos expected from the cold dark matter paradigm, and the recent investigations have highlighted the interplay between baryons and dark matter. We investigate the processes that make subhalos starless, using high-resolution cosmological simulations. We found that the number of satellites around Milky Way analogs closely aligns with observations, which accords with recent studies. In our simulations, the majority of subhalos are devoid of stars, i.e., "starless." We first examined supernova feedback and the environmental effects associated with subhalos' orbital motion as candidates of origin. However, neither seems to be the main driver. Supernova feedback causes a reduction of cold gas in "starred" subhalos, but its impact is not significant. In the case of starless subhalos, supernova feedback is irrelevant because most of them do not have in-situ star formation in the first place. The orbital motion in dense environments causes gas removal in all subhalos but is not enough to remove pre-existing stars. The key is found to be the effect of reionization instead. Starless subhalos are initially born in regions that are less efficient in accreting matter. This makes them lack sufficiently dense gas to self-shield from UV background heating, preventing their gas from cooling below the star formation threshold. This indicates that starless subhalos are not made but born.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of low-mass black hole seeds in the BRAHMA simulations using subgrid-dynamical friction: Impact on merger-driven black hole growth in the high redshift Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of low-mass black hole (BH) seeds in the high-redshift ($z\gtrsim5$) Universe using a suite of $[4.5~\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$ and $[9~\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$ BRAHMA cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. The simulations form seeds with mass $M_{\mathrm{seed}}=2.2\times10^3~M_{\odot}$ in halos that exceed critical thresholds of dense &amp; metal-poor gas mass ($5-150~M_{\mathrm{seed}}$) and the halo mass ($1000-10000~M_{\mathrm{seed}}$). While the initial BRAHMA boxes pinned the BHs to the halo centers, here we implement a sub-grid dynamical friction (DF) model. We also compare simulations where the BH is allowed to wander without the added DF. We investigate the spatial and velocity offsets of BHs in their host subhalos, as well as BH merger rates. We find that subgrid DF is crucial to ensure that a significant fraction of BHs effectively sink to halo centers by $z\sim5$, thereby enabling them to get gravitationally bound and merge with other BHs at separations close to the spatial resolution ($\sim0.2-0.4~\rm kpc$) of the simulation. For the BHs that merge, the associated merger time scales lag between $\sim100-1000~\mathrm{Myr}$ after their host halos merge. Compared to predictions using BH repositioning, the overall $z\gtrsim5$ BH merger rates under subgrid DF decrease by a factor of $\sim4-10$. Under subgrid DF, the different seed models predict merger rates between $\sim100-1000$ events per year at $z\gtrsim5$. These mergers dominate early BH growth, assembling BHs up to $\sim10^4-10^5~M_{\odot}$ by $z\sim5$, wherein $\lesssim2~\%$ of their mass is assembled via gas accretion. Our results highlight the promise for constraining seeding mechanisms using gravitational waves from future facilities such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Interstellar bands and ultraviolet extinction bump: a Milky Way perspective on distant galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral width wB and the center wavelength lB of the UV absorption bump uvB measured for two z=7 galaxies were found to differ from Milky Way (MW) values. A decrease of wB by 45% and a positive shift of lB by 70-80 Ang were measured. In the MW, the uvB amplitude hB and wB do vary; however, such a narrow bump has never been observed and no variability of lB has been convincingly found. Recently, links have been found between both hB and wB and the strength of several Diffuse Interstellar absorption Bands (DIBs). They were found to be limited to the sigma-type DIBs and their detection to be strongly favored if the data were limited to monocloud-type lines-of-sight, selected based on 3D dust maps. We extended the study of the links between MW DIBs and uvB to the lB value and to the hB to continuum ratio, and compared MW variations of the bump parameters to high z values. We used the 5780 and 6284 A sigma, and 5797 and 5850 A zeta DIBs. Similarly to hB and wB, lB reacts to the abundance of sigma carriers and is insensitive to the abundance of zeta DIB carriers, which dominate in dense cloud cores. A strong abundance of sigma carriers induces a shift of lB to longer wavelengths and a decrease of wB. The MW lB and wB variability range is about half the difference between average MW values and values in the distant galaxies. These results reinforce the hypothesis of the existence of individual types of hydrocarbon molecules responsible for both DIBs and part of the UV bump. They show that the majority of species responsible for narrow and positively shifted bumps in distant galaxies have a link with or are those producing the sigma DIBs and the long-wavelength part of the bump in the MW, and that species producing the short-wavelength part of the bump in the MW are of a different nature and absent along the paths to regions of those distant galaxies that contribute most to the UV emission.</description>

      <title>Deriving physical parameters of unresolved star clusters. IX. Sky background effects in the aperture photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aperture photometry method is a powerful tool that enables us to study large star cluster systems efficiently. However, its accuracy depends on various factors, including the stochasticity of the stellar initial mass function and variations in the sky background. Previously, in the eighth paper of this series, we established the best achievable limits of the aperture photometry method for star cluster studies in the local universe. The aim of this study is to determine how the sky background affects the limits and applicability of the aperture photometry method in star cluster analysis. We used a large sample of star cluster models spanning the parameter space of M 31 clusters. To determine how the background affects star cluster photometry, we placed images of simulated clusters into five background fields of different stellar density from the Panchromatic $Hubble$ Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey and measured them using aperture photometry. We determined age and mass limits for the M 31 disc star clusters at which photometric uncertainties are low enough to enable the determination of cluster parameters using the aperture photometry method. We demonstrated that for typical-size clusters, optimal aperture diameters are of ~3 half-light radii. We assessed cluster detection completeness in relation to varying sky background densities, based on the M 31 PHAT survey data. Our results suggest that a significant selection bias towards more compact clusters may exist in the PHAT survey. We derived low-mass limits of the cluster mass function (CMF) in the PHAT survey, reaching down to masses of ~500 $M_\odot$ in outer disc areas, ~1500 $M_\odot$ in middle disc or star-forming regions, and ~3000 $M_\odot$ in inner disc regions. Therefore, we stress a necessity of careful accounting for selection effects arising due to sky background variations when studying the CMF.</description>

      <title>A Metallicity Catalog of Very Metal-poor Main-sequence Turn-off and Red Giant Stars from LAMOST DR10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 8,440 candidate very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H] &lt; -2.0) main-sequence turn-off (MSTO) and red giant stars in the Milky Way, identified from low-resolution spectra in LAMOST DR10. More than 7,000 of these candidates are brighter than G ~ 16, making them excellent targets for high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up with 4-10 meter-class telescopes. Unlike most previous studies, we employed an empirical calibration to estimate metallicities from the equivalent widths (EWs) of the Calcium Triplet (CaT) lines, taking advantage of the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the red arm of LAMOST spectra. We further refined this calibration to improve its reliability for more distant stars. This method enables robust identification of VMP candidates with metallicities as low as [Fe/H] = -4.0 among both MSTO and red giant stars. Comparisons with metal-poor samples from other spectroscopic surveys and high-resolution follow-up observations confirm the accuracy of our estimates, showing a typical median offset of ~0.1 dex and a standard deviation of ~0.2 dex.</description>

      <title>Counterculture Stars: Slow and Retrograde Stars with Low-Alpha Disk Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way is home to a thin disk that can be defined via kinematics and/or elemental abundances. The elemental abundance-defined thin disk, also called the low-alpha disk, is generally thought to be comprised of stars on planar, circular orbits that approximate the circular velocity curve. While this is an apt description for the majority of stars with thin-disk-like abundances, there are a number of interesting exceptions. In this analysis, we identify and investigate $\sim 70$ stars with thin-disk-like abundances and very slow or retrograde Galactocentric azimuthal velocities. These stars could be kinematical outliers of the thin disk or elemental abundance outliers of the halo. Focusing first on the former, we introduce a number of mechanisms that could alter a thin disk orbit and cause the azimuthal velocity to become slow or retrograde. We then determine signatures for each mechanism and assess whether that mechanism is unlikely, plausible, or consistent given each star's reported properties. We find that at least one mechanism is plausible for each star, and the mechanism with the highest number of consistent candidate stars is dynamical ejection from stellar clusters. We next discuss scenarios that could produce halo stars with thin disk abundances, and again identify stars that could be connected to these mechanisms. With this sample we investigate rare processes, such as binary disruption by the central supermassive black hole, while also providing a unique perspective into the chemo-dynamics and structural components of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Three-Dimensional Diagram to Separate Star Formation, Active Galactic Nuclei, and Shocks in Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excitation sources in galaxies are frequently mixed due to AGN and stellar feedback, including star formation, active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and shock excitation. Disentangling the star formation, AGN, and shocks in galaxy integral-field spectra (IFU) at optical wavelengths is crucial to expanding the galaxy sample for AGN and stellar feedback studies, given the lack of multiwavelength observations for most of the galaxies that are observed in optical wavelengths. Previous methods to address this issue either have a limited application range or are highly uncertain in separating AGN from shock excitation (D'Agostino et al. 2019; Johnston et al. 2023). Here, we propose a theoretical three-dimensional (3D) diagram. This theoretical 3D diagram overcomes the limitations of previous methods and can simultaneously separate star formation, AGNs, and shocks in active galaxies. Along with the separation, the new theoretical 3D diagram also constrains the gas metallicity, ionization parameter, and gas pressure within the galaxy. By applying the Very Large Telescope (VLT)/MUSE IFU data and the Wide Field Spectrograph IFU data for NGC5728 on the theoretical 3D diagram, we find a star-forming ring surrounding the galaxy center with a projected radius of $\sim$1 kpc in the sky plane, an AGN ionized-bicone extended up to $\sim$2 kpc from the nuclear center, and a fast shock dominated disk region at the base of the AGN outflow, which is likely associated with a nuclear accretion disk or a result of jet-ISM interaction. The theoretical 3D diagram opens a new window to study the interplay among star formation, AGN, and shocks in active galaxies.</description>

      <title>Caustic fringes for wave dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave dark matter is composed of particles sufficiently light that their de Broglie wavelength exceeds the average inter-particle separation. A typical wave dark matter halo exhibits granular substructures due to wave interference. In this paper, we explore the wave interference effects around caustics. These are locations of formally divergent density in cold collisionless systems. Examples include splashback in galaxy clusters, and tidal shells in merging galaxies, where the pile-up of dark matter close to apogee gives rise to caustics. We show that wave interference modifies the density profile in the vicinity of the caustics, giving rise to a fringe pattern well-described by the Airy function. This follows from approximating the gravitational potential as linear close to apogee. This prediction is verified in a series of numerical simulations in which the gravitational potential is computed exactly. We provide a formula expressing the fringe separation in terms of the wave dark matter mass and halo parameters, which is useful for interpreting and stacking data. The fringe separation near caustics can be significantly larger than the naive de Broglie scale (the latter set by the system's velocity dispersion). This opens up the possibility of detecting caustic fringes for a wide range of wave dark matter masses.</description>

      <title>New X-ray Supernova Remnants in NGC 7793</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the detection of X-ray Supernova Remnants (SNRs) in the galaxy NGC 7793 and the study of their properties. X-ray SNRs in galaxies beyond the Local Group are rare, mainly due to the limited sensitivity of current X-ray instruments. Additionally, their identification requires an optical counterpart, making incomplete optical identification methods an extra challenge. Detecting X-ray SNRs in other galaxies is crucial for understanding their feedback in different evolutionary phases and gaining insights into their local interstellar medium. In NGC 7793, only one X-ray SNR was previously known, while a recent study reported nearly 240 optical SNRs. The discovery of a new, larger optical SNR sample motivated a re-examination of the X-ray SNR population by comparing optical SNRs with X-ray sources. To identify X-ray SNRs, we utilised Chandra's spatial resolution and analysed all available archival data of NGC 7793, totaling 229.9 ks over 19 years. After data reduction, we performed source detection and analysis, searching for X-ray sources coinciding with optical SNRs. We also used XMM-Newton for spectral analysis of the confirmed and candidate SNRs. We detected 58 X-ray sources down to an observed luminosity of $\sim 1.5\times 10^{36}\, erg\, s^{-1}$. Among them, five X-ray counterparts to optical SNRs were identified, all presenting soft emission (&lt;1.2 keV) with no short- or long-term variability. One corresponds to the previously known X-ray SNR, while four are newly detected. Spectral modeling of two SNRs shows thermal spectra exceeding 2.5 million K, with strong OVII, OVIII, and NeIX emission lines. A correlation between density, X-ray luminosity, and source softness was observed. We also report X-ray emission from supernova 2008bk, refining its position, and suggest two candidate X-ray SNRs with soft, non-variable spectra, one resembling the identified X-ray SNRs.</description>

      <title>Dissecting environmental effects with eccentric gravitational wave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the effect of resonances between time-varying perturbative forces and the epi-cyclical motion of eccentric binaries in the gravitational wave (GW) driven regime. These induce secular drifts in the orbital elements which are reflected in a dephasing of the binary's GW signal, derived here systematically. The resulting dephasing prescriptions showcase a much richer phenomenology with respect to typically adopted power-laws, and are better able to model realistic environmental effects (EE). The most important consequences are for gas embedded binaries, which we analyse in detail with a series of analytical calculations, numerical experiments and a curated set of hydrodynamical simulations. Even in these simplified tests, we find the surprising result that dephasing caused by epi-cyclical resonances dominate over expectations based on smoothed or orbit averaged gas drag models in GW signals that retain mild eccentricity in the detector band ($e&gt; 0.05$). We discuss how dissecting GW dephasing in its component Fourier modes can be used to probe the coupling of binaries with their surrounding environment in unprecedented detail.</description>

      <title>Delving into the depths of NGC 3783 with XRISM. I. Kinematic and ionization structure of the highly ionized outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our study of the XRISM observation of the Seyfert-1 galaxy NGC 3783. For the first time, XRISM's Resolve microcalorimeter enables a detailed characterization of the highly ionized outflows in this active galactic nucleus. Our analysis constrains their outflow and turbulent velocities, along with their ionization parameter $\xi$ and column density $N_{\rm H}$. The high-resolution Resolve spectrum reveals a distinct series of Fe absorption lines between 6.4 and 7.8 keV, ranging from Fe XVIII to Fe XXVI. At lower energies, absorption features from Si, S, and Ar are also detected. Our spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of the time-averaged Resolve spectrum uncover six outflow components, five of which exhibit relatively narrow absorption lines, with outflow velocities ranging from 560 to 1170 km/s. In addition, a broad absorption feature is detected, which is consistent with Fe XXVI outflowing at 14,300 km/s (0.05 $c$). This component carries a kinetic luminosity of 0.8-3% of the bolometric luminosity. Our analysis of the Resolve spectrum shows that more highly ionized absorption lines are intrinsically broader than those of lower ionization species, indicating that the turbulent velocity of the six outflow components (ranging from 0 to 3500 km/s) increases with $\xi$. Furthermore, we find that the $N_{\rm H}$ of the outflows generally declines with $\xi$ up to $\log \xi = 3.2$, but rises beyond this point, suggesting a complex ionization structure. Examination of the absorption profile of the Fe XXV resonance line reveals intriguing similarities to UV absorption lines (Ly$\alpha$ and C IV) observed by the HST, from which we infer that the outflows are clumpy in nature. Our XRISM/Resolve results support a 'hybrid wind' scenario, in which the outflows have multiple origins and driving mechanisms. We explore various interpretations of our findings within AGN wind models.</description>

      <title>AMUSE-Antlia. II. Intracluster X-ray Population in the Antlia Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic survey of X-ray sources in the inner ($r\sim200$ kpc) region of the Antlia cluster based on \Chandra observations, down to a source detection limit of $ L(0.5\text{--}8\ \mathrm{keV})\sim4.2\times10^{-7}\ \mathrm{ph\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}}$ ($2\times10^{38}\ \mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}}$). We present an X-ray source catalog with 202 sources and provide their coordinates, multi-band flux information and hardness ratios. We find a statistically significant excess at a significance level of $4.2\sigma$ with 37.6 excess sources beyond three times the mean effective radius of the two BCGs. This implies that these excess sources could be a genuine intracluster X-ray population that is not associated with the bulk stellar component. Also, the increased number of excess sources in the fields containing a BCG implies a potential connection between the excess sources and BCGs. The discovery of these sources in the Antlia cluster, together with previous research of similar findings in other two nearby clusters, Virgo and Fornax, indicates that the intracluster X-ray population could be universal in nearby galaxy clusters. Furthermore, we discuss the candidate origins of the excess sources, including low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) associated with intracluster light (ICL-LMXBs), LMXBs in globular clusters (GC-LMXBs) and supernova-kicked LMXBs (SN-kicked LMXBs). We estimate the contribution of ICL-LMXBs, which should include the LMXBs relating with the stellar halo surrounding BCGs, are unlikely to dominate the intracluster X-ray population in Antlia. Meanwhile, GC-LMXBs and SN-kicked LMXBs, each component could contribute $\sim30\%$ to the total excess sources.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way as Seen by Classical Cepheids I: Distances Based on Mid-infrared Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids are the archetype of the standard candle, thanks to the period-luminosity relation which allows to measure their intrinsic brightness. They are also relatively young and bright, potentially making them excellent tracers of the young stellar population that is responsible for shaping the visible aspect of our Galaxy, the Milky Way. However, being observers embedded in the dusty interstellar medium of the Galaxy, deriving reliable photometric distances to classical Cepheids of the Milky Way is a challenge. The typical approach is to use "reddening-free" indices, such as Wesenheit magnitudes, to obviate the need for an extinction correction. However, this approach could lead to unknown systematics - especially toward the inner Galaxy - as its assumption of a universal total-to-selective extinction ratio is not satisfied, particularly in lines of sight where the extinction is high and crosses spiral arms. We instead estimate new distances for 3424 Cepheids based on mid-IR photometry from WISE, which suffers minimally from extinction, and by adopting a 3D extinction map to calculate the necessary (albeit small) extinction corrections. We show that our distances are consistent with Gaia's parallaxes for the subset with relative parallax errors smaller than 10%, verifying that our mean distance errors are of the order of 6% and that the mean parallax zero point for this subsample is 7 $\mu$as.</description>

      <title>DESI Mg II Absorbers: Extinction Characteristics &amp; Quasar Redshift Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how absorption-line systems affect the spectra and redshifts of quasars (QSOs), using catalogs of Mg II absorbers from the early data release (EDR) and first data release (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We determine the reddening effect of an absorption system by fitting an un-reddened template spectrum to a sample of 50,674 QSO spectra that contain Mg II absorbers. We find that reddening caused by intervening absorbers (voff &gt; 3500 km/s) has an average color excess of E(B-V) = 0.04 magnitudes. We find that the E(B-V) tends to be greater for absorbers at low redshifts, or those having Mg II absorption lines with higher equivalent widths, but shows no clear trend with voff for intervening systems. However, the E(B-V) of associated absorbers, those at voff &lt; 3500 km/s, shows a strong trend with voff , increasing rapidly with decreasing voff and peaking (approximately 0.15 magnitudes) around voff = 0 km/s. We demonstrate that Mg II absorbers impact redshift estimation for QSOs by investigating the distributions of voff for associated absorbers. We find that at z &gt; 1.5 these distributions broaden and bifurcate in a nonphysical manner. In an effort to mitigate this effect, we mask pixels associated with the Mg II absorption lines and recalculate the QSO redshifts. We find that we can recover voff populations in better agreement with those for z &lt; 1.5 absorbers and in doing so typically shift background QSO redshifts by delta_z approximately equal to plus or minus 0.005.</description>

      <title>The extreme starburst J1044+0353 blows kpc-scale bubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a kpc-scale lacy filamentary structure in low surface-brightness H$\alpha$ and [OIII]$\lambda5007$ emission around the low-redshift, extremely metal-poor and compact reionisation-era analogue SDSS J1044+0353. We identify seven elliptical arcs in H$\alpha$ emission at $\mathrm{SB}_\mathrm{H\alpha} \sim 1 - 2 \times 10^{-18}$erg s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$arcsec$^{-2}$. We interpret these features as limb-brightened giant-shells that bound egg-shaped super bubbles with 3-3.5 kpc radii. These shells are significantly larger than the known giant shells around nearby star-forming dwarfs. Kinematic maps reveal a gradient perpendicular to the major-axis and line broadening in the outskirts. The latter, when interpreted due to line-splitting of the expanding shells, suggests expansion velocities of $\sim 40$km s$^{-1}$. Notably, the properties of the giant shells evade description by simple analytic prescriptions for energy- and momentum-driven super-bubbles.</description>

      <title>Discovery of WINERED-HVS1: A metal-rich hyper-velocity star candidate ejected from the Galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a metal-rich red giant star, WINERED-HVS1, which is a candidate for a hyper-velocity star (HVS). Its past trajectory suggests that this star may have been ejected by the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH; Sgr A*), with a modest ejection velocity of at least $500\; \mathrm{km\;s^{-1}}$. Since WINERED-HVS1 is gravitationally bound to the Milky Way and is not necessarily young, it is not an unambiguous HVS candidate from a kinematic perspective, unlike the previously confirmed A-type main-sequence HVS known as S5-HVS1. Therefore, the chemical characterization of this star is essential for understanding its origin. Through a spectroscopic follow-up observation with Magellan/WINERED, we determined its metallicity $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=-0.147^{+0.046}_{-0.045}$, as well as the abundances for Na, Mg, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, and Sr. The high metallicity value suggests that this star was ejected from the Galactic center and is unlikely to be a halo star with a radial orbit. The abundance pattern of this star -- including the pattern of [$\alpha$/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Mg], and [Ca/Mg] -- is consistent with that of the nuclear star cluster surrounding the SMBH, further supporting our view. This discovery opens a new window to look through the Galactic center environment without the hindrance of dust extinction, by using the HVSs moving in the halo region where dust extinction is minimal.</description>

      <title>Central galaxy alignments. Dependence on the mass and the large-scale environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations indicate that central galaxies show a significant alignment of their main shape axes with other galaxies in their group, as well as with the large-scale structure of the universe. Simulations have corroborated this finding, providing further insights into how the shape of the stellar component aligns with the surrounding dark matter halo. In this work, we aim at gaining a deeper understanding of galaxy alignments by quantifying how this property is related to the mass of the haloes hosting central galaxies and to the large-scale environment measured at different scales. By studying different angles, we describe how the alignments of central galaxies depend on the mass of the haloes they inhabit. We explore how the main axes of central galaxies align across different scales, both in three-dimensional and two-dimensional projections. We examine how halo mass influences these alignments and how they vary in the surrounding large-scale environment. To conduct this study, we employ the TNG300 hydrodynamical simulations and compare our results with the spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 18. Three types of alignment were analysed: between stellar and dark matter components, between satellite galaxies and the central galaxy, and between the central galaxy and its host halo. The results show that the alignment increases with halo mass and varies with the environment (clusters, filaments, cluster periphery, and others). However, after controlling for local density, we found that most of the observed trends disappear, except for a marginal influence of cosmic filaments on some of the considered alignment angles. The SDSS observations confirm a mass dependence similar to the simulations, although observational biases limit the detection of differences between the different environments.</description>

      <title>Measuring Scaling Relationships: Fitting Technique Matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling relationships, both integrated and spatially resolved, arise due to the physical processes that govern galaxy evolution and are frequently measured in both observed and simulated data. However, the accuracy and comparability of these measurements are hindered by various differences between studies such as spatial resolution, sample selection criteria, and fitting technique. Here, we compare variations of standard least squares techniques to the ridge line method for identifying spatially resolved scaling relations ($\Sigma_*-\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, $\Sigma_*-\Sigma_{\rm gas}$, and $\Sigma_{\rm gas}-\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) for TNG100 galaxies. We find that using the ridge line technique to fit these scaling relations with a double linear function results in significantly better fits than fitting with ordinary least squares. We further illustrate the utility of the ridge line technique with an investigation into the dependence of rSFMS measurements on spatial resolution and smoothing scale. Specifically, we find that the slope of the rSFMS at low-$\Sigma_*$ is independent (within $2\sigma$) of spatial resolution and smoothing scale. Finally, we discuss the need for a consistent re-analysis of resolved scaling relations in the literature and physically motivate adoption of the ridge line technique over other fitting methods.</description>

      <title>Identifying Dwarfs of MC Analog GalaxiEs (ID-MAGE): The Search for Satellites Around Low-Mass Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from ID-MAGE (Identifying Dwarfs of MC Analog GalaxiEs), a survey aimed at identifying and characterizing unresolved satellite galaxies around 36~nearby LMC- and SMC-mass hosts (D$=$4$-$10~Mpc). We use archival DESI Legacy Survey imaging data and perform an extensive search for dwarf satellites, extending out to a radius of 150~kpc ($\sim$$R_{vir}$). We identify 355 candidate satellite galaxies, including 24 new discoveries. Extensive tests with injected galaxies demonstrate that the survey is complete down to $M_V\sim-$9.0 (assuming the distance of the host) and $\mu_{0,V}\sim$26 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ (assuming a n$=$1 S\'ersic profile). We perform consistent photometry, via S\'ersic profile fitting, on all candidates and have initiated a comprehensive follow-up campaign to confirm and characterize candidates. Through a systematic visual inspection campaign, we classify the top candidates as high-likelihood satellites. On average, we find 4.0$\pm$1.4 high-likelihood candidate satellites per LMC-mass host and 2.1$\pm$0.6 per SMC-mass host which is within the range predicted by cosmological models. We use this sample to establish upper and lower estimates on the satellite luminosity function of LMC/SMC-mass galaxies. ID-MAGE nearly triples the number of low-mass galaxies surveyed for satellites with well-characterized completeness limits, providing a unique dataset to explore small-scale structure and dwarf galaxy evolution around low-mass hosts in diverse environments.</description>

      <title>Automated detection and modeling of binary microlensing events in OGLE-IV data. I. Events with well-separated bumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing depends primarily on the lens mass and presents a larger occurrence rate in crowded regions, which makes it the best tool to uncover the initial mass function (IMF) of low-mass stars in the Galactic bulge. The bulge IMF can be obtained from the luminosity function measured with the Hubble Space Telescope if one knows the statistics of binary stellar systems in the bulge. We aim to analyse a statistically significant number of binary-lens/single-source and single-lens/binary-source events, in order to explore the lower-mass end of the bulge IMF even in unresolved binary systems. This paper deals with events with clearly separated bumps and no caustic crossing or approach, whereas other types will be analysed in following works. A fully-automated approach in the search and modeling of binary events was implemented. Event detection was carried out with a modified version of the algorithm used in previous studies. Model fitting was carried out with Markov chain Monte Carlo and nested sampling methods, in order to find the most probable solution among binary lens or binary source models. We retrieved 107 binary events in Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) light curves spanning ten years in 9 high-cadence and 112 low-cadence fields towards the bulge. Several criteria were applied to reduce false positives, resulting in 59 most likely binary lenses and 48 binary sources. The tools were effective in detecting a bona-fide sample of binary events, with a distribution of Einstein timescales around 35-40 days and flat distributions for mass ratio and source flux ratio. After proper consideration of detection efficiency, the statistics for binary fraction and mass ratio will provide valuable constraints for the bulge IMF.</description>

      <title>Dense gas tracers in and between spiral arms: from Giant Molecular Filaments to star-forming clumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Giant Molecular Filaments are opportune locations in our Galaxy to study the star-forming interstellar matter and its accumulation on spatial scales comparable to those now becoming available for external galaxies. We mapped the emission of HCN(1$-$0), HCO$^+$(1$-$0), and N$_2$H$^+$(1$-$0) towards two of these filaments, one associated with the Sagittarius arm and one with an interarm area. Using the data alongside the COHRS $^{12}$CO(3$-$2), the CHIMPS $^{13}$CO(3$-$2), and $\textit{Herschel}$-based column density maps, we evaluate the dense gas tracer emission characteristics and find that although its filling factor is the smallest among the studied species, N$_2$H$^+$ is the best at tracing the truly dense gas. Significant differences can be seen between the $^{13}$CO, HCN, and $N$(H$_2$)$_{\mathrm{dust}}$ levels of the arm and interarm, while the N$_2$H$^+$ emission is more uniform regardless of location, meaning that the observed variations in line ratios like N$_2$H$^+$/HCN or N$_2$H$^+$/$^{13}$CO are driven by species tracing moderate-density gas and not the star-forming gas. In many cases, greater variation in molecular emission and ratios exist between regions inside a filament than between the arm and interarm environments. The choice of measure of the dense gas and the available spatial resolution have deep impact on the multi-scale view of different environments inside a galaxy regarding molecular emissions, ratios, and thus the estimated star formation activity.</description>

Abstract: Stellar atmospheric element abundance ratios of stars retain information about their birth conditions, helping elucidate their origin and nature. In this letter, we analyse and contrast the hydrostatic and explosive $\alpha$-element abundance ratios, and the ratio of the two (the hex ratio), for a large sample of Galactic globular clusters (GCs), halo substructures, satellite galaxies, and the Milky Way high-/low-$\alpha$ discs using data from the $APOGEE$ survey. Our results show that: $i$) Milky Way GCs and halo substructures appear to have qualitatively similar hex ratios across a broad range of [Fe/H], that are higher than that of dwarf satellite galaxies of similar [Fe/H]; $ii$) for all stellar populations studied, there is a trend in the hex ratio with [Fe/H]; $iii$) there is a weak trend in the hex ratio with respect to age for Galactic GCs, but not with initial or final GC mass; $iv$) there are no differences in the hex ratio between GCs formed $in$ $situ$ versus those labelled as accreted.</description>

      <title>Observations of Carbon Radio Recombination Lines with the NenuFAR telescope. I. Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carbon Radio Recombination Lines (CRRLs) at decametre wavelengths trace the diffuse phase of the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Galaxy. Their observation allows to measure physical parameters of this phase. We observed CRRLs with the recently commissioned New Extension in Nan\c{c}ay Upgrading LOFAR (NenuFAR) telescope towards two of the brightest sources at low-frequency (10-85 MHz): Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A (hereafter Cas A and Cyg A respectively), to measure the density n_e and temperature T_e of electrons in line-of-sight clouds. We used NenuFAR's beamforming mode, and we integrated several tens of hours on each source. The nominal spectral resolution was 95.4 Hz. We developed a pipeline to remove radio frequency interference (RFI) contamination and correct the baselines. We then fitted the spectral lines observed in absorption, associated to line-of-sight clouds. Cas A is the brightest source in the sky at low frequencies and represents an appropriate test bench for this new telescope. On this source, we detected 398 C\alpha lines between principal quantum numbers n=426 and n=826. C\alpha lines towards Cyg A were fainter. We stacked the signal by groups of a few tens of lines to improve the quality of our fitting process. On both sources we reached significantly higher S/N and spectral resolution than the most recent detections by the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). The variation of line shape with n provides constraints on the physical properties of the clouds: T_e, n_e, the temperature T_0 of the radiation field, the mean turbulent velocity v_t and the typical size of the cloud. The NenuFAR observations sample a larger space volume than LOFAR's towards the same sources due to the differences in instrumental beamsizes, and the discrepancies highlight the sensitivity of low-frequency CRRLs as probes of the diffuse ISM, paving the way towards large area surveys of CRRLs in our Galaxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two classes of stationary axisymmetric solutions of Einstein's equations for isolated differentially rotating matter sources are presented. The asymptotic regime is extracted, with attention to quasilocal gravitational energy, shear and angular momentum related by the Raychaudhuri equation. At outer boundaries the quasilocal angular momentum and energy densities vanish, defining novel geometric structures - the vortex surface and the rotosurface. Solutions with a rotosurface present a new notion of asymptotic flatness: vorticity, shear and Kretschmann scalars vanish at a finite radial distance from the symmetry centre. Synthetic rotation curves for the Milky Way are presented, fit to GAIA-DR3 data, and potential astrophysical signatures are suggested. Whether or not abundant collisionless dark matter exists, the new solutions very strongly support suggestions that the phenomenology of galactic rotation curves be fundamentally reconsidered, for consistency with general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of known star clusters, associations, and moving groups in the vicinity of the Sun has increased significantly due to the use of Gaia data. We investigated the existence and properties of open superclusters (OSC) within 500 pc of the Sun, with a particular focus on a newly identified OSC, designated HC8. Using advanced Gaia-derived astrometric data and star cluster catalogs, we identify and analyze member stars of various clusters, deriving key parameters such as ages, distances, extinctions, and kinematic properties. Our findings reveal that HC8, a previously unrecognized OSC, encompasses several young clusters, including the newly discovered cluster Duvia 1. We provide a detailed examination of HC8's star formation history and its spatial and kinematic characteristics. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the existence of highly populated primordial groups and enhances our understanding of the formation and evolution of star clusters in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Evolution of Fast Radio Bursts Inferred from the CHIME/FRB Baseband Catalog 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09810v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Redshift and luminosity distributions are essential for understanding the cosmic evolution of extragalactic objects and phenomena, such as galaxies, gamma-ray bursts, and fast radio bursts (FRBs). For FRBs, these distributions are primarily estimated using the fluence and the Dispersion Measure (DM). Calibrating their joint distribution has been challenging due to a lack of accurate fluences in the intensity data of the CHIME/FRB survey. Using the baseband update of CHIME/FRB Catalog 1, we calibrate the 2D fluence-DM distribution for the first time. We find the energy distribution is described well by a Schechter function with power-law slope of $-1.94^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$. Testing two types of redshift evolution models suggests a likely combination of young and old formation channels. $31^{+31}_{-21}$% of FRB sources may track star formation, or correspondingly, FRB sources may have delay times of $1.94^{+1.54}_{-1.31}$ Gyr. A pure star formation tracking population is excluded by only one model at $&gt; 2\sigma$ confidence. An updated cosmic star formation rate density evolution up to redshift 14 is constrained by compiling results from several JWST studies. The furthest FRB detection with planned radio facilities is expected to be at $z \approx 5$. A radio telescope operating at 200 MHz with a system-equivalent flux density of $\leq 0.07$ Jy (equivalent to a detection threshold of 1 mJy ms) and instantaneous sky coverage of $\gtrsim 400$ square degrees should be able to detect $630^{+730}_{-485}$ FRBs year$^{-1}$ at $z \gtrsim 6$ and $53^{+83}_{-43}$ FRBs year$^{-1}$ at $z\gtrsim 8$, which is sufficient to differentiate between reionization histories.</description>

      <title>Introducing the AIDA-TNG project: galaxy formation in alternative dark matter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the AIDA-TNG project, a suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations that simultaneously model galaxy formation and different variations of the underlying dark matter model. We consider the standard cold dark matter model and five variations, including three warm dark matter scenarios and two self-interacting models with constant or velocity-dependent cross-section. In each model, we simulate two cosmological boxes of 51.7 and 110.7 Mpc on a side, with the same initial conditions as TNG50 and TNG100, and combine the variations in the physics of dark matter with the fiducial IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model. The AIDA-TNG runs are thus ideal for studying the simultaneous effect of baryons and alternative dark matter models on observable properties of galaxies and large-scale structures. We resolve haloes in the range between $10^{8}$ and $4\times10^{14}\,$M$_{\odot}$ and scales down to the nominal resolution of 570 pc in the highest resolution runs. This work presents the first results on statistical quantities such as the halo mass function and the matter power spectrum; we quantify the modification in the number of haloes and the power on scales smaller than 1 Mpc, due to the combination of baryonic and dark matter physics. Despite being calibrated on cold dark matter, we find that the TNG galaxy formation model can produce a realistic galaxy population in all scenarios. The stellar and gas mass fraction, stellar mass function, black hole mass as a function of stellar mass and star formation rate density are very similar in all dark matter models, with some deviations only in the most extreme warm dark matter model. Finally, we also quantify changes in halo structure due to warm and self-interacting dark matter, which appear in the density profiles, concentration-mass relation and galaxy sizes.</description>

Abstract: In the $\Lambda$CDM universe, structure formation is generally not a self-similar process, while some self-similarity remains in certain statistics which can greatly simplify our description and understanding of the cosmic structures. In this work, we show that the merger tree of dark matter halos is approximately self-similar by investigating the universality of the subhalo peak mass function (PMF) describing the mass distribution of progenitor halos. Using a set of cosmological simulations and identifying subhalos of different merger levels with HBT+, we verify that the level-1 subhalo PMF is close to universal across halo mass, redshift, and cosmology. This approximate self-similarity allows us to analytically derive the subhalo PMF for subhalos accreted at any level (i.e., for sub-sub...halos) through self-convolutions of the level-1 PMF, and the resulting model shows good agreement with simulation measurements. We further derive a number of analytical properties on the hierarchical origin of subhalos. We show that higher-level subhalos dominate at progressively lower peak mass in the PMF and are more likely to originate from major mergers than lower-level ones. At a given merger mass ratio, the subhalo accretion rates at each level track the growth rate of the host halo. At a fixed final mass ratio, however, subhalos of higher-level, higher-mass-ratio and in more massive haloes tend to be accreted more recently. Matching subhalo peak mass to galaxy mass, these results have direct implications on the hierarchical origin of satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>Emission-line Stacking of 21cm Intensity Maps with MeerKLASS: Inference Pipeline and Application to the L-band Deep-field Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel analysis of observational systematics through the emission-line stacking of the MeerKLASS L-band deep-field intensity maps, following the detection in arXiv:2407.21626. A stacking signal is obtained by stacking the 21cm intensity map cubelets around the galaxy positions from the GAMA survey at $0.39\lesssim z \lesssim0.46$. An extensive simulation framework is built to study the viability of the stacking detection, the covariance estimation, and the model inference, which are then applied to the data. The statistical significance of the detection is $8.66\sigma$ when averaged into an angular map, and $7.45\sigma$ when averaged into a spectrum. The stacked spectrum exhibits an oscillating component of systematics, and we provide evidence that these systematics are a convolutional effect on the map data. The oscillation frequency matches the diffraction from the secondary reflector into the primary beam of the MeerKAT telescope. Bayesian inference can be used to constrain the systematics and the average HI emission of the galaxies. The fitting of the parameters gives a constraint on the systematics frequency $\nu_{\rm sys}\,[{\rm MHz}] = 17.90^{+6.53}_{-4.27}$. The posterior of the systematics amplitude reaches the wide prior and gives $A_{\rm sys}=0.50^{+0.33}_{-0.33}$. A tentative measurement of the average HI mass of the sources is achieved at $\log_{10}[\langle M_{HI}\rangle/M_\odot ]=9.84^{+0.48}_{-0.59}$, which is an underestimation limited by the narrow redshift bin, the strong degeneracy with the systematics, and the low-density galaxy sample. These shortfalls will be resolved for future MeerKLASS data to enable accurate measurements of the HI density through stacking of intensity maps.</description>
