      <title>Freshness-aware Resource Allocation for Non-orthogonal Wireless-powered IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a wireless-powered Internet of Things (IoT) network comprising a hybrid access point (HAP) and two devices. The HAP facilitates downlink wireless energy transfer (WET) for device charging and uplink wireless information transfer (WIT) to collect status updates from the devices. To keep the information fresh, concurrent WET and WIT are allowed, and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are adaptively scheduled for WIT. Consequently, we formulate an expected weighted sum age of information (EWSAoI) minimization problem to adaptively schedule the transmission scheme, choosing from WET, OMA, NOMA, and WET+OMA, and to allocate transmit power. To address this, we reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and develop an optimal policy based on instantaneous AoI and remaining battery power to determine scheme selection and transmit power allocation. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed policy, and the optimal policy has a distinct decision boundary-switching property, providing valuable insights for practical system design.</description>

      <title>6D Movable Antenna Based on User Distribution: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new six-dimensional (6D) movable antenna (6DMA) system for future wireless networks to improve the communication performance. Unlike the traditional fixed-position antenna (FPA) and existing fluid antenna/two-dimensional (2D) movable antenna (FA/2DMA) systems that adjust the positions of antennas only, the proposed 6DMA system consists of distributed antenna surfaces with independently adjustable three-dimensional (3D) positions as well as 3D rotations within a given space. In particular, this paper applies the 6DMA to the base station (BS) in wireless networks to provide full degrees of freedom (DoFs) for the BS to adapt to the dynamic user spatial distribution in the network. However, a challenging new problem arises on how to optimally control the 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces at the BS to maximize the network capacity based on the user spatial distribution, subject to the practical constraints on 6D antennas' movement. To tackle this problem, we first model the 6DMA-enabled BS and the user channels with the BS in terms of 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces. Next, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to search for the best 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces by leveraging the Monte Carlo simulation technique. Specifically, we sequentially optimize the 3D position/3D rotation of each 6DMA surface with those of the other surfaces fixed in an iterative manner. Numerical results show that our proposed 6DMA-BS can significantly improve the network capacity as compared to the benchmark BS architectures with FPAs or MAs with limited/partial movability, especially when the user distribution is more spatially non-uniform.</description>

      <title>Point-to-set Principle and Constructive Dimension Faithfulness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a constructive analogue of $\Phi$-dimension, a notion of Hausdorff dimension developed using a restricted class of coverings of a set. A class of coverings $\Phi$ is said to be "faithful" to Hausdorff dimension if the $\Phi$-dimension and Hausdorff dimension coincide for every set.
  We prove a Point-to-Set Principle for $\Phi$-dimension, through which we get Point-to-Set Principles for Hausdorff Dimension, continued-fraction dimension and dimension of Cantor Coverings as special cases. Using the Point-to-Set Principle for Cantor coverings and a new technique for the construction of sequences satisfying a certain Kolmogorov complexity condition, we show that the notions of faithfulness of Cantor coverings at the Hausdorff and constructive levels are equivalent.
  We adapt the result by Albeverio, Ivanenko, Lebid, and Torbin to derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the constructive dimension faithfulness of the coverings generated by the Cantor series expansion. This condition yields two general classes of representations of reals, one whose constructive dimensions that are equivalent to the constructive Hausdorff dimensions, and another, whose effective dimensions are different from the effective Hausdorff dimensions, completely classifying Cantor series expansions of reals.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Beam Training for Multi-RIS-Assisted Multi-User Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the beam training problem in the multi-user millimeter wave (mmWave) communication system, where multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are deployed to improve the coverage and the achievable rate. However, existing beam training techniques in mmWave systems suffer from the high complexity (i.e., exponential order) and low identification accuracy. To address these problems, we propose a novel hashing multi-arm beam (HMB) training scheme that reduces the training complexity to the logarithmic order with the high accuracy. Specifically, we first design a generation mechanism for HMB codebooks. Then, we propose a demultiplexing algorithm based on the soft decision to distinguish signals from different RIS reflective links. Finally, we utilize a multi-round voting mechanism to align the beams. Simulation results show that the proposed HMB training scheme enables simultaneous training for multiple RISs and multiple users, and reduces the beam training overhead to the logarithmic level. Moreover, it also shows that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the identification accuracy by at least 20% compared to existing beam training techniques.</description>

      <title>Coverage and Rate Analysis for Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is increasingly recognized as a pivotal technology for next-generation cellular networks, offering mutual benefits in both sensing and communication capabilities. This advancement necessitates a re-examination of the fundamental limits within networks where these two functions coexist via shared spectrum and infrastructures. However, traditional stochastic geometry-based performance analyses are confined to either communication or sensing networks separately. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a generalized stochastic geometry framework in ISAC networks. Based on this framework, we define and calculate the coverage and ergodic rate of sensing and communication performance under resource constraints. Then, we shed light on the fundamental limits of ISAC networks by presenting theoretical results for the coverage rate of the unified performance, taking into account the coupling effects of dual functions in coexistence networks. Further, we obtain the analytical formulations for evaluating the ergodic sensing rate constrained by the maximum communication rate, and the ergodic communication rate constrained by the maximum sensing rate. Extensive numerical results validate the accuracy of all theoretical derivations, and also indicate that denser networks significantly enhance ISAC coverage. Specifically, increasing the base station density from $1$ $\text{km}^{-2}$ to $10$ $\text{km}^{-2}$ can boost the ISAC coverage rate from $1.4\%$ to $39.8\%$. Further, results also reveal that with the increase of the constrained sensing rate, the ergodic communication rate improves significantly, but the reverse is not obvious.</description>

      <title>Robust Distributed Compression with Learned Heegard-Berger Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider lossy compression of an information source when decoder-only side information may be absent. This setup, also referred to as the Heegard-Berger or Kaspi problem, is a special case of robust distributed source coding. Building upon previous works on neural network-based distributed compressors developed for the decoder-only side information (Wyner-Ziv) case, we propose learning-based schemes that are amenable to the availability of side information. We find that our learned compressors mimic the achievability part of the Heegard-Berger theorem and yield interpretable results operating close to information-theoretic bounds. Depending on the availability of the side information, our neural compressors recover characteristics of the point-to-point (i.e., with no side information) and the Wyner-Ziv coding strategies that include binning in the source space, although no structure exploiting knowledge of the source and side information was imposed into the design.</description>

      <title>Meta Reinforcement Learning for Resource Allocation in Aerial Active-RIS-assisted Networks with Rate-Splitting Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mounting a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) holds promise for improving traditional terrestrial network performance. Unlike conventional methods deploying passive RIS on UAVs, this study delves into the efficacy of an aerial active RIS (AARIS). Specifically, the downlink transmission of an AARIS network is investigated, where the base station (BS) leverages rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) for effective interference management and benefits from the support of an AARIS for jointly amplifying and reflecting the BS's transmit signals. Considering both the non-trivial energy consumption of the active RIS and the limited energy storage of the UAV, we propose an innovative element selection strategy for optimizing the on/off status of RIS elements, which adaptively and remarkably manages the system's power consumption. To this end, a resource management problem is formulated, aiming to maximize the system energy efficiency (EE) by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the BS, the element activation, the phase shift and the amplification factor at the RIS, the RSMA common data rate at users, as well as the UAV's trajectory. Due to the dynamicity nature of UAV and user mobility, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is designed for resource allocation, utilizing meta-learning to adaptively handle fast time-varying system dynamics. Simulations indicate that incorporating an active RIS at the UAV leads to substantial EE gain, compared to passive RIS-aided UAV. We observe the superiority of the RSMA-based AARIS system in terms of EE, compared to existing approaches adopting non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA).</description>

      <title>Improved Trade-offs Between Amortization and Download Bandwidth for Linear HSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Homomorphic Secret Sharing (HSS) scheme is a secret-sharing scheme that shares a secret $x$ among $s$ servers, and additionally allows an output client to reconstruct some function $f(x)$ using information that can be locally computed by each server. A key parameter in HSS schemes is download rate, which quantifies how much information the output client needs to download from the servers. Often, download rate is improved by amortizing over $\ell$ instances of the problem, making $\ell$ also a key parameter of interest.
  Recent work (Fosli, Ishai, Kolobov, and Wootters 2022) established a limit on the download rate of linear HSS schemes for computing low-degree polynomials and constructed schemes that achieve this optimal download rate; their schemes required amortization over $\ell = \Omega(s \log(s))$ instances of the problem. Subsequent work (Blackwell and Wootters, 2023) completely characterized linear HSS schemes that achieve optimal download rate in terms of a coding-theoretic notion termed optimal labelweight codes. A consequence of this characterization was that $\ell = \Omega(s \log(s))$ is in fact necessary to achieve optimal download rate.
  In this paper, we characterize all linear HSS schemes, showing that schemes of any download rate are equivalent to a generalization of optimal labelweight codes. This equivalence is constructive and provides a way to obtain an explicit linear HSS scheme from any linear code. Using this characterization, we present explicit linear HSS schemes with slightly sub-optimal rate but with much improved amortization $\ell = O(s)$. Our constructions are based on algebraic geometry codes (specifically Hermitian codes and Goppa codes).</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for THz: Hardware Design and Signal Processing Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless communications in the THz frequency band is an envisioned revolutionary technology for sixth Generation (6G) networks. However, such frequencies impose certain coverage and device design challenges that need to be efficiently overcome. To this end, the development of cost- and energy-efficient approaches for scaling these networks to realistic scenarios constitute a necessity. Among the recent research trends contributing to these objectives belongs the technology of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs). In fact, several high-level descriptions of THz systems based on RISs have been populating the literature. Nevertheless, hardware implementations of those systems are still very scarce, and not at the scale intended for most envisioned THz scenarios. In this paper, we overview some of the most significant hardware design and signal processing challenges with THz RISs, and present a preliminary analysis of their impact on the overall link budget and system performance, conducted in the framework of the ongoing TERRAMETA project.</description>

      <title>Physics-Inspired Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing Framework in Efficient Channel State Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acquiring downlink channel state information (CSI) at the base station is vital for optimizing performance in massive Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) Frequency-Division Duplexing (FDD) systems. While deep learning architectures have been successful in facilitating UE-side CSI feedback and gNB-side recovery, the undersampling issue prior to CSI feedback is often overlooked. This issue, which arises from low density pilot placement in current standards, results in significant aliasing effects in outdoor channels and consequently limits CSI recovery performance. To this end, this work introduces a new CSI upsampling framework at the gNB as a post-processing solution to address the gaps caused by undersampling. Leveraging the physical principles of discrete Fourier transform shifting theorem and multipath reciprocity, our framework effectively uses uplink CSI to mitigate aliasing effects. We further develop a learning-based method that integrates the proposed algorithm with the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm Net (ISTA-Net) architecture, enhancing our approach for non-uniform sampling recovery. Our numerical results show that both our rule-based and deep learning methods significantly outperform traditional interpolation techniques and current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of performance.</description>

      <title>The q-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound can be improved for all but finitely many positive integers q</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any positive integer $q\geq 2$ and any real number $\delta\in(0,1)$, let $\alpha_q(n,\delta n)$ denote the maximum size of a subset of $\mathbb{Z}_q^n$ with minimum Hamming distance at least $\delta n$, where $\mathbb{Z}_q=\{0,1,\dotsc,q-1\}$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$. The asymptotic rate function is defined by $ R_q(\delta) = \limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n}\log_q\alpha_q(n,\delta n). $ The famous $q$-ary asymptotic Gilbert-Varshamov bound, obtained in the 1950s, states that \[ R_q(\delta) \geq 1 - \delta\log_q(q-1)-\delta\log_q\frac{1}{\delta}-(1-\delta)\log_q\frac{1}{1-\delta} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}R_\mathrm{GV}(\delta,q) \] for all positive integers $q\geq 2$ and $0&lt;\delta&lt;1-q^{-1}$. In the case that $q$ is an even power of a prime with $q\geq 49$, the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound was firstly improved by using algebraic geometry codes in the works of Tsfasman, Vladut, and Zink and of Ihara in the 1980s. The further investigation in algebraic geometry codes has shown that the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound can also be improved in the case that $q$ is an odd power of a prime but not a prime with $q &gt; 125$. However, it remains a long-standing open problem whether the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound would be tight for those infinitely many integers $q$ which is a prime, except for Fermat primes not less than 257, and which is a generic positive integer not being a prime power.
  In this paper, we prove that the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound can be improved for all but finitely many positive integers $q\geq 2$. It is shown that $ R_q(1/2) &gt; R_\mathrm{GV}(1/2,q) $ for all integers $q &gt; \exp(29)$. Furthermore, we show that the growth of the rate function $R_q(\delta)$ for $\delta\in(0,1)$ fixed and $q$ growing large has a nontrivial lower bound. These new lower bounds are achieved by using codes from geometry of numbers introduced by Lenstra in the 1980s.</description>

      <title>Learning How to Strategically Disclose Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strategic information disclosure, in its simplest form, considers a game between an information provider (sender) who has access to some private information that an information receiver is interested in. While the receiver takes an action that affects the utilities of both players, the sender can design information (or modify beliefs) of the receiver through signal commitment, hence posing a Stackelberg game. However, obtaining a Stackelberg equilibrium for this game traditionally requires the sender to have access to the receiver's objective. In this work, we consider an online version of information design where a sender interacts with a receiver of an unknown type who is adversarially chosen at each round. Restricting attention to Gaussian prior and quadratic costs for the sender and the receiver, we show that $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret is achievable with full information feedback, where $T$ is the total number of interactions between the sender and the receiver. Further, we propose a novel parametrization that allows the sender to achieve $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret for a general convex utility function. We then consider the Bayesian Persuasion problem with an additional cost term in the objective function, which penalizes signaling policies that are more informative and obtain $\mathcal{O}(\log(T))$ regret. Finally, we establish a sublinear regret bound for the partial information feedback setting and provide simulations to support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Detection in Noncoherent Massive SIMO Systems over Correlated Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the goal of enabling ultrareliable and low-latency wireless communications for industrial internet of things (IIoT), this paper studies the use of energy-based modulations in noncoherent massive single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems. We consider a one-shot communication over a channel with correlated Rayleigh fading and colored Gaussian noise, in which the receiver has statistical channel state information (CSI). We first provide a theoretical analysis on the limitations of unipolar pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) in systems of this kind, based on maximum likelihood detection. The existence of a fundamental error floor at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes is proved for constellations with more than two energy levels, when no (statistical) CSI is available at the transmitter. In the main body of the paper, we present a design framework for quadratic detectors that generalizes the widely-used energy detector, to better exploit the statistical knowledge of the channel. This allows us to design receivers optimized according to information-theoretic criteria that exhibit lower error rates at moderate and high SNR. We subsequently derive an analytic approximation for the error probability of a general class of quadratic detectors in the large array regime. Finally, we numerically validate it and discuss the outage probability of the system.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that Assembly Theory, pathway complexity, the assembly index, and the assembly number are subsumed and constitute a weak version of algorithmic (Kolmogorov-Solomonoff-Chaitin) complexity reliant on an approximation method based upon statistical compression, their results obtained due to the use of methods strictly equivalent to the LZ family of compression algorithms used in compressing algorithms such as ZIP, GZIP, or JPEG. Such popular algorithms have been shown to empirically reproduce the results of AT's assembly index and their use had already been reported in successful application to separating organic from non-organic molecules, and the study of selection and evolution. Here we exhibit and prove the connections and full equivalence of Assembly Theory to Shannon Entropy and statistical compression, and AT's disconnection as a statistical approach from causality. We demonstrate that formulating a traditional statistically compressed description of molecules, or the theory underlying it, does not imply an explanation or quantification of biases in generative (physical or biological) processes, including those brought about by selection and evolution, when lacking in logical consistency and empirical evidence. We argue that in their basic arguments, the authors of AT conflate how objects may assemble with causal directionality, and conclude that Assembly Theory does nothing to explain selection or evolution beyond known and previously established connections, some of which are reviewed.</description>

      <title>D$^2$-JSCC: Digital Deep Joint Source-channel Coding for Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communications (SemCom) have emerged as a new paradigm for supporting sixth-generation applications, where semantic features of data are transmitted using artificial intelligence algorithms to attain high communication efficiencies. Most existing SemCom techniques utilize deep neural networks (DNNs) to implement analog source-channel mappings, which are incompatible with existing digital communication architectures. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework of digital deep joint source-channel coding (D$^2$-JSCC) targeting image transmission in SemCom. The framework features digital source and channel codings that are jointly optimized to reduce the end-to-end (E2E) distortion. First, deep source coding with an adaptive density model is designed to encode semantic features according to their distributions. Second, digital channel coding is employed to protect encoded features against channel distortion. To facilitate their joint design, the E2E distortion is characterized as a function of the source and channel rates via the analysis of the Bayesian model and Lipschitz assumption on the DNNs. Then to minimize the E2E distortion, a two-step algorithm is proposed to control the source-channel rates for a given channel signal-to-noise ratio. Simulation results reveal that the proposed framework outperforms classic deep JSCC and mitigates the cliff and leveling-off effects, which commonly exist for separation-based approaches.</description>

      <title>BICM-compatible Rate Adaptive Geometric Constellation Shaping Using Optimized Many-to-one Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a rate adaptive geometric constellation shaping (GCS) scheme which is fully backward-compatible with existing state of the art bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The system relies on optimization of the positions of the quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) points on the I/Q plane for maximized achievable information rate, while maintaining quantization and fiber nonlinear noise robustness. Furthermore, `dummy' bits are multiplexed with coded bits before mapping to symbols. Rate adaptivity is achieved by tuning the ratio of coded and `dummy' bits, while maintaining a fixed forward error-correction block and a fixed modulation format size. The points' positions and their labeling are optimized using automatic differentiation. The proposed GCS scheme is compared to a time-sharing hybrid (TH) QAM modulation and the now mainstream probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) scheme. The TH without shaping is outperformed for all studied data rates in a simulated linear channel by up to 0.7 dB. In a linear channel, PAS is shown to outperform the proposed GCS scheme, while similar performances are reported for PAS and the proposed GCS in a simulated nonlinear fiber channel. The GCS scheme is experimentally demonstrated in a multi-span recirculating loop coherent optical fiber transmission system with a total distance of up to 3000 km. Near-continuous zero-error flexible throughput is reported as a function of the transmission distance. Up to 1-2 spans of increased reach gains are achieved at the same net data rate w.r.t. conventional QAM. At a given distance, up to 0.79 bits/2D symbol of gain w.r.t. conventional QAM is achieved. In the experiment, similar performance to PAS is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>The negation of permutation mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Negation is an important perspective of knowledge representation. Existing negation methods are mainly applied in probability theory, evidence theory and complex evidence theory. As a generalization of evidence theory, random permutation sets theory may represent information more precisely. However, how to apply the concept of negation to random permutation sets theory has not been studied. In this paper, the negation of permutation mass function is proposed. Moreover, in the negation process, the convergence of proposed negation method is verified. The trends of uncertainty and dissimilarity after each negation operation are investigated. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the rationality of the proposed method.</description>
