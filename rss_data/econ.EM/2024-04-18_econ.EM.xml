      <title>Testing Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economists are often interested in the mechanisms by which a particular treatment affects an outcome. This paper develops tests for the ``sharp null of full mediation'' that the treatment $D$ operates on the outcome $Y$ only through a particular conjectured mechanism (or set of mechanisms) $M$. A key observation is that if $D$ is randomly assigned and has a monotone effect on $M$, then $D$ is a valid instrumental variable for the local average treatment effect (LATE) of $M$ on $Y$. Existing tools for testing the validity of the LATE assumptions can thus be used to test the sharp null of full mediation when $M$ and $D$ are binary. We develop a more general framework that allows one to test whether the effect of $D$ on $Y$ is fully explained by a potentially multi-valued and multi-dimensional set of mechanisms $M$, allowing for relaxations of the monotonicity assumption. We further provide methods for lower-bounding the size of the alternative mechanisms when the sharp null is rejected. An advantage of our approach relative to existing tools for mediation analysis is that it does not require stringent assumptions about how $M$ is assigned; on the other hand, our approach helps to answer different questions than traditional mediation analysis by focusing on the sharp null rather than estimating average direct and indirect effects. We illustrate the usefulness of the testable implications in two empirical applications.</description>

      <title>Regret Analysis in Threshold Policy Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Threshold policies are targeting mechanisms that assign treatments based on whether an observable characteristic exceeds a certain threshold. They are widespread across multiple domains, such as welfare programs, taxation, and clinical medicine. This paper addresses the problem of designing threshold policies using experimental data, when the goal is to maximize the population welfare. First, I characterize the regret (a measure of policy optimality) of the Empirical Welfare Maximizer (EWM) policy, popular in the literature. Next, I introduce the Smoothed Welfare Maximizer (SWM) policy, which improves the EWM's regret convergence rate under an additional smoothness condition. The two policies are compared studying how differently their regrets depend on the population distribution, and investigating their finite sample performances through Monte Carlo simulations. In many contexts, the welfare guaranteed by the novel SWM policy is larger than with the EWM. An empirical illustration demonstrates how the treatment recommendation of the two policies may in practice notably differ.</description>

      <title>(Empirical) Bayes Approaches to Parallel Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Bayes and Empirical Bayes (EB) approaches for dealing with violations of parallel trends. In the Bayes approach, the researcher specifies a prior over both the pre-treatment violations of parallel trends $\delta_{pre}$ and the post-treatment violations $\delta_{post}$. The researcher then updates their posterior about the post-treatment bias $\delta_{post}$ given an estimate of the pre-trends $\delta_{pre}$. This allows them to form posterior means and credible sets for the treatment effect of interest, $\tau_{post}$. In the EB approach, the prior on the violations of parallel trends is learned from the pre-treatment observations. We illustrate these approaches in two empirical applications.</description>
