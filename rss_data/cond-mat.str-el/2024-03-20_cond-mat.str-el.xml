      <title>Characterizing the Entanglement of Anyonic Systems using the Anyonic Partial Transpose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement of mixed quantum states can be quantified using the partial transpose and its corresponding entanglement measure, the logarithmic negativity. Recently, the notion of partial transpose has been extended to systems of anyons, which are exotic quasiparticles whose exchange statistics go beyond the bosonic and fermionic case. Studying the fundamental properties of this anyonic partial transpose, we first reveal that when applied to the special case of fermionic systems, it can be reduced to the fermionic partial transpose or its twisted variant depending on whether or not a boundary Majorana fermion is present. Focusing on ground state properties, we find that the anyonic partial transpose captures both the correct entanglement scaling for gapless systems, as predicted by conformal field theory, and the phase transition between a topologically trivial and a nontrivial phase. For non-abelian anyons and the bipartition geometry, we find a rich multiplet structure in the eigenvalues of the partial transpose, the so-called negativity spectrum, and reveal the possibility of defining both a charge- and an imbalance-resolved negativity.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian and Abelian descendants of vortex spin liquid: fractional quantum spin Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent experimental observation of a potential fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) state in the twisted MoTe$_2$ system has sparked theoretical explorations at total filling $\nu_T=1$ of a pair of $C=\pm 1$ Chern bands from the two spins (locked to valley). One intriguing candidate is a vortex spin liquid (VSL), which can be viewed as an exciton version of composite fermi liquid (CFL). The VSL insulator is incompressible in the charge channel, while compressible in the spin channel. Here we investigate fully gapped descendants of the VSL phase at the total filling $\nu_T=\nu_{\uparrow}+\nu_{\downarrow}=1$. At zero magnetization, a non-Abelian state with both FQSH and thermal Hall effect emerges from weak $p+ip$ pairing of the neutral Fermi surface, hosting 12 anyons (up to addition of physical electron) including two independent Ising anyons separately carrying charge and spin. Strong pairing leads to a Z$_4$ topological order with only FQSH effect. At non-zero magnetization $m=2S_z$, there is a Jain sequence of magnetic plateaus with $m=\frac{1}{p}, p \in Z$, exhibiting both half FQSH effect and spin fractional quantum Hall effect (SFQH). Our work highlights the VSL's potential as a parent state to organize numerous FQSH insulators with non-trivial inter-valley correlations at $\nu_T=1$. The quantized FQSH behavior remains robust even in the presence of ferromagnetism, thanks to the spin-charge separation nature inherent in the parent VSL phase. Future experimental investigations are crucial to validate or rule out spontaneous magnetization and time reversal symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Fractionalization Signatures in the Dynamics of Quantum Spin Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the signatures of fractionalization in quantum spin liquids by studying different phases of the Kitaev honeycomb model in the presence of an out-of-plane magnetic field through which the model becomes non-integrable. Using the infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) ansatz, along with analytical calculations and exact diagonalization, we calculate dynamical signatures of fractionalized particles through spin-spin and dimer-dimer correlations. Our analysis demonstrates the ability of these correlations to discern distinct fractionalized quantum sectors, namely Majorana fermions and the emergent $Z_2$ fluxes, in both the chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase under weak field and the emergent intermediate gapless phase (IGP) under moderate field. Importantly, our calculation reveals the nature of IGP observed at moderate fields, a region of ongoing debate, indicating that this phase is a Majorana metal induced by strong flux fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Wigner-molecule supercrystal in transition-metal dichalcogenide moir\'e superlattices: Lessons from the bottom-up approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The few-body problem for $N=4$ fermionic charge carriers in a double-well moir\'{e} quantum dot (MQD), representing the first step in a bottom-up strategy to investigate formation of molecular supercrystals in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e superlattices with integral fillings, $\nu &gt; 1$, is solved exactly by employing large-scale exact-diagonalization via full configuration interaction (FCI) computations. A comparative analysis with the mean-field solutions of the often used spin-and-space unrestricted Hartree Fock (sS-UHF) demonstrates the limitations of the UHF method (by itself) to provide a proper description of the influence of the interdot Coulomb interaction. In particular, it is explicitly shown for $\nu=2$ that the exact charge densities (CDs) within each MQD retain the ring-like shape characteristic (for a wide range of relevant parameters) of a fully isolated MQD, as was found for sliding Wigner molecules (WMs). This deeply quantum-mechanical behavior contrasts sharply with the UHF CDs that portray solely orientationally pinned and well localized dumbbell dimers. An improved CD, which agrees with the FCI-calculated one, derived from the restoration of the sS-UHF broken parity symmetries is further introduced, suggesting a beyond-mean-field methodological roadmap for correcting the sS-UHF results. It is conjectured that the conclusions for the $\nu=2$ moir\'e TMD superlattice case extend to all cases with integral fillings that are associated with sliding WMs in isolated MQDs. The case of $\nu=3$, associated with a pinned WM in isolated MQDs, is an exception.</description>

      <title>Denoising of Imaginary Time Response Functions with Hankel projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaginary-time response functions of finite-temperature quantum systems are often obtained with methods that exhibit stochastic or systematic errors. Reducing these errors comes at a large computational cost -- in quantum Monte Carlo simulations, the reduction of noise by a factor of two incurs a simulation cost of a factor of four. In this paper, we relate certain imaginary-time response functions to an inner product on the space of linear operators on Fock space. We then show that data with noise typically does not respect the positive definiteness of its associated Gramian. The Gramian has the structure of a Hankel matrix. As a method for denoising noisy data, we introduce an alternating projection algorithm that finds the closest positive definite Hankel matrix consistent with noisy data. We test our methodology at the example of fermion Green's functions for continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo data and show remarkable improvements of the error, reducing noise by a factor of up to 20 in practical examples. We argue that Hankel projections should be used whenever finite-temperature imaginary-time data of response functions with errors is analyzed, be it in the context of quantum Monte Carlo, quantum computing, or in approximate semianalytic methodologies.</description>

      <title>Large Rashba spin-orbit coupling in metallic SrTaO$_3$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epitaxial thin films of SrTaO$_3$ with thickness ($t$) smaller than 74 nm were successfully fabricated on an insulator (LaAlO$_3$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_2$AlTaO$_6$)$_{0.7}$ substrate. Films with $t$ above 8.6 nm showed metallic conduction. Both conductivity and a mobility showed a decrease with increasing $t$ above 42 nm, suggesting the instability of thick SrTaO$_3$ films. This instability was also supported by TEM image and XRD intensity. For the metallic films with $t$ below 25 nm, energy band splitting due to spin-orbit coupling ($\Delta$$_{so}$) and Rashba parameter ($\alpha$$_R$) were deduced from an analysis of a magnetoresistance using two-dimensional weak antilocalization theory. The values of $\Delta$$_{so}$ ranged from 26 to 120 meV, which were the largest among other metallic oxide films, such as SrNbO$_3$, SrIrO$_3$, and La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ thin films, indicating that spin-orbit coupling in SrTaO$_3$ was the largest among the metallic perovskite oxides reported so far. The values of $\alpha$$_R$ for our SrTaO$_3$ films ranged from $8.8 \times$10$^{-13}$ to $1.7 \times$10$^{-12}$ eV m, which were much larger than those reported for other metallic oxide thin films.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fischer information in a strange metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strange metal is an exotic state of correlated quantum matter; intensive efforts are ongoing to decipher its nature. Here we explore whether the quantum Fisher information (QFI), a concept from quantum metrology, can provide new insight. We use inelastic neutron scattering and quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study a Kondo destruction quantum critical point, where strange metallicity is associated with fluctuations beyond a Landau order parameter. We find that the QFI probed away from magnetic Bragg peaks, where the effect of magnetic ordering is minimized, increases strongly and without a characteristic scale as the strange metal forms with decreasing temperature, evidencing its unusual entanglement properties. Our work opens a new direction for studies across strange metal platforms.</description>

      <title>Electronic instability, layer selectivity and Fermi arcs in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using advanced dynamical mean-field theory on a realistic level we study the normal-state correlated electronic structure of the high-pressure superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and compare the features of the conventional bilayer (2222) Ruddelsden-Popper crystal structure with those of a newly-identified monolayer-trilayer (1313) alternation. Both structural cases display Ni-$d_{z^2}$ flat-band character at low-energy, which drives an electronic instability with a wave vector ${\bf q_{\rm I}}=(0.25,0.25,q_z)$ at ambient pressure, in line with recent experimental findings. The 1313 electronic structure exhibits significant layer selectivity, rendering especially the monolayer part to be Mott-critical. At high pressure, this layer selectivity weakens and the 1313 fermiology displays arcs reminiscent to those of high-$T_c$ cuprates. In contrast to dominant inter-site self-energy effects in the latter systems, here the Fermi arcs are the result of the multiorbital and multilayer interplay within a correlated flat-band scenario.</description>

      <title>The Wilson-Fisher Fixed point revisited: importance of the form of the cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we re-examine the Wilson Fisher fixed point. We study momentum space renormalization group (RG) flow for various forms ofthe cutoff. We show that already at order 4-d where d is the dimension of the phi^{4} theory there are changes to the position of the fixed point and the direction of irrelevant coupling parameters. We also show in a multi-flavor phi^{4} model that symmetries of the Lagrange function can be destroyed by the different flavors having different cutoffs (that is the Lagrangian can flow to a non-symmetric fixed point). Some related comments are made about a similar situation in parquet RG (pRG).</description>

      <title>Low-overhead non-Clifford topological fault-tolerant circuits for all non-chiral abelian topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a family of explicit geometrically local circuits realizing any abelian non-chiral topological phase as an actively error-corrected fault-tolerant memory. These circuits are constructed from measuring 1-form symmetries in discrete fixed-point path integrals, which we express through cellular cohomology and higher-order cup products. The specific path integral we use is the abelian Dijkgraaf-Witten state sum on a 3-dimensional cellulation, which is a spacetime representation of the twisted quantum double model. The resulting circuits are based on a syndrome extraction circuit of the (qudit) stabilizer toric code, into which we insert non-Clifford phase gates that implement the ``twist''. The overhead compared to the toric code is moderate, in contrast to known constructions for twisted abelian phases. We also show that other architectures for the (qudit) toric code phase, like measurement-based topological quantum computation or Floquet codes, can be enriched with phase gates to implement twisted quantum doubles instead of their untwisted versions. As a further result, we prove fault tolerance under arbitrary local (including non-Pauli) noise for a very general class of topological circuits that we call 1-form symmetric fixed-point circuits. This notion unifies the circuits in this paper as well as the stabilizer toric code, subsystem toric code, measurement-based topological quantum computation, or the (CSS) honeycomb Floquet code. We also demonstrate how our method can be adapted to construct fault-tolerant circuits for specific non-Abelian phases. In the appendix we present an explicit combinatorial procedure to define formulas for higher cup products on arbitrary cellulations, which might be interesting in its own right to the TQFT and topological-phases community.</description>

      <title>Exact counterdiabatic driving for finite topological lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic protocols are often employed in state preparation schemes but require the system to be driven by a slowly varying Hamiltonian so that transitions between instantaneous eigenstates are exponentially suppressed. Counterdiabatic driving is a technique to speed up adiabatic protocols by including additional terms calculated from the instantaneous eigenstates that counter diabatic excitations. However, this approach requires knowledge of the full eigenspectrum meaning that the exact analytical form of counterdiabatic driving is only known for a subset of problems, e.g., the harmonic oscillator and transverse field Ising model. We extend this subset of problems to include the general family of one-dimensional non-interacting lattice models with open boundary conditions and arbitrary on-site potential, tunnelling terms, and lattice size. We formulate this approach for all states of lattice models, including bound and in-gap states which appear, e.g., in topological insulators. We also derive targeted counterdiabatic driving terms which are tailored to enforce the dynamical state to remain in a specific state. As an example, we consider state transfer using the topological edge states of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The derived analytical counterdiabatic driving Hamiltonian can be utilised to inform control protocols in many-body lattice models or to probe the non-equilibrium properties of lattice models.</description>

      <title>Halperin States of Particles and Holes in Ideal Time Reversal Invariant Pairs of Chern Bands and The Fractional Quantum Spin Hall Effect in Moir\'e MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An experiment in moir\'e MoTe$_2$ bilayers reported the first observation of a topologically ordered state with zero Hall conductivity and half of the edge conductance of a standard time-reversal invariant quantum spin Hall insulator. This state is believed to emerge at total filling one of a pair of bands with Chern numbers $C=\pm1$ related by time reversal symmetry. By viewing these bands as a pair of Landau levels with opposite magnetic fields, and starting from a parent magnet with one filled band, we demonstrate that a class of Halperin states constructed by adding particles to the empty Chern band and holes to the occupied Chern band have all the properties observed in MoTe$_2$. Remarkably, these states break time-reversal symmetry but have exactly zero Hall conductivity and helical edge conductance of $e^2/2h$. These states also feature a spinless composite fermion with the same charge as the electron but split equally between both valleys. In a standard Halperin 331 state, this particle would be a neutral Bogoliubov composite fermion. However, in our context this composite fermion is charged but remains itinerant because it is split into the two valleys that effectively experience opposite magnetic fields. The existence of such charged itinerant particles is a key difference between Landau levels with opposite magnetic fields and standard multi-components Landau levels, where all the itinerant particles are charge neutral, such as the magneto-roton of the Laughlin state or the Bogoliubov composite fermion of the Moore-Read state. When the electron density changes away from the ideal filling and these itinerant charged particles are added to the parent state, the disorder potential is less efficient at localizing them as compared to standard Lanadau levels. This can explain why the state in MoTe$_2$ did not display a robust Hall plateau upon changing the electron density.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate nonadiabatic molecular dynamics enabled through variational interpolation of correlated electron wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build on the concept of eigenvector continuation to develop an efficient multi-state method for the rigorous and smooth interpolation of a small training set of many-body wavefunctions through chemical space at mean-field cost. The inferred states are represented as variationally optimal linear combinations of the training states transferred between the many-body basis of different nuclear geometries. We show that analytic multi-state forces and nonadiabatic couplings from the model enable application to nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, developing an active learning scheme to ensure a compact and systematically improvable training set. This culminates in application to the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics of a photoexcited 28-atom hydrogen chain, with surprising complexity in the resulting nuclear motion. With just 22 DMRG calculations of training states from the low-energy correlated electronic structure at different geometries, we infer the multi-state energies, forces and nonadiabatic coupling vectors at 12,000 geometries with provable convergence to high accuracy along an ensemble of molecular trajectories, which would not be feasible with a brute force approach. This opens up a route to bridge the timescales between accurate single-point correlated electronic structure methods and timescales of relevance for photo-induced molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Tangent space generators of matrix product states and exact Floquet quantum scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of quantum simulators motivates the development of a theoretical framework to assist with efficient state preparation in quantum many-body systems. Generally, preparing a target entangled state via unitary evolution with time-dependent couplings is a challenging task and very little is known about the existence of solutions and their properties. In this work we develop a constructive approach for preparing matrix product states (MPS) via continuous unitary evolution. We provide an explicit construction of the operator which exactly implements the evolution of a given MPS along a specified direction in its tangent space. This operator can be written as a sum of local terms of finite range, yet it is in general non-Hermitian. Relying on the explicit construction of the non-Hermitian generator of the dynamics, we demonstrate the existence of a Hermitian sequence of operators that implements the desired MPS evolution with the error which decreases exponentially with the operator range. The construction is benchmarked on an explicit periodic trajectory in a translationally invariant MPS manifold. We demonstrate that the Floquet unitary generating the dynamics over one period of the trajectory features an approximate MPS-like eigenstate embedded among a sea of thermalizing eigenstates. These results show that our construction is useful not only for state preparation and control of many-body systems, but also provides a generic route towards Floquet scars -- periodically driven models with quasi-local generators of dynamics that have exact MPS eigenstates in their spectrum.</description>

      <title>The Lyapunov exponent as a signature of dissipative many-body quantum chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A distinct feature of Hermitian quantum chaotic dynamics is the exponential increase of certain out-of-time-order-correlation (OTOC) functions around the Ehrenfest time with a rate given by a Lyapunov exponent. Physically, the OTOCs describe the growth of quantum uncertainty that crucially depends on the nature of the quantum motion. Here, we employ the OTOC in order to provide a precise definition of dissipative quantum chaos. For this purpose, we compute analytically the Lyapunov exponent for the vectorized formulation of the large $q$-limit of a $q$-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model coupled to a Markovian bath. These analytic results are confirmed by an explicit numerical calculation of the Lyapunov exponent for several values of $q \geq 4$ based on the solutions of the Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations. We show that the Lyapunov exponent decreases monotonically as the coupling to the bath increases and eventually becomes negative at a critical value of the coupling signaling a transition to a dynamics which is no longer quantum chaotic. Therefore, a positive Lyapunov exponent is a defining feature of dissipative many-body quantum chaos. The observation of the breaking of the exponential growth for sufficiently strong coupling suggests that dissipative quantum chaos may require in certain cases a sufficiently weak coupling to the environment.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics, anomaly inflow and bosonic effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Euler hydrodynamics of perfect fluids can be viewed as an effective bosonic field theory. In cases when the underlying microscopic system involves Dirac fermions, the quantum anomalies should be properly described. In 1+1 dimensions the action formulation of hydrodynamics at zero temperature is reconsidered and shown to be equal to standard field-theory bosonization. Furthermore, it can be derived from a topological gauge theory in one extra dimension, which identifies the fluid variables through the anomaly inflow relations. Extending this framework to 3+1 dimensions yields an effective field theory/hydrodynamics model, capable of elucidating the mixed axial-vector and axial-gravitational anomalies of Dirac fermions. This formulation provides a platform for bosonization in higher dimensions. Moreover, the connection with 4+1 dimensional topological theories suggests some generalizations of fluid dynamics involving additional degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Effects of forward disorder on quasi-1D superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between disorder and singlet superconductivity in a quasi-1d system. We investigate the applicability of the Anderson theorem, namely that time-reversal conserving (non-magnetic) disorder does not impact the critical temperature, by opposition to time-reversal breaking disorder (magnetic). To do so we examine a quasi-1d system of spin 1/2 fermions with attractive interactions and forward scattering disorder using field theory (bosonization). By computing the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$), we find that for non-magnetic disorder the Anderson theorem also holds in the quasi-1D geometry. On the contrary, magnetic disorder has an impact on the critical temperature, that we investigate by deriving renormalization group (RG) equations describing the competition between the disorder and the interactions. Computing the critical temperature as a function of disorder strength, we see that different regimes arise depending on the strength of interactions. We discuss possible platforms where to observe this in cold atoms and condensed matter.</description>

      <title>An example of the convergence of hydrodynamics in strong external fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence is used to provide an estimate of the radius of convergence of the linearized gradient expansion of the hydrodynamic description of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory minimally coupled to $U(1)$ gauge theory subjected to strong magnetic fields. The results of this work demonstrate that the dispersion relations of hydrodynamic modes continue to converge for magnetic field strengths far beyond those values for which a hydrodynamic description is expected. For magnetic field strengths much larger then the temperature scale the bulk dual interpolates between AdS$_{4+1}$ and $\text{BTZ}_{2+1}\times \mathbb{R}^2$ and may be regarded as a renormalization group flow of the $3+1$ CFT dimensional theory to a $1+1$ CFT. In this regime, we clarify past literature on the QNM spectrum of bulk scalar fields by introducing a new way to classify the behavior of QNM collisions in the complex frequency and momentum plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a Floquet circuit describing the driven Ising chain with topological defects. The corresponding gates include a defect that flips spins as well as the duality defect that explicitly implements the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. The Floquet unitary evolution operator commutes with such defects, but the duality defect is not unitary, as it projects out half the states. We give two applications of these defects. One is to analyze the return amplitudes in the presence of "space-like" defects stretching around the system. We verify explicitly that the return amplitudes are in agreement with the fusion rules of the defects. The second application is to study unitary evolution in the presence of "time-like" defects that implement anti-periodic and duality-twisted boundary conditions. We show that a single unpaired localized Majorana zero mode appears in the latter case. We explicitly construct this operator, which acts as a symmetry of this Floquet circuit. We also present analytic expressions for the entanglement entropy after a single time step for a system of a few sites, for all of the above defect configurations.</description>

      <title>Intersite Coulomb repulsion driven quadrupole instability and magnetic ordering in the orbital frustrated Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an unrestricted Hartree-Fock mean-field method including Coulomb repulsion $U$, $V$ and spin-orbital coupling $\lambda$ self-consistently to investigate the mechanism of structural instability and magnetic ordering in Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$. A comprehensive quadrupole phase diagram versus $U$ and $V$ with $\lambda$=0.28eV is calculated. Our results demonstrate that the easy-plane anisotropy and the intersite Coulomb repulsion $V$ must be considered to remove the orbital frustration. The increasing of $V$ to $&gt;$20meV would arrange quadrupole $Q_{x^2-y^2}$ antiparallelly, accompanied with small parallel $Q_{3z^2-r^2}$, and stabilize Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ into the body-centered tetragonal structure. Such antiparallel $Q_{x^2-y^2}$ provides a new mechanism of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and gives rise to the canted antiferromagnetic (CAF) state along [110] axis. Moreover, sizable octupoles such as $O_{21}^{31}$, $O_{21}^{33}$, $O_{21}^{34}$ and $O_{21}^{36}$ are discovered for the first time in CAF state. Our study not only provides a comprehensive understanding of the experiment results in Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$, but also reveals some commonalities of 5d compounds.</description>

      <title>Electrical control of spin and valley in spin-orbit coupled graphene multilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrical control of magnetism has been a major techonogical pursuit of the spintronics community, owing to its far-reaching implications for data storage and transmission. Here, we propose and analyze a new mechanism for electrical switching of isospin, using chiral-stacked graphene multilayers, such as bernal bilayer graphene or rhombohedral trilayer graphene, encapsulated by transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) substrates. Leveraging the proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling from the TMD, we demonstrate electrical switching of correlation-induced spin and/or valley polarization, by reversing a perpendicular displacement field or the chemical potential. We substantiate our proposal with both analytical arguments and self-consistent Hartree-Fock numerics. Finally, we illustrate how the relative alignment of the TMDs, together with the top and bottom gate voltages, can be used to selectively switch distinct isospin flavors, putting forward correlated van der Waals heterostructures as a promising platform for spintronics and valleytronics.</description>

Abstract: Boundaries of Walker-Wang models have been used to construct commuting projector models which realize chiral unitary modular tensor categories (UMTCs) as boundary excitations. Given a UMTC $\mathcal{A}$ representing the Witt class of an anomaly, the article [arXiv:2208.14018] gave a commuting projector model associated to an $\mathcal{A}$-enriched unitary fusion category $\mathcal{X}$ on a 2D boundary of the 3D Walker-Wang model associated to $\mathcal{A}$. That article claimed that the boundary excitations were given by the enriched center/M\"uger centralizer $Z^\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{X})$ of $\mathcal{A}$ in $Z(\mathcal{X})$.
  In this article, we give a rigorous treatment of this 2D boundary model, and we verify this assertion using topological quantum field theory (TQFT) techniques, including skein modules and a certain semisimple algebra whose representation category describes boundary excitations. We also use TQFT techniques to show the 3D bulk point excitations of the Walker-Wang bulk are given by the M\"uger center $Z_2(\mathcal{A})$, and we construct bulk-to-boundary hopping operators $Z_2(\mathcal{A})\to Z^{\mathcal{A}}(\mathcal{X})$ reflecting how the UMTC of boundary excitations $Z^{\mathcal{A}}(\mathcal{X})$ is symmetric-braided enriched in $Z_2(\mathcal{A})$.
  This article also includes a self-contained comprehensive review of the Levin-Wen string net model from a unitary tensor category viewpoint, as opposed to the skeletal $6j$ symbol viewpoint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic collective modes are ubiquitous in metals, but over a wide range of energy and momenta suffer from Landau damping, decaying into the continuum of particle-hole excitations. Here we point out that interactions can suppress this decay, protecting a finite fraction of the total spectral weight associated with the collective mode, e.g. a plasmon. The underlying mechanism is level repulsion between a discrete mode and the continuum. We demonstrate the effect using a number of simplified models of strongly correlated Fermi-liquid metals, including a ``solvable" random flavor model in the large$-N$ limit. We discuss in detail the possibility of observing such an avoided decay for plasmons in (moir\'e) graphene-like systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in material design enables the study of correlated, low-temperature phases and associated anomalous transport in two-dimensional kagome systems. Here, we show that unconventional spin transport can arise in such systems even at elevated temperatures due to emergent dynamical constraints. To demonstrate this effect, we consider a strong-coupling limit of an extended Hubbard model on the kagome lattice with density of $2/3$. We numerically investigate the charge and spin transport by a cellular automaton circuit, allowing us to perform simulations on large systems to long times while preserving the essential conservation laws. The charge dynamics reflects the constraints and can be understood by a Gaussian field theory of a scalar height field. Moreover, the system exhibits a hidden spin conservation law with a dynamic sublattice structure, which enables additional slow relaxation pathways for spin excitations. These features can be directly tested by measuring the dynamic spin structure factor with neutron scattering.</description>

Abstract: We found a plateau in the magnitude of the isolated magnetic moments as a function of the anisotropy of the transfer integral (t'/t) in the gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase of an S=1/2 triangular lattice molecular solid X[Pd(dmit)2]2 (dmit = 1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate), accomplished by a fine-tuning of t'/t through the mixing of cations, X. In contrast, the magnetic susceptibility at the lowest temperature in the QSL phase parametrized by t'/t evinces an unconventional suppression approaching the quantum phase transition, implying significant critical fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11823v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum many-body problem is an important topic in condensed matter physics. To efficiently solve the problem, several methods have been developped to improve the representation ability of wave-functions.For the Fermi-Hubbard model, current state-of-the-art methods are neural network backflows and the hidden fermion Slater determinant. The backflow correction is an efficient way to improve the Slater determinant of free-particles. In this work we propose a tensor representation of the backflow corrected wave-function, we show that for the spinless $t$-$V$ model, the energy precision is competitive or even lower than current state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For models with spin, we further improve the representation ability by considering non-zero backflow corrections on different spins between the orbital and the particle. We benchmark on molecules under STO-3G basis and the Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic and cylindrical boudary conditions. We show that our methods achieve competitive or even lower energy results than current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: Like air flowing over a wing, optimizing the flow of electronic charge is essential to the operation of nanoscale devices. Unfortunately, the delicate interplay of charge, spin, and heat in complex devices has precluded detailed imaging of charge flow. Here, we report on the visualization of intrinsic charge current streamlines through yttrium iron garnet micromagnetic heterostructures. Scanning photovoltage microscopy of precisely designed devices leads to striking spatial patterns, with prominent photovoltage features emerging in corners and narrow constrictions. These patterns, which evolve continuously with rotation of an external magnetic field, enable rich spatial mapping of fluid-like flow. Taking inspiration from aerodynamic Clark Y airfoils, we engineer micromagnetic wing shaped devices, called electrofoils, which allow us to precisely contort, compress and decompress flowlines of electronic charge.120 (39) e2221815120</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films grown by pulsed laser deposition, we report a combined structural and magnetotransport study of thin films and Hall bar devices patterned side-by-side on the same film. Structural properties of these films are investigated using X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and confirm that these films are epitaxially oriented and nearly phase pure. For magnetic fields applied along the $c-$axis, a positive magnetoresistance of 10\% is measured for unpatterned Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films, whereas for patterned Hall bar devices of channel widths of $10$ and $5\, \mu$m, magnetoresistance values of 40\% and 140\% are found, respectively. These films show switching behaviors from positive to negative magnetoresistance that are controlled by the direction of the applied magnetic field. The present results provide a promising route for achieving stable epitaxial synthesis of intermediate members of correlated layered strontium ruthenates, and for the exploration of device physics in thin films of these compounds.</description>

      <title>Higher-order topological corner and bond-localized modes in magnonic insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a two-dimensional decorated honeycomb lattice framework to realize a second-order topological magnon insulator (SOTMI) phase featuring distinct corner-localized modes. Our study emphasizes the pivotal role of spin-magnon mapping in characterizing bosonic topological properties, which exhibit differences from their fermionic counterparts. We employ a symmetry indicator topological invariant to identify and characterize this SOTMI phase, particularly for systems respecting time-reversal and ${\sf{C}}_6$ rotational symmetry. Using a spin model defined on a honeycomb lattice geometry, we demonstrate that introducing ``\textit{kekul\'e}'' type distortions yields a topological phase. In contrast, ``\textit{anti-kekul\'e}'' distortions result in a non-topological magnonic phase. The presence of kekul\'e distortions manifests in two distinct topologically protected bosonic corner modes - an \textit{intrinsic} and a \textit{pseudo}, based on the specific edge terminations. On the other hand, anti-kekul\'e distortions give rise to \SW{\textit{Tamm/Shockley}} type bond-localized boundary modes, which are non-topological and reliant on particular edge termination. We further investigate the effects of random out-of-plane exchange anisotropy disorder on the robustness of these bosonic corner modes. The distinction between SOTMIs and their fermionic counterparts arises due to the system-specific magnonic onsite energies, a crucial feature often overlooked in prior literature. Our study unveils exciting prospects for engineering higher-order topological phases in magnon systems and enhances our understanding of their unique behavior within decorated honeycomb lattices.</description>

      <title>The $GW$ Approximation: A Quantum Chemistry Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an in-depth examination of the $GW$ approximation of Green's function many-body perturbation theory by detailing both its theoretical and practical aspects in the realm of quantum chemistry. First, the quasiparticle context is introduced before delving into the derivation of Hedin's equations. From these, we explain how to derive the well-known $GW$ approximation of the self-energy. In a second time, we meticulously explain each step involved in a $GW$ calculation and what type of physical quantities can be computed. To illustrate its versatility, we consider two contrasting systems: the water molecule, a weakly correlated system, and the carbon dimer, a strongly correlated system. Each stage of the process is thoroughly detailed and explained alongside numerical results and illustrative plots. We hope that the contribution will facilitate the dissemination and democratization of Green's function-based formalisms within the computational and theoretical quantum chemistry community.</description>

      <title>Theory of magnetic excitations in multilayer nickelate superconductor La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent reports of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we analyzed theoretically the magnetic excitations in the normal and the superconducting state in this compound, which can be measured by inelastic neutron scattering or RIXS. We show that the bilayer structure of the spin response allows to elucidate the role of the interlayer interaction and the nature of the Cooper-pairing in a very efficient way. In particular, we demonstrate the key difference between the potential $s_\pm$ and $d$-wave gaps, proposed recently, by comparing the corresponding response in the even and odd channels of the spin susceptibility. We show that the mostly interlayer driven bonding-antibonding $s_\pm$ Cooper-pairing produces a single large spin resonance peak in the odd channel only near the $X$ point whereas spin resonances in both the odd and the even channel are predicted for the $d$-wave scenario.</description>

      <title>Higher vortexability: zero field realization of higher Landau levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of moir\'{e} materials has led to experimental realizations of integer and fractional Chern insulators in small or vanishing magnetic fields. At the same time, a set of minimal conditions sufficient to guarantee a Abelian fractional state in a flat band were identified, namely "ideal" or "vortexable" quantum geometry. Such vortexable bands share essential features with the lowest Landau level, while excluding the need for more fine-tuned aspects such as flat Berry curvature. A natural and important generalization is to ask if such conditions can be extended to capture the quantum geometry of higher Landau levels, particularly the first (1LL), where non-Abelian states at $\nu = 1/2,2/5$ are known to be competitive. The possibility of realizing these states at zero magnetic field , and perhaps even more exotic ones, could become a reality if we could identify the essential structure of the 1LL in Chern bands. In this work, we introduce a precise definition of 1LL quantum geometry, along with a figure of merit that measures how closely a given band approaches the 1LL. We apply the definition to identify two models with 1LL structure -- a toy model of double bilayer twisted graphene and a more realistic model of strained Bernal graphene.</description>

      <title>Operator size growth in Lindbladian SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of operator size in the Lindbladian SYK model with $q$-body interaction terms and linear jump terms at finite dissipation strength. We compute the operator size as well as its distribution numerically at finite $q$ and analytically at large $q$. With dissipative (productive) jump terms, the size converges to a value smaller (larger) than half the number of Majorana fermions. At weak dissipation, the evolution of operator size displays a quadratic-exponential-plateau behavior. The plateau value is determined by the ratios between the coupling of the interaction and the linear jump term in the large $q$ limit. The operator size distribution remains localized in the finite size region even at late times, contrasting with the unitary case. Moreover, we also derived the time-independent orthogonal basis for operator expansion which exhibits the operator size concentration at finite dissipation. Finally, we observe that the uncertainty relation for operator size growth is saturated at large $q$, leading to a classical dynamics of the operator size growth with dissipation.</description>

      <title>Reweight-annealing method for calculating the value of partition function via quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate algorithm for partition function, free energy and thermal entropy calculations is of great significance in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics. Here we present an unbiased but low-technical-barrier algorithm within the quantum Monte Carlo framework, which has exceptionally high accuracy and no systemic error. Compared with the conventional specific heat integral method and Wang-Landau sampling algorithm, our method can obtain a much more accurate result of the sub-leading coefficient of the entropy. This method can be widely used in both classical and quantum Monte Carlo simulations and is easy to be parallelized on computer.</description>
