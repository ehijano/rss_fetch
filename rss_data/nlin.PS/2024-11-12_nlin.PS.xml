      <title>Quartic soliton solutions of a normal dispersion based mode-locked laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the characteristics, regions of existence and stability of different types of solitons for a distributed model of a mode-locked laser whose dispersion is purely quartic and normal. Among the different types of solitons, we identified three main branches that are named according to their different amplitude: low, medium and high amplitude solitons. It was found that the first solitons are always unstable while the latter two exist and are stable in relatively large regions of the parameter space. Moreover, the stability regions of medium and high amplitude solitons overlap over a certain range of parameters, manifesting effects of bistability. The energy of high amplitude solitons increases quadratically with their width, whereas the energy of medium amplitude solitons may decrease or increase with the width depending on the parameter region. Furthermore, we have investigated the long term evolution of the continuous wave solutions under modulational instability, showing that medium amplitude solitons can arise in this scenario. Additionally, we assessed the effects of second and third order dispersion on medium and high amplitude solitons and found that both remain stable in the presence of these terms.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous modulational instability of elliptic periodic waves: the soliton condensate model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the spectral theory of soliton gas for the one-dimensional focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (fNLSE) to describe the statistically stationary and spatially homogeneous integrable turbulence emerging at large times from the evolution of the spontaneous (noise-induced) modulational instability of the elliptic ``dn'' fNLSE solutions. We show that a special, critically dense, soliton gas, namely the genus one bound-state soliton condensate, represents an accurate model of the asymptotic state of the ``elliptic'' integrable turbulence. This is done by first analytically evaluating the relevant spectral density of states which is then used for implementing the soliton condensate numerically via a random N-soliton ensemble with N large. A comparison of the statistical parameters, such as the Fourier spectrum, the probability density function of the wave intensity, and the autocorrelation function of the intensity, of the soliton condensate with the results of direct numerical fNLSE simulations with dn initial data augmented by a small statistically uniform random perturbation (a noise) shows a remarkable agreement. Additionally, we analytically compute the kurtosis of the elliptic integrable turbulence, which enables one to estimate the deviation from Gaussianity. The analytical predictions of the kurtosis values, including the frequency of its temporal oscillations at the intermediate stage of the modulational instability development, are also shown to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations for the entire range of the elliptic parameter $m$ of the initial dn potential.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of neuromorphic dynamics from a single scalar time series using variational autoencoder and neural network map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the reconstruction of a family of dynamical systems with neuromorphic behavior using a single scalar time series. A model of a physiological neuron based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism is considered. Single time series of one of its variables is shown to be enough to train a neural network that can operate as a discrete time dynamical system with one control parameter. The neural network system is created in two steps. First, the delay-coordinate embedding vectors are constructed form the original time series and their dimension is reduced with by means of a variational autoencoder to obtain the recovered state-space vectors. It is shown that an appropriate reduced dimension can be determined by analyzing the autoencoder training process. Second, pairs of the recovered state-space vectors at consecutive time steps supplied with a constant value playing the role of a control parameter are used to train another neural network to make it operate as a recurrent map. The regimes of thus created neural network system observed when its control parameter is varied are in very good accordance with those of the original system, though they were not explicitly presented during training.</description>

      <title>Thermal lifetime of breathers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the lifetime of localized excitations in nonlinear lattices, called breathers, when a thermalized lattice is perturbed with localized energy delivered to a single site. We develop a method to measure the time it takes for the system to approach equilibrium based on a single scalar quantity, the participation number, and deduce the value corresponding to thermal equilibrium. We observe the time to achieve thermalization as a function of the energy of the excited site. We explore a variety of different physical system models. The result is that the lifetime of breathers increases exponentially with the breather energy for all the systems. These results may provide a method to detect the existence of breathers in real systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric thermodynamics of reaction-diffusion systems: Thermodynamic trade-off relations and optimal transport for pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish universal relations between pattern formation and dissipation with a geometric approach to nonequilibrium thermodynamics of deterministic reaction-diffusion systems. We first provide a way to systematically decompose the entropy production rate (EPR) based on the orthogonality of thermodynamic forces, in this way identifying the amount of dissipation caused by each factor. This enables us to extract the excess EPR that genuinely contributes to the time evolution of patterns. We also show that a similar geometric method further decomposes the EPR into detailed contributions, e.g., the dissipation from each point in real or wavenumber space. Second, we relate the excess EPR to the details of the change in patterns through two types of thermodynamic trade-off relations for reaction-diffusion systems: thermodynamic speed limits and thermodynamic uncertainty relations. The former relates dissipation and the speed of pattern formation, and the latter bounds the excess EPR with partial information on patterns, such as specific Fourier components of concentration distributions. In connection with the derivation of the thermodynamic speed limits, we also extend optimal transport theory to reaction-diffusion systems, which enables us to measure the speed of the time evolution. This extension of optimal transport also solves the minimization problem of the dissipation associated with the transition between two patterns, and it constructs energetically efficient protocols for pattern formation. We numerically demonstrate our results using chemical traveling waves in the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov equation and changes in symmetry in the Brusselator model. Our results apply to general reaction-diffusion systems and contribute to understanding the relations between pattern formation and unavoidable dissipation.</description>
