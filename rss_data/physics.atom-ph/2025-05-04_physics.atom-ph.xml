      <title>Forces on alkali Rydberg atoms due to non-linearly polarized light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped Rydberg atoms are highly promising candidates for quantum science experiments. While several approaches have been put forward to exert (trapping) forces on isolated Rydberg atoms, a widely applicable lossless technique is lacking. This paper proposes a robust versatile alternative technique that avoids lifetime compromising losses. Our proposal leverages the vector polarizability, which is induced by non-linearly polarized light and is shown to be several orders of magnitude larger than the usual scalar and tensor polarizabilities for commonly used alkali Rydberg series such as the $nS$, $nP$, and $nD$ series with principal quantum number $n$ as low as 30. The resulting force can be used to trap isolated Rydberg atoms over long times, which constitutes a key advance that is expected to impact quantum simulation applications, as well as to generate large light--Rydberg-atom hybrid states, which possess non-trivial position-dependent forces.</description>

      <title>Excitation spectrum of vortex-lattice modes in a rotating condensate with a density-dependent gauge potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collective excitation spectrum of a quasi-2D Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in a harmonic confinement with nonlinear rotation induced by a density-dependent gauge field. Using a Bogoliubov-de Gennes(BdG) analysis, we show that the dipole mode frequency depends strongly on the nonlinear interaction strength, violating Kohn's theorem. Further utilizing the variational analysis, we derive analytical expressions for the dipole and breathing modes, which suggests a strong dependence of the condensate's width on the nonlinear rotation resulting from the density-dependent gauge potential. We identify four different vortex displacement modes -- namely Tkachenko, circular, quadratic, and rational-whose frequencies are sensitive to the nonlinear rotation. In addition to the numerical analysis, we also derive an analytical expression for the Tkachenko mode frequency using a Hydrodynamic approach that agrees well with the frequencies obtained by the Fourier analysis of the transverse and longitudinal vortex dynamics induced by a Gaussian perturbation as well as the frequencies from the BdG excitation spectrum. Our findings also reveal that the excitation spectrum remain symmetric around the angular quantum number $l=0$, with modified energy splitting between $l$ and $-l$ as the nonlinear rotation changes from negative to positive values. Finally, we demonstrate that the surface mode excitation frequency increases (decreases) with an increase in the positive (negative) nonlinear rotation strength.</description>

      <title>Interplay of asymmetry and fragmentation in the many-body tunneling dynamics of two-dimensional bosonic Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the many-body tunneling of a bosonic condensate leads to (longitudinal) fragmentation along the tunneling direction. In this work, we prepare the initial ground state as a (transversely) fragmented system by introducing a barrier oriented orthogonally to the tunneling direction and allow it to tunnel through a two-dimensional longitudinally and transversely-asymmetric bosonic Josephson junctions. For a fixed barrier height, we find that the initial transversal fragmentation is essentially independent of the asymmetry along the tunneling direction but reduces when the asymmetry is oriented orthogonally to the junction. We investigate the interplay between the interference of fragmentations and asymmetry in the junction by analyzing the rate of density collapse in the survival probability, the uncertainty product, and the nontrivial dynamics of the occupation of the first excited orbital. The interference of fragmentations is quantified by the ratio between the reduction of transverse fragmentation and the development of longitudinal fragmentation. We show that asymmetry along the junction (orthogonal to the junction) delays (accelerates), compared to the symmetric potential, in obtaining the maximal interference of fragmentations. Notably, self-trapping opposes the interference, whereas a resonant tunneling condition enhances it. Overall, we demonstrate that the influence of asymmetry on the competition between longitudinal and transversal fragmentations, which together govern the macroscopic tunneling dynamics of interacting bosons, arises purely from the many-body effects and has no counterpart in the mean-field theory.</description>

      <title>Accelerating point defect photo-emission calculations with machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a computational framework leveraging universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to dramatically accelerate the calculation of photoluminescence (PL) spectra of atomic or molecular emitters with \emph{ab initio} accuracy. By replacing the costly density functional theory (DFT) computation of phonon modes with much faster MLIP phonon mode calculations, our approach achieves speed improvements exceeding an order of magnitude with minimal precision loss. We benchmark the approach using a dataset comprising \emph{ab initio} emission spectra of 791 color centers spanning various types of crystal point defects in different charge and magnetic states. The method is also applied to a molecular emitter adsorbed on a hexagonal boron nitride surface. Across all the systems, we find excellent agreement for both the Huang-Rhys factor and the PL lineshapes. This application of universal MLIPs bridges the gap between computational efficiency and spectroscopic fidelity, opening pathways to high-throughput screening of defect-engineered materials. Our work not only demonstrates accelerated calculation of PL spectra with DFT accuracy, but also makes such calculations tractable for more complex materials.</description>

      <title>Collection of fluorescence from an ion using trap-integrated photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneously emitted photons are entangled with the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom of the emitting atom, so interference and measurement of these photons can entangle separate matter-based quantum systems as a resource for quantum information processing. However, the isotropic nature of spontaneous emission hinders the single-mode photonic operations required to generate entanglement. Current demonstrations rely on bulk photon-collection and manipulation optics that suffer from environment-induced phase instability, mode matching challenges, and system-to-system variability, factors that impede scaling to the large numbers of entangled pairs needed for quantum information processing. To address these limitations, we demonstrate a collection method that enables passive phase stability, straightforward photonic manipulation, and intrinsic reproducibility. Specifically, we engineer a waveguide-integrated grating to couple photons emitted from a trapped ion into a single optical mode within a microfabricated ion-trap chip. Using the integrated collection optic, we characterize the collection efficiency, image the ion, and detect the ion's quantum state. This proof-of-principle demonstration lays the foundation for leveraging the inherent stability and reproducibility of integrated photonics to efficiently create, manipulate, and measure multipartite quantum states in arrays of quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Bright and Dark States of Light: The quantum Origin of Classical Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical theory asserts that several electromagnetic waves cannot interact with matter if they interfere destructively to zero, whereas quantum mechanics predicts a nontrivial light-matter dynamics even when the average electric field vanishes. Here we show that in quantum optics classical interference emerges from collective bright and dark states of light, \textit{i.e.}, entangled superpositions of multi-mode photon-number states. This makes it possible to explain wave interference using the particle description of light and the superposition principle for linear systems.</description>

      <title>Substantial precision enhancements via adaptive symmetry-informed Bayesian metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements are essential for addressing major challenges, ranging from gravitational wave detection to healthcare diagnostics. While quantum sensing experiments are constantly improving to deliver greater precision, the in-depth optimisation of measurement procedures beyond phase estimation has been overlooked. Here we present a systematic strategy for parameter estimation that can be applied across a wide range of experimental platforms operating in the low data limit. Its strength is the inclusion of experimental control parameters, which allows optimisation within a Bayesian procedure and adaptive repetition. We provide general expressions for the optimal estimator and error for any parameter amenable to symmetry-informed strategies. We demonstrate the power of this strategy by applying it to atom number estimation in a quantum technology experiment. Our protocol results in a five-fold reduction in the fractional variance of the atom number estimate compared to a standard, unoptimized protocol. Equivalently, it achieves the target precision with a third of the data points previously required. The enhanced device performance and accelerated data collection achieved with this Bayesian optimised strategy will be essential for applications in quantum computing, communication, metrology, and the wider quantum technology sector.</description>
