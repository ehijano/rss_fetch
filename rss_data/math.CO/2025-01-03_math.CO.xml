      <title>Oriented Matroid Circuit Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matroids give rise to several natural constructions of polytopes. Inspired by this, we examine polytopes that arise from the signed circuits of an oriented matroid. We give the dimensions of these polytopes arising from graphical oriented matroids and their duals. Moreover, we consider polytopes constructed from cocircuits of oriented matroids generated by the positive roots in any type A root system. We give an explicit description of their face structure and determine the Ehrhart series. We also study an action of the symmetric group on these polytopes, giving a full description the subpolytopes fixed by each permutation. These type A polytopes are graphic zonotopes, are polar duals of symmetric edge polytopes, and also make an appearance in Stapledon's paper introducing Equivariant Ehrhart Theory.</description>

      <title>Loops with involution and the Cayley-Dickson doubling process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of loops with involution. On this basis we define a Cayley-Dickson doubling on loops, and use it to investigate the lattice of varieties of loops with involution, focusing on properties that remain valid in the Cayley-Dickson double. Specializing to central-by-abelian loops with elementary abelian $2$-group quotients, we find conditions under which one can characterize the automorphism groups of iterated Cayley-Dickson doubles. A key result is a corrected proof that for $n&gt;3$, the automorphism group of the Cayley-Dickson loop $Q_n$ is $\text{GL}_3(\mathbb{F}_2) \times \{\pm 1\}^{n-3}$.</description>

      <title>A Demigod's Number for the Rubik's Cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known by now that any state of the $3\times 3 \times 3$ Rubik's Cube can be solved in at most 20 moves, a result often referred to as "God's Number". However, this result took Rokicki et al. around 35 CPU years to prove and is therefore very challenging to reproduce.
  We provide a novel approach to obtain a worse bound of 36 moves with high confidence, but that offers two main advantages: (i) it is easy to understand, reproduce, and verify, and (ii) our main idea generalizes to bounding the diameter of other vertex-transitive graphs by at most twice its true value, hence the name "demigod number".
  Our approach is based on the fact that, for vertex-transitive graphs, the average distance between vertices is at most half the diameter, and by sampling uniformly random states and using a modern solver to obtain upper bounds on their distance, a standard concentration bound allows us to confidently state that the average distance is around $18.32 \pm 0.1$, from where the diameter is at most $36$.</description>

      <title>Alon-Tarsi for hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a hypergraph $H=(V,E)$, define for every edge $e\in E$ a linear expression with arguments corresponding with the vertices. Next, let the polynomial $p_H$ be the product of such linear expressions for all edges. Our main goal was to find a relationship between the Alon-Tarsi number of $p_H$ and the edge density of $H$. We prove that $AT(p_H)=\lceil ed(H)\rceil+1$ if all the coefficients in $p_H$ are equal to $1$. Our main result is that, no matter what those coefficients are, they can be permuted within the edges so that for the resulting polynomial $p_H^\prime$, $AT(p_H^\prime)\leq 2\lceil ed(H)\rceil+1$ holds. We conjecture that, in fact, permuting the coefficients is not necessary. If this were true, then in particular a significant generalization of the famous 1-2-3 Conjecture would follow.</description>

      <title>A geometric interpretation of the Delta Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a variety $Y_{n,k}$, which we call the \textit{affine $\Delta$-Springer fiber}, generalizing the affine Springer fiber studied by Hikita, whose Borel-Moore homology has an $S_n$ action and a bigrading that corresponds to the Delta Conjecture symmetric function $\mathrm{rev}_q\,\omega \Delta'_{e_{k-1}}e_n$ under the Frobenius character map. We similarly provide a geometric interpretation for the Rational Shuffle Theorem in the integer slope case $(km,k)$. The variety $Y_{n,k}$ has a map to the affine Grassmannian whose fibers are the $\Delta$-Springer fibers introduced by Levinson, Woo, and the third author. Part of our proof of our geometric realization relies on our previous work on a Schur skewing operator formula relating the Rational Shuffle Theorem to the Delta Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Further results for classical and universal characters twisted by roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit factorizations of classical characters under various specializations, some old and some new. We first show that all characters of classical families of groups twisted by odd powers of an even primitive root of unity factorize into products of characters of smaller groups. Motivated by conjectures of Wagh and Prasad (Manuscr. Math. 2020), we then observe that certain specializations of Schur polynomials factor into products of two characters of other groups. We next show, via a detour through hook Schur polynomials, that certain Schur polynomials indexed by staircase shapes factorize into linear pieces. Lastly, we consider classical and universal characters specialized at roots of unity. One of our results, in parallel with Schur polynomials, is that universal characters take values only in $\{0, \pm 1, \pm 2\}$ at roots of unity.</description>

      <title>Bijections around Springer numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arnol'd proved in 1992 that Springer numbers enumerate the Snakes, which are type $B$ analogs of alternating permutations. Chen, Fan and Jia in 2011 introduced the labeled ballot paths and established a ``hard'' bijection with snakes. Callan conjectured in 2012 and Han--Kitaev--Zhang proved recently that rc-invariant alternating permutations are counted by Springer numbers. Very recently, Chen--Fang--Kitaev--Zhang investigated multi-dimensional permutations and proved that weakly increasing $3$-dimensional permutations are also counted by Springer numbers. In this work, we construct a sequence of ``natural'' bijections linking the above four combinatorial objects.</description>

      <title>Joint equidistributions of mesh patterns 123 and 321 with symmetric and antipodal shadings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the number of 123-avoiding and 321-avoiding permutations is the same, and these numbers correspond to the Catalan numbers. However, patterns 123 and 321 are not equidistributed. In the context of mesh patterns, patterns formed by the permutations 123 and 321 with identical shadings are sometimes jointly equidistributed. In this paper, we prove 20 joint equidistributions of mesh patterns 123 and 321 with symmetric shadings, and 36 joint equidistributions of the same patterns with antipodal shadings.</description>

      <title>Solution to a $3$-path isolation problem for subcubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $3$-path isolation number of a connected $n$-vertex graph $G$, denoted by $\iota(G,P_3)$, is the size of a smallest subset $D$ of the vertex set of $G$ such that the closed neighbourhood $N[D]$ of $D$ in $G$ intersects each $3$-vertex path of $G$, meaning that no two edges of $G-N[D]$ intersect. If $G$ is not a $3$-path or a $3$-cycle or a $6$-cycle, then $\iota(G,P_3) \leq 2n/7$. This was proved by Zhang and Wu, and independently by Borg in a slightly extended form. The bound is attained by infinitely many graphs having induced $6$-cycles. Huang, Zhang and Jin showed that if $G$ has no $6$-cycles, or $G$ has no induced $5$-cycles and no induced $6$-cycles, then $\iota(G,P_3) \leq n/4$ unless $G$ is a $3$-path or a $3$-cycle or a $7$-cycle or an $11$-cycle. They asked if the bound still holds asymptotically for connected graphs having no induced $6$-cycles. Thus, the problem essentially is whether induced $6$-cycles solely account for the difference between the two bounds. In this paper, we solve this problem for subcubic graphs, which need to be treated differently from other graphs. We show that if $G$ is subcubic and has no induced $6$-cycles, then $\iota(G,P_3) \leq n/4$ unless $G$ is a copy of one of $12$ particular graphs whose orders are $3$, $7$, $11$ and $15$. The bound is sharp.</description>

      <title>Edit distance in substitution systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\sigma$ be a primitive substitution on an alphabet $\mathcal{A}$, and let $\mathcal{W}_n$ be the set of words of length $n$ determined by $\sigma$ (i.e., $w \in \mathcal{W}_n$ if $w$ is a subword of $\sigma^k(a)$ for some $a \in \mathcal{A}$ and $k \geq 1$). We show that the diameter of $\mathcal{W}_n$ in the edit distance is $o(n)$. Thus, any two words in $\mathcal{W}_n$ have a common subsequence of length $n-o(n)$, which implies that the corresponding substitution dynamical system is loosely Bernoulli. The main challenge is handling the case where $\sigma$ is non-uniform. Finally, we show that for the Thue--Morse substitution, the diameter of $\mathcal{W}_n$ is at least $\sqrt{n/6} - 1$.</description>

      <title>Average-sized miniatures and normal-sized miniatures of lattice polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $d \geq 0$ be an integer and $P \subset \mathbb R^d$ be a $d$-dimensional lattice polytope. We call a polytope $M \subset \mathbb R^d$ such that $M \subset P$ and $M \sim P$ a miniature of $P,$ and it is said to be horizontal if $M$ is transformed into $P$ by translating and rescaling. A miniature $M$ of $P$ is said to be average-sized (resp. normal-sized) if the volume of $M$ is equal to the limit of the sequence whose $n$-th term is the average of the volumes of all miniarures (resp. all horizontal miniatures) whose vertices belong to $(\mathbb Z[1/n])^d.$ We prove that, for any lattice square $P \subset \mathbb R^2,$ the ratio of the areas of an average-sized miniature of $P$ and $P$ is $2:15.$ We also prove that, for any lattice simplex $P \subset \mathbb R^d,$ the ratio of the volumes of a normal-sized miniature of $P$ and $P$ is $1:\binom{2d+1}{d}.$ This ratio is the same as the known result for the hypercube $[0,1]^d$ provided by the author.</description>

      <title>On the extremal number of incidence graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $H$ and a natural number $n$, the extremal number $\mathrm{ex}(n, H)$ is the largest number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph containing no copy of $H$. In this paper, we obtain a general upper bound for the extremal number of generalised face-incidence graphs, a family which includes the standard face-incidence graphs of regular polytopes. This builds on and generalises work of Janzer and Sudakov, who obtained the same bound for hypercubes and bipartite Kneser graphs, and allows us to confirm a conjecture of Conlon and Lee on the extremal number of $K_{r,r}$-free bipartite graphs for certain incidence graphs.
  In their work, Janzer and Sudakov showed that such an upper bound on the extremal number holds whenever the graph $H$ satisfies a certain percolation property which captures an appropriate sequence of repeated applications of the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality, a property which they then verify for hypercubes and bipartite Kneser graphs. This percolation property bears close resemblance to a property that arose in earlier work of Conlon and Lee on weakly norming graphs. In this latter work, Conlon and Lee developed a method for controlling repeated applications of the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality based on the properties of reflection groups, which then allowed them to isolate a broad family of weakly norming graphs. Here, we develop this method further, casting it in a purely algebraic form that allows us not only to combine it with the Janzer--Sudakov result and obtain the desired result about the extremal number of incidence graphs, but also to simplify the proofs of both the Conlon--Lee result on weakly norming graphs and a related result of Coregliano.</description>

      <title>Local Shearer bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the following local strengthening of Shearer's classic bound on the independence number of triangle-free graphs: For every triangle-free graph $G$ there exists a probability distribution on its independent sets such that every vertex $v$ of $G$ is contained in a random independent set drawn from the distribution with probability $(1-o(1))\frac{\ln d(v)}{d(v)}$. This resolves the main conjecture raised by Kelly and Postle (2018) about fractional coloring with local demands, which in turn confirms a conjecture by Cames van Batenburg et al. (2018) stating that every $n$-vertex triangle-free graph has fractional chromatic number at most $(\sqrt{2}+o(1))\sqrt{\frac{n}{\ln(n)}}$. Addressing another conjecture posed by Cames van Batenburg et al., we also establish an analogous upper bound in terms of the number of edges.
  To prove these results we establish a more general technical theorem that works in a weighted setting. As a further application of this more general result, we obtain a new spectral upper bound on the fractional chromatic number of triangle-free graphs: We show that every triangle-free graph $G$ satisfies $\chi_f(G)\le (1+o(1))\frac{\rho(G)}{\ln \rho(G)}$ where $\rho(G)$ denotes the spectral radius. This improves the bound implied by Wilf's classic spectral estimate for the chromatic number by a $\ln \rho(G)$ factor and makes progress towards a conjecture of Harris on fractional coloring of degenerate graphs.</description>

      <title>A Fano framework for embeddings of graphs in surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider seven fundamental properties of cellular embeddings of graphs in compact surfaces, and show that each property can be associated with a point of the Fano plane $F$, in such a way that allowable combinations of properties correspond to projective subspaces of $F$. This Fano framework allows us to deduce a number of implications involving the seven properties, providing new results and unifying existing ones. For each property, we provide a correspondence between embeddings with that property and an associated structure for $4$-regular graphs, using the medial graph of the graph embedding. We apply this to characterize when a graph embedding has a twisted dual with one of the properties. For each allowable combination of properties, we show that a graph embedding with these properties exists. We investigate connections between the seven properties and three weaker `Eulerian' properties. Our proofs involve parity conditions on closed walks in an extended version of the `gem' (graph-encoded map) representation of a graph embedding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seymour's Second Neighborhood Conjecture asserts that in the square of any oriented graph, there exists a node whose out-degree at least doubles. This paper presents a definitive proof of the conjecture by introducing the GLOVER (Graph Level Order) data structure, which facilitates a systematic partitioning of neighborhoods and an analysis of degree-doubling conditions. By leveraging this structure, we construct a decreasing sequence of subsets that establish a well-ordering of nodes, ensuring that no counterexample can exist. This approach not only confirms the conjecture for all oriented graphs but also provides a novel framework for analyzing degrees and arcs in complex networks. The findings have implications for theoretical graph studies and practical applications in network optimization and algorithm design.</description>

      <title>Ihara zeta functions for some simple graph families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reciprocal of the Ihara zeta function of a graph is a polynomial invariant introduced by Ihara in 1966. Scott and Storm gave a method to determine the coefficients of the polynomial. Here we simplify their calculation and determine the zeta function for all graphs of rank two. We verify that it is a complete invariant for such graphs: If $G_1$ and $G_2$ are of rank two, then $G_1$ and $G_2$ are isomorphic if and only if they have the same Ihara zeta function. We observe that the reciprocal of the zeta function is an even polynomial if the graph is bipartite. We also determine the zeta function for several graph families: complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, M\"{o}bius ladders, cocktail party graphs, and all graphs of order five or less. We use the special value $u=1$ to count the spanning trees for these families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript introduces Diophantine labeling, a new way of labeling of the vertices for finite simple undirected graphs with some divisibility condition on the edges. Maximal graphs admitting Diophantine labeling are investigated and their number of edges are computed. Some number-theoretic techniques are used to characterize vertices of maximum degree and nonadjacent vertices. Some necessary and sufficient conditions for vertices of equal degrees are found.</description>

      <title>Boundaries of pseudointegral polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a rational pseudointegral triangle with exactly one lattice point in its interior has at most $9$ lattice points on its boundary, where a polygon $P$ is called pseudointegral if the Ehrhart function of $P$ is a polynomial. We further show that such a triangle never has exactly $7$ lattice points on its boundary. Our results determine the set of all Ehrhart polynomials of rational triangles with one interior lattice point.
  In addition, we construct convex pseudointegral polygons with $i$ interior lattice points and $b$ boundary lattice points for all positive integral values of $(i,b)$ such that $b \le 5i + 4$. This is in contrast to integral polygons, which must satisfy $b \le 2i + 7$ by a result of Scott. Our constructions yield many new Ehrhart polynomials of rational polygons in the $i \ge 2$ case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2009 Benoit Cloitre introduced a certain self-generating sequence $$(a_n)_{n\geq 1} = 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, \ldots,$$ with the property that the sum of the terms appearing in the $n$'th run equals twice the $n$'th term of the sequence. We give a connection between this sequence and the paperfolding sequence, and then prove Cloitre's conjecture about the density of $1$'s appearing in $(a_n)_{n \geq 1}$.</description>

      <title>Density Hajnal--Szemer\'{e}di theorem for cliques of size four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Corr\'{a}di--Hajnal Theorem~\cite{CH63} and the Hajnal--Szemer\'{e}di Theorem~\cite{HS70} determined the exact minimum degree thresholds for a graph on $n$ vertices to contain $k$ vertex-disjoint copies of $K_r$, for $r=3$ and general $r \ge 4$, respectively. The edge density version of the Corr\'{a}di--Hajnal Theorem was established by Allen--B\"ottcher--Hladk\'y--Piguet~\cite{ABHP15} for large $n$. Remarkably, they determined the four classes of extremal constructions corresponding to different intervals of $k$. They further proposed the natural problem of establishing a density version of the Hajnal--Szemer\'{e}di Theorem: For $r \ge 4$, what is the edge density threshold that guarantees a graph on $n$ vertices contains $k$ vertex-disjoint copies of $K_r$ for $k \le n/r$. They also remarked, ``We are not even sure what the complete family of extremal graphs should be.''
  We take the first step toward this problem by determining asymptotically the five classes of extremal constructions for $r=4$. Furthermore, we propose a candidate set comprising $r+1$ classes of extremal constructions for general $r \ge 5$.</description>

      <title>Transversal Hamilton cycles in digraph collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a collection $\mathcal{D} =\{D_1,D_2,\ldots,D_m\}$ of digraphs on the common vertex set $V$, an $m$-edge digraph $H$ with vertices in $V$ is transversal in $\mathcal{D}$ if there exists a bijection $\varphi :E(H)\rightarrow [m]$ such that $e \in E(D_{\varphi(e)})$ for all $e\in E(H)$. Ghouila-Houri proved that any $n$-vertex digraph with minimum semi-degree at least $\frac{n}{2}$ contains a directed Hamilton cycle. In this paper, we provide a transversal generalization of Ghouila-Houri's theorem, thereby solving a problem proposed by Chakraborti, Kim, Lee and Seo \cite{2023Tournament}. Our proof utilizes the absorption method for transversals, the regularity method for digraph collections, as well as the transversal blow-up lemma \cite{cheng2023transversals} and the related machinery. As an application, when $n$ is sufficiently large, our result implies the transversal version of Dirac's theorem, which was proved by Joos and Kim \cite{2021jooskim}.</description>

      <title>Connected ideals of chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $t\geq 2$, the $t$-independence complex of a graph $G$ is the collection of all $A\subseteq V(G)$ such that each connected component of the induced subgraph $G[A]$ has at most $t-1$ vertices. The Stanley-Reisner ideal $I_{t}(G)$ of the $t$-independence complex of $G$, called $t$-connected ideal, is generated by monomials in a polynomial ring $R$ corresponding to all $A\subseteq V(G)$ of size $t$ such that $G[A]$ is connected. This class of ideals is a natural generalization of the edge ideals of graphs. In this paper, we investigate the $t$-connected ideals of chordal graphs. In particular, we prove that for a chordal graph $G$ and for all $t$
  \[
  \mathrm{reg}(R/I_{t}(G))=(t-1)\nu_{t}(G) \text{ and } \mathrm{pd}(R/I_{t}(G))=\mathrm{bight}(I_{t}(G)),
  \]
  where $\nu_{t}(G)$ denotes the induced matching number of the corresponding hypergraph of $I_{t}(G)$, and $\mathrm{reg}$, $\mathrm{pd}$ and $\mathrm{bight}$ stand for the regularity, projective dimension, and big height, respectively. As a consequence of the above results, we completely characterize when the $t$-connected ideal of a chordal graph has a linear resolution as well as when it satisfies the Cohen-Macaulay property. The above formulas and their consequences can be seen as a nice generalization of the classical results corresponding to the edge ideals of chordal graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work of the author connected several parking function enumeration problems to enumerations of Catalan paths with respect to certain weight functions that are expressed in terms of the ascent lengths. Motivated by this, we generalise and solve analogous weighted enumeration problems for a large family of lattice paths and weight functions, and discuss their connections with other enumeration problems and OEIS entries.</description>

Abstract: Given $d\in\mathbb{N}$, let $\alpha(d)$ be the largest real number such that every abstract simplicial complex $\mathcal{S}$ with $0&lt;\vert\mathcal{S}\vert\leq\alpha(d)\vert V(\mathcal{S})\vert$ has a vertex of degree at most $d$. We extend previous results by Frankl, Frankl and Watanabe, and Piga and Sch\"ulke by proving that for all integers $d$ and $m$ with $d\geq m\geq 1$, we have $\alpha(2^d-m)=\frac{2^{d+1}-m}{d+1}$. Similar results were obtained independently by Li, Ma, and Rong.</description>

      <title>On a Conjecture Concerning the Complementary Second Zagreb Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complementary second Zagreb index of a graph $G$ is defined as $cM_2(G)=\sum_{uv\in E(G)}|(d_u(G))^2-(d_v(G))^2|$, where $d_u(G)$ denotes the degree of a vertex $u$ in $G$ and $E(G)$ represents the edge set of $G$. Let $G^*$ be a graph having the maximum value of $cM_2$ among all connected graphs of order $n$. Furtula and Oz [MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 93 (2025) 247--263] conjectured that $G^*$ is the join $K_k+\overline{K}_{n-k}$ of the complete graph $K_k$ of order $k$ and the complement $\overline{K}_{n-k}$ of the complete graph $K_{n-k}$ such that the inequality $k&lt;\lceil n/2 \rceil$ holds. We prove that (i) the maximum degree of $G^*$ is $n-1$ and (ii) no two vertices of minimum degree in $G^*$ are adjacent; both of these results support the aforementioned conjecture. We also prove that the number of vertices of maximum degree in $G^*$, say $k$, is at most $-\frac{2}{3}n+\frac{3}{2}+\frac{1}{6}\sqrt{52n^2-132n+81}$, which implies that $k&lt;5352n/10000$. Furthermore, we establish results that support the conjecture under consideration for certain bidegreed and tridegreed graphs. In the aforesaid paper, it was also mentioned that determining the $k$ as a function of the $n$ is far from being an easy task; we obtain the values of $k$ for $5\le n\le 149$ in the case of certain bidegreed graphs by using computer software and found that the resulting sequence of the values of $k$ does not exist in "The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences" (an online database of integer sequences).</description>

      <title>Bounds on Coloring Trees without Rainbow Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph with colored vertices, a rainbow subgraph is one where all vertices have different colors. For graph $G$, let $c_k(G)$ denote the maximum number of different colors in a coloring without a rainbow path on $k$ vertices, and $cp_k(G)$ the maximum number of colors if the coloring is required to be proper. The parameter $c_3$ has been studied by multiple authors. We investigate these parameters for trees and $k \ge 4$. We first calculate them when $G$ is a path, and determine when the optimal coloring is unique. Then for trees $T$ of order $n$, we show that the minimum value of $c_4(T)$ and $cp_4(T)$ is $(n+2)/2$, and the trees with the minimum value of $cp_4(T)$ are the coronas. Further, the minimum value of $c_5(T)$ and $cp_5(T)$ is $(n+3)/2$ , and the trees with the minimum value of either parameter are octopuses.</description>

      <title>Electrical networks and data analysis in phylogenetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classic problem in data analysis is studying the systems of subsets defined by either a similarity or a dissimilarity function on $X$ which is either observed directly or derived from a data set. For an electrical network there are two functions on the set of the nodes defined by the resistance matrix and the response matrix either of which defines the network completely. We argue that these functions should be viewed as a similarity and a dissimilarity function on the set of the nodes moreover they are related via the covariance mapping also known as the Farris transform or the Gromov product. We will explore the properties of electrical networks from this point of view. It has been known for a while that the resistance matrix defines a metric on the nodes of the electrical networks. Moreover for a circular electrical network this metric obeys the Kalmanson property as it was shown recently. We will call such a metric an electrical Kalmanson metric. The main results of this paper is a complete description of the electrical Kalmanson metrics in the set of all Kalmanson metrics in terms of the geometry of the positive Isotropic Grassmannian whose connection to the theory of electrical networks was discovered earlier. One important area of applications where Kalmanson metrics are actively used is the theory of phylogenetic networks which are a generalization of phylogenetic trees. Our results allow us to use in phylogenetics the powerful methods of reconstruction of the minimal graphs of electrical networks and possibly open the door into data analysis for the methods of the theory of cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for polynomial-time detection of induced minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $H$-Induced Minor Containment problem ($H$-IMC) consists in deciding if a fixed graph $H$ is an induced minor of a graph $G$ given as input, that is, whether $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by deleting vertices and contracting edges. Several graphs $H$ are known for which $H$-IMC is \NP-complete, even when $H$ is a tree. In this paper, we investigate which conditions on $H$ and $G$ are sufficient so that the problem becomes polynomial-time solvable. Our results identify three infinite classes of graphs such that, if $H$ belongs to one of these classes, then $H$-IMC can be solved in polynomial time. Moreover, we show that if the input graph $G$ excludes long induced paths, then $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for any fixed graph $H$. As a byproduct of our results, this implies that $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for all graphs $H$ with at most $5$ vertices, except for three open cases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper, and its companion [BCLV24], are devoted to a negative resolution of the Aldous--Lyons Conjecture [AL07, Ald07].
  In this part we study tailored non-local games. This is a subclass of non-local games -- combinatorial objects which model certain experiments in quantum mechanics, as well as interactive proofs in complexity theory. Our main result is that, given a tailored non-local game $G$, it is undecidable to distinguish between the case where $G$ has a special kind of perfect strategy, and the case where every strategy for $G$ is far from being perfect. Using a reduction introduced in the companion paper [BCLV24], this undecidability result implies a negative answer to the Aldous--Lyons conjecture. Namely, it implies the existence of unimodular networks that are non-sofic.
  To prove our result, we use a variant of the compression technique developed in MIP*=RE [JNV+21]. Our main technical contribution is to adapt this technique to the class of tailored non-local games. The main difficulty is in establishing answer reduction, which requires a very careful adaptation of existing techniques in the construction of probabilistically checkable proofs. As a byproduct, we are reproving the negation of Connes' embedding problem [Con76] -- i.e., the existence of a $\mathrm{II}_1$-factor which cannot be embedded in an ultrapower of the hyperfinite $\mathrm{II}_1$-factor -- first proved in [JNV+21], using an arguably more streamlined proof. In particular, we incorporate recent simplifications from the literature [dlS22b, Vid22] due to de la Salle and the third author.</description>

      <title>Group Invariant Quantum Latin Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum Latin square is an $n \times n$ array of unit vectors where each row and column forms an orthonormal basis of a fixed complex vector space. We introduce the notion of $(G,G')$-invariant quantum Latin squares for finite groups $G$ and $G'$. These are quantum Latin squares with rows and columns indexed by $G$ and $G'$ respectively such that the inner product of the $a,b$-entry with the $c,d$-entry depends only on $a^{-1}c \in G$ and $b^{-1}d \in G'$. This definition is motivated by the notion of group invariant bijective correlations introduced in [Roberson \&amp; Schmidt (2020)], and every group invariant quantum Latin square produces a group invariant bijective correlation, though the converse does not hold. In this work we investigate these group invariant quantum Latin squares and their corresponding correlations. Our main result is that, up to applying a global isometry to every vector in a $(G,G')$-invariant quantum Latin square, there is a natural bijection between these objects and trace and conjugate transpose preserving isomorphisms between the group algebras of $G$ and $G'$. This in particular proves that a $(G,G')$-invariant quantum Latin square exists if and only if the multisets of degrees of irreducible representations are equal for $G$ and $G'$. Another motivation for this line of work is that whenever Cayley graphs for groups $G$ and $G'$ are quantum isomorphic, then there is a $(G,G')$-invariant quantum correlation witnessing this, and thus it suffices to consider such correlations when searching for quantum isomorphic Cayley graphs. Given a group invariant quantum correlation, we show how to construct all pairs of graphs for which it gives a quantum isomorphism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, with very high probability, the random graph Laplacian has simple spectrum. Our method provides a quantitatively effective estimate of the spectral gaps. Along the way, we establish results on affine no-gaps delocalization, no-structure delocalization, overcrowding and small entries of the eigenvectors for the Laplacian model. These findings are of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We obtain assumption-free, non-asymptotic, uniform bounds on the product of the height and the width of uniformly random trees with a given degree sequence, conditioned Bienaym\'e trees and simply generated trees. We show that for a tree of size $n$, this product is $O(n \log n)$ in probability, answering a question by Addario-Berry (2019). The order of this bound is tight in this generality.</description>

      <title>Partition-theoretic model of prime distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We make an application of ideas from partition theory to a problem in multiplicative number theory. We posit a deterministic model of prime number distribution from first principles related to properties of integer partitions, that predicts the prime number theorem, and suggests new conjectures regarding predictable variations in prime gaps.The model predicts that, for $n\geq 2$, $$p_{n}\ =\ 1\ +\ 2\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\left\lceil \frac{d(k)}{2}\right\rceil\ +\ \varepsilon(n),$$ where $p_k$ is the $k$th prime number, $d(k)$ is the divisor function, and $\varepsilon(k)\geq 0$ is an error that is negligible asymptotically; both the main term and error are enumerative functions in our conceptual model. We refine the error to give numerical estimates of $\pi(n)$ similar to those provided by the logarithmic integral, and much more accurate than $\operatorname{li}(n)$ up to $n=10{,}000$ where the estimate is almost exact. We then test a seemingly dubious prediction suggested by the model, that prime-indexed primes $p_2, p_3, p_5, p_7,$ etc., are more likely to be involved in twin prime pairs than are arbitrary primes; surprisingly, computations show prime-indexed primes are more likely to be twin primes up to at least $n=10{,}000{,}000{,}000$, with the bias diminishing but persistent as $n$ increases.</description>

      <title>In Search of a Hidden Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three enumeration problems are discussed in these lectures. One is a detailed account on simple Hurwitz numbers, explaining how the problem was solved by discovering a key curve. This key ignites the generating functions of Hurwitz numbers and drives them into polynomials. The unexpected polynomiality then brings us simple proofs of the Witten-Kontsevich theorem and the $\lambda_g$-theorem of Faber-Pandharipande. An analogous problem associated with Catalan numbers is also presented, which has a simpler feature in terms of analysis. The third enumeration problem is a quest of identifying a hidden curve behind the Ap\'ery sequence, which remains to be discovered.
  It is examined how a counting problem leads to a \emph{spectral curve} through a differential equation, of Picard-Fuchs type but can be nonlinear. The counting problem is a geometric question associated with the \emph{genus $0$, one marked point} case. Going from the $(0,1)$-case to arbitrary $(g,n)$-case is explained as a process of \emph{quantization} of the spectral curve.
  This perspective of quantization is discussed in a geometric setting, when the differential equations have holomorphic coefficients, in terms of Higgs bundles, opers, and Gaiotto's conformal limit construction. In this context, however, there are no counting problems behind the scene.</description>

      <title>The moduli space of HCMU surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HCMU surfaces are compact Riemann surfaces equipped with an extremal K\"{a}hler metric and a finite number of singularities. Research on these surfaces was initiated by E. Calabi and X.-X. Chen over thirty years ago. We provide a detailed description of the geometric structure of HCMU surfaces, building on the classical football decomposition introduced by Chen-Chen-Wu. From this perspective, most HCMU surfaces can be uniquely described by a set of data that includes both discrete topological information and continuous geometric parameters. This data representation is effective for studying the moduli space of HCMU surfaces with specified genus and conical angles, suggesting a topological approach to this topic. As a first application, we present a unified proof of the angle constraints on HCMU surfaces. Using the same approach, we establish an existence theorem for HCMU surfaces of any genus with a single conical point, which is also a saddle point. Finally, we determine the dimension of the moduli space, defined as the number of independent continuous parameters. This is achieved by examining several geometric deformations of HCMU surfaces and the various relationships between the quantities in the data set representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of graphs of twin-width at most $1$, and obtain the following results:
  - Graphs of twin-width at most $1$ are permutation graphs. In particular they have an intersection model and a linear structure.
  - There is always a $1$-contraction sequence closely following a given permutation diagram.
  - Based on a recursive decomposition theorem, we obtain a simple algorithm running in linear time that produces a $1$-contraction sequence of a graph, or guarantees that it has twin-width more than $1$.
  - We characterise distance-hereditary graphs based on their twin-width and deduce a linear time algorithm to compute optimal sequences on this class of graphs.</description>

      <title>A fast algorithm for the Frobenius problem in three variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a set of three positive integers {a1, a2, a3}, denoted A, the Frobenius problem in three variables is to find the greatest integer which cannot be expressed in the following form, where x1, x2 and x3 are non-negative integers:
  x1*a1 + x2*a2 + x3*a3
  The fastest known algorithm for solving the three variable case of the Frobenius problem was invented by H. Greenberg in 1988 whose worst case time complexity is a logarithmic function of A. In 2017 A. Tripathi presented another algorithm for solving the same problem. This article presents an algorithm whose foundation is the same as Tripathi's. However, the algorithm presented here is significantly different from Tripathi's and we show that its worst case time complexity also is a logarithmic function of A</description>

Abstract: Certain generalization of Euler numbers was defined in 1935 by Lehmer using cubic roots of unity, as a natural generalization of Bernoulli and Euler numbers. In this paper, Lehmer's generalized Euler numbers are studied to give certain congruence properties together with recurrence and explicit formulas of the numbers. We also show a new polynomial sequence and its properties. Some identities including Euler and central factorial numbers are obtained.</description>

Further it is shown that $W$ has abstract regular polytopes of rank $r$ for all $r$ such that $3 \leq r \leq n - 1$, if $n$ is even, and $3 \leq r \leq n$, if $n$ is odd. The possible ranks of abstract regular polytopes for the exceptional finite irreducible Coxeter groups are also determined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.01723v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study systems of orientations on triples that satisfy the following so-called interiority condition: $\circlearrowleft(ABD)=~\circlearrowleft(BCD)=~\circlearrowleft(CAD)=1$ implies $\circlearrowleft(ABC)=1$ for any $A,B,C,D$. We call such an orientation a P3O (partial 3-order), a natural generalization of a poset, that has several interesting special cases. For example, the order type of a planar point set (that can have collinear triples) is a P3O; we denote a P3O realizable by points as p-P3O. If we do not allow $\circlearrowleft(ABC)=0$, we obtain a T3O (total 3-order). Contrary to linear orders, a T3O can have a rich structure. A T3O realizable by points, a p-T3O, is the order type of a point set in general position. In our paper "Orientation of convex sets" we defined a 3-order on pairwise intersecting convex sets; such a P3O is called a C-P3O. In this paper we extend this 3-order to pairwise intersecting good covers; such a P3O is called a GC-P3O. If we do not allow $\circlearrowleft(ABC)=0$, we obtain a C-T3O and a GC-T3O, respectively. The main result of this paper is that there is a p-T3O that is not a GC-T3O, implying also that it is not a C-T3O -- this latter problem was left open in our earlier paper. Our proof involves several combinatorial and geometric observations that can be of independent interest. Along the way, we define several further special families of GC-T3O's.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ramsey theory is a central and active branch of combinatorics. Although Ramsey numbers for graphs have been extensively investigated since Ramsey's work in the 1930s, there is still an exponential gap between the best known lower and upper bounds. For $k$-uniform hypergraphs, the bounds are of tower-type, where the height grows with $k$. Here, we give a multidimensional generalisation of Ramsey's Theorem to Cartesian products of graphs, proving that a doubly exponential upper bound suffices in every dimension. More precisely, we prove that for every positive integers $r,n,d$, in any $r$-colouring of the edges of the Cartesian product $\square^{d} K_N$ of $d$ copies of $K_N$, there is a copy of $\square^{d} K_n$ such that the edges in each direction are monochromatic, provided that $N\geq 2^{2^{C_drn^{d}}}$. As an application of our approach we also obtain improvements on the multidimensional Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres Theorem proved by Fishburn and Graham $30$ years ago. Their bound was recently improved by Buci\'c, Sudakov, and Tran, who gave an upper bound that is triply exponential in four or more dimensions. We improve upon their results showing that a doubly expoenential upper bounds holds any number of dimensions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study some class of cellular automata (CA) preserving modulo-recursive, stability by reflection and richness called stable cellular automata (SCA). After applying these automata on Sturmian words, we establish some combinatorial properties of these new words. Next, the classical and palindromic complexity functions of these words are also determined. Finally, we show that these words are $2$-balanced and we establish their abelian complexity function.</description>

      <title>Characterising Clique Convergence for Locally Cyclic Graphs of Minimum Degree $\delta\ge 6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The clique graph $kG$ of a graph $G$ has as its vertices the cliques (maximal complete subgraphs) of $G$, two of which are adjacent in $kG$ if they have non-empty intersection in $G$. We say that $G$ is clique convergent if $k^nG\cong k^m G$ for some $n\not= m$, and that $G$ is clique divergent otherwise. We completely characterise the clique convergent graphs in the class of (not necessarily finite) locally cyclic graphs of minimum degree $\delta\ge 6$, showing that for such graphs clique divergence is a global phenomenon, dependent on the existence of large substructures. More precisely, we establish that such a graph is clique divergent if and only if its universal triangular cover contains arbitrarily large members from the family of so-called "triangular-shaped graphs".</description>

      <title>The cycle double cover conjecture from the perspective of percolation theory on iterated line graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06649v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cycle double cover conjecture is a long standing problem in graph theory, which links local properties, the valency of a vertex and no bridges, and a global property of the graph, being covered by a particular set of cycles. We prove the conjecture using a lift of walks and cycles in $G$ to sets of open and closed edges on $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{L}(G))$, the line graph of the line graph of $G$. We exploit that triangles are preserved by the line graph operator to obtain a one-to-one mapping from walks in the underlying graph $G$ to walks on $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{L}(G))$. We prove that each set of "double walk covers" in $G$ induces a certain set of $\lbrace 0,1\rbrace$ labels on a subgraph covering of $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{L}(G))$, minus a set of triangles, and conversely, that there is such a set of labels such that its projection back to $G$ implies a double cycle cover, if $G$ is an simple bridgeless triangle-free cubic graph. The techniques applied are inspired by percolation theory, flipping the $\lbrace 0,1\rbrace$ labels to obtain the desired structure.</description>

      <title>The fractional chromatic number of the plane is at least 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the fractional chromatic number $\chi_f(\mathbb{R}^2)$ of the unit distance graph of the Euclidean plane is greater than or equal to $4$. Notably, however, we cannot present a finite subgraph $G$ of the plane such that $\chi_f(G)\ge 4$. Instead, we utilize the concept of geometric fractional chromatic number $\chi_{gf}(G)$, which was introduced recently in connection with density bounds for 1-avoiding sets.
  First, as $G$ ranges over finite subgraphs of the plane, we establish that the supremum of $\chi_f(G)$ is the same as that of $\chi_{gf}(G)$. The proof exploits the amenability of the group of Euclidean transformations in dimension 2 and, as such, we do not know whether the analogous statement holds in higher dimensions. We then present a specific planar unit distance graph $G$ on 27 vertices such that $\chi_{gf}(G)=4$.</description>

      <title>Perfect Matching in Product Graphs and in their Random Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $t \in \mathbb{N}$ and every $i\in[t]$, let $H_i$ be a $d_i$-regular connected graph, with $1&lt;|V(H_i)|\le C$ for some integer $C\ge 2$. Let $G=\square_{i=1}^tH_i$ be the Cartesian product of $H_1, \ldots, H_t$. We show that if $t\ge 5C\log_2C$ then $G$ contains a (nearly-)perfect matching.
  Then, considering the random graph process on $G$, we generalise the result of Bollob\'as on the binary hypercube $Q^t$, showing that with high probability, the hitting times for minimum degree one, connectivity, and the existence of a (nearly-)perfect matching in the $G$-random-process are the same. We develop several tools which may be of independent interest in a more general setting of the typical existence of a perfect matching under percolation.</description>

      <title>Chromatic and achromatic numbers of unitary addition Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring. The unitary addition Cayley graph of $R$, denoted $\mathcal{U}(R)$, is the graph with vertex $R$, and two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if $x+y$ is a unit. We determine a formula for the clique number and chromatic number of such graphs when $R$ is a finite commutative ring with an odd number of elements. This includes the special case when $R$ is $\mathbb{Z}_n$, the integers modulo $n$, where these parameters had been found under the assumption that $n$ is even, or $n$ is a power of an odd prime. Additionally, we study the achromatic number of $\mathcal{U}( \mathbb{Z}_n )$ in the case that $n$ is the product of two primes. We prove that the achromatic number of $\mathcal{U} ( \mathbb{Z}_{3q})$ is equal to $\frac{3q+1}{2}$ when $q &gt; 3$ is a prime. We also prove a lower bound that applies when $n = pq$ where $p$ and $q$ are distinct odd primes.</description>

Abstract: In the 60s, Micha Perles constructed a point-line arrangement in the plane on nine points, which can not be realized only by points with rational coordinates. Gr\"unbaum conjectured that Perles' construction is the smallest: any geometric arrangement on eight or fewer points if it is realizable with real coordinates in the plane, it is also realizable with rational coordinates. In this paper, we prove the conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the number of partitions of the hypercube ${\bf Z}_q^n$ into $q^m$ subcubes of dimension $n-m$ each for fixed $q$, $m$ and growing $n$ is asymptotically equal to $n^{(q^m-1)/(q-1)}$. For the proof, we introduce the operation of the bang of a star matrix and demonstrate that any star matrix, except for a fractal, is expandable under some bang, whereas a fractal remains to be a fractal under any bang.</description>

      <title>On Bollob\'as-type theorems of $d$-tuples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1965, Bollob\'as proved that for a Bollob\'as set-pair system $\{(A_i,B_i)\mid i\in[m]\}$, the maximum value of $\sum_{i=1}^m\binom{|A_i|+|B_i|}{A_i}^{-1}$ is $1$. Heged\"{u}s and Frankl recently extended the concept of Bollob\'as systems to $d$-tuples, conjecturing that for a Bollob\'as system of $d$-tuples, $\{(A_i^{(1)},\ldots,A_i^{(d)})\mid i\in[m]\}$, the maximum value of $\sum_{i=1}^m\binom{|A_i^{(1)}|+\cdots+|A_i^{(d)}|}{|A_i^{(1)}|,\ldots,|A_i^{(d)}|}^{-1}$ is also $1$. This paper refutes this conjecture and establishes an upper bound for the sum. In the case $d=3$, the derived upper bound is asymptotically tight. Furthermore, we sharpen an inequality for skew Bollob\'as systems of $d$-tuples in Heged\"{u}s and Frankl's paper. Finally, we determine the maximum size of a uniform skew Bollob\'as system of $d$-tuples on both sets and spaces.</description>

      <title>A contribution to the characterization of finite minimal automorphic posets of width three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characterization of the finite minimal automorphic posets of width three is still an open problem. Niederle has shown that this task can be reduced to the characterization of the nice sections of width three having a non-trivial tower of nice sections as retract. We solve this problem for a sub-class $\mathfrak{N}_2$ of the finite nice sections of width three. On the one hand, we characterize the posets in $\mathfrak{N}_2$ having a retract of width three being a non-trivial tower of nice sections, and on the other hand we characterize the posets in $\mathfrak{N}_2$ having a 4-crown stack as retract. The latter result yields a recursive approach for the determination of posets in $\mathfrak{N}_2$ having a 4-crown stack as retract. With this approach, we determine all posets in $\mathfrak{N}_2$ with height up to six having such a retract. For each integer $n \geq 2$, the class $\mathfrak{N}_2$ contains $2^{n-2}$ different isomorphism types of posets of height $n$.</description>

      <title>Large Induced Subgraphs of Bounded Degree in Outerplanar and Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following question. Let $\mathcal G$ be a family of planar graphs and let $k\geq 3$ be an integer. What is the largest value $f_k(n)$ such that every $n$-vertex graph in $\mathcal G$ has an induced subgraph with degree at most $k$ and with $f_k(n)$ vertices? Similar questions, in which one seeks a large induced forest, or a large induced linear forest, or a large induced $d$-degenerate graph, rather than a large induced graph of bounded degree, have been studied for decades and have given rise to some of the most fascinating and elusive conjectures in Graph Theory. We tackle our problem when $\mathcal G$ is the class of the outerplanar graphs or the class of the planar graphs. In both cases, we provide upper and lower bounds on the value of $f_k(n)$. For example, we prove that every $n$-vertex planar graph has an induced subgraph with degree at most $3$ and with $\frac{5n}{13}&gt;0.384n$ vertices, and that there exist $n$-vertex planar graphs whose largest induced subgraph with degree at most $3$ has $\frac{4n}{7}+O(1)&lt;0.572n+O(1)$ vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paperfolding sequences form an uncountable class of infinite sequences over the alphabet $\{ -1, 1 \}$ that describe the sequence of folds arising from iterated folding of a piece of paper, followed by unfolding. In this note we observe that the sequence of run lengths in such a sequence, as well as the starting and ending positions of the $n$'th run, is $2$-synchronized and hence computable by a finite automaton. As a specific consequence, we obtain the recent results of Bunder, Bates, and Arnold, in much more generality, via a different approach. We also prove results about the critical exponent and subword complexity of these run-length sequences.</description>

      <title>Chain Conditions and Optimal Elements in Generalized Union-Closed Families of Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The union-closed sets conjecture (sometimes referred to as Frankl's conjecture) states that every finite, nontrivial union-closed family of sets has an element that is in at least half of its members. Although the conjecture is known to be false in the infinite setting, we show that many interesting results can still be recovered by imposing suitable chain conditions and considering carefully chosen elements called optimal elements. We use these elements to show that the union-closed conjecture holds for both finite and infinite union-closed families such that the cardinality of any chain of sets is at most three. We also show that the conjecture holds for all nontrivial topological spaces satisfying the descending chain condition on its open sets. Notably, none of those arguments depend on the cardinality of the underlying family or its universe. Finally, we provide an interesting class of families that satisfy the conclusion of the conjecture but are not necessarily union-closed.</description>

Abstract: The study of spectral graph determination is a fascinating area of research in spectral graph theory and algebraic combinatorics. This field focuses on examining the spectral characterization of various classes of graphs, developing methods to construct or distinguish cospectral nonisomorphic graphs, and analyzing the conditions under which a graph's spectrum uniquely determines its structure. This paper presents an overview of both classical and recent advancements in these topics, along with newly obtained proofs of some existing results, which offer additional insights.</description>

Abstract: Let the tight $\ell$-cycle minus one edge $C_\ell^{3-}$ be the $3$-graph on $\{1,\dots,\ell\}$ consisting of $\ell-1$ consecutive triples in the cyclic order. We show that, for every $\ell\ge 5$ not divisible by $3$, the Tur\'an density of $C_{\ell}^{3-}$ is $1/4$ and also prove some finer structure results. This proves a conjecture of Mubayi--Sudakov--Pikhurko from 2011 and extends the results of Balogh--Luo [Combinatorica 44 (2024) 949--976] who established analogous claims for all sufficiently large $\ell$.
  Results similar to ours were independently obtained by Lidick\'y--Mattes--Pfender [arXiv:2409.14257].</description>

Abstract: We give a representation-theoretic bijection between rooted labeled forests with $n$ vertices and complete exceptional sequences for the quiver of type $A_n$ with straight orientation. The ascending and descending vertices in the forest correspond to relatively injective and relatively projective objects in the exceptional sequence. We conclude that every object in an exceptional sequence for linearly oriented $A_n$ is either relatively projective or relatively injective or both. We construct a natural action of the extended braid group on rooted labeled forests and show that it agrees with the known action of the braid group on complete exceptional sequences. We also describe the action of $\Delta$, the Garside element of the braid group, on rooted labeled forests using representation theory and show how this relates to cluster theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article establishes alcove walk models for intersections of Schubert varieties and partially semi-infinite orbits in the affine Grassmannian of a split reductive group (we call such intersections parabolic Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen intersections). More precisely, we describe explicit cellular pavings of these intersections, indexed by certain positively-folded alcove walks. We prove a parametrization of the irreducible components of maximal possible dimension, in terms of alcove walks of maximal possible dimension. We then deduce a new combinatorial description of branching to Levi subgroups of irreducible highest weight representations, and in particular we give a new algorithm for computing the characters of such representations.</description>

      <title>A circle method approach to K-multimagic squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate $K$-multimagic squares of order $N$, these are $N \times N$ magic squares which remain magic after raising each element to the $k$ th power for all $2 \leqslant$ $k \leqslant K$. Given $K \geqslant 2$, we consider the problem of establishing the smallest integer $N_2(K)$ for which there exists nontrivial $K$-multimagic squares of order $N_2(K)$. Previous results on multimagic squares show that $N_2(K) \leqslant(4 K-2)^K$ for large $K$. Here we utilize the Hardy-Littlewood circle method and establish the bound
  $$ N_2(K) \leqslant 2 K(K+1)+1 $$
  Via an argument of Granville's we additionally deduce the existence of infinitely many nontrivial prime valued $K$-multimagic squares of order $2 K(K+1)+1$.</description>

      <title>Existence of $K$-multimagic squares and magic squares of $k$th powers with distinct entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of $K$-multimagic squares of order $N$ consisting of distinct integers whenever $N&gt;2 K(K+1)$. This improves upon our earlier result in which we only required $N+1$ distinct integers.
  Additionally, we present a direct method by which our analysis of the magic square system may be used to show the existence of $N \times N$ magic squares consisting of distinct $k$ th powers when
  $$ N&gt; \begin{cases}2^{k+1} &amp; \text { if } 2 \leqslant k \leqslant 4 \\ 2\lceil k(\log k+4.20032)\rceil &amp; \text { if } k \geqslant 5\end{cases} $$
  improving on a recent result by Rome and Yamagishi.</description>
