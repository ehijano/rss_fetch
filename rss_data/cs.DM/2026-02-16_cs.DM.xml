      <title>A Tighter Upper Bound for Distinct Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A square is a word of the form $xx$ for a non-empty word $x$. Brlek and Li [Comb. Theory, 2025] proved that the number of distinct squares in a word of length $n$ that uses $\sigma$ distinct letters is at most $n - \sigma$. In this paper, we give a new upper bound $n - \Theta(\log n)$, improving the previous bound when $\sigma \in o(\log n)$.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Homomorphism Reconstruction Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the algorithmic problem of reconstructing a graph from homomorphism counts that has first been studied in (B\"oker et al., STACS 2024): given graphs $F_1,\ldots,F_k$ and counts $m_1,\ldots,m_k$, decide if there is a graph $G$ such that the number of homomorphisms from $F_i$ to $G$ is $m_i$, for all $i$. We prove that the problem is NEXP-hard if the counts $m_i$ are specified in binary and $\Sigma_2^p$-complete if they are in unary.
  Furthermore, as a positive result, we show that the unary version can be solved in polynomial time if the constraint graphs are stars of bounded size.</description>

      <title>Distance-based certification for leader election in meshed graphs and local recognition of their subclasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a 2-local proof labeling scheme with labels in $\{ 0,1,2\}$ for leader election in anonymous meshed graphs. Meshed graphs form a general class of graphs defined by a distance condition. They comprise several important classes of graphs, which have long been the subject of intensive studies in metric graph theory, geometric group theory, and discrete mathematics: median graphs, bridged graphs, chordal graphs, Helly graphs, dual polar graphs, modular, weakly modular graphs, and basis graphs of matroids. We also provide 3-local proof labeling schemes to recognize these subclasses of meshed graphs using labels of size $O(\log D)$ (where $D$ is the diameter of the graph).
  To establish these results, we show that in meshed graphs, we can verify locally that every vertex $v$ is labeled by its distance $d(s,v)$ to an arbitrary root $s$. To design proof labeling schemes to recognize the subclasses of meshed graphs mentioned above, we use this distance verification to ensure that the triangle-square complex of the graph is simply connected and we then rely on existing local-to-global characterizations for the different classes we consider.
  To get a proof-labeling scheme for leader election with labels of constant size, we then show that we can check locally if every $v$ is labeled by $d(s,v) \pmod{3}$ for some root $s$ that we designate as the leader.</description>

      <title>Optimal Path Partitions in Subcubic and Almost-subcubic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of partitioning the edges of a graph into as few paths as possible. This is a~subject of the classic conjecture of Gallai and a recurring topic in combinatorics. Regarding the complexity of partitioning a graph optimally, Peroch\'e [Discret. Appl. Math., 1984] proved that it is NP-hard already on graphs of maximum degree four, even when we only ask if two paths suffice.
  We show that the problem is solvable in polynomial time on subcubic graphs and then we present an efficient algorithm for ``almost-subcubic'' graphs. Precisely, we prove that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the edge-deletion distance to a subcubic graph. To this end, we reduce the task to model checking in first-order logic extended by disjoint-paths predicates ($\mathsf{FO}\text{+}\mathsf{DP}$) and then we employ the recent tractability result by Schirrmacher, Siebertz, Stamoulis, Thilikos, and Vigny [LICS 2024].</description>

      <title>Flips and Merge-Width in Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A flip of a graph is obtained by complementing the edge relation within a set of vertices. Flips are typically used to separate vertices in a graph, by increasing the distances between them. We show that in $K_{t,t}$-free graphs, every short sequence of flips can be simulated by a short sequence of vertex deletions that achieves a similar degree of separation: distances in the resulting graph are, up to a factor of three, at least as large as those obtained after the flips.
  This result provides a simple and uniform explanation of an emerging pattern in structural graph theory and finite model theory: the $K_{t,t}$-free fragment of a tameness notion for dense graphs often coincides with a tameness notion for sparse graphs. As immediate applications, we recover the following known equivalences. In the $K_{t,t}$-free setting, the dense notions (1) bounded shrub-depth, (2) bounded clique-width, (3) bounded flip-width, (4) monadic dependence, respectively, coincide with the sparse notions (1) bounded tree-depth, (2) bounded tree-width, (3) bounded expansion, and (4) no-where dense-ness.
  Furthermore, we reprove the result by Dreier and Toru\'nczyk (STOC 2025) stating that $K_{t,t}$-free classes of bounded merge-width have bounded expansion. Our proof provides explicit bounds and is direct, as it shows how to construct strong coloring orders (witnesses of bounded expansion) from merge sequences (witnesses of bounded merge-width).
  Along the way, we identify a new family of graph parameters, dubbed separation-width, that is sandwiched between the strong and weak coloring numbers, and is closely related to the merge-width parameters. We provide evidence that this family of graph parameters, apparently overlooked in the literature, may play a fundamental role in the study of sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>Planting and MCMC Sampling from the Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from the ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the random $d$-regular graph with parameter $\beta&gt;0$. A key difficulty that arises in sampling from the model is the existence of a metastability window $(\beta_u,\beta_u')$ where the distribution has two competing modes, the so-called disordered and ordered phases, causing MCMC-based algorithms to be slow mixing from worst-case initialisations.
  To this end, Helmuth, Jenssen and Perkins designed a sampling algorithm that works for all $\beta$ when $q$ is large, using cluster expansion methods; more recently, their analysis technique has been adapted to show that random-cluster dynamics mixes fast when initialised more judiciously. However, a bottleneck behind cluster-expansion arguments is that they inherently only work for large $q$, whereas it is widely conjectured that sampling is possible for all $q,d\geq 3$. The only result so far that applies to general $q,d\geq 3$ is by Blanca and Gheissari who showed that the random-cluster dynamics mixes fast for $\beta&lt;\beta_u$. For $\beta&gt;\beta_u$, certain correlation phenomena emerge because of the metastability which have been hard to handle, especially for small $q$ and $d$.
  Our main contribution is to perform a delicate analysis of the Potts distribution and the random-cluster dynamics that goes beyond the threshold $\beta_u$. We use planting as the main tool in our proofs, and combine it with the analysis of random-cluster dynamics. We are thus able to show that the random-cluster dynamics initialised from all-out mixes fast for all integers $q,d\geq 3$ beyond the uniqueness threshold $\beta_u$; our analysis works all the way up to the threshold $\beta_c\in (\beta_u,\beta_u')$ where the dominant mode switches from disordered to ordered. We also obtain an algorithm in the ordered regime $\beta&gt;\beta_c$ that refines significantly the range of $q,d$.</description>

      <title>Extending Ghouila-Houri's Characterization of Comparability Graphs to Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An orientation of a given static graph is called transitive if for any three vertices $a,b,c$, the presence of arcs $(a,b)$ and $(b,c)$ forces the presence of the arc $(a,c)$. If only the presence of an arc between $a$ and $c$ is required, but its orientation is unconstrained, the orientation is called quasi-transitive. A fundamental result presented by Ghouila-Houri guarantees that any static graph admitting a quasi-transitive orientation also admits a transitive orientation. In a seminal work, Mertzios et al. introduced the notion of temporal transitivity in order to model information flows in simple temporal networks. We revisit the model introduced by Mertzios et al. and propose an analogous to Ghouila-Houri's characterization for the temporal scenario. We present a structure theorem that will allow us to express by a 2-SAT formula all the constraints imposed by temporal transitive orientations. The latter produces an efficient recognition algorithm for graphs admitting such orientations. Additionally, we extend the temporal transitivity model to temporal graphs having multiple time-labels associated to their edges and claim that the previous results hold in the multilabel setting. Finally, we propose a characterization of temporal comparability graphs via forbidden temporal ordered patterns.</description>
