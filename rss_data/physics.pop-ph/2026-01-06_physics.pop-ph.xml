      <title>Biomechanics of Tori body motion during competition Sutemi, Makikomi, Tai Atari</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background Objectives:The biomechanics of Tori s body motion during Sutemi,sacrifice techniques,Makikomi wrapping techniques,and Tai Atari,Body Strike techniques in judo is crucial for understanding these techniques' effectiveness and safety. This study examined the biomechanics by analysing the entire body of the tori during execution. Methods:We analysed Tori s body motion using original biomechanical models, considering the balance of sacrificing to throw Uke and body mass to strike the opponent. General equations for Sutemi, Makikomi, and Tai atari were established, and their utilisation in high level male competition was statistically analysed. Results:The results show that effective Sutemi and Makikomi execution depends on the correct use of Tori's body mass.The biomechanical model revealed the relationships between angular falling speed, body angle, and athlete height.The model allowed us to evaluate the falling velocity, showing that the angular velocity and acceleration were proportional to the gravitational acceleration and body-Tatami angle and inversely proportional to the athlete height.The stopping and sliding forces are directly proportional to the sum of the Tori and Uke masses and the body Tatami angle but are independent of the athletes eight. Tai Atari s force was quantified to evaluate its situational applicability in competition. Conclusion:This study advanced the biomechanical understanding of Sutemi, Makikomi, and Tai Atari using two original theoretical models, highlighting the importance of Tori s body mass motion. The findings obtained can influence training and competition strategies, enhance technique effectiveness, and reduce injury risks.</description>

      <title>From Random Walks to Thermal Rides: Universal Anomalous Transport in Soaring Flights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-country soaring flights rely on intermittent atmospheric updrafts to cover long distances, producing trajectories that alternate between rapid relocation and local exploration. From a large dataset of paraglider, hang glider, and sailplane flights, we uncover a universal transport law: beyond short ballistic times, horizontal motion is persistently sub-ballistic, with a Hurst exponent $\approx 0.88$ largely independent of aircraft type. Phase-resolved analysis using a probabilistic segmentation method shows that this scaling arises from the fundamentally intermittent, two-dimensional, and directionally correlated nature of soaring transport, in which successive ballistic segments do not add coherently. We find that learning, in the sense of experience-driven improvements in exploration and decision-making, manifests primarily in the search phase, enhancing the ability to efficiently probe the air mass and locate the next thermal. Overall, our results suggest that atmospheric structure and the generic organization of the transition-search-climb cycle dominate transport properties, placing human soaring alongside biological and physical systems where anomalous transport emerges from intermittency and persistence.</description>

      <title>Shuttlecock velocity decay after smash and slice shots in badminton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports on the decay in shuttlecock velocity after smash and slice shots performed by elite and international players, based on the analysis of videos captured on a badminton court with high-speed cameras. The trajectories of feather shuttlecocks show an exponential decay in velocity and an exponential increase in time-of-flight with distance, in accordance with the equation of motion of a shuttlecock subjected to high drag. The initial speed, which can exceed 500 km/h, is reduced by half every 3.35 m, depending on the physical parameters of the shuttlecock characterized by a speed index. The videos show that plastic shuttlecocks, which are more resistant than feather shuttlecocks, deform at high speeds. The resulting decay of their drag coefficient with increasing speed makes them unsuitable for high-level play. The study also shows that the spin induced by the slice shots of left-handed players or the reverse slice shots of right-handed players slows the shuttlecock down.</description>
