      <title>Demkov--Fradkin tensor for curved harmonic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain the Demkov-Fradkin tensor of symmetries for the quantum curved harmonic oscillator in a space with constant curvature given by a parameter $\kappa$. In order to construct this tensor we have firstly found a set of basic operators which satisfy the following conditions: i) their products give symmetries of the problem; in fact the Hamiltonian is a combination of such products; ii) they generate the space of eigenfunctions as well as the eigenvalues in an algebraic way; iii) in the limit of zero curvature, they come into the well known creation/annihilation operators of the flat oscillator. The appropriate products of such basic operators will produce the curved Demkov-Fradkin tensor. However, these basic operators do not satisfy Heisenberg commutators but close another Lie algebra. As a by-product, the classical Demkov-Fradkin tensor for the classical curved harmonic oscillator has been obtained by the same method. The case of two dimensions has been worked out in detail: the operators close a $so_\kappa(4)$ Lie algebra; the spectrum and eigenfunctions are explicitly solved in an algebraic way and in the classical case the trajectories have been computed.</description>

      <title>The atmospheric Ekman spiral for piecewise-uniform eddy viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the boundary-value problem of atmospheric Ekman flows with piecewise-uniform eddy viscosity. In addition we present a method for finding more general solutions by considering eddy viscosity as an arbitrary step-function. We discuss the existence and uniqueness of the solutions obtained through this method, providing detailed proofs for cases with one and two "jumps" in eddy viscosity. For scenarios with more "jumps," we establish results inductively. Furthermore, we examine the angle between the bottom surface of the Ekman layer and geostrophic winds by extremizing variables such as the eddy viscosity and its point of change. These calculations reveal how the angle can differ from \(45^\circ\), demonstrating that the extreme values of \(0^\circ\) and \(90^\circ\) are achievable, indicating the potential range of the deflection angle.</description>

      <title>A high-order procedure for computing globally optimal Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A standard task in solid state physics and quantum chemistry is the computation of localized molecular orbits known as Wannier functions. In this manuscript, we propose a new procedure for computing Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline materials. Our approach proceeds by first performing parallel transport of the Bloch functions using numerical integration. Then, using novel analysis, we show that a simple correction can be analytically computed that yields the optimally localized Wannier function. The resulting scheme is robust and capable of achieving high-order accuracy. We illustrate this in a number of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Finite time path field theory perturbative methods for local quantum spin chain quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss local magnetic field quenches using perturbative methods of finite time path field theory in the following spin chains: Ising and XY in a transverse magnetic field. Their common characteristics are: i) they are integrable via mapping to second quantized noninteracting fermion problem; ii) when the ground state is nondegenerate (true for finite chains except in special cases) it can be represented as a vacuum of Bogoliubov fermions. By switching on a local magnetic field perturbation at finite time, the problem becomes nonintegrable and must be approached via numeric or perturbative methods. Using the formalism of finite time path field theory based on Wigner transforms of projected functions, we show how to: i) calculate the basic "bubble" diagram in the Loschmidt echo of a quenched chain to any order in the perturbation; ii) resum the generalized Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion two point retarded functions in the "bubble" diagram, hence achieving the resummation of perturbative expansion of Loschmidt echo for a wide range of perturbation strengths under certain analiticity assumptions. Limitations of the assumptions and possible generalizations beyond it and also for other spin chains are further discussed.</description>

      <title>Multi-color solitons and frequency combs in microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-color solitons that are parametrically created in dual-pumped microresonators generate interleaved frequency combs that can be used to obtain combs at new frequencies and when synchronized can be used for low-noise microwave generation and potentially as an element in a chip-scale clockwork. Here, we first derive three-wave equations that describe multi-color solitons that appear in microresonators with a nearly quartic dispersion profile. These solitons are characterized by a single angular group velocity and multiple angular phase velocities. We then use these equations to explain the interleaved frequency combs that are observed at the output of the microresonator. Finally, we used these equations to describe the experimentally-observed soliton-OPO effect. In this effect, the pump frequency comb interacts nonlinearly with a signal frequency comb to create an idler frequency comb in a new frequency range, analogous to an optical parametric oscillation (OPO) process. We determine the conditions under which we expect this effect to occur. We anticipate that the three-wave equations and their extensions will be of use in designing new frequency comb systems and determining their stability and noise performance.</description>

      <title>Additivity of quantum capacities in simple non-degradable quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum channel capacities give the fundamental performance limits for information flow over a communication channel. However, the prevalence of superadditivity is a major obstacle to understanding capacities, both quantitatively and conceptually. Examples of additivity, while rare, provide key insight into the origins of nonadditivity and enable our best upper bounds on capacities. Degradable channels, which have additive coherent information, are some of the only channels for which we can calculate the quantum capacity. In this paper we construct non-degradable quantum channels that nevertheless have additive coherent information and therefore easily calculated quantum capacity. The first class of examples is constructed by generalizing the Platypus channel introduced by Leditzky et al. The second class of examples, whose additivity follows from a conjectured stability property, is based on probabilistic mixture of degradable and anti-degradable channels.</description>

      <title>Symmetric periodic solutions in the generalized Sitnikov Problem with homotopy methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper investigates a generalization of the classical Sitnikov problem, concentrating on the movement of a satellite along the Z-axis as it interacts with $n$ primary bodies in periodic motion. It establishes the existence of an infinite number of even and anti-periodic solutions with increasing periods. The proof employs the Leray-Schauder degree theory to trace the critical points of action functionals, using a homotopy from solutions when the primary bodies are transformed into circular orbits.</description>

Abstract: In [Ammari et al., SIAM J Math Anal., 52 (2020), pp. 5441--5466], the first author with collaborators proved the existence of Dirac dispersion cones at subwavelength scales in bubbly honeycomb phononic crystals. In this paper, we study the time-evolution of wave packets that are spectrally concentrated near such conical points. We prove that the wave packets dynamics is governed by a time-dependent effective Dirac system, which still depends, but in a simple way, on the subwavelength scale.</description>

Abstract: This letter presents new nontrivial stochastic identities for random isotropic second rank tensor fields. They can be considered as criteria of statistical isotropy in turbulent flows of any nature. The case of axial symmetry is also considered.

      <title>Optimal Fidelity Estimation from Binary Measurements for Discrete and Continuous Variable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the fidelity between a desired target quantum state and an actual prepared state is essential for assessing the success of experiments. For pure target states, we use functional representations that can be measured directly and determine the number of copies of the prepared state needed for fidelity estimation. In continuous variable (CV) systems, we utilise the Wigner function, which can be measured via displaced parity measurements. We provide upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity required for fidelity estimation, considering the worst-case scenario across all possible prepared states. For target states of particular interest, such as Fock and Gaussian states, we find that this sample complexity is characterised by the $L^1$-norm of the Wigner function, a measure of Wigner negativity widely studied in the literature, in particular in resource theories of quantum computation. For discrete variable systems consisting of $n$ qubits, we explore fidelity estimation protocols using Pauli string measurements. Similarly to the CV approach, the sample complexity is shown to be characterised by the $L^1$-norm of the characteristic function of the target state for both Haar random states and stabiliser states. Furthermore, in a general black box model, we prove that, for any target state, the optimal sample complexity for fidelity estimation is characterised by the smoothed $L^1$-norm of the target state. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the $L^1$-norm of the Wigner function provides a lower bound on the cost of some information processing task.</description>

Abstract: We use an exact Moreau-Yosida regularized formulation to obtain the exchange-correlation potential for periodic systems. We reveal a profound connection between rigorous mathematical principles and efficient numerical implementation, which marks the first computation of a Moreau-Yosida-based inversion for physical systems. We develop a mathematically rigorous inversion algorithm including error bounds that are verified numerically in bulk silicon. This unlocks a new pathway to analyze Kohn-Sham inversion methods, which we expect in turn to foster mathematical approaches for developing approximate functionals.</description>

      <title>Optical response of alternating twisted trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study via microscopic considerations and symmetry principles the optical response of the alternating twisted trilayer graphene. The layer-resolved optical conductivities are expressed in terms of contributions from effective twisted bilayer and single-layer systems along with their coupling. We show the emergence of constitutive laws for: (i) an in-plane magnetic response proportional to the above coupling; and (ii) an effective twisted-bilayer electro-magnetic response that involves a chirality parameter. We estimate the in-plane magnetic response to be negligible, but finite for twists close to the magic angle near charge neutrality. Our approach makes use of a unitary transformation for the trilayer Hamiltonian, and the Kubo formulation of linear response theory. We discuss other implications of our analytical results such as features of bulk plasmonic modes.</description>

      <title>A class of 2 X 2 correlated random-matrix models with Brody spacing distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of 2 X 2 random-matrix models is introduced for which the Brody distribution is the exact eigenvalue spacing distribution. The matrix elements consist of constrained sums of an exponential random variable raised to various powers that depend on the Brody parameter. The random matrices introduced here differ from those of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) in three important ways: the matrix elements are not independent and identically distributed (i.e., not IID) nor Gaussian-distributed, and the matrices are not necessarily real and/or symmetric. The first two features arise from dropping the classical independence assumption, and the third feature stems from dropping the quantum-mechanical conditions that are imposed in the construction of the GOE. In particular, the hermiticity condition, which in the present model, is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the eigenvalues to be real, is not imposed. Consequently, complex non-Hermitian 2 X 2 random matrices with real or complex eigenvalues can also have spacing distributions that are intermediate between those of the Poisson and Wigner classes. Numerical examples are provided for different types of random matrices, including complex-symmetric matrices with real or complex-conjugate eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an open, bounded and connected set $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and its rescaling $\Omega_{\varepsilon}$ of size $\varepsilon\ll 1$, we consider the solutions of the Cauchy problem for the inhomogeneous wave equation $$ (\varepsilon^{-2}\chi_{\Omega_{\varepsilon}}+\chi_{\mathbb{R}^{3}\backslash\Omega_{\varepsilon}})\partial_{tt}u=\Delta u+f $$ with initial data and source supported outside $\Omega_{\varepsilon}$; here, $\chi_{S}$ denotes the characteristic function of a set $S$. We provide the first-order $\varepsilon$-corrections with respect to the solutions of the inhomogeneous free wave equation and give space-time estimates on the remainders in the $L^{\infty}((0,1/\varepsilon^{\tau}),L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{3})) $-norm. Such corrections are explicitly expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Newton potential operator in $L^{2}(\Omega)$ and provide an effective dynamics describing a legitimate point scatterer approximation in the time domain.</description>

      <title>The spin-statistics theorem for topological quantum field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the spin-statistics theorem for topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) in the framework of Atiyah. We incorporate spin via spin structures on bordisms, and represent statistics using super vector spaces. Unitarity is implemented using dagger categories, in a manner that is equivalent to the approach of Freed-Hopkins, who employed $\mathbb{Z}/2$-equivariant functors to address reflection-positivity. A key contribution of our work is the introduction of the notion of fermionically dagger compact categories, which extends the well-established concept of dagger compact categories. We show that both the spin bordism category and the category of super Hilbert spaces are examples of fermionically dagger compact categories. The spin-statistics theorem for TQFTs emerges as a specific case of a more general result concerning symmetric monoidal dagger functors between fermionically dagger compact categories.</description>

      <title>Harmonic locus and Calogero-Moser spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the harmonic locus consisting of the monodromy-free Schr\"odinger operators with rational potential and quadratic growth at infinity. It is known after Oblomkov that it can be identified with the set of all partitions via the Wronskian map for Hermite polynomials. We show that the harmonic locus can also be identified with the subset of the Calogero--Moser space introduced by Wilson, which is fixed by the symplectic action of $\mathbb C^\times.$ As a corollary, for the multiplicity-free part of the locus we effectively solve the inverse problem for the Wronskian map by describing the partition in terms of the spectrum of the corresponding Moser matrix. We also compute the characters of the $\mathbb C^\times$-action at the fixed points, proving, in particular, a conjecture of Conti and Masoero. In the Appendix written by N. Nekrasov there is an alternative proof of this result, based on the space of instantons and ADHM construction.</description>

      <title>Degenerate and irregular topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the theory of $x-y$ duality to propose a new definition / construction for the correlation differentials of topological recursion; we call it "generalized topological recursion". This new definition coincides with the original topological recursion of Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin in the regular case and allows, in particular, to get meaningful answers in a variety of irregular and degenerate situations.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry of MHD equilibria for generic adapted metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria on a Riemannian 3-manifold satisfy the stationary Euler equations for ideal fluids. A stationary solution $X$ admits a large set of ``adapted" metrics in $M$ for which $X$ solves the corresponding MHD equilibrium equations with the same pressure function. We prove different versions of the following statement: an MHD equilibrium with non-constant pressure on a compact three-manifold with or without boundary admits no continuous Killing symmetries for an open and dense set of adapted metrics. This contrasts with the classical conjecture of Grad which loosely states that an MHD equilibrium on a toroidal Euclidean domain in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with pressure function foliating the domain with nested toroidal surfaces must admit Euclidean symmetries.</description>

      <title>An algebraic approach to gravitational quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most approaches towards a quantum theory of gravitation indicate the existence of a minimal length scale of the order of the Planck length. Quantum mechanical models incorporating such an intrinsic length scale call for a deformation of Heisenberg's algebra resulting in a generalized uncertainty principle and constitute what is called gravitational quantum mechanics. Utilizing the position representation of this deformed algebra, we study various models of gravitational quantum mechanics. The free time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet is investigated as well as the spectral properties of a particle bound by an external attractive potential. Here the cases of a box with infinite walls and an attractive potential well of finite depth are considered.</description>

      <title>Emergence of condensation patterns in kinetic equations for opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we define a class of models to understand the impact of population size on opinion formation dynamics, a phenomenon usually related to group conformity. To this end, we introduce a new kinetic model in which the interaction frequency is weighted by the kinetic density. In the quasi-invariant regime, this model reduces to a Kaniadakis-Quarati-type equation with nonlinear drift, originally introduced for the dynamics of bosons in a spatially homogeneous setting. From the obtained PDE for the evolution of the opinion density, we determine the regime of parameters for which a critical mass exists and triggers blow-up of the solution. Therefore, the model is capable of describing strong conformity phenomena in cases where the total density of individuals holding a given opinion exceeds a fixed critical size. In the final part, several numerical experiments demonstrate the features of the introduced class of models and the related consensus effects.</description>

      <title>Simple fusion-fission quantifies Israel-Palestine violence and suggests multi-adversary solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why humans fight has no easy answer. However, understanding better how humans fight could inform future interventions, hidden shifts and casualty risk. Fusion-fission describes the well-known grouping behavior of fish etc. fighting for survival in the face of strong opponents: they form clusters ('fusion') which provide collective benefits and a cluster scatters when it senses danger ('fission'). Here we show how similar clustering (fusion-fission) of human fighters provides a unified quantitative explanation for complex casualty patterns across decades of Israel-Palestine region violence, as well as the October 7 surprise attack -- and uncovers a hidden post-October 7 shift. State-of-the-art data shows this fighter fusion-fission in action. It also predicts future 'super-shock' attacks that will be more lethal than October 7 and will arrive earlier. It offers a multi-adversary solution. Our results -- which include testable formulae and a plug-and-play simulation -- enable concrete risk assessments of future casualties and policy-making grounded by fighter behavior.</description>

      <title>From local isometries to global symmetries: Bridging Killing vectors and Lie algebras through induced vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of symmetries in the realm of manifolds can be approached in two different ways. On one hand, Killing vector fields on a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold correspond to the directions of local isometries within it. On the other hand, from an algebraic perspective, global symmetries of such manifolds are associated with group elements. Although the connection between these two concepts is well established in the literature, this work aims to build an unexplored bridge between the Killing vector fields of n-dimensional maximally symmetric spaces and their corresponding isometry Lie groups, anchoring primarily on the definition of induced vector fields. As an application of our main result, we explore two specific examples: the three-dimensional Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime.</description>
