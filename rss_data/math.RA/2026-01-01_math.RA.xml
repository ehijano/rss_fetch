      <title>On Characterizations of W-weighted DMP and MPD Inverses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the weak Drazin inverse and its characterization have been crucial studies for matrices of index k. In this article, we have revisited W-weighted DMP and MPD inverses and constructed a general class of unique solutions to certain matrix equations. Moreover, we have generalized the W-weighted Drazin inverse of Meng, 2017 using the minimal rank Wweighted weak Drazin inverse. In addition to that, we have derived several equivalent properties of W-weighted DMP and MPD inverses for minimal rank W-weighted weak Drazin inverse of rectangular matrices. Furthermore, some projection-based results are discussed for the characterization of minimal rank W-weighted Drazin inverse, along with some new expressions that are derived for MPD and DMP inverses. Thereby, we have elaborated certain expressions of the perturbation formula for W-weighted weak MPD and DMP inverses. As an application, we establish the reverse and forward order laws using the W-weighted weak Drazin inverse and the minimal rank W-weighted weak Drazin inverse, and apply these results to solve certain matrix equation.</description>

      <title>On quadratic Lie algebras containing the Heisenberg Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study quadratic Lie algebras that contain the Heisenberg Lie algebra $\h_m$ as an ideal. We give a procedure for constructing these kind of quadratic Lie algebras and prove that any quadratic Lie algebra $\g$ that contains the Heisenberg Lie algebra as an ideal is constructed by using this procedure. We state necessary and sufficiency conditions to determine whether an indecomposable quadratic Lie algebra is the Heisenberg Lie algebra extended by a derivation. In addition, we state necessary and sufficiency conditions to determine whether the quotient $\g/\h_m$ admits an invariant metric and we also study the case when the nilradical of the Lie algebra $\g$ is equal to $\h_m$.</description>

      <title>Incremental Certificate Learning for Hybrid Neural Network Verification . A Solver Architecture for Piecewise-Linear Safety Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal verification of deep neural networks is increasingly required in safety-critical domains, yet exact reasoning over piecewise-linear (PWL) activations such as ReLU suffers from a combinatorial explosion of activation patterns. This paper develops a solver-grade methodology centered on \emph{incremental certificate learning}: we maximize the work performed in a sound linear relaxation (LP propagation, convex-hull constraints, stabilization), and invoke exact PWL reasoning only through a selective \emph{exactness gate} when relaxations become inconclusive. Our architecture maintains a node-based search state together with a reusable global lemma store and a proof log. Learning occurs in two layers: (i) \emph{linear lemmas} (cuts) whose validity is justified by checkable certificates, and (ii) \emph{Boolean conflict clauses} extracted from infeasible guarded cores, enabling DPLL(T)-style pruning across nodes. We present an end-to-end algorithm (ICL-Verifier) and a companion hybrid pipeline (HSRV) combining relaxation pruning, exact checks, and branch-and-bound splitting. We prove soundness, and we state a conditional completeness result under exhaustive splitting for compact domains and PWL operators. Finally, we outline an experimental protocol against standardized benchmarks (VNN-LIB / VNN-COMP) to evaluate pruning effectiveness, learned-lemma reuse, and exact-gate efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work characterizes the general form of a bijective linear map $\Psi:\mathscr{M}_n(\mathbb{C}) \to \mathscr{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ such that $[\Psi(A_1),~\Psi(A_2)]=D_2$ whenever $[A_1,~A_2]=D_1$ where $D_1~\text{and}~D_2$ are fixed matrices. Additionally, let $\mathscr{H}_1$ and $\mathscr{H}_2$ be the infinite-dimensional complex Hilbert spaces. We characterize the bijective linear map $\Psi: \mathscr{B}(\mathscr{H}_1) \to \mathscr{B}(\mathscr{H}_2)$ where $\Psi(A_1) \circ ~\Psi(A_2)=D_2$ whenever $A_1\circ ~A_2=D_1$ and $D_1~\text{and}~D_2$ are fixed operators.</description>

      <title>A guide to the $2$-generated axial algebras of Monster type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axial algebras of Monster type are a class of non-associative algebras which generalise the Griess algebra, whose automorphism group is the largest sporadic simple group, the Monster. The $2$-generated algebras, which are the building blocks from which all algebras in this class can be constructed, have recently been classified by Yabe; Franchi and Mainardis; and Franchi, Mainardis and McInroy. There are twelve infinite families of examples as well as the exceptional Highwater algebra and its cover, however their properties are not well understood.
  In this paper, we detail the properties of each of these families, describing their ideals and quotients, subalgebras and idempotents in all characteristics. We also describe all exceptional isomorphisms between them. We give new bases for several of the algebras which better exhibit their axial features and provide code for others to work with them.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we disprove a conjecture of F. Alarc\'on and D.

      <title>On strongly multiplicative sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multiplicative subset S of a ring R is called strongly multiplicative if (\cap_{i \in \Delta} s_i R) \cap S is non-empty for each family (s_i)_{i \in \Delta} of S. In this paper, we study how these sets help stabilize localization and ideal operations. We show that localization and arbitrary intersections commute, meaning S^{-1}(\cap I_\alpha) = \cap S^{-1}I_\alpha$ for any family of ideals, if and only if S is strongly multiplicative. Furthermore, we characterize total quotient rings and strongly zero-dimensional rings in terms of strongly multiplicative sets. We also answer an open question by Hamed and Malek about whether this condition is needed for S-minimal primes to exist. In addition, we prove a Strong Krull's Separation Lemma, which guarantees a maximal ideal disjoint from S. Finally, we demonstrate that if S is a strongly multiplicative set and S is not contained in U(R), then S-minimal primes are not classical prime ideals, and we provide an algorithmic approach to constructing such ideals.</description>

      <title>On the $\tau$-tilting finiteness and silting-discreteness of graded (skew-) gentle algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates finiteness conditions for gentle and skew-gentle algebras. First, we prove that a skew-gentle algebra is $\tau$-tilting finite if and only if it is representation-finite, which extends the result for gentle algebras by Plamondon (2019). Second, using surface models, we characterize silting-discreteness for the perfect derived categories of graded gentle and skew-gentle algebras. Specifically, for a graded gentle algebra, silting-discreteness is equivalent to its associated surface being of genus zero with non-zero winding numbers for all simple closed curves. We further extend this geometric characterization to graded skew-gentle algebras via orbifold surface models.</description>

      <title>Proof-Carrying PWL Verification for ReLU Networks: Convex-Hull Semantics, Exact \SMT/\MILP Encodings, and Symbolic Certificate Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ReLU networks are piecewise-linear (PWL), enabling exact symbolic verification via \SMT(\LRA) or \MILP. However, safety claims in certification pipelines require not only correctness but also \emph{checkable evidence}. We develop a proof-carrying verification core for PWL neural constraints: (i) we formalize ReLU networks as unions of polyhedra indexed by activation patterns; (ii) we present exact \SMT/\MILP encodings and the canonical convex-hull relaxation for each bounded ReLU; and (iii) we introduce a certificate calculus in which bound tightening, stabilization, strengthening, and pruning steps emit explicit algebraic witnesses (LP dual multipliers and Farkas infeasibility certificates). Crucially, these witnesses are \emph{symbolic objects} that admit independent verification in exact arithmetic over $\Q$. We provide a symbolic certificate checker, normalization rules that preserve validity, and a compositional view of region-wise certificates as a global proof artifact for universal safety.</description>

      <title>On rational orbits in some prehomogeneous vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field with characteristic different from $2$. In this paper, we describe the $k$-rational orbit spaces in some irreducible prehomogeneous vector spaces $(G,V)$ over $k$, where $G$ is a connected reductive algebraic group defined over $k$ and $V$ is an irreducible rational representation of $G$ with a Zariski dense open orbit. We parametrize all composition algebras over the field $k$ in terms of the orbits in some of these representations. This leads to a parametric description of the reduced Freudenthal algebras of dimensions $6$ and $9$ over $k$ (if $\text{char}(k)\neq 2,3$). We also get a parametrization for the involutions of the second kind defined on a central division $K$-algebra $B$ with center $K$, a quadratic extension of the underlying field $k$.</description>

      <title>Rational orbits in some prehomogeneous vector spaces associated to $Sp_{6}$ revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field with $\text{char}(k)\neq 2$. We prove that all maximal flags of composition algebras over $k$, appear as the $k$-rational $Sp_{6}$-orbits in a Zariski-dense $Sp_{6}$-invariant subset $V^{ss}\subset V=\wedge^{3}V_{6}$, where $V_{6}$ is the standard $6$-dimensional irreducible representation of $Sp_{6}$. This gives an arithmetic interpretation for the orbit spaces of the semi-stable sets in the prehomogeneous vector spaces $(Sp_{6}\times GL_{1}^{2},V)$ and $(GSp_{6}\times GL_{1}^{2},V)$. We also get all reduced Freudenthal algebras of dimensions $6$ and $9$, represented by the same orbit spaces.</description>
