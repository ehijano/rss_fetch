      <title>Supernova Bursts as a Probe of Neutrino Nature via $CE\nu NS$ Coherent Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Resonant Spin-Flavor Precession (RSFP) of core-collapse supernova neutrinos within the framework of the quantum density matrix formalism is studied. The cooling duration of SN1987A severely constraints standard RSFP models for Dirac Neutrinos. Using the properties of the outer stellar envelope where resonant conversion could occur after thermal decoupling, we show that for neutrino magnetic moments in the range $\mu_\nu \sim 10^{-14} - 10^{-12} \mu_B$, adiabatic conversion in the envelope ($R &gt; 1000$ km) leads to macroscopic helicity inversion without violating cooling bounds.This RSFP neutrino helicity change induces different signatures for Dirac or Majorana neutrinos in Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) detectors. For Dirac neutrino, a massive flux deficit for Dirac neutrinos due to sterile conversion should be seen. For Majorana neutrinos, the flux will not change but a modification to its spectral decomposition of the cross section should be seen due to the transition from left-handed electron neutrinos to right-handed $\mu$ or $\tau$ anti-neutrinos. An experimental strategy is proposed to minimize the astrophysical uncertainties using the high-energy neutrino tail ($E \approx 1$ GeV) which evades RSFP to normalize the signal. This ratio-based approach effectively cancels astrophysical uncertainties, allowing future detectors to distinguish the fundamental nature of the neutrino and probe magnetic moments down to $10^{-14} \mu_B$, two orders of magnitude beyond current solar limits.</description>

      <title>Solar Flares as a Probe of Neutrino Nature: Distinguishing Dirac and Majorana via Resonant Spin-Flavor Precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant Spin-Flavor Precession (RSFP) of solar neutrinos is studied using the quantum density matrix formalism, explicitly taking into account collisional decoherence and solar matter density profiles. The transition probabilities for standard $^8$B solar neutrinos ($E \approx 10$ MeV) and ultra-high-energy flare neutrinos ($E \gtrsim 1$ GeV) under three magnetic field hypotheses: core-concentrated (Wood-Saxon), tachocline-confined (Gaussian), and turbulent convective (Power Law) are compared. For standard LMA parameters, we show the resonance for 10 MeV neutrinos is strictly confined to the deep solar core ($r &lt; 0.2 R_\odot$), rendering standard solar neutrinos insensitive to outer magnetic fields. Conversely, for 1 GeV flare neutrinos, the resonance shifts to the tachocline and convective zones, where strong fields ($B \sim 50$ kG) drive efficient spin conversion.
  We apply this effect to compute the difference between Dirac or Majorana neutrino scattering cross section as electron-neutrino scattering and Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS). We show that significant asymmetry in these cross section are possible allowing in case of detection to distinguish between Dirac or Majorana neutrinos. In case of null observation, we show that this method can potentially improved the limit on the neutrino magnetic moment by one order to magnitude compared to current limits.</description>

      <title>Novel Signatures of Heavy Neutral Lepton at Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Higgs-strahlung process $\ell^+\ell^-\to Z h$ is one of the most important production channels of the standard model Higgs boson $h$ at the lepton colliders. The cross section reaches the maximum value slightly above the threshold $\sqrt{s}\sim m_Z+m_h$, and decreases as $\sim 1/s$ at high energies. In the gauged extension models, the new gauge boson $Z'$ and heavy Higgs boson $H$ exist after the symmetry breaking. The heavy Higgs-strahlung process $\ell^+\ell^-\to Z' H$ would also reach the maximum cross section around the threshold $\sqrt{s}\sim m_{Z'}+m_H$. Therefore, the future high energy lepton colliders, such as the TeV scale muon collider, are promising to probe this new process. If heavy neutral lepton $N$ is introduced to generate the tiny neutrino masses via seesaw mechanism, novel signatures could arise from $\mu^+\mu^-\to Z' H \to NN +NN \to 4 \mu^\pm +4J$ and $\mu^+\mu^-\to Z' H \to \mu^+\mu^- +NN \to 3 \mu^\pm \mu^\mp +2J$, where the fat-jets $J$ come from the hadronic decay of $W$ bosons. In this paper, we investigate the same-sign tetralepton signature $4\mu^\pm+4J$ and the same-sign trilepton signature $3\mu^\pm \mu^\mp + 2J$ at the 3 TeV and 10 TeV muon collider.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher Information Revealing Parameter Sensitivity in Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determination of the leptonic CP-violating phase $\delta_{\mathrm{CP}}$, the atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}$, and the mass-squared difference $\Delta m_{31}^{2}$ constitutes a primary objective of current and next-generation long-baseline neutrino experiments. We employ QFI (QFI) to establish fundamental precision bounds on single-parameter estimation in three-flavor $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ oscillations, treating the neutrino as an evolving pure quantum state. Computing QFI as a function of the baseline-to-energy ratio $L/E$ for benchmark parameter sets from NuFit-6.0, we find distinct sensitivity hierarchies and $L/E$-dependent structures. Specifically, $\delta_{\mathrm{CP}}$ and $\theta_{23}$ exhibit bimodal QFI profiles with peaks at $L/E \sim 500$ and $1500~\mathrm{km/GeV}$, corresponding to the first and second oscillation maxima, reaching $F_Q(\delta_{\mathrm{CP}}) \sim 0.15$ and $F_Q(\theta_{23}) \sim 15$, respectively. In contrast, $\Delta m_{31}^{2}$ displays a unimodal structure peaking at $L/E \sim 1000$--$1200~\mathrm{km/GeV}$ with $F_Q(\Delta m_{31}^{2}) \sim 3 \times 10^{6}$, reflecting its role in setting the oscillation length scale.</description>

      <title>Resolved photoproduction of the $B_c$ meson in electron-proton collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of $B_c$ meson photoproduction at electron--proton colliders within the framework of nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization. In addition to the dominant direct channel $\gamma+g\to B_c+X$, we include resolved contributions initiated by $g+g$ and $q+\bar q (q=u,d,s)$ subprocesses. Total cross sections and transverse-momentum distributions are calculated for several collider configurations, including HERA, LHeC, FCC-$ep$, and EIC. The numerical results show that the $\gamma+g$ channel provides the leading contribution to the total cross section, while the resolved $g+g$ channel yields a non-negligible correction at the level of ${\cal O}(10\%)$ in the low-$p_T$ region where most events are produced. The $q+\bar q$ channel is found to be numerically insignificant.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the Standard Model effective field theory to dimension eight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) provides a powerful, model-independent framework to explore deviations from the Standard Model (SM) by parametrising potential new physics through higher-dimensional operators. This thesis investigates the renormalisation structure of SMEFT, focusing on dimension-eight operators, which are increasingly relevant in precision analyses and in models where dimension-six effects are suppressed.
  We review renormalisation in quantum field theory, emphasising dimensional regularisation and the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme, and outline the conceptual foundations of EFTs. One of the central results of this work is the systematic construction and classification of bosonic operators in SMEFT at dimension eight, employing Group Theory techniques and removing redundancies by working in momentum space. Building on this operator basis, we compute the complete one-loop renormalisation group equations (RGEs) involving insertions of dimension-eight-or-lower operators. This includes pure dimension-eight effects, pairs of dimension-six operators and lepton-number-violating sectors. Our calculations use an off-shell Green's function basis and leverage algebraic simplifications derived from symmetry and gauge invariance.
  These results are applied to positivity bounds and oblique parameters, providing essential tools for consistent SMEFT analyses across energy scales. The findings extend SMEFT's theoretical reach and support its use in high-precision phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Influence of Non-extensivity on the drag and diffusion coefficients of hadronic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the drag and diffusion coefficients of various hadrons propagating through a hadronic thermal bath by employing the Fokker Planck equation within the framework of Tsallis nonextensive statistics. The nonextensive parameter $q$ accounts for the deviation from equilibrium and provides a more realistic description of the medium that is not perfectly thermalized. The hadronic bath, consisting of various mesonic and baryonic species, is characterized by different mass cutoffs that control the spectral composition of the medium. Our analysis shows that both the drag $F$ and momentum diffusion coefficients $\Gamma$ increases exponentially with temperature and increases systematically with increasing $q$ and mass cutoff. The spatial diffusion coefficient $D_x$ exhibits a decreasing trend with temperature $T$, $q$ and mass cutoff which highlights the significant influence of nonequilibrium effects and hadronic composition on the transport behaviour of hadrons, offering valuable insights into the thermal and dynamical properties of the hadronic phase preceding freezeout in heavy ion collisions. Additionally, we have studied the relaxation time of heavy mesons such as $D_0$, $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$. We found that the heavier mesons relaxed later in comparison to the lighter mesons in the hadronic medium.</description>

      <title>Simulating first-order phase transition during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ending the inflation by vacuum decay is considered infeasible due to the graceful exit problem. Even if considering an alternative field other than the inflaton to realize a first-order phase transition (FoPT) during inflation, it is usually challenging for concrete model building, as bubble nucleations might not be fast and dense enough to successfully end the inflation. In this work, we propose a FoPT at the grand-unification-theory (GUT) scale within the Starobinsky inflation. The key construction is an exponentially evolving potential barrier dynamically controlled by the rolling inflaton, so that almost no bubble is nucleated during the early inflationary era, but with massive bubble nucleations near the end of inflation. With lattice numerical simulations, we have successfully tested this GUT-FoPT during Starobinsky inflation, and the resulting gravitational-wave energy density spectrum reproduces previous analytical estimation with a distinctive oscillation feature at high frequencies.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic polarizabilities of the triplet hadrons in heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic polarizabilities of singly heavy mesons and doubly heavy baryons within the framework of heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory up to $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$. We estimate the low-energy constants using the non-relativistic constituent quark model. A striking prediction of our study is the giant electric polarizabilities of the $D^*$ mesons: $\alpha_E(\bar{D}^{*0}) \approx 291.4 \times 10^{-4} \text{fm}^3$ and $\alpha_E(D^{*-}) \approx -0.4-64.4 i \times 10^{-4} \text{fm}^3$. These anomalously large values arise from the near-degenerate mass between $D^*$ and $D \pi$, which are orders of magnitude larger than those of their bottom counterparts. This kinematic coincidence induces a pronounced cusp structure in the chiral loops, reflecting the long-range dynamics of a pion cloud. For doubly heavy baryons, polarizabilities depend strongly on heavy-flavor composition: the $bcq$ system differs markedly from $ccq$ and $bbq$ due to mixing with scalar heavy-diquark states. Using heavy diquark-antiquark symmetry (HDAS), we unify the chiral dynamics of singly heavy mesons and doubly heavy baryons in the heavy-quark limit. The pion-loop contributions dominate the electromagnetic structure of heavy hadrons and provide essential benchmarks for future lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Chromomagnetic condensation and perturbative confinement induced by imaginary rotation in SU(2) Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perturbatively investigate the rotation effect on the Polyakov loop potential in SU(2) gauge theroy within a chromomagnetic background. It is observed that the imaginary rotation spontaneously induces both confinement and chromomagnetic condensation at high temperatures, thereby provides a perturbative window to explore non-perturbative dynamics. Compared to the case without including the induced chromomagnetic field, the perturbative confinement transition becomes first-order, with a temperature-dependent phase boundary that asymptotically approaches $\tilde{\Omega}_c = \pi/\sqrt{3}$ at high temperatures. This leads to a significantly enriched $\tilde{\Omega}$-$T$ phase diagram characterized by an expanded deconfined region. For real angular velocities, we find that the chromomagnetic condensate decreases with increasing rotation, and that the coupling between rotation, spin, and the chromomagnetic background leads to a cusp in the Polyakov loop potential, suggesting that the underlying dynamics could be more intricate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-temperature SU(2) Savvidy model under an imaginary angular velocity. Employing the background-field method, we derive the one-loop effective potential and analyze both its real and imaginary parts. We demonstrate that imaginary rotation modifies the chromomagnetic condensate and the Polyakov loop, and can partially suppress the Nielsen-Olesen instability of the chromomagnetic background. Moreover, a high-temperature expansion shows that imaginary rotation strengthens the effective coupling and that the chromomagnetic field induces a negative contribution to the moment of inertia.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass ordering in JUNO at risk from scalar NSI induced resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of neutrino mass ordering (NMO) is the primary goal of the currently running JUNO reactor experiment. We show that the measurement of NMO at JUNO may severely deteriorate in the presence of non-standard neutrino interactions mediated by a beyond standard model scalar (SNSI). Taking inverted ordering and the lightest neutrino mass at $m_l=0.01$ eV, the NMO sensitivity falls below $2\sigma$ for SNSI parameter values in the range $\eta_{ee}&lt; -7.1\times 10^{-3}$ and $\eta_{ee} &gt; 3.3\times 10^{-3}$. More importantly, for $\eta_{ee} \gtrsim 5.7\times 10^{-3}$ the NMO sensitivity in JUNO is completely lost. We show that this is due to the presence of a hitherto unrecognized resonant enhancement of the mixing angle $\theta_{12}$, which gives rise to a mass ordering degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Order-$v^2$ relativistic corrections to heavy-quark fragmentation into $P$-wave quarkonium states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization,and based on the Collins--Soper operator definition of fragmentation functions, we present a systematic calculation of the fragmentation functions for a heavy quark fragmenting into color-singlet $P$-wave quarkonium states. After reproducing and confirming the known leading-order results, we further compute the relativistic corrections up to order $\mathcal{O}(v^{2})$. Our analysis applies both to quarkonium systems composed of heavy quarks with the same flavor and to $B_c$-type mesons formed by heavy quarks of different flavors. Numerical results show that, for all color-singlet $P$-wave channels, the $\mathcal{O}(v^{2})$ relativistic corrections give sizable negative contributions over most of the momentum-fraction $z$ region. We further compute inclusive cross sections for $P$-wave quarkonium plus charmed hadrons in $e^+e^-$ annihilation via the single photon process up to $\mathcal{O}(v^{2})$ by applying our obtained fragmentation functions, and the resulting predictions are consistent with the full fixed-order results in the high-energy region.</description>

      <title>Induced-Gravity Higgs Inflation in Palatini Supergravity Confronts ACT DR6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate within Palatini Supergravity a model of induced-gravity inflation excellently consistent with ACT DR6. The inflaton belongs in the decomposition of a conjugate pair of Higgs superfields which lead to the spontaneous breaking of a U(1)B-L symmetry at a scale close to the range (0.102-5.85)x10^16 GeV. The inflaton field is canonically normalized thanks to a real and shift-symmetric contribution into the Kaehler potential. It also includes two separate holomorphic and antiholomorphic logarithmic terms, the argument of which can be interpreted as the coupling of the inflaton to the Ricci scalar. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and energy scales below the cut-off scale of the corresponding effective theory. Embedding the model in a B-L extension of the MSSM we show how the mu parameter can be generated and non-thermal leptogenesis can be successfully realized. An outcome of our scheme is split SUSY with gravitino mass in the range (40-60) PeV, which is consistent with the results of LHC on the Higgs boson mass.</description>

      <title>The Pion Sum Rule beyond the Chiral Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The difference between the charged and neutral pion masses can be predicted from a well-known dispersion relation involving an infinite-energy integral over experimental data, the pion sum rule. This relation, however, holds only in the chiral limit. Here we combine several nonperturbative techniques to determine the form of the physical finite-energy integral, thereby generalizing this sum rule to include effects linear in the light-quark masses. We test the dispersion relation using hadronic tau-decay data.</description>

      <title>Early-universe constraints on the electron mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of a nonstandard electron mass $m_e$ on early-Universe thermal history, focusing on neutrino decoupling and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). In the standard cosmology, neutrino--electron interactions keep neutrinos in thermal contact with the electromagnetic plasma until shortly before $e^\pm$ annihilation. Varying $m_e$ shifts the decoupling epoch and the entropy transfer from $e^\pm$ annihilation, thereby modifying the neutrino energy density and the inferred effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$. Independently, during BBN the rates of charged-current weak processes, and hence the neutron-to-proton ratio, depend on $m_e$. By confronting BBN predictions for the primordial light-element abundances with observations and imposing cosmological constraints on $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, we obtain a bound on $m_e$ in the early Universe of $m_e = 0.504^{+0.007}_{-0.006}$ MeV or $m_e=0.510\pm0.007$ MeV ($1\sigma$), depending on the considered nuclear reaction network (NACRE II or PRIMAT, respectively). The allowed range is close to the present laboratory value at the level of 1.4\%, thus supporting the constancy of the electron mass over cosmological timescales.</description>

      <title>Violation of the Conformal Limit at Finite Density: Insights from Effective Models and Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss recent results obtained with the application of the medium separation scheme (MSS) in different contexts where a clear violation of the conformal limit for the speed of sound at finite density has been observed in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We analyze several scenarios, including QCD at finite isospin density, two-color QCD, and two-flavor color superconductivity. Whenever possible, we compare our findings with lattice QCD (LQCD) results, showing that the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model combined with the MSS provides a consistent description across different regimes of the QCD phase diagram. Our analysis highlights how effective models, when properly regularized, can capture essential nonperturbative features of dense QCD matter, offering complementary insights to lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>A POWHEG generator for di-jet production in polarized proton-proton collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new Monte-Carlo generator for the simulation of di-jet production in polarized proton-proton collisions at the next-to-leading order in QCD matched to parton showers using the framework of the POWHEG BOX. With this program we compute a variety of observables of immediate relevance for the spin program of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. While parton-shower effects are generally small, we find that in some search regions their inclusion improves agreement of predictions with data. Moreover, we provide a critical assessment of selection criteria applied in experiment in the light of perturbative stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization that primordial black holes (PBHs) might be some fraction of the dark matter begged the question, how often do PBHs enter the solar system? For a Neptune radius solar system the answer is, rarely. For an Oort cloud sized system the answer is different. Simulations of bombardment of the Oort cloud by dark matter suggest that dislodgement of protocomets and their entry into the inner solar system can match the observed frequency of comets, if that PBH fraction is high enough. Comets were traditionally considered as messengers, usually omens. After 50 years of puzzlement regarding dark matter, we need a hint from the dark universe about the size and nature of dark matter particles.</description>

      <title>Influence of spatial curvature in cosmological particle production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze cosmological particle production driven by spacetime expansion in the early universe for homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies with positive, negative, and zero spatial curvature. We prioritize analytical results to gain a deeper understanding of curvature-induced effects. Specifically, for a conformally coupled scalar field, we model the inflationary epoch as an exact de Sitter phase followed by a transition to a static universe. Both instantaneous and smooth exits from inflation are considered, the latter being implemented via the adiabatic vacuum prescription. Starting from an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum, we derive the associated mode functions carefully adapted to each curvature sign. Using the Bogoliubov formalism, we non-perturbatively compute the number density of produced scalar particles. Our results demonstrate that spatial curvature significantly impacts the resulting particle spectra, particularly for light fields, where the deviation from the flat-space scenario is most prominent and can reach several orders of magnitude</description>

      <title>Neglecting correlations leads to misestimated model errors in EFT predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian analyses of the convergence pattern of Effective Field Theories (EFTs) enable estimation of the uncertainty induced by a truncated expansion. When an EFT that has been calibrated to data is used to make a prediction this truncation uncertainty enters the posterior predictive distribution twice: directly from the finite-order calculation of the predicted quantity and indirectly through the posterior probability distributions of the EFT low-energy constants (LECs) determined by the calibration. In this work, we focus on the interplay of these two sources of uncertainty. We do this in the context of a toy EFT that we fit to pseudodata and use to make predictions. Direct EFT truncation uncertainty and LEC uncertainty are correlated in predictions when the predicted quantity is correlated with the observables used to fit the LECs. Here this results in the overall theoretical uncertainty in the EFT prediction being smaller than either the uncertainty induced by the truncation error or that stemming from the LECs alone.</description>

      <title>Bound States in Lee's Complex Ghost Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theories (QFTs) including fourth-derivative terms such as the Lee-Wick finite QED and quadratic gravity have a better ultra-violet behavior compared to standard theories with second-derivative ones, but the existence of ghost with negative norm endangers unitarity. Such a ghost in general acquires a pair of complex conjugate masses from radiative corrections whose features are concisely described by the so-called Lee model. Working with the canonical operator formalism of QFTs, we investigate the issue of bound states in the Lee model. We find that the bound states cannot be created from ghosts by contributions of a complex delta function, which is a complex generalization of the well-known Dirac delta function. Since the cause of unitarity violation in the Lee-Wick model is the existence of the complex delta function instead of the Dirac delta function, it is of interest to notice that the violation of the unitarity is also connected to the non-existence of bound states. Finally, the problem of amelioration of the unitarity in quadratic gravity is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Detecting gravitational wave background with equivalent configurations in the network of space based optical lattice clocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The network of space based optical lattice clocks (OLCs) has been proposed to detect the stochastic gravitational wave background. We investigate the overlap reduction function (ORF) of the OLC detector network and analytically derive a transformation that leaves the ORF invariant. This transformation is applicable to configurations with two OLC detectors, each equipped with a one-way link. It can map a configuration with small separation and high noise correlation to another configuration with larger separation and reduced noise correlation. Using this transformation, we obtain a favourable OLC detector network configuration with high cross-correlation response, and compare its sensitivity to that of space-based laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first quantum-simulation study of bound and resonant doubly-bottom tetraquark states within a QCD-inspired chiral quark model. An effective four-quark Hamiltonian is mapped onto a 16-qubit register, encoding color, spin, and spatial degrees of freedom, and incorporating both meson-meson and diquark-antidiquark configurations with complete color bases. Using a variational quantum eigensolver, we identify bound and resonance states in the low-lying $S$-wave sector. Deeply bound states are found exclusively in the isoscalar $I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})$ channel, dominated by color-singlet meson-meson components with non-negligible hidden-color contributions. The resulting masses and binding energies are consistent with classical chiral quark model predictions, establishing quantum simulation as a viable framework for studying exotic multiquark states beyond the reach of conventional methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the consequences of allowing non-Hermitian structures in quantum cosmology by extending the Wheeler DeWitt framework beyond strictly Hermitian dynamics. Using a controlled semiclassical reduction, we show how anti Hermitian contributions propagate into both early universe primordial fluctuations and late-time structure growth as effective damping or gain terms. Confronting this framework with inflationary observables, growth of structure and the observed near flatness of the universe, we derive strong infrared constraints that suppress non Hermiticity across cosmic history. We demonstrate that these bounds are mutually consistent between early and late-time probes and can be partially relaxed in theories beyond General Relativity. Our results establish cosmology as a novel arena for testing foundational aspects of quantum mechanics and suggest that Hermiticity may emerge dynamically along the semiclassical branch describing our universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential of conducting an experiment in a low Earth orbit spacecraft and using the Earth a spin and mass source to constrain beyond-the-standard-model (BSM) long-range spin- and velocity-dependent interactions, which are mediated by the exchange of an ultralight $\left(m_{Z^{\prime}}&lt;10^{-10}\text{eV}\right)$ or massless intermediate vector boson. The high speed of the low Earth orbit spacecraft can enhance the sensitivity to velocity-dependent interactions. The periodicity enables efficient extraction of signals from background noise, thereby improving the experiment's accuracy. Combining these advantages, we demonstrate theoretically that the novel Spacecraft-Earth model can improve existing bounds on these exotic interactions by up to three orders of magnitude, using the China Space Station (CSS) as a representative low-Earth-orbit carrier. Such a model, if successfully implemented, may provide an innovative strategy for detecting ultralight dark matter and yield tighter constraints on certain coupling constants of exotic interactions.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic decomposition of QCD splitting functions into scalar dipole radiators and pure splitting remainders up to second order in the strong coupling. The individual components contain terms that are formally sub-leading in soft or collinear scaling parameters, but well understood and universal due to their origin in scalar QCD. The multipole radiator functions which we derive share essential features of the known double-soft and one-loop soft gluon currents, and are not based on kinematical approximations.</description>

      <title>Probing lepton flavor violating dark matter scenarios via astrophysical photons and positrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter we explore, for the first time, the constraints on lepton flavor violating (LFV) dark matter (DM) scenarios via the astrophysical photons and positrons, including both the annihilation and decay modes, ${\tt DM(+DM)}\to e^\pm \mu^\mp, e^\pm \tau^\mp, \mu^\pm \tau^\mp$. Given the presence of LFV interactions in various DM models and the challenge of probing such interactions at terrestrial facilities, such as DM direct detection and collider experiments, indirect detection offers a unique approach to investigating them. We utilize the currently available photon datasets from the XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL, and Fermi-LAT telescopes, along with the positron datasets from the AMS-02 satellite, to establish stringent bounds on the relevant annihilation cross sections or decay widths. In particular, we include contributions to the photon spectrum from final state radiation, radiative decays, and inverse Compton scattering. We find that the INTEGRAL (AMS-02) provides the most stringent bound on the annihilation cross sections and decay widths for DM mass below (above) approximately 20 GeV, which are comparable to those of their lepton flavor conserving counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the applicability of Achilles (A CHIcagoLand Lepton Event Simulator) by incorporating the single-pion production mechanism in a fully exclusive fashion. The electroweak interaction vertex is modeled by combining the state-of-the-art Dynamical Coupled-Channels approach with realistic hole spectral functions, which account for correlations in both the initial target state and the residual spectator system. Final-state interactions are treated using a semi-classical intranuclear cascade that leverages nuclear configurations to determine the correlated spatial distribution of protons and neutrons. The meson-baryon scattering amplitudes used in the cascade are computed within the Dynamical Coupled-Channels framework, consistent with the electroweak vertex. To model pion absorption, we employ the optical potential approach of Oset and Salcedo. As an alternative approach, we explicitly model the production and propagation of resonances which mediate pion-nucleon scattering and pion absorption. We validate out approach against pion-nucleon and pion-nucleus scattering data, and present comparisons with electron- and neutrino-nucleus measurements from e4$\nu$, T2K, MINER$\nu$A, and MicroBooNE.</description>

Abstract: We propose heavy decaying dark matter (DM) as a new probe of the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B). Heavy DM, with mass $\gtrsim 10^9$ GeV, decaying into neutrinos can be a new source of ultrahigh-energy (UHE) neutrinos. Including this contribution along with the measured astrophysical and predicted cosmogenic neutrino fluxes, we study the scattering of UHE neutrinos with the C$\nu$B via standard weak interactions mediated by the $Z$ boson. We solve the complete neutrino transport equation, taking into account both absorption and reinjection effects, to calculate the expected spectrum of UHE neutrino flux at future neutrino telescopes, such as the IceCube-Gen2 radio. We argue that such observations can be used to probe the C$\nu$B properties and, in particular, local C$\nu$B clustering. We find that, depending on the absolute neutrino mass and the DM mass and lifetime, a local C$\nu$B overdensity $\gtrsim 10^6$ can be probed at the IceCube-Gen2 radio within ten years of data taking.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the vacuum-to-vacuum correlator of two quark tensor currents with two massive quarks, retaining full momentum dependence. For the first time, we include perturbative corrections up to next-to-leading order. Our fully analytical expressions are provided in machine-readable form. Furthermore, we present numerical results for various input parameters, including an estimate of the scale uncertainties. Our results are essential input for applications of dispersive methods, including unitarity bounds and QCD sum rules.</description>

      <title>Rescattering-induced $D\to SS$ weak decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate two-body non-leptonic $D\to SS$ weak decays, where $S$ denotes a light scalar meson such as $a_0/a_0(980)$, $f_0/f_0(980)$, or $\sigma_0/f_0(500)$. Short-distance topologies from $W$-boson emission and annihilation (exchange) are found to be negligible, while long-distance final-state interactions provide the dominant contributions. In particular, triangle rescattering processes, $D \to \pi\eta^{(\prime)} \to \sigma_0 a_0$ and $D \to a_1(1260)\eta \to \sigma_0 a_0$, mediated by pion exchange in $\pi\eta^{(\prime)}$ and $a_1(1260)\eta$ scatterings, respectively, are identified as the leading mechanisms. Our calculations yield branching fractions ${\cal B}(D_s^+ \to \sigma_0 a_0^+) = (1.0 \pm 0.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}) \times 10^{-2}$, ${\cal B}(D^+ \to \sigma_0 a_0^+) = (1.1 \pm 0.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}) \times 10^{-3}$, and ${\cal B}(D^0 \to \sigma_0 a_0^0) = (0.9 \pm 0.2^{+0.2}_{-0.3}) \times 10^{-5}$. For the Cabibbo-allowed decay mode $D_s^+ \to f_0 a_0^+$, the near-threshold condition $m_{D_s}\simeq m_{f_0}+m_{a_0}$ limits the phase space, suppressing the branching fraction to $(3.4\pm0.3^{+0.4}_{-0.9})\times 10^{-4}$. These results highlight rescattering-induced $D\to SS$ decays as promising channels for experimental studies at BESIII, Belle(-II), and LHCb.</description>

      <title>Exclusive photoproduction of light and heavy vector mesons: thresholds to very high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A reaction model for $\gamma + p \to V + p$, $V=\rho^0, \phi, J/\psi, \Upsilon$, which exposes the quark-antiquark content of the photon in making the transition $\gamma\to {q} \bar{q} + \mathbb P \to V$, where ${q}$ depends on $V$, and couples the intermediate ${q} \bar{q}$ system to the proton's valence quarks via Pomeron ($\mathbb P$) exchange, is used to deliver a unified description of available data -- both differential and total cross sections -- from near threshold to very high energies, $W$, for all the $V$-mesons. For the $\Upsilon$, this means $10\lesssim W/{\rm GeV} \lesssim 2\,000$. Also provided are predictions for the power-law exponents that are empirically used to characterise the large-$W$ behaviour of the total cross sections and slope parameters characterising the near-threshold differential cross sections. Appealing to notions of vector meson dominance, the latter have been interpreted as vector-meson--proton scattering lengths. The body of results indicate that it is premature to link any $\gamma + p \to V + p$ data with, for instance, in-proton gluon distributions, the quantum chromodynamics trace anomaly, or pentaquark production. Further developments in reaction theory and higher precision data are required before the validity of any such links can be assessed.</description>

      <title>Partial-Wave Unitarity Bounds on Higher-Dimensional Operators from 2-to-$N$ Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic method for deriving partial-wave unitarity bounds on Wilson coefficients of higher-dimensional operators in effective field theories involving more than four fields, which naturally appear in tree-level 2-to-$N$ scattering processes with $N \geq 3$. Unlike 2-to-2 scattering, 2-to-$N$ scattering with $N \geq 3$ features multiple amplitudes associated with the same total angular momentum. To resolve these degeneracies, we provide a way to construct an orthonormal amplitude basis by parameterizing the phase space manifold of massless particles using spinor-helicity variables, enabling analytical integration over the phase space with arbitrary particle numbers. We provide Mathematica code to analytically evaluate phase space integrals of interference between two local on-shell amplitudes up to four final-state particles, with straightforward generalization to $N$ final-state particles. As practical applications, we demonstrate the use of this tool by deriving unitarity bounds on some dimension-7 and dimension-8 operators in the Standard Model effective field theory involving five and six fields, respectively.</description>

      <title>WIMP Freeze-out dynamics under Tsallis statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize thermal WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) freeze-out within Tsallis nonextensive statistics. Using Curado-Tsallis $q$-distributions $f_q(E;\mu,T)$ we compute $q$-deformed number and energy densities, pressure, entropy density and Hubble rate, $\{n_q,\rho_q,P_q,s_q,H_q\}$. The Boltzmann equation is generalized accordingly to obtain the comoving abundance $Y_{\chi,q}(x)$ and relic density $\Omega_{\chi,q}h^2$ for a dark-matter candidate $\chi$ in a model-independent setup. The thermally averaged cross section is expanded as $\langle\sigma v\rangle_q \approx a + b\,\langle v_{\rm rel}^2\rangle_q$ up to $p$-wave. The freeze-out parameter $x_f(q)$ is determined from $\Gamma_{{\rm ann},q}(T_f)\simeq H_q(T_f)$ using a $q$-logarithmic inversion, with the expansion rate modified through ultra-relativistic rescalings $R_\rho(q)$ of the effective relativistic degrees of freedom $g_*$ and $g_{*s}$. We show that $x_f$ increases with $q$ and that QCD-threshold features propagate into $Y_{\chi,q}(x)$ and $\Omega_{\chi,q}h^2$. We then perform two $q$-grid scans: fixing $\langle\sigma v\rangle_q$ while varying the dark-matter mass $m_\chi$, and fixing $m_\chi$ while varying the $s$-wave coefficient $a$. For an $s$-wave dominated scenario we construct $\chi^2$ profiles in these planes by comparing $\Omega_{\chi,q}h^2$ with the Planck benchmark $\Omega_c h^2 = 0.120\pm 0.001$. In both cases we find a clear degeneracy in the preferred nonextensive parameter $q_{\rm best}$ along valleys in parameter space. However, fixed-mass scans (varying $\langle\sigma v\rangle_q$) are significantly more constraining than fixed-cross-section scans, reflecting that $\Omega_{\chi,q}h^2$ is mainly controlled by $\langle\sigma v\rangle_q$, so that for realistic cross sections the best-fit $q_{\rm best}$ remains close to the extensive limit $q\to 1$.</description>

      <title>Misalignment dynamics of Scalar Condensates with Yukawa coupling: Particle and Entropy Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Misalignment dynamics, the non-equilibrium evolution of a scalar (or pseudoscalar) condensate in a potential landscape, broadly describes a solution to the strong CP problem, a mechanism for cold dark matter production and (pre) reheating post inflation. Often, radiative corrections are included phenomenologically by replacing the potential by the effective potential which is a \emph{static quantity}, its usefulness is restricted to (near) equilibrium situations. We study the misalignment dynamics of a scalar condensate Yukawa coupled to $N_f$ fermions in a manifestly energy conserving, fully renormalized Hamiltonian framework. A large $N_f$ limit allows us to focus on the fermion degrees of freedom, which yield a negative contribution to the effective potential, a radiatively induced instability and ultraviolet divergent field renormalization. We introduce an adiabatic basis and an adiabatic expansion that embodies the derivative expansion in the effective action, the zeroth order is identified with the effective potential, higher orders account for the derivative expansion including field renormalization and describe profuse particle production. Energy conserving dynamics leads to the conjecture of emergent asymptotic highly excited stationary states with a distribution function $n_k(\infty)\propto 1/k^6$ and an extensive entropy which is identified with an entanglement entropy. Subtle aspects of renormalization associated with the initial value problem are analyzed and resolved. Possible new manifestations of asymptotic spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) as a consequence of the dynamics even in absence of tree level (SSB), and cosmological inferences are discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing torsion field with Einstein-Cartan gravity at the HL-LHC: an angular distribution case study</title>

Abstract: This analysis utilizes simulated data privately generated based on the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) configuration to investigate the angular distribution of high-mass dimuon pairs produced during the foreseen proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV. The study focuses on the cos$\theta_{CS}$ variable, which is defined in the Collins-Soper frame. In the Standard Model, the production of high-mass dimuon pairs is primarily governed by the Drell-Yan process, which demonstrates a significant forward-backward asymmetry. However, scenarios beyond the Standard Model suggest different shapes for the cos$\theta_{CS}$ distribution. By observing excess events not predicted by the Standard Model, the angular distribution can help differentiate among these alternative models. Furthermore, we used a simplified Einstein-Cartan gravity model to analyze the simulated data. This analysis established upper limits at the 95\% confidence level regarding the masses of various particles within the model, including a spin-2 dark neutral gauge boson and the torsion field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute Mellin moments of the heavy-quark structure functions in deep-inelastic scattering at next-to-leading order in quantum chromodynamics, retaining their full dependence on the heavy-quark mass. Using the optical theorem and the operator product expansion, we derive analytic results for fixed Mellin moments $N = 2$ to $22$ of the structure functions $F_2$ and $F_L$. Our results reproduce the known expressions in the relevant asymptotic limits, in particular for virtualities of the exchanged photon $Q^2$ much larger than the heavy-quark mass squared $m^2$, and are in agreement with existing parametrisations of the next-to-leading-order coefficient functions. The computational set-up developed in this work also provides a direct pathway toward extending these calculations to next-to-next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Feebly Interacting Particles in a First Order Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First order phase transitions are well-motivated and extensively studied sources of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. The vacuum energy released during such transitions is assumed to be transferred primarily either to the expanding bubble walls, whose collisions source GWs, or to the surrounding plasma, producing sound waves and turbulence, which source GWs. In this Letter, we study an alternative possibility that has not yet been considered: the released energy gets transferred primarily to feebly interacting particles that do not form a coherent interacting plasma but simply free-stream individually. We develop the formalism to study the production of GWs from such configurations, and demonstrate that such GW signals have qualitatively distinct characteristics compared to conventional sources and are potentially observable with near-future GW detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study bottomonium suppression in $p+ {\rm Pb}$ relative to $p+p$ collisions at center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 5.02$ and 8.16~TeV. Specifically, we combine cold nuclear matter effects (nuclear modifications of the parton densities, energy loss and momentum broadening) with those from hot nuclear matter (suppression and regeneration) by implementing the formation of a quark-gluon plasma in hydrodynamic simulations. Bottomonium transport in the quark-gluon plasma is evaluated semiclassically, employing two different reaction rates. The first includes quasi-free inelastic scattering and gluo-dissociation employing a perturbative coupling to the medium. The second is based on in-medium $T$-matrix calculations where the input potential is constrained by lattice quantum chromodynamics to extract the bottomonium masses and dissociation rates. These semiclassical results are compared to previous calculations in an open quantum systems approach and to the experimental data. Predictions for $\chi_b$ suppression at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 8.16$~TeV are also presented.</description>

      <title>Resonant W and Z Boson Production in FSRQ Jets: Implications for Diffuse Neutrino Fluxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blazars, particularly Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), are well-known for their ability to accelerate a substantial population of electrons and positrons, as inferred from multiwavelength radiation observations. Therefore, these astrophysical objects are promising candidates for studying high-energy electron--positron interactions, such as the production of $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons. In this work, we explore the implications of electron--positron annihilation processes in the jet environments of FSRQs, focusing on the resonant production of electroweak bosons and their potential contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux. By modeling the electron distribution in the jet of the FSRQ 3C~279 during a flaring state, we calculate the reaction rates for $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons and estimate the resulting diffuse fluxes from the cosmological population of FSRQs. We incorporate the FSRQ luminosity function and its redshift evolution to account for the population distribution across cosmic time, finding that the differential flux contribution exhibits a pronounced peak at redshift $z \sim 1$. While the expected fluxes remain well below the detection thresholds of current neutrino observatories such as IceCube, KM3NeT, or Baikal-GVD, the flux from $Z$ boson production within the jet blob is many orders of magnitude smaller than the total diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux. These results provide a theoretical benchmark for the role of Standard Model electroweak processes in extreme astrophysical environments, highlighting the interplay between particle physics and astrophysics, and illustrating that even extremely rare high-energy interactions can leave a subtle, theoretically meaningful imprint on the diffuse astrophysical neutrino background.</description>

      <title>Search for a hypothetical gauge boson and dark photons in charmonium transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a direct search for a new gauge boson, $X$, with a mass of $17~\text{MeV}/c^2$, which could explain the anomalous excess of $e^+e^-$ pairs observed in the $^8\text{Be}$ nuclear transitions. The search is conducted in the charmonium decays $\chi_{cJ}\to X J/\psi~(J=0,1,2)$ via the radiative transition $\psi(3686)\to\gamma\chi_{cJ}$ using $\left(2712.4\pm 14.3 \right)\times 10^6$ $\psi(3686)$ events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider. No significant signal is observed, and the updated upper limit on the coupling strength of charm quark and the new gauge boson, $\epsilon_c$, is set to be $|\epsilon_c|&lt;1.2\times 10^{-2}$ at $90\%$ confidence level. We also report new constraints on the mixing strength $\epsilon$ between the Standard Model photon and dark photon $\gamma^\prime$ in the mass range from $5~\text{MeV}/c^2$ to $300~\text{MeV}/c^2$. The upper limits at $90\%$ confidence level vary within $(2.5-17.5)\times 10^{-3}$ depending on the $\gamma^\prime $ mass.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Spectral Shapes as a probe of Long Lived Right-handed Neutrinos, Leptogenesis and Dark Matter: Global versus Local B-L Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scale of the seesaw mechanism is typically much larger than the electroweak scale. This hierarchy can be naturally explained by $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, which after spontaneous symmetry breaking, simultaneously generates Majorana masses for neutrinos and produces a network of cosmic strings. Such strings generate a gravitational wave (GW) spectrum which is expected to be almost uniform in frequency unless there is a departure from the usual early radiation domination. We explore this possibility in Type I, II and III seesaw frameworks, finding that only for Type-I, long-lived right-handed neutrinos (RHN) may provide a period of early matter domination for parts of the parameter space, even if they are thermally produced. Such a period leaves distinctive imprints in the GW spectrum in the form of characteristic breaks and a knee feature, arising due to the end and start of the periods of RHN domination. These features, if detected, directly determine the mass $M$, and effective neutrino mass $\tilde m$ of the dominating RHN. We find that GW detectors like LISA and ET could probe RHN masses in the range $M\in[0.1,10^{9}]$ GeV and effective neutrino masses in the $\tilde m\in[10^{-10},10^{-8}]$ eV range. We investigate the phenomenological implications of long-lived right-handed neutrinos for both local and global $U(1)_{B-L}$ strings, focusing on dark matter production and leptogenesis. We map the viable and detectable parameter space for successful baryogenesis and asymmetric dark matter production from right-handed neutrino decays. We derive analytical and semi-analytical relations correlating the characteristic gravitational-wave frequencies to the neutrino parameters $\tilde m$ and $M$, as well as to the relic abundances of dark matter and baryons.</description>

      <title>Prompt cusps in hierarchical dark matter halos: Implications for annihilation boost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent simulations have identified long-lived ``prompt cusps'' --  compact remnants of early density peaks with inner profiles $\rho\propto r^{-3/2}$. They can survive hierarchical assembly and potentially enhance signals of dark matter annihilation. In this work, we incorporate prompt cusps into the semi-analytic substructure framework SASHIMI, enabling a fully hierarchical, environment-dependent calculation of the annihilation luminosity that consistently tracks subhalos, sub-subhalos, and tidal stripping. We assign prompt cusps to first-generation microhalos and propagate their survival through the merger history, including an explicit treatment of cusps associated with stripped substructure. We find that the substructure hierarchy converges rapidly once a few levels are included, and that prompt cusps can raise the total annihilation boost of Milky-Way--size hosts at $z=0$ to $B\sim 50$ for fiducial cusp-occupation assumptions, compared to a subhalo-only baseline of $B_{\rm sh}\sim\mathrm{few}$. Across a wide range of host masses and redshifts, prompt cusps increase the normalization of $B(M_{\rm host},z)$ while largely preserving its mass and redshift trends. Compared to universal-average, peak-based estimates, our fiducial boosts are lower by about a factor of a few, primarily reflecting a correspondingly smaller inferred cusp abundance in host halos, highlighting the importance of unifying peak-based cusp formation with merger-tree evolution and environmental dependence.</description>
