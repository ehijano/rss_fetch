      <title>An unified approach to link prediction in collaboration networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates and compares three approaches to link prediction in colaboration networks, namely, an ERGM (Exponential Random Graph Model; Robins et al. 2007), a GCN (Graph Convolutional Network; Kipf and Welling 2017), and a Word2Vec+MLP model (Word2Vec model combined with a multilayer neural network; Mikolov et al. 2013a and Goodfellow et al. 2016). The ERGM, grounded in statistical methods, is employed to capture general structural patterns within the network, while the GCN and Word2Vec+MLP models leverage deep learning techniques to learn adaptive structural representations of nodes and their relationships. The predictive performance of the models is assessed through extensive simulation exercises using cross-validation, with metrics based on the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results clearly show the superiority of machine learning approaches in link prediction, particularly in large networks, where traditional models such as ERGM exhibit limitations in scalability and the ability to capture inherent complexities. These findings highlight the potential benefits of integrating statistical modeling techniques with deep learning methods to analyze complex networks, providing a more robust and effective framework for future research in this field.</description>

      <title>Cost efficiency of fMRI studies using resting-state vs task-based functional connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether and how we can improve the cost efficiency of neuroimaging studies with well-tailored fMRI tasks. The comparative study is conducted using a novel network science-driven Bayesian connectome-based predictive method, which incorporates network theories in model building and substantially improves precision and robustness in imaging biomarker detection. The robustness of the method lays the foundation for identifying predictive power differential across fMRI task conditions if such difference exists. When applied to a clinically heterogeneous transdiagnostic cohort, we found shared and distinct functional fingerprints of neuropsychological outcomes across seven fMRI conditions. For example, emotional N-back memory task was found to be less optimal for negative emotion outcomes, and gradual-onset continuous performance task was found to have stronger links with sensitivity and sociability outcomes than with cognitive control outcomes. Together, our results show that there are unique optimal pairings of task-based fMRI conditions and neuropsychological outcomes that should not be ignored when designing well-powered neuroimaging studies.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning Between U.S. Presidential Elections: How Should We Learn From A 2020 Ad Campaign To Inform 2024 Ad Campaigns?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the 2024 U.S. presidential election, would negative, digital ads against Donald Trump impact voter turnout in Pennsylvania (PA), a key "tipping point" state? The gold standard to address this question, a randomized experiment where voters get randomized to different ads, yields unbiased estimates of the ad effect, but is very expensive. Instead, we propose a less-than-ideal, but significantly cheaper and likely faster framework based on transfer learning, where we transfer knowledge from a past ad experiment in 2020 to evaluate ads for 2024. A key component of our framework is a sensitivity analysis that quantifies the unobservable differences between past and future elections, which can be calibrated in a data-driven manner. We propose two estimators of the 2024 ad effect: a simple regression estimator with bootstrap, which we recommend for practitioners in this field, and an estimator based on the efficient influence function for broader applications. Using our framework, we estimate the effect of running a negative, digital ad campaign against Trump on voter turnout in PA for the 2024 election. Our findings indicate effect heterogeneity across counties of PA and among important subgroups stratified by gender, urbanicity, and education attainment.</description>

      <title>On Optimal Planning of Progressive Type-I Interval Censoring Schemes under Dependent Competing Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers designing of reliability acceptance sampling plan (RASP) when the competing risk data are progressively interval-censored. The methodology uses the asymptotic results of the estimators of parameters of any lifetime distribution under progressive interval censored competing risk data. Therefore, we establish a simplified form of the Fisher information matrix and present the asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) under a set of regularity conditions. Next, we consider a special case to illustrate the proposed RASP. we assume that the lifetime of the item due to the individual cause follows Weibull distribution. Also, it is assumed that the components are dependent and the gamma frailty model describes the dependent structure between the components. Now, we obtain the optimal RASP in three different ways. First, We present the method for obtaining optimal sample size and acceptance limit using producer's and consumer's risks. Next, we determine the optimal RASP under C-optimal criteria without cost constraints and with cost constraints. Numerical example is performed for both independent and dependent cases. Also, Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted in order to show that the sampling plans meet the specified risks for finite sample size.</description>

      <title>Relative Survival Analysis Using Bayesian Decision Tree Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cancer epidemiology, the \emph{relative survival framework} is used to quantify the hazard associated with cancer by comparing the all-cause mortality hazard in cancer patients to that of the general population. This framework assumes that an individual's hazard function is the sum of a known population hazard and an excess hazard associated with the cancer. Several estimands are derived from the excess hazard, including the \emph{net survival}, which are used to inform decisions and to assess the effectiveness of interventions on cancer management. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian machine learning approach to estimating the excess hazard and identifying vulnerable subgroups, with a higher excess risk, using Bayesian additive regression trees (BART). We first develop a proportional hazards extension of the BART model to the relative survival setting, and then extend this model to non-proportional hazards. We develop tools for model interpretation and posterior summarization and then present an application using colon cancer data from England, highlighting the insights our proposed methodology offers when paired with state-of-the-art data linkage methods. This application demonstrates how these methods can be used to identify drivers of inequalities in cancer survival through variable importance quantification.</description>

      <title>Modeling Home Range and Intra-Specific Spatial Interaction in Wild Animal Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions among individuals from the same-species of wild animals are an important component of population dynamics. An interaction can be either static (based on overlap of space use) or dynamic (based on movement). The goal of this work is to determine the level of static interactions between individuals from the same-species of wild animals using 95\% and 50\% home ranges, as well as to model their movement interactions, which could include attraction, avoidance (or repulsion), or lack of interaction, in order to gain new insights and improve our understanding of ecological processes. Home range estimation methods (minimum convex polygon, kernel density estimator, and autocorrelated kernel density estimator), inhomogeneous multitype (or cross-type) summary statistics, and envelope testing methods (pointwise and global envelope tests) were proposed to study the nature of the same-species wild-animal spatial interactions. Using GPS collar data, we applied the methods to quantify both static and dynamic interactions between black bears in southern Alabama, USA. In general, our findings suggest that the black bears in our dataset showed no significant preference to live together or apart, i.e., there was no significant deviation from independence toward association or avoidance (i.e., segregation) between the bears.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Traumatic Brain Injury Outcomes in Road Traffic Crashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBIs) resulting from Road Traffic Crashes (RTCs) can have fatal and disabling effects on patients. In this study, we evaluated the TBIs outcomes of patients involved in RTCs and identify key contributing factors affecting these outcomes. Data on 207 patients recorded by physicians at a tertiary hospital in Bangladesh was collected. A random parameters multinomial logit model with heterogeneity in the means was utilized to assess patients outcomes in three categories: Non-surgical, Surgical, and Fatal. From the random parameters, the study found that male patients (55.48%) are more likely to experience surgical and fatal outcomes. Male motorcycle users have a higher probability of experiencing fatal consequences. Additionally, 60.94% of incidents on rural roads result in surgeries and fatalities, with nighttime crashes on these roads significantly increasing the likelihood of fatal outcomes. Key factors impacting the likelihood of TBIs outcomes include older age, pedestrian involvement, bus and truck crashes, speeding, wet pavements, overtaking, low visibility, and weekday crashes. The study identified two significant interaction variables that increase the probability of fatal outcomes from TBIs: the interactions between low visibility and bus involvement, and between overtaking and wet pavements. While these factors individually had a higher probability of leading to both surgical and fatal outcomes, together these factors increase the risks to fatalities. Overall, our findings provide more detailed insights about the impact of TBIs outcomes resulting from RTCs and emphasize the need to develop more effective measures to improve road safety and patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Predicting and understanding shooting performance in professional biathlon: A Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biathlon is a unique winter sport that combines precision rifle marksmanship with the endurance demands of cross-country skiing. We develop a Bayesian hierarchical model to predict and understand shooting performance using data from the 2021/22 Women's World Cup season. The model captures athlete-specific, position-specific, race-type, and stage-dependent effects, providing a comprehensive view of shooting accuracy variability. By incorporating dynamic components, we reveal how performance evolves over the season, with model validation showing strong predictive ability at both overall and individual levels. Our findings highlight substantial athlete-specific differences and underscore the value of personalized performance analysis for optimizing coaching strategies. This work demonstrates the potential of advanced Bayesian modeling in sports analytics, paving the way for future research in biathlon and similar sports requiring the integration of technical and endurance skills.</description>

      <title>GDP nowcasting with large-scale inter-industry payment data in real time -- A network approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time economic information is essential for policy-making but difficult to obtain. We introduce a granular nowcasting method for macro- and industry-level GDP using a network approach and data on real-time monthly inter-industry payments in the UK. To this purpose we devise a model which we call an extended generalised network autoregressive (GNAR-ex) model, tailored for networks with time-varying edge weights and nodal time series, that exploits the notion of neighbouring nodes and neighbouring edges. The performance of the model is illustrated on a range of synthetic data experiments. We implement the GNAR-ex model on the payments network including time series information of GDP and payment amounts. To obtain robustness against statistical revisions, we optimise the model over 9 quarterly releases of GDP data from the UK Office for National Statistics. Our GNAR-ex model can outperform baseline autoregressive benchmark models, leading to a reduced forecasting error. This work helps to obtain timely GDP estimates at the aggregate and industry level derived from alternative data sources compared to existing, mostly survey-based, methods. Thus, this paper contributes both, a novel model for networks with nodal time series and time-varying edge weights, and the first network-based approach for GDP nowcasting based on payments data.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we leverage state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews. By employing transformer-based models, RoBERTa, we analyze a vast dataset to derive sentiment scores that accurately reflect the emotional tones of the reviews. We provide an in-depth explanation of the underlying principles of these models and evaluate their performance in generating sentiment scores. Further, we conduct comprehensive data analysis and visualization to identify patterns and trends in sentiment scores, examining their alignment with behavioral economics principles such as electronic word of mouth (eWOM), consumer emotional reactions, and the confirmation bias. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of advanced NLP models in sentiment analysis and offer valuable insights into consumer behavior, with implications for strategic decision-making and marketing practices.</description>

      <title>Online Moderation in Competitive Action Games: How Intervention Affects Player Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online competitive action games have flourished as a space for entertainment and social connections, yet they face challenges from a small percentage of players engaging in disruptive behaviors. This study delves into the under-explored realm of understanding the effects of moderation on player behavior within online gaming on an example of a popular title - Call of Duty(R): Modern Warfare(R)II. We employ a quasi-experimental design and causal inference techniques to examine the impact of moderation in a real-world industry-scale moderation system. We further delve into novel aspects around the impact of delayed moderation, as well as the severity of applied punishment. We examine these effects on a set of four disruptive behaviors including cheating, offensive user name, chat, and voice. Our findings uncover the dual impact moderation has on reducing disruptive behavior and discouraging disruptive players from participating. We further uncover differences in the effectiveness of quick and delayed moderation and the varying severity of punishment. Our examination of real-world gaming interactions sets a precedent in understanding the effectiveness of moderation and its impact on player behavior. Our insights offer actionable suggestions for the most promising avenues for improving real-world moderation practices, as well as the heterogeneous impact moderation has on indifferent players.</description>

      <title>Local Indicators of Mark Association for Spatial Marked Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of distinct local mark behaviours is becoming increasingly common in the applications of spatial marked point processes. This dynamic highlights the limitations of existing global mark correlation functions in accurately identifying the true patterns of mark associations/variations among points as distinct mark behaviours might dominate one another, giving rise to an incomplete understanding of mark associations. In this paper, we introduce a family of local indicators of mark association (LIMA) functions for spatial marked point processes. These functions are defined on general state spaces and can include marks that are either real-valued or function-valued. Unlike global mark correlation functions, which are often distorted by the existence of distinct mark behaviours, LIMA functions reliably identify all types of mark associations and variations among points. Additionally, they accurately determine the interpoint distances where individual points show significant mark associations. Through simulation studies, featuring various scenarios, and four real applications in forestry, criminology, and urban mobility, we study spatial marked point processes in $\R^2$ and on linear networks with either real-valued or function-valued marks, demonstrating that LIMA functions significantly outperform the existing global mark correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Independence in Integrated Population Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated population models (IPMs) combine multiple ecological data types such as capture-mark-recapture histories, reproduction surveys, and population counts into a single statistical framework. In such models, each data type is generated by a probabilistic submodel, and an assumption of independence between the different data types is usually made. The fact that the same biological individuals can contribute to multiple data types has been perceived as affecting their independence, and several studies have even investigated IPM robustness in this scenario. However, what matters from a statistical perspective is probabilistic independence: the joint probability of observing all data is equal to the product of the likelihoods of the various datasets. Contrary to a widespread perception, probabilistic non-independence does not automatically result from collecting data on the same physical individuals. Conversely, while there can be good reasons for non-independence of IPM submodels arising from sharing of individuals between data types, these relations do not seem to be included in IPMs whose robustness is being investigated. Furthermore, conditional rather than true independence is sometimes assumed. In this conceptual paper, I survey the various independence concepts used in IPMs, try to make sense of them by getting back to first principles in toy models, and show that it is possible to obtain probabilistic independence (or near-independence) despite two or three data types collected on the same set of biological individuals. I then revisit recommendations pertaining to component data collection and IPM robustness checks, and provide some suggestions to bridge the current gap between individual-level IPMs and their population-level approximations using composite likelihoods.</description>

      <title>The Relationship Between Smartphone Usage and Sleep Quality Amongst University Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gender differences were examined in sensitivity to sleep quality, in the context of blue light exposure from smartphones. Our hypothesis was created based on our journal article findings that females are more prone to be inclined to the prolonged usage of smartphones at bedtime and thus had less quality of sleep than males. The theory that usage affects sleep quality was due to the belief that the blue light emanating from the smartphone screen would disrupt our body natural circadian rhythm, or sleep cycle, due to the blue light ability to block a hormone called melatonin that controls and aids sleep. However, upon conducting regression tests and statistical analysis on our dataset, we found that our hypothesis was incorrect.

      <title>Decomposing Network Influence: Social Influence Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09072</link>

Abstract: Understanding network influence and its determinants are key challenges in political science and network analysis. Traditional latent variable models position actors within a social space based on network dependencies but often do not elucidate the underlying factors driving these interactions. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Social Influence Regression (SIR) model, an extension of vector autoregression tailored for relational data that incorporates exogenous covariates into the estimation of influence patterns. The SIR model captures influence dynamics via a pair of $n \times n$ matrices that quantify how the actions of one actor affect the future actions of another. This framework not only provides a statistical mechanism for explaining actor influence based on observable traits but also improves computational efficiency through an iterative block coordinate descent method. We showcase the SIR model's capabilities by applying it to monthly conflict events between countries, using data from the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS). Our findings demonstrate the SIR model's ability to elucidate complex influence patterns within networks by linking them to specific covariates. This paper's main contributions are: (1) introducing a model that explains third-order dependencies through exogenous covariates and (2) offering an efficient estimation approach that scales effectively with large, complex networks.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Organizational Effectiveness: A New Strategy to Leverage Multisite Randomized Trials for Valid Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In education, health, and human services, an intervention program is usually implemented by many local organizations. Determining which organizations are more effective is essential for theoretically characterizing effective practices and for intervening to enhance the capacity of ineffective organizations. In multisite randomized trials, site-specific intention-to-treat (ITT) effects are likely invalid indicators for organizational effectiveness and may lead to inequitable decisions. This is because sites differ in their local ecological conditions including client composition, alternative programs, and community context. Applying the potential outcomes framework, this study proposes a mathematical definition for the relative effectiveness of an organization. The estimand contrasts the performance of a focal organization with those that share the features of its local ecological conditions. The identification relies on relatively weak assumptions by leveraging observed control group outcomes that capture the confounding impacts of alternative programs and community context. We propose a two-step mixed-effects modeling (2SME) procedure. Simulations demonstrate significant improvements when compared with site-specific ITT analyses or analyses that only adjust for between-site differences in the observed baseline participant composition. We illustrate its use through an evaluation of the relative effectiveness of individual Job Corps centers by reanalyzing data from the National Job Corps Study, a multisite randomized trial that included 100 Job Corps centers nationwide serving disadvantaged youths. The new strategy promises to alleviate consequential misclassifications of some of the most effective Job Corps centers as least effective and vice versa.</description>

      <title>An Agglomerative Clustering of Simulation Output Distributions Using Regularized Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using statistical learning methods to analyze stochastic simulation outputs can significantly enhance decision-making by uncovering relationships between different simulated systems and between a system's inputs and outputs. We focus on clustering multivariate empirical distributions of simulation outputs to identify patterns and trade-offs among performance measures. We present a novel agglomerative clustering algorithm that utilizes the regularized Wasserstein distance to cluster these multivariate empirical distributions. This framework has several important use cases, including anomaly detection, pre-optimization, and online monitoring. In numerical experiments involving a call-center model, we demonstrate how this methodology can identify staffing plans that yield similar performance outcomes and inform policies for intervening when queue lengths signal potentially worsening system performance.</description>

      <title>A Novel Metric for Measuring the Robustness of Large Language Models in Non-adversarial Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01963v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the robustness of several large language models on multiple datasets. Robustness here refers to the relative insensitivity of the model's answers to meaning-preserving variants of their input. Benchmark datasets are constructed by introducing naturally-occurring, non-malicious perturbations, or by generating semantically equivalent paraphrases of input questions or statements. We further propose a novel metric for assessing a model robustness, and demonstrate its benefits in the non-adversarial scenario by empirical evaluation of several models on the created datasets.</description>

      <title>Dhoroni: Exploring Bengali Climate Change and Environmental Views with a Multi-Perspective News Dataset and Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate change poses critical challenges globally, disproportionately affecting low-income countries that often lack resources and linguistic representation on the international stage. Despite Bangladesh's status as one of the most vulnerable nations to climate impacts, research gaps persist in Bengali-language studies related to climate change and NLP. To address this disparity, we introduce Dhoroni, a novel Bengali (Bangla) climate change and environmental news dataset, comprising a 2300 annotated Bangla news articles, offering multiple perspectives such as political influence, scientific/statistical data, authenticity, stance detection, and stakeholder involvement. Furthermore, we present an in-depth exploratory analysis of Dhoroni and introduce BanglaBERT-Dhoroni family, a novel baseline model family for climate and environmental opinion detection in Bangla, fine-tuned on our dataset. This research contributes significantly to enhancing accessibility and analysis of climate discourse in Bengali (Bangla), addressing crucial communication and research gaps in climate-impacted regions like Bangladesh with 180 million people.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Nonparametric Models for Multiple Raters: a General Statistical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rating procedure is crucial in many applied fields (e.g., educational, clinical, emergency). It implies that a rater (e.g., teacher, doctor) rates a subject (e.g., student, doctor) on a rating scale. Given raters variability, several statistical methods have been proposed for assessing and improving the quality of ratings. The analysis and the estimate of the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) are major concerns in such cases. As evidenced by the literature, ICC might differ across different subgroups of raters and might be affected by contextual factors and subject heterogeneity. Model estimation in the presence of heterogeneity has been one of the recent challenges in this research line. Consequently, several methods have been proposed to address this issue under a parametric multilevel modelling framework, in which strong distributional assumptions are made. We propose a more flexible model under the Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) framework, in which most of those assumptions are relaxed. By eliciting hierarchical discrete nonparametric priors, the model accommodates clusters among raters and subjects, naturally accounts for heterogeneity, and improves estimate accuracy. We propose a general BNP heteroscedastic framework to analyze rating data and possible latent differences among subjects and raters. The estimated densities are used to make inferences about the rating process and the quality of the ratings. By exploiting a stick-breaking representation of the Dirichlet Process a general class of ICC indices might be derived for these models. Theoretical results about the ICC are provided together with computational strategies. Simulations and a real-world application are presented and possible future directions are discussed.</description>
