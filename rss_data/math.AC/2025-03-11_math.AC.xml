      <title>Acyclicity test of complexes modulo Serre subcategories using the residue fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative noetherian ring, and let $\mathscr{S}$(resp. $\mathscr{L}$) be a Serre(resp. localizing) subcategory of the category of $R$-modules. If $\Bbb F$ is an unbounded complex of $R$-modules Tor-perpendicular to $\mathscr{S}$ and $d$ is an integer, then $\HH{i\geqslant d}{S\otimes_R \Bbb F}$ is in $\mathscr{L}$ for each $R$-module $S$ in $\mathscr{S}$ if and only if $\HH{i\geqslant d}{k(\fp)\otimes_R \Bbb F}$ is in $\mathscr{L}$ for each prime ideal $\fp$ such that $R/\fp$ is in $\mathscr{S}$, where $k(\fp)$ is the residue field at $\fp$. As an application, we show that for any $R$-module $M$, $\Tor_{i\geqslant 0}^R(k(\fp),M)$ is in $\mathscr{L}$ for each prime ideal $\fp$ such that $R/\fp$ is in $\mathscr{S}$ if and only if $\Ext^{i \geqslant 0}_R(S,M)$ is in $\mathscr{L}$ for each cyclic $R$-module $S$ in $\mathscr{S}$. We also obtain some new characterizations of regular and Gorenstein rings in the case of $\mathscr{S}$ consists of finite modules with supports in a specialization-closed subset $V(I)$ of $\Spec R$.</description>

      <title>Decompositions into a direct sum of projective and stable submodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A module $M$ is said to be stable if it has no nonzero projective direct summand. For a ring $ R $, we study the conditions under which every $R$-module $M$ within a specific class can be decomposed into a direct sum of a projective module and a stable module, focusing on identifying the types of rings and the class of $R$-modules where this property holds. Some well-known classes of rings over which every finitely presented module can be decomposed into a direct sum of a projective submodule and a stable submodule are semiperfect rings or semilocal rings or rings satisfying some finiteness conditions like having finite uniform dimension or hollow dimension or being Noetherian or Artinian. By using the Auslander-Bridger transpose of modules, we prove that every finitely presented right $R$-module over a left semihereditary ring $R$ has such a decomposition; note that the semihereditary condition is on the opposite side. Our main focus in this article is to give examples where such a decomposition fails. We give some ring examples over which there exists an infinitely generated or finitely generated or cyclic module or finitely presented module or cyclically presented module where such a decomposition fails. Our main example is a cyclically presented module $M$ over a commutative ring such that~$M$ has no such decomposition and $M$ is not projectively equivalent to a stable module.</description>

      <title>Finite fields whose members are the sum of a potent and a 4-potent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify those finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$, for $q$ a power of some fixed prime number, whose members are the sum of an $n$-potent element with $n&gt;1$ and a 4-potent element. It is shown that there are precisely ten non-trivial pairs $(q,n)$ for which this is the case.
  This continues a recent publication by Cohen-Danchev et al. in Turk. J. Math. (2024) in which the tripotent version was examined in-depth as well as it extends recent results of this branch established by Abyzov-Tapkin in Sib. Math. J. (2024).</description>

      <title>On average orders of automorphism groups of bilinear maps over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\varphi:V\times V\to W$ be a bilinear map of finite vector spaces $V$ and $W$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. We present asymptotic bounds on the number of isomorphism classes of bilinear maps under the natural action of $\mathrm{GL}(V)$ and $\mathrm{GL}(W)$, when $\dim(V)$ and $\dim(W)$ are linearly related.
  As motivations and applications of the results, we present almost tight upper bounds on the number of $p$-groups of Frattini class $2$ as first studied by Higman (Proc. Lond. Math. Soc., 1960). Such bounds lead to answers for some open questions by Blackburn, Neumann, and Venkataraman (Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics, 2007). Further applications include sampling matrix spaces with the trivial automorphism group, and asymptotic bounds on the number of isomorphism classes of finite cube-zero commutative algebras.</description>

      <title>Strongly Lech-independent ideals and Lech's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.09849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of strongly Lech-independent ideals as a generalization of Lech-independent ideals defined by Lech and Hanes, and use this notion to derive inequalities on multiplicities of ideals. In particular we prove that if $(R,\mathfrak{m}) \to (S,\mathfrak{n})$ is a flat local extension of local rings with $\dim R = \dim S$, the completion of $S$ is the completion of a standard graded ring over a field $k$ with respect to the homogeneous maximal ideal, and the completion of $\mathfrak{m}S$ is the completion of a homogeneous ideal, then $e(R) \leq e(S)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the property of (almost) complete intersection of LSS-ideals of graphs of some special forms, like trees, unicyclic, and bicyclic graphs. Further, we give a sufficient condition for the complete intersection property of twisted LSS-ideals in terms of a new graph theoretical invariant called twisted positive matching decomposition number denoted by tpmd. We also study the regularity of powers of LSS-ideals and make observations related to the Koszul property of the quotients of the same.</description>

      <title>Syzygies of associated graded modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finitely generated module $M$ over a Noetherian local ring $R$, we give a characterization for the first syzygy of the associated graded module $G_{\mathfrak{m}}(M)$ to be equigenerated. As an application of this, we identify a complex of free $G_{\mathfrak{m}}(R)$-modules, arising from given free resolution of $M$ over $R$, which is a resolution of $G_{\mathfrak{m}}(M)$ if and only if $G_{\mathfrak{m}}(M)$ is a pure $G_{\mathfrak{m}}(R)$-module. We also give several applications of the purity of $G_{\mathfrak{m}}(M)$. Our results demonstrate that while not all algebraic properties of a module carry over to its associated graded module, the purity of the minimal free resolution of $G_{\mathfrak{m}}(M)$ ensures that several important invariants are inherited. In addition, we provide sufficient conditions for Cohen-Macaulayness and purity of $G_{\mathfrak{m}}(M)$, and provide a local version of the Herzog-K\"uhl equations.</description>

Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring with identity, $S$ a multiplicative subset of $R$ and $I$ an ideal of $R$ disjoint from $S$. In this paper, we introduce the notion of an $S$-$n$-absorbing ideal which is a generalization of both the $S$-prime ideals and $n$-absorbing ideals. Moreover, we investigate the basic properties, quotient extension, existence and amalgamation of $S$-$n$-absorbing ideals.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic v-numbers of graded (co)homology modules involving powers of an ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a Noetherian $\mathbb{N}$-graded ring. Let $L$, $M$ and $N$ be finitely generated graded $R$-modules with $N \subseteq M$. For a homogeneous ideal $I$, and for each fixed $k \in \mathbb{N}$, we show the asymptotic linearity of v-numbers of the graded modules $ {\rm Ext}_R^{k}(L,{I^{n}M}/{I^{n}N})$ and ${\rm Tor}_k^{R}(L,{I^{n}M}/{I^{n}N})$ as functions of $n$. Moreover, under some conditions on ${\rm Ext}_R^k(L,M)$ and ${\rm Tor}_k^R(L,M)$ respectively, we prove similar behaviour for v-numbers of ${\rm Ext}_R^{k}(L,{M}/{I^{n}N})$ and $ {\rm Tor}_k^{R}(L,{M}/{I^{n}N})$. The last result is obtained by proving the asymptotic linearity of v-number of $(U+I^{n}V)/I^{n}W$, where $U$, $V$ and $W$ are graded submodules of a finitely generated graded $R$-module such that $W \subseteq V$ and $(0:_{U}I) = 0$.</description>

      <title>Vector space summands of lower syzygies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate problems concerning when the residue field $k$ of a local ring $(R,\frak m$, $k)$ appears as a direct summand of syzygy modules, from two perspectives. First, we prove that the following conditions are equivalent: (i) $k$ is a direct summand of second syzygies of all non-free finitely generated $R$-modules; (ii) $k$ is a direct summand of third syzygies of all non-free finitely generated $R$-modules; (iii) $k$ is a direct summand of $\frak m$. We also prove various consequences of these conditions.
  The second point of this article is to investigate for what artinian local rings $R$ the dual $E^*=Hom_R(E_R(k),R)$ of the injective envelope of the residue field, which is also a second syzygy, is a $k$-vector space. Using the notion of Eliahou-Kervaire resolution, we introduce a large class of artinian local rings that satisfy this condition.</description>

      <title>Betti elements and full atomic support in rings and monoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several papers in the recent literature have studied factorization properties of affine monoids using the monoid's Betti elements. In this paper, we extend this study to more general rings and monoids. We open by demonstrating the issues with computing the complete set of Betti elements of a general commutative cancellative monoid, and as an example compute this set for an algebraic number ring of class number two. We specialize our study to the case where the monoid has a single Betti element, before examining monoids with full atomic support (that is, when each Betti element is divisible by every atom). For such a monoid, we show that the catenary degree, tame degree, and omega value agree and can be computed using the monoid's set of Betti elements. We close by considering Betti elements in block monoids, giving a "Carlitz-like" characterization of block monoids with full atomic support and proving that these are precisely the block monoids having a unique Betti element.</description>

      <title>Infinite Minkowski sums of lattice polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0508092</link>
      <description>arXiv:math/0508092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artinian integrally closed monomial ideals are characterized by their Newton polyhedra, which are lattice polyhedra inside the positive orthant having the positive orthant as their recession cone. Multiplication of such ideals correspond to Minkowski addition of their Newton polyhedra. In two dimensions, the isomorphic monoids of artinian, integrally closed monomial ideals under multiplication, or the class of lattice polyhedra described above, under Minkowski addition, are free abelian, as proved by Crispin-Quinonez.
  Bayer and Stillman considered so-called /monomial submodules/ of the Laurent polynomial ring. Inspired by this, we consider a family of such monomial submodules that can be (uniquely) expressed as an infinite product of monomial submodules isomorphic to integrally closed monomial ideals. Geometrically, their Newton polyhedras are expressed as an infinite Minkowski sum of *simple* lattice polyhedra. This gives another example of a *topological ufd* i.e. a topological abelian monoid in which every element can be uniquely written as a convergent (possibly infinite) product of irreducibles.</description>

      <title>The{N/D}-Conjecture for Nonresonant Hyperplane Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies Bernstein--Sato polynomials $b_{f,0}$ for homogeneous polynomials $f$ of degree $d$ with $n$ variables. It is open to know when $-{n\over d}$ is a root of $b_{f,0}$. For essential indecomposable hyperplane arrangements, this is a conjecture by Budur, Musta\c{t}\u{a} and Teitler and implies the strong topological monodromy conjecture for arrangements. U. Walther gave a sufficient condition that a certain differential form does not vanish in the top cohomology group of Milnor fiber. We use Walther's result to verify the $n\over d$-conjecture for weighted hyperplane arrangements satisfying the nonresonant condition. We also give some essential indecomposable homogeneous polynomials $f$ such that $-{n\over d}$ is not a root of $b_{f,0}$. This leads to a conjectural sufficient condition for $b_{f,0}(-{n\over d})=0$.</description>
