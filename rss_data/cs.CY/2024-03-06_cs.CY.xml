      <title>An Empirical Analysis on the Use and Reporting of National Security Letters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: National Security Letters (NSLs) are similar to administrative subpoenas and can be issued directly by elements of the executive branch without requiring prior approval from a court or grand jury. Importantly, NSLs authorize the imposition of nondisclosure orders (aka "gag orders") on the receiving party. Controversy about potential abuses of this authority has driven a range of legal and policy discussions. To address these concerns, both the public sector and the private sector have sought to document the usage of NSLs in aggregated form. However, each data source is limited in scope, time, and kind.
  In this paper, we consolidate the available data around NSLs and answer two questions: (1) what can the public effectively learn from the reported data and does this information suffice to assess the NSL usage? (2) how accessible is this data collection? We show that longitudinal trends in the usage of NSLs can be observed. For instance, we find a significant increase in NSL requests for non-US persons and that the policy reforms to decrease the mandated nondisclosure period appear to be effective. The observed trends suggest that the current transparency mechanisms are viable safeguards against the excessive use of NSLs. However, aggregating and normalizing the data requires manual reviewing, parsing, and validating. We even find inconsistencies within and across official data sources. Overall, the laborious data collection process hinders external and internal auditing efforts and demonstrates the need for a unified and more usable dataset for NSLs.</description>

      <title>Preserving Tangible and Intangible Cultural Heritage: the Cases of Volterra and Atari</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At first glance, the ruins of the Roman Theatre in the Italian town of Volterra have little in common with cassette tapes containing Atari games. One is certainly considered an important historical landmark, while the consensus on the importance of the other is partial at best. Still, both are remnants of times vastly different from the present and are at risk of oblivion. Unearthed architectural structures are exposed to the elements just as the deteriorating signals stored on magnetic tapes. However, the rate of deterioration is much faster with the magnetic media, as their life expectancy is counted in decades, whereas the Roman Theater, which is already in ruin, measures its lifespan in centuries. Hence, both would benefit from some form of digital preservation and reconstruction. In this panel, we discuss how to sustainably preserve tangible and intangible cultural artifacts for future generations.</description>

      <title>Improving the quality of individual-level online information tracking: challenges of existing approaches and introduction of a new content- and long-tail sensitive academic solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article evaluates the quality of data collection in individual-level desktop information tracking used in the social sciences and shows that the existing approaches face sampling issues, validity issues due to the lack of content-level data and their disregard of the variety of devices and long-tail consumption patterns as well as transparency and privacy issues. To overcome some of these problems, the article introduces a new academic tracking solution, WebTrack, an open source tracking tool maintained by a major European research institution. The design logic, the interfaces and the backend requirements for WebTrack, followed by a detailed examination of strengths and weaknesses of the tool, are discussed. Finally, using data from 1185 participants, the article empirically illustrates how an improvement in the data collection through WebTrack leads to new innovative shifts in the processing of tracking data. As WebTrack allows collecting the content people are exposed to on more than classical news platforms, we can strongly improve the detection of politics-related information consumption in tracking data with the application of automated content analysis compared to traditional approaches that rely on the list-based identification of news.</description>

      <title>When Industry meets Trustworthy AI: A Systematic Review of AI for Industry 5.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industry is at the forefront of adopting new technologies, and the process followed by the adoption has a significant impact on the economy and society. In this work, we focus on analysing the current paradigm in which industry evolves, making it more sustainable and Trustworthy. In Industry 5.0, Artificial Intelligence (AI), among other technology enablers, is used to build services from a sustainable, human-centric and resilient perspective. It is crucial to understand those aspects that can bring AI to industry, respecting Trustworthy principles by collecting information to define how it is incorporated in the early stages, its impact, and the trends observed in the field. In addition, to understand the challenges and gaps in the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0, a general perspective on the industry's readiness for new technologies is described. This provides practitioners with novel opportunities to be explored in pursuit of the adoption of Trustworthy AI in the sector.</description>

      <title>On-demand Mobility Services for Urban Resilience: A Review Towards Human-Machine Collaborative Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobility-on-demand (MOD) services have the potential to significantly improve the adaptiveness and recovery of urban logistics and transportation infrastructure, in the wake of disruptive events. This paper presents a survey on the usage of MOD services for resilience improvement (MOD-R) and finds a noticeable increase within recent years on this topic across four main areas: resilient MOD services, novel usage of MOD-R services for improving supply chain resilience, empirical impact evaluation, and supporting technologies. MOD-R services have been utilized for anomaly detection, essential supply delivery, evacuation and rescue, on-site medical care, power grid stabilization, transit service substitution during downtime, and infrastructure and equipment repair. The review reveals integrating electrification, automation, and advanced communication technologies offers significant synergistic benefits. The review also suggests the importance of harnessing the collective capabilities of humans and intelligent machines to effectively implement versatile, multi-functional MOD-R services during crises.</description>

      <title>Metamorpheus: Interactive, Affective, and Creative Dream Narration Through Metaphorical Visual Storytelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human emotions are essentially molded by lived experiences, from which we construct personalised meaning. The engagement in such meaning-making process has been practiced as an intervention in various psychotherapies to promote wellness. Nevertheless, to support recollecting and recounting lived experiences in everyday life remains under explored in HCI. It also remains unknown how technologies such as generative AI models can facilitate the meaning making process, and ultimately support affective mindfulness. In this paper we present Metamorpheus, an affective interface that engages users in a creative visual storytelling of emotional experiences during dreams. Metamorpheus arranges the storyline based on a dream's emotional arc, and provokes self-reflection through the creation of metaphorical images and text depictions. The system provides metaphor suggestions, and generates visual metaphors and text depictions using generative AI models, while users can apply generations to recolour and re-arrange the interface to be visually affective. Our experience-centred evaluation manifests that, by interacting with Metamorpheus, users can recall their dreams in vivid detail, through which they relive and reflect upon their experiences in a meaningful way.</description>

      <title>Bias in Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study analyzed images generated by three popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools - Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALLE 2 - representing various occupations to investigate potential bias in AI generators. Our analysis revealed two overarching areas of concern in these AI generators, including (1) systematic gender and racial biases, and (2) subtle biases in facial expressions and appearances. Firstly, we found that all three AI generators exhibited bias against women and African Americans. Moreover, we found that the evident gender and racial biases uncovered in our analysis were even more pronounced than the status quo when compared to labor force statistics or Google images, intensifying the harmful biases we are actively striving to rectify in our society. Secondly, our study uncovered more nuanced prejudices in the portrayal of emotions and appearances. For example, women were depicted as younger with more smiles and happiness, while men were depicted as older with more neutral expressions and anger, posing a risk that generative AI models may unintentionally depict women as more submissive and less competent than men. Such nuanced biases, by their less overt nature, might be more problematic as they can permeate perceptions unconsciously and may be more difficult to rectify. Although the extent of bias varied depending on the model, the direction of bias remained consistent in both commercial and open-source AI generators. As these tools become commonplace, our study highlights the urgency to identify and mitigate various biases in generative AI, reinforcing the commitment to ensuring that AI technologies benefit all of humanity for a more inclusive future.</description>

      <title>Rehabilitation Exercise Quality Assessment through Supervised Contrastive Learning with Hard and Soft Negatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exercise-based rehabilitation programs have proven to be effective in enhancing the quality of life and reducing mortality and rehospitalization rates. AI-driven virtual rehabilitation, which allows patients to independently complete exercises at home, utilizes AI algorithms to analyze exercise data, providing feedback to patients and updating clinicians on their progress. These programs commonly prescribe a variety of exercise types, leading to a distinct challenge in rehabilitation exercise assessment datasets: while abundant in overall training samples, these datasets often have a limited number of samples for each individual exercise type. This disparity hampers the ability of existing approaches to train generalizable models with such a small sample size per exercise. Addressing this issue, our paper introduces a novel supervised contrastive learning framework with hard and soft negative samples that effectively utilizes the entire dataset to train a single model applicable to all exercise types. This model, with a Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) architecture, demonstrated enhanced generalizability across exercises and a decrease in overall complexity. Through extensive experiments on three publicly available rehabilitation exercise assessment datasets, the University of Idaho-Physical Rehabilitation Movement Data (UI-PRMD), IntelliRehabDS (IRDS), and KInematic assessment of MOvement and clinical scores for remote monitoring of physical REhabilitation (KIMORE), our method has shown to surpass existing methods, setting a new benchmark in rehabilitation exercise assessment accuracy.</description>

      <title>Citizen Science and Machine Learning for Research and Nature Conservation: The Case of Eurasian Lynx, Free-ranging Rodents and Insects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Technology is increasingly used in Nature Reserves and National Parks around the world to support conservation efforts. Endangered species, such as the Eurasian Lynx (Lynx lynx), are monitored by a network of automatic photo traps. Yet, this method produces vast amounts of data, which needs to be prepared, analyzed and interpreted. Therefore, researchers working in this area increasingly need support to process this incoming information. One opportunity is to seek support from volunteer Citizen Scientists who can help label the data, however, it is challenging to retain their interest. Another way is to automate the process with image recognition using convolutional neural networks. During the panel, we will discuss considerations related to nature research and conservation as well as opportunities for the use of Citizen Science and Machine Learning to expedite the process of data preparation, labelling and analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantum for Good and the Societal Impact of Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises to help humanity solve problems that would otherwise be intractable on classical computers. Unlike today's machines, quantum computers use a novel computing process that leverages the foundational quantum mechanical laws of nature. This unlocks unparalleled compute power for certain applications and promises to help solve some of our generation's gravest challenges, including the climate crisis, food insecurity, and widespread disease. No one entity will be able to realize this end state alone. Developing a fault-tolerant quantum supercomputer and a vibrant ecosystem around it will require deep partnerships between industry, governments, and academia. It will also require collective action to enable and promote positive applications of quantum computing and ensure that the safe and responsible use of the technology is at the center of its development and deployment. Achieving these objectives will require focusing on three priorities:
  1. Impact. Ensure quantum computing benefits all of humankind by developing quantum solutions to solve critical, global problems.
  2. Use. Protect against malicious use by accelerating the deployment of quantum-safe cryptography and developing governance processes and controls for the responsible use of quantum machines.
  3. Access. Democratize the potential for economic growth across all of society through skilling, workforce and ecosystem development, and digital infrastructure.
  This paper discusses each in turn.</description>

      <title>Bodioid: philosophical reflections on the hybrid of bodies and artefacts towards post-human</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of the post-human era has blurred the boundary between the body and artifacts. Further, external materials and information are more deeply integrated into the body, making emerging technology a key driving force for shaping post-human existence and promoting bodily evolution. Based on this, this study analyses the transformation process of three technological forms, namely tools, machines, and cyborgs, and reveals the construction of bodies and artifacts. From the phenomenological perspective, the essences of body and artifact existences are reflected upon, and the existence is construction viewpoint is proposed. Furthermore, a technological design concept, bodioid, is proposed to meticulously depict the characteristics of integrating similarities and differences towards unity between the body and artifacts, based on the theoretical foundation of technology mediation and the materialization of morality. Finally, through analogizing the organizational form of language, the two key forms and specific mechanisms of bodioid construction, namely extension and mirroring, are indicated. With this in mind, the post-human existence landscape is discussed with the objective of providing theoretical insights into the study of the underlying philosophical principles of technological design.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning Under Attack: Exposing Vulnerabilities through Data Poisoning Attacks in Computer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning (ML) approach that enables multiple decentralized devices or edge servers to collaboratively train a shared model without exchanging raw data. During the training and sharing of model updates between clients and servers, data and models are susceptible to different data-poisoning attacks.
  In this study, our motivation is to explore the severity of data poisoning attacks in the computer network domain because they are easy to implement but difficult to detect. We considered two types of data-poisoning attacks, label flipping (LF) and feature poisoning (FP), and applied them with a novel approach. In LF, we randomly flipped the labels of benign data and trained the model on the manipulated data. For FP, we randomly manipulated the highly contributing features determined using the Random Forest algorithm. The datasets used in this experiment were CIC and UNSW related to computer networks. We generated adversarial samples using the two attacks mentioned above, which were applied to a small percentage of datasets. Subsequently, we trained and tested the accuracy of the model on adversarial datasets. We recorded the results for both benign and manipulated datasets and observed significant differences between the accuracy of the models on different datasets. From the experimental results, it is evident that the LF attack failed, whereas the FP attack showed effective results, which proved its significance in fooling a server. With a 1% LF attack on the CIC, the accuracy was approximately 0.0428 and the ASR was 0.9564; hence, the attack is easily detectable, while with a 1% FP attack, the accuracy and ASR were both approximately 0.9600, hence, FP attacks are difficult to detect. We repeated the experiment with different poisoning percentages.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Label Flipping Attacks in Malicious URL Detectors Using Ensemble Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Malicious URLs provide adversarial opportunities across various industries, including transportation, healthcare, energy, and banking which could be detrimental to business operations. Consequently, the detection of these URLs is of crucial importance; however, current Machine Learning (ML) models are susceptible to backdoor attacks. These attacks involve manipulating a small percentage of training data labels, such as Label Flipping (LF), which changes benign labels to malicious ones and vice versa. This manipulation results in misclassification and leads to incorrect model behavior. Therefore, integrating defense mechanisms into the architecture of ML models becomes an imperative consideration to fortify against potential attacks.
  The focus of this study is on backdoor attacks in the context of URL detection using ensemble trees. By illuminating the motivations behind such attacks, highlighting the roles of attackers, and emphasizing the critical importance of effective defense strategies, this paper contributes to the ongoing efforts to fortify ML models against adversarial threats within the ML domain in network security. We propose an innovative alarm system that detects the presence of poisoned labels and a defense mechanism designed to uncover the original class labels with the aim of mitigating backdoor attacks on ensemble tree classifiers. We conducted a case study using the Alexa and Phishing Site URL datasets and showed that LF attacks can be addressed using our proposed defense mechanism. Our experimental results prove that the LF attack achieved an Attack Success Rate (ASR) between 50-65% within 2-5%, and the innovative defense method successfully detected poisoned labels with an accuracy of up to 100%.</description>

      <title>Using Smartphones to Study Vaccination Decisions in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most important tools available to limit the spread and impact of infectious diseases is vaccination. It is therefore important to understand what factors determine people's vaccination decisions. To this end, previous behavioural research made use of, (i) controlled but often abstract or hypothetical studies (e.g., vignettes) or, (ii) realistic but typically less flexible studies that make it difficult to understand individual decision processes (e.g., clinical trials). Combining the best of these approaches, we propose integrating real-world Bluetooth contacts via smartphones in several rounds of a game scenario, as a novel methodology to study vaccination decisions and disease spread. In our 12-week proof-of-concept study conducted with $N$ = 494 students, we found that participants strongly responded to some of the information provided to them during or after each decision round, particularly those related to their individual health outcomes. In contrast, information related to others' decisions and outcomes (e.g., the number of vaccinated or infected individuals) appeared to be less important. We discuss the potential of this novel method and point to fruitful areas for future research.</description>

Abstract: Generative AI has made rapid advancements in recent years, achieving unprecedented capabilities in multimodal understanding and code generation. This can enable a new paradigm of front-end development, in which multimodal LLMs might directly convert visual designs into code implementations. In this work, we formalize this as a Design2Code task and conduct comprehensive benchmarking. Specifically, we manually curate a benchmark of 484 diverse real-world webpages as test cases and develop a set of automatic evaluation metrics to assess how well current multimodal LLMs can generate the code implementations that directly render into the given reference webpages, given the screenshots as input. We also complement automatic metrics with comprehensive human evaluations. We develop a suite of multimodal prompting methods and show their effectiveness on GPT-4V and Gemini Pro Vision. We further finetune an open-source Design2Code-18B model that successfully matches the performance of Gemini Pro Vision. Both human evaluation and automatic metrics show that GPT-4V performs the best on this task compared to other models. Moreover, annotators think GPT-4V generated webpages can replace the original reference webpages in 49% of cases in terms of visual appearance and content; and perhaps surprisingly, in 64% of cases GPT-4V generated webpages are considered better than the original reference webpages. Our fine-grained break-down metrics indicate that open-source models mostly lag in recalling visual elements from the input webpages and in generating correct layout designs, while aspects like text content and coloring can be drastically improved with proper finetuning.</description>

      <title>SNIFFER: Multimodal Large Language Model for Explainable Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Misinformation is a prevalent societal issue due to its potential high risks. Out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, where authentic images are repurposed with false text, is one of the easiest and most effective ways to mislead audiences. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency but lack convincing explanations for their judgments, which is essential for debunking misinformation. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rich knowledge and innate capability for visual reasoning and explanation generation, they still lack sophistication in understanding and discovering the subtle crossmodal differences. In this paper, we introduce SNIFFER, a novel multimodal large language model specifically engineered for OOC misinformation detection and explanation. SNIFFER employs two-stage instruction tuning on InstructBLIP. The first stage refines the model's concept alignment of generic objects with news-domain entities and the second stage leverages language-only GPT-4 generated OOC-specific instruction data to fine-tune the model's discriminatory powers. Enhanced by external tools and retrieval, SNIFFER not only detects inconsistencies between text and image but also utilizes external knowledge for contextual verification. Our experiments show that SNIFFER surpasses the original MLLM by over 40% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. SNIFFER also provides accurate and persuasive explanations as validated by quantitative and human evaluations.</description>

      <title>Towards Democratized Flood Risk Management: An Advanced AI Assistant Enabled by GPT-4 for Enhanced Interpretability and Public Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time flood forecasting plays a crucial role in enabling timely and effective emergency responses. However, a significant challenge lies in bridging the gap between complex numerical flood models and practical decision-making. Decision-makers often rely on experts to interpret these models for optimizing flood mitigation strategies. And the public requires complex techniques to inquiry and understand socio-cultural and institutional factors, often hinders the public's understanding of flood risks. To overcome these challenges, our study introduces an innovative solution: a customized AI Assistant powered by the GPT-4 Large Language Model. This AI Assistant is designed to facilitate effective communication between decision-makers, the general public, and flood forecasters, without the requirement of specialized knowledge. The new framework utilizes GPT-4's advanced natural language understanding and function calling capabilities to provide immediate flood alerts and respond to various flood-related inquiries. Our developed prototype integrates real-time flood warnings with flood maps and social vulnerability data. It also effectively translates complex flood zone information into actionable risk management advice. To assess its performance, we evaluated the prototype using six criteria within three main categories: relevance, error resilience, and understanding of context. Our research marks a significant step towards a more accessible and user-friendly approach in flood risk management. This study highlights the potential of advanced AI tools like GPT-4 in democratizing information and enhancing public engagement in critical social and environmental issues.</description>

      <title>The WMDP Benchmark: Measuring and Reducing Malicious Use With Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The White House Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence highlights the risks of large language models (LLMs) empowering malicious actors in developing biological, cyber, and chemical weapons. To measure these risks of malicious use, government institutions and major AI labs are developing evaluations for hazardous capabilities in LLMs. However, current evaluations are private, preventing further research into mitigating risk. Furthermore, they focus on only a few, highly specific pathways for malicious use. To fill these gaps, we publicly release the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark, a dataset of 4,157 multiple-choice questions that serve as a proxy measurement of hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. WMDP was developed by a consortium of academics and technical consultants, and was stringently filtered to eliminate sensitive information prior to public release. WMDP serves two roles: first, as an evaluation for hazardous knowledge in LLMs, and second, as a benchmark for unlearning methods to remove such hazardous knowledge. To guide progress on unlearning, we develop CUT, a state-of-the-art unlearning method based on controlling model representations. CUT reduces model performance on WMDP while maintaining general capabilities in areas such as biology and computer science, suggesting that unlearning may be a concrete path towards reducing malicious use from LLMs. We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://wmdp.ai</description>

      <title>Human Simulacra: A Step toward the Personification of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are recognized as systems that closely mimic aspects of human intelligence. This capability has attracted attention from the social science community, who see the potential in leveraging LLMs to replace human participants in experiments, thereby reducing research costs and complexity. In this paper, we introduce a framework for large language models personification, including a strategy for constructing virtual characters' life stories from the ground up, a Multi-Agent Cognitive Mechanism capable of simulating human cognitive processes, and a psychology-guided evaluation method to assess human simulations from both self and observational perspectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our constructed simulacra can produce personified responses that align with their target characters. Our work is a preliminary exploration which offers great potential in practical applications. All the code and datasets will be released, with the hope of inspiring further investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: More than six million people died of the COVID-19 by April 2022. The heavy casualties have put people on great and urgent alert and people try to find all kinds of information to keep them from being inflected by the coronavirus. This research tries to find out whether the mobile health text information sent to peoples devices is correct as smartphones becoming the major information source for people. The proposed method uses various mobile information retrieval and data mining technologies including lexical analysis, stopword elimination, stemming, and decision trees to classify the mobile health text information to one of the following classes: (i) true, (ii) fake, (iii) misinformative, (iv) disinformative, and (v) neutral. Experiment results show the accuracy of the proposed method is above the threshold value 50 percentage, but is not optimal. It is because the problem, mobile text misinformation identification, is intrinsically difficult.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Local and Global Fairness Trade-offs in Federated Learning Using Partial Information Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents an information-theoretic perspective to group fairness trade-offs in federated learning (FL) with respect to sensitive attributes, such as gender, race, etc. Existing works often focus on either $\textit{global fairness}$ (overall disparity of the model across all clients) or $\textit{local fairness}$ (disparity of the model at each client), without always considering their trade-offs. There is a lack of understanding regarding the interplay between global and local fairness in FL, particularly under data heterogeneity, and if and when one implies the other. To address this gap, we leverage a body of work in information theory called partial information decomposition (PID), which first identifies three sources of unfairness in FL, namely, $\textit{Unique Disparity}$, $\textit{Redundant Disparity}$, and $\textit{Masked Disparity}$. We demonstrate how these three disparities contribute to global and local fairness using canonical examples. This decomposition helps us derive fundamental limits on the trade-off between global and local fairness, highlighting where they agree or disagree. We introduce the $\textit{Accuracy and Global-Local Fairness Optimality Problem (AGLFOP)}$, a convex optimization that defines the theoretical limits of accuracy and fairness trade-offs, identifying the best possible performance any FL strategy can attain given a dataset and client distribution. We also present experimental results on synthetic datasets and the ADULT dataset to support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Generative AI in Higher Education: Seeing ChatGPT Through Universities' Policies, Resources, and Guidelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies such as ChatGPT provide opportunities to enrich educational experiences, but also raise concerns about academic integrity if misused. This study aims to explore how universities and educators respond and adapt to the development of GenAI in their academic contexts by analyzing academic policies and guidelines established by top-ranked US universities regarding the use of ChatGPT in higher education. The data sources include academic policies, statements, guidelines as well as relevant resources provided by the top 100 universities in the US. Results show that the majority of these universities adopt an open but cautious approach towards the integration of GenAI. Primary concerns lie in ethical usage, accuracy, and data privacy. Most universities actively respond and provide diverse types of resources, such as syllabus templates/samples, workshops, shared articles, and one-on-one consultations, with topics focusing on general technical introduction, ethical concerns, pedagogical applications, preventive strategies, data privacy, limitations, and detective tools. The findings provide two suggestions for educators in policy-making: establish discipline-specific policies, and manage sensitive information carefully, as well as four implications for educators in teaching practices: accept its presence, align its use with learning objectives, evolve curriculum to prevent misuse, and adopt multifaceted evaluation strategies rather than relying on AI detectors.</description>
