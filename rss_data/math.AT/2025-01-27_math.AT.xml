      <title>$C_2$-Equivariant Orthogonal Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a version of orthogonal calculus for functors from $C_2$-representations to $C_2$-spaces, where $C_2$ is the cyclic group of order 2. For example, the functor $BO(-)$, that sends a $C_2$-representation to the classifying space of its orthogonal group, which has a $C_2$-action induced by the action on the $C_2$-representation. We obtain a bigraded sequence of approximations to such a functor, and via a zig-zag of Quillen equivalences, we prove that the homotopy fibres of maps between approximations are fully determined by orthogonal spectra with a genuine action of $C_2$ and a naive action of the orthogonal group $O(p,q):=O(\mathbb{R}^{p+q\delta})$.</description>

      <title>A Classifying Space for Phases of Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a topological space $\mathcal{B}$ consisting of translation invariant injective matrix product states (MPS) of all physical and bond dimensions and show that it has the weak homotopy type $K(\mathbb{Z}, 2) \times K(\mathbb{Z}, 3)$. The implication is that the phase of a family of such states parametrized by a space $X$ is completely determined by two invariants: a class in $H^2(X; \mathbb{Z})$ corresponding to the Chern number per unit cell and a class in $H^3(X; \mathbb{Z})$, the so-called Kapustin-Spodyneiko (KS) number. The space $\mathcal{B}$ is defined as the quotient of a contractible space $\mathcal{E}$ of MPS tensors by an equivalence relation describing gauge transformations of the tensors. We prove that the projection map $p:\mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ is a quasifibration, and this allows us to determine the weak homotopy type of $\mathcal{B}$. As an example, we review the Chern number pump-a family of MPS parametrized by $S^3$-and prove that it generates $\pi_3(\mathcal{B})$.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Topological Regularizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent space matching, which consists of matching distributions of features in latent space, is a crucial component for tasks such as adversarial attacks and defenses, domain adaptation, and generative modelling. Metrics for probability measures, such as Wasserstein and maximum mean discrepancy, are commonly used to quantify the differences between such distributions. However, these are often costly to compute, or do not appropriately take the geometric and topological features of the distributions into consideration. Persistent homology is a tool from topological data analysis which quantifies the multi-scale topological structure of point clouds, and has recently been used as a topological regularizer in learning tasks. However, computation costs preclude larger scale computations, and discontinuities in the gradient lead to unstable training behavior such as in adversarial tasks. We propose the use of principal persistence measures, based on computing the persistent homology of a large number of small subsamples, as a topological regularizer. We provide a parallelized GPU implementation of this regularizer, and prove that gradients are continuous for smooth densities. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this regularizer on shape matching, image generation, and semi-supervised learning tasks, opening the door towards a scalable regularizer for topological features.</description>

Abstract: We produce refinements of the known multiplicative structures on the Brown--Peterson spectrum $BP$, its truncated variants $BP\langle n \rangle$, Ravenel's spectra $X(n)$, and evenly graded polynomial rings over the sphere spectrum. Consequently, topological Hochschild homology relative to these rings inherits a circle action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study the proper topological complexity of a given configuration space, a version of the classical invariant for which we require that the algorithm controlling the motion is able to avoid any possible choice of ``unsafe'' area. To make it a homotopy functorial invariant we characterize it as a particular instance of the exterior sectional category of an exterior map, an invariant of the exterior homotopy category which is also deeply analyzed.</description>

      <title>Identities for Whitehead products and infinite sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10430</link>

Abstract: Whitehead products and natural infinite sums are prominent in the higher homotopy groups of the $n$-dimensional infinite earring space $\mathbb{E}_n$ and other locally complicated Peano continua. In this paper, we derive general identities for how these operations interact with each other. As an application, we consider a shrinking wedge $X$ of finite $(n-1)$-connected CW-complexes $X_1,X_2,X_3,\dots$ and compute the infinite-sum closure $\mathcal{W}_{2n-1}(X)$ of the set of Whitehead products $[\alpha,\beta]$ in $\pi_{2n-1}\left(X\right)$ where $\alpha,\beta\in\pi_n(X)$ are represented in respective sub-wedges that meet only at the basepoint. In particular, we show that $\mathcal{W}_{2n-1}(X)$ is canonically isomorphic to $\prod_{j=1}^{\infty}\left(\pi_{n}(X_j)\otimes \prod_{k&gt;j}\pi_n(X_k)\right)$. The insight provided by this computation motivates a conjecture about the isomorphism type of the elusive groups $\pi_{2n-1}(\mathbb{E}_n)$, $n\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>On the algebraic transfers of ranks 4 and 6 at generic degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak A$ denote the classical singly-graded Steenrod algebra over the binary field $\mathbb Z/2.$ We write $P_k:=\mathbb Z/2[t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k]$ as the polynomial algebra on $k$ generators, each having a degree of one. Let $GL_k$ be the general linear group of rank $k$ over $\mathbb Z/2.$ Then, $P_k$ is an $ \mathfrak A[GL_k]$-module. The structure of the cohomology groups, ${\rm Ext}_{ \mathfrak A}^{k, k+\bullet}(\mathbb Z/2, \mathbb Z/2)$, of the Steenrod algebra has, thus far, resisted clear understanding and full description for all homological degrees $k$. In the study of these groups, the algebraic transfer$-$constructed by W. Singer in [Math. Z. 202, 493--523 (1989)]$-$plays an important role. The Singer transfer is represented by the following homomorphism: $$Tr_k: {\rm Hom}([(\mathbb Z/2\otimes_{ \mathfrak A} P_k)_{\bullet}]^{GL_k}, \mathbb Z/2)\longrightarrow {\rm Ext}_{ \mathfrak A}^{k, k+\bullet}(\mathbb Z/2, \mathbb Z/2).$$ Among Singer's contributions is an interesting open conjecture asserting the monomorphism of $Tr_k$ for all $k.$ For this reason, our main aim in this article is to ascertain the validity of the Singer conjecture for ranks 4 and 6 in certain families of internal degrees. We place particular emphasis on the rank 4 case. More precisely, we present a detailed proof for certain generic degree cases when verifying the conjecture of rank four, which were succinctly noted in our previous work [Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A 153, 1529--1542 (2023)].</description>
