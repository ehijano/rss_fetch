      <title>Gaussian Processes Regression for Uncertainty Quantification: An Introductory Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is a powerful method widely used in Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). This tutorial serves as an introductory guide for beginners, aiming to offer a structured and accessible overview of GPR's applications in UQ. We begin with an introduction to UQ and outline its key tasks, including uncertainty propagation, risk estimation, optimization under uncertainty, parameter estimation, and sensitivity analysis. We then introduce Gaussian Processes (GPs) as a surrogate modeling technique, detailing their formulation, choice of covariance kernels, hyperparameter estimation, and active learning strategies for efficient data acquisition. The tutorial further explores how GPR can be applied to different UQ tasks, including Bayesian quadrature for uncertainty propagation, active learning-based risk estimation, Bayesian optimization for optimization under uncertainty, and surrogate-based sensitivity analysis. Throughout, we emphasize how to leverage the unique formulation of GP for these UQ tasks, rather than simply using it as a standard surrogate model.</description>

      <title>Confidence intervals for functionals in constrained inverse problems via data-adaptive sampling-based calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address functional uncertainty quantification for ill-posed inverse problems where it is possible to evaluate a possibly rank-deficient forward model, the observation noise distribution is known, and there are known parameter constraints. We present four constraint-aware confidence intervals extending the work of Batlle et al. (2023) by making the intervals both computationally feasible and less conservative. Our approach first shrinks the potentially unbounded constraint set compact in a data-adaptive way, obtains samples of the relevant test statistic inside this set to estimate a quantile function, and then uses these computed quantities to produce the intervals. Our data-adaptive bounding approach is based on the approach by Berger and Boos (1994), and involves defining a subset of the constraint set where the true parameter exists with high probability. This probabilistic guarantee is then incorporated into the final coverage guarantee in the form of an uncertainty budget. We then propose custom sampling algorithms to efficiently sample from this subset, even when the parameter space is high-dimensional. Optimization-based interval methods formulate confidence interval computation as two endpoint optimizations, where the optimization constraints can be set to achieve different types of interval calibration while seamlessly incorporating parameter constraints. However, choosing valid optimization constraints has been elusive. We show that all four proposed intervals achieve nominal coverage for a particular functional both theoretically and in practice, with numerical examples demonstrating superior performance of our intervals over the OSB interval in terms of both coverage and expected length. In particular, we show the superior performance in a realistic unfolding simulation from high-energy physics that is severely ill-posed and involves a rank-deficient forward model.</description>

      <title>Posterior SBC: Simulation-Based Calibration Checking Conditional on Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based calibration checking (SBC) refers to the validation of an inference algorithm and model implementation through repeated inference on data simulated from a generative model. In the original and commonly used approach, the generative model uses parameters drawn from the prior, and thus the approach is testing whether the inference works for simulated data generated with parameter values plausible under that prior. This approach is natural and desirable when we want to test whether the inference works for a wide range of datasets we might observe. However, after observing data, we are interested in answering whether the inference works conditional on that particular data. In this paper, we propose posterior SBC and demonstrate how it can be used to validate the inference conditionally on observed data. We illustrate the utility of posterior SBC in three case studies: (1) A simple multilevel model; (2) a model that is governed by differential equations; and (3) a joint integrative neuroscience model which is approximated via amortized Bayesian inference with neural networks.</description>

      <title>Linearized Optimal Transport pyLOT Library: A Toolkit for Machine Learning on Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pyLOT library offers a Python implementation of linearized optimal transport (LOT) techniques and methods to use in downstream tasks. The pipeline embeds probability distributions into a Hilbert space via the Optimal Transport maps from a fixed reference distribution, and this linearization allows downstream tasks to be completed using off the shelf (linear) machine learning algorithms. We provide a case study of performing ML on 3D scans of lemur teeth, where the original questions of classification, clustering, dimension reduction, and data generation reduce to simple linear operations performed on the LOT embedded representations.</description>

      <title>The Performance Of The Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm Without Smoothness Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the problem of sampling from distributions whose densities are not necessarily smooth nor log-concave. We propose a simple Langevin-based algorithm that does not rely on popular but computationally challenging techniques, such as the Moreau Yosida envelope or Gaussian smoothing. We derive non-asymptotic guarantees for the convergence of the algorithm to the target distribution in Wasserstein distances. Non asymptotic bounds are also provided for the performance of the algorithm as an optimizer, specifically for the solution of associated excess risk optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Unified Robust Boosting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.07718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boosting is a popular algorithm in supervised machine learning with wide applications in regression and classification problems. It combines weak learners, such as regression trees, to obtain accurate predictions. However, in the presence of outliers, traditional boosting may yield inferior results since the algorithm optimizes a convex loss function. Recent literature has proposed boosting algorithms that optimize robust nonconvex loss functions. Nevertheless, there is a lack of weighted estimation to indicate the outlier status of observations. This article introduces the iteratively reweighted boosting (IRBoost) algorithm, which combines robust loss optimization and weighted estimation. It can be conveniently constructed with existing software. The output includes weights as valuable diagnostics for the outlier status of observations. For practitioners interested in the boosting algorithm, the new method can be interpreted as a way to tune robust observation weights. IRBoost is implemented in the R package irboost and is demonstrated using publicly available data in generalized linear models, classification, and survival data analysis.</description>

      <title>Fast Conservative Monte Carlo Confidence Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extant "fast" algorithms for Monte Carlo confidence sets are limited to univariate shift parameters for the one-sample and two-sample problems using the sample mean as the test statistic; moreover, some do not converge reliably and most do not produce conservative confidence sets. We outline general methods for constructing confidence sets for real-valued and multidimensional parameters by inverting Monte Carlo tests using any test statistic and a broad range of randomization schemes. The method exploits two facts that, to our knowledge, had not been combined: (i) there are Monte Carlo tests that are conservative despite relying on simulation, and (ii) since the coverage probability of confidence sets depends only on the significance level of the test of the true null, every null can be tested using the same Monte Carlo sample. The Monte Carlo sample can be arbitrarily small, although the highest nontrivial attainable confidence level generally increases as the number $N$ of Monte Carlo replicates increases. We present open-source Python and R implementations of new algorithms to compute conservative confidence sets for real-valued and multidimensional parameters from Monte Carlo tests, for test statistics and randomization schemes that yield $P$-values that are monotone or weakly unimodal in the parameter, with the data and Monte Carlo sample held fixed. In this case, the new method finds conservative confidence sets for real-valued parameters in $O(n)$ time, where $n$ is the number of data. The values of some test statistics for different simulations and parameter values have a simple relationship that makes more savings possible.</description>

      <title>Markov chain Monte Carlo without evaluating the target: an auxiliary variable approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In sampling tasks, it is common for target distributions to be known up to a normalizing constant. However, in many situations, even evaluating the unnormalized distribution can be costly or infeasible. This issue arises in scenarios such as sampling from the Bayesian posterior for tall datasets and the 'doubly-intractable' distributions. In this paper, we begin by observing that seemingly different Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, such as the exchange algorithm, PoissonMH, and TunaMH, can be unified under a simple common procedure. We then extend this procedure into a novel framework that allows the use of auxiliary variables in both the proposal and the acceptance-rejection step. Several new MCMC algorithms emerge from this framework that utilize estimated gradients to guide the proposal moves. They have demonstrated significantly better performance than existing methods on both synthetic and real datasets. Additionally, we develop the theory of the new framework and apply it to existing algorithms to simplify and extend their results.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Variational Inference for Structured Additive Distributional Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In structured additive distributional regression, the conditional distribution of the response variables given the covariate information and the vector of model parameters is modelled using a P-parametric probability density function where each parameter is modelled through a linear predictor and a bijective response function that maps the domain of the predictor into the domain of the parameter. We present a method to perform inference in structured additive distributional regression using stochastic variational inference. We propose two strategies for constructing a multivariate Gaussian variational distribution to estimate the posterior distribution of the regression coefficients. The first strategy leverages covariate information and hyperparameters to learn both the location vector and the precision matrix. The second strategy tackles the complexity challenges of the first by initially assuming independence among all smooth terms and then introducing correlations through an additional set of variational parameters. Furthermore, we present two approaches for estimating the smoothing parameters. The first treats them as free parameters and provides point estimates, while the second accounts for uncertainty by applying a variational approximation to the posterior distribution. Our model was benchmarked against state-of-the-art competitors in logistic and gamma regression simulation studies. Finally, we validated our approach by comparing its posterior estimates to those obtained using Markov Chain Monte Carlo on a dataset of patents from the biotechnology/pharmaceutics and semiconductor/computer sectors.</description>

      <title>Advancing Network Securing Strategies with Network Algorithms for Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) Missile Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) has become vital for the defense system as the military defense system is vital for national security. Placing Integrated Air Defense System batteries among locations to protect locations assets is a crucial problem because optimal solutions are needed for interceptor missiles to intercept attacker missiles for maximizing protection of assets across locations or places. In this research, the procedures of using network algorithms along with developing several network algorithms are going to be demonstrated to develop a model for sequential development of seven network securing strategies of placing Surface to Air Missile (SAM) batteries to maximize the protection of assets across locations (based on given asset values) by generating optimal solutions through computation to destroy maximum attacker missiles by using minimum interceptor missiles with given intercept probability. This network securing strategies can be implemented not only for Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) planning but also Counter Air (CA) planning as Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) is conducted with defensive counter air supported by attack operations in offensive counter air.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to improving Genetic Algorithms (GA) in large or complex problem spaces by incorporating new chromosome patterns in the breeding process through border trade activities. These strategies increase chromosome diversity, preventing premature convergence and enhancing the GA's ability to explore the solution space more effectively. Empirical evidence demonstrates significant improvements in convergence behavior. This approach offers a promising pathway to addressing challenges in optimizing large or complex problem domains.</description>
