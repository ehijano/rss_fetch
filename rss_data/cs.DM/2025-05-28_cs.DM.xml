      <title>Colouring Probe $H$-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NP-complete problems Colouring and k-Colouring $(k\geq 3$) are well studied on $H$-free graphs, i.e., graphs that do not contain some fixed graph $H$ as an induced subgraph. We research to what extent the known polynomial-time algorithms for $H$-free graphs can be generalized if we only know some of the edges of the input graph. We do this by considering the classical probe graph model introduced in the early nineties. For a graph $H$, a partitioned probe $H$-free graph $(G,P,N)$ consists of a graph $G=(V,E)$, together with a set $P\subseteq V$ of probes and an independent set $N=V\setminus P$ of non-probes, such that $G+F$ is $H$-free for some edge set $F\subseteq \binom{N}{2}$. We first fully classify the complexity of Colouring on partitioned probe $H$-free graphs and show that this dichotomy is different from the known dichotomy of Colouring for $H$-free graphs. Our main result is a dichotomy of $3$-Colouring for partitioned probe $P_t$-free graphs: we prove that the problem is polynomial-time solvable if $t\leq 5$ but NP-complete if $t\geq 6$. In contrast, $3$-Colouring on $P_t$-free graphs is known to be polynomial-time solvable if $t\leq 7$ and quasi polynomial-time solvable for $t\geq 8$.</description>

      <title>Complexity landscape for local certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An impressive recent line of work has charted the complexity landscape of distributed graph algorithms. For many settings, it has been determined which time complexities exist, and which do not (in the sense that no local problem could have an optimal algorithm with that complexity). In this paper, we initiate the study of the landscape for space complexity of distributed graph algorithms. More precisely, we focus on the local certification setting, where a prover assigns certificates to nodes to certify a property, and where the space complexity is measured by the size of the certificates.
  Already for anonymous paths and cycles, we unveil a surprising landscape:
  - There is a gap between complexity $O(1)$ and $\Theta(\log \log n)$ in paths. This is the first gap established in local certification.
  - There exists a property that has complexity $\Theta(\log \log n)$ in paths, a regime that was not known to exist for a natural property.
  - There is a gap between complexity $O(1)$ and $\Theta(\log n)$ in cycles, hence a gap that is exponentially larger than for paths.
  We then generalize our result for paths to the class of trees. Namely, we show that there is a gap between complexity $O(1)$ and $\Theta(\log \log d)$ in trees, where $d$ is the diameter. We finally describe some settings where there are no gaps at all. To prove our results we develop a new toolkit, based on various results of automata theory and arithmetic, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A refined view of a curious identity for partitions into odd parts with designated summands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2002, Andrews, Lewis, and Lovejoy introduced the combinatorial objects which they called partitions with designated summands. These are constructed by taking unrestricted integer partitions and designating exactly one of each occurrence of a part. In the same work, they also considered the restricted partitions with designated summands wherein all parts must be odd, and they denoted the corresponding function by $\mathrm{PDO}(n)$.</description>

      <title>Rainbow copies of spanning subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G_{n,p}^{[\kappa]}$ denote the space of $n$-vertex edge coloured graphs, where each edge occurs independently with probability $p$. The colour of each existing edge is chosen independently and uniformly at random from the set $[\kappa]$. We consider the threshold for the existence of rainbow colored copies of a spanning subgraph $H$. We provide lower bounds on $p$ and $\kappa$ sufficient to prove the existence of such copies w.h.p.</description>

      <title>Pushing Cops and Robber on Graphs of Maximum Degree 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \textsc{Cops and Robber} is a game played on graphs where a set of \textit{cops} aim to \textit{capture} the position of a single \textit{robber}. The main parameter of interest in this game is the \textit{cop number}, which is the minimum number of cops that are sufficient to guarantee the capture of the robber.
  In a directed graph $\overrightarrow{G}$, the \textit{push} operation on a vertex $v$ reverses the orientation of all arcs incident on $v$. We consider a variation of classical \textsc{Cops and Robber} on oriented graphs, where in its turn, each cop can either move to an out-neighbor of its current vertex or push some vertex of the graph, whereas, the robber can move to an adjacent vertex in its turn. [Das et al., CALDAM, 2023] introduced this variant and established that if $\overrightarrow{G}$ is an orientation of a subcubic graph, then one cop with push ability has a winning strategy. We extend these results to establish that if $\overrightarrow{G}$ is an orientation of a $3$-degenerate graph, or of a graph with maximum degree $4$, then one cop with push ability has a winning strategy.</description>

      <title>Reuniting $\chi$-boundedness with polynomial $\chi$-boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class $\mathcal F$ of graphs is $\chi$-bounded if there is a function $f$ such that $\chi(H)\le f(\omega(H))$ for all induced subgraphs $H$ of a graph in $\mathcal F$. If $f$ can be chosen to be a polynomial, we say that $\mathcal F$ is polynomially $\chi$-bounded. Esperet proposed a conjecture that every $\chi$-bounded class of graphs is polynomially $\chi$-bounded. This conjecture has been disproved; it has been shown that there are classes of graphs that are $\chi$-bounded but not polynomially $\chi$-bounded. Nevertheless, inspired by Esperet's conjecture, we introduce Pollyanna classes of graphs. A class $\mathcal C$ of graphs is Pollyanna if $\mathcal C\cap \mathcal F$ is polynomially $\chi$-bounded for every $\chi$-bounded class $\mathcal F$ of graphs. We prove that several classes of graphs are Pollyanna and also present some proper classes of graphs that are not Pollyanna.</description>

      <title>Elementary first-order model checking for sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that for subgraph-closed graph classes the first-order model checking problem is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if the class is nowhere dense [Grohe, Kreutzer, Siebertz, STOC 2014]. However, the dependency on the formula size is non-elementary, and in fact, this is unavoidable even for the class of all trees [Frick and Grohe, LICS 2002]. On the other hand, it is known that the dependency is elementary for classes of bounded degree [Frick and Grohe, LICS 2002] as well as for classes of bounded pathwidth [Lampis, ICALP 2023]. In this paper we generalise these results and almost completely characterise subgraph-closed graph classes for which the model checking problem is fixed-parameter tractable with an elementary dependency on the formula size. Those are the graph classes for which there exists a number $d$ such that for every $r$, some tree of depth $d$ and size bounded by an elementary function of $r$ is avoided as an $({\leq} r)$-subdivision in all graphs in the class. In particular, this implies that if the class in question excludes a fixed tree as a topological minor, then first-order model checking for graphs in the class is fixed-parameter tractable with an elementary dependency on the formula size.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Diameter on H-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16678v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intensively studied Diameter problem is to find the diameter of a given connected graph. We investigate, for the first time in a structured manner, the complexity of Diameter for H-free graphs, that is, graphs that do not contain a fixed graph H as an induced subgraph. We first show that if H is not a linear forest with small components, then Diameter cannot be solved in subquadratic time for H-free graphs under SETH. For some small linear forests, we do show linear-time algorithms for solving Diameter. For other linear forests H, we make progress towards linear-time algorithms by considering specific diameter values. If H is a linear forest, the maximum value of the diameter of any graph in a connected H-free graph class is some constant dmax dependent only on H. We give linear-time algorithms for deciding if a connected H-free graph has diameter dmax, for several linear forests H. In contrast, for one such linear forest H, Diameter cannot be solved in subquadratic time for H-free graphs under SETH. Moreover, we even show that, for several other linear forests H, one cannot decide in subquadratic time if a connected H-free graph has diameter dmax under SETH.</description>
