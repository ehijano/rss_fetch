      <title>Partially Active Automated Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of automated market maker (AMM), the \emph{partially active automated market maker} (PA-AMM). PA-AMM divides its reserves into two parts, the active and the passive parts, and uses only the active part for trading. At the top of every block, such a division is done again to keep the active reserves always being \(\lambda\)-portion of total reserves, where \(\lambda \in (0, 1]\) is an activeness parameter. We show that this simple mechanism reduces adverse selection costs, measured by loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR), and thereby improves the wealth of liquidity providers (LPs) relative to plain constant-function market makers (CFMMs). As a trade-off, the asset weights within a PA-AMM pool may deviate from their target weights implied by its invariant curve. Motivated by the optimal index-tracking problem literature, we also propose and solve an optimization problem that balances such deviation and the reduction of LVR.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning (Il)liquidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The estimation of the Risk Neutral Density (RND) implicit in option prices is challenging, especially in illiquid markets. We introduce the Deep Log-Sum-Exp Neural Network, an architecture that leverages Deep and Transfer learning to address RND estimation in the presence of irregular and illiquid strikes. We prove key statistical properties of the model and the consistency of the estimator. We illustrate the benefits of transfer learning to improve the estimation of the RND in severe illiquidity conditions through Monte Carlo simulations, and we test it empirically on SPX data, comparing it with popular estimation methods. Overall, our framework shows recovery of the RND in conditions of extreme illiquidity with as few as three option quotes.</description>

      <title>Rough volatility, path-dependent PDEs and weak rates of convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the setting of stochastic Volterra equations, and in particular rough volatility models, we show that conditional expectations are the unique classical solutions to path-dependent PDEs. The latter arise from the functional It\^o formula developed by [Viens, F., &amp; Zhang, J. (2019). A martingale approach for fractional Brownian motions and related path dependent PDEs. Ann. Appl. Probab.]. We then leverage these tools to study weak rates of convergence for discretised stochastic integrals of smooth functions of a Riemann-Liouville fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H \in (0,\frac{1}{2})$. These integrals approximate log-stock prices in rough volatility models. We obtain the optimal weak error rates of order $1$ if the test function is quadratic and of order $(3H+\frac{1}{2})\wedge1$ if the test function is five times differentiable; in particular these conditions are independent of the value of $H$.</description>
