      <title>Optimized Gutzwiller Projected States for Doped Antiferromagnets in Fermi-Hubbard Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum many-body physics, one aims to understand emergent phenomena and effects of strong interactions, ideally by developing a simple theoretical picture. Recently, progress in quantum simulators has enabled the measurement of site resolved snapshots of Fermi-Hubbard systems at finite doping on square as well as triangular lattice geometries. These experimental advances pose the quest for theorists to analyze the ensuing data in order to gain insights into these prototypical, strongly correlated many-body systems. Here we employ machine learning techniques to optimize the mean-field parameters of a resonating valence bond (RVB) state through comparison with experimental data, thus determining a possible underlying simple model that is physically motivated and fully interpretable. We find that the resulting RVB states are capable of capturing two- as well as three-point correlations measured in experiments, even when they are not specifically used in the optimization. The analysis of the mean-field parameters and their doping dependence can be used to obtain physical insights and shed light on the nature of possible underlying quantum spin liquid states. Our results show that finite temperature data from Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulators can be well captured by RVB states. This work paves the way for a new, systematic analysis of data from numerical as well as quantum simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Topologically nontrivial and trivial flat bands via weak and strong interlayer coupling in twisted bilayer honeycomb optical lattices for ultracold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, flat electronic bands in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) have attracted significant attention due to their intriguing topological properties, extremely slow electron velocities, and enhanced density of states. Extending twisted bilayer systems to new configurations is highly desirable, as it offers promising opportunities to explore flat bands beyond TBG. Here, we study both topological and trivial flat bands in a twisted bilayer honeycomb lattice for ultracold atoms and present the evolution of the flat bands with different interlayer coupling strength (ICS). Our results demonstrate that an isolated topological flat band can emerge at the Dirac point energy for a specific value of weak ICS, referred to as the ``critical coupling". This occurs over a wide range of twist angles, surpassing the limits of the magic angle in TBG systems. When the ICS is slightly increased beyond the critical coupling value, the topological flat band exhibits degenerate band crossings with both the upper and lower adjacent bands at the high-symmetry $\Gamma_s$ point. As the ICS is further increased into the strong coupling regime, trivial flat bands arise around Dirac point energy. Meanwhile, more trivial flat bands appear, extending from the lowest to higher energy bands, and remain flat as the ICS increases. The topological properties of the flat bands are studied through the winding pattern of the Wilson loop spectrum. Our research provides deeper insights into the formation of flat bands in ultracold atoms with highly controllable twisted bilayer optical lattices, and may contribute to the discovery of new strongly correlated states of matter.</description>

      <title>Exploring light-induced phases of 2D materials in a modulated 1D quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Illuminating integer quantum Hall matter with polarized light can drive quantum phase transitions. Technical limitations on laser intensity and material purity make such experiments challenging in the solid state. However, the Harper-Hofstadter mapping which relates a two-dimensional integer quantum Hall system to a 1D quasicrystal enables the same polarization-dependent light-induced phase transitions to be observed using a quantum gas in a driven quasiperiodic optical lattice. We report experimental results from such a 1D quantum simulator of 2D integer quantum Hall matter driven by light of variable polarization. We observe an interlaced phase diagram of localization-delocalization phase transitions as a function of drive polarization and amplitude. Elliptically polarized driving can stabilize an extended critical phase featuring multifractal wavefunctions; we observe signatures of this phenomenon in subdiffusive transport. In this regime, increasing the strength of the quasiperiodic potential can enhance rather than suppress transport. These experiments demonstrate a simple method for synthesizing exotic multifractal states and exploring light-induced quantum phases across different dimensionalities.</description>

      <title>The Aharonov-Casher Phase: Considerations Regarding Force, Time-Dependence, and Berry Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relation of the Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect and the force on a particle having a magnetic moment is explored. The general form of the AC Hamiltonian is derived using the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation to the Dirac equation. Geometries in which an analytic expression for the phase can be obtained are examined, as well as the relation of the AC phase to the Berry phase. The AC phase is determined for an arbitrary homogeneous electric field; it is quadratic (linear) in the field strength for small (large) electric field strengths.</description>

      <title>Continuously trapped matter-wave interferometry in magic Floquet-Bloch band structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trapped matter-wave interferometry offers the promise of compact high-precision local force sensing. However, the trap itself can introduce new systematic errors which are absent in traditional free-fall interferometers. We describe and demonstrate a novel Floquet-engineered platform for compact, continuously trapped atom interferometry which is intrinsically robust against trap noise and beamsplitter pulse duration. A non-interacting degenerate quantum gas undergoes position-space Bloch oscillations through an amplitude-modulated optical lattice, whose resulting Floquet-Bloch band structure includes Landau-Zener beamsplitters and Bragg mirrors, forming the components of a Mach-Zehnder interferometric force sensor. We identify, realize, and experimentally characterize magic band structures, analogous to the magic wavelengths employed in optical lattice clocks, for which the interferometric phase is insensitive to lattice intensity noise. We leverage the intrinsic programmability of the Floquet synthesis approach to demonstrate a variety of interferometer structures, highlighting the potential of this technique for quantum force sensors which are tunable, compact, simple, and robust.</description>

      <title>Measurement-based quantum computation with variable-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that weighted graph states (WGS) generated via variable-range interacting Ising spin systems where the interaction strength decays with distance as a power law, characterized by the fall-off rate, can successfully implement single- and two-qubit gates with fidelity exceeding classical limits by performing suitable measurements. In the regime of truly long-range interactions (small fall-off rate), optimizing over local unitary operations, while retaining the local measurement scheme in the original measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) set-up, enables the scheme to achieve nonclassical average fidelities. Specifically, we identify a threshold fall-off rate of the interaction above which the fidelity of both universal single- and two-qubit gates consistently exceeds $90\%$ accuracy. Moreover, we exhibit that the gate-implementation protocol remains robust under two realistic imperfections -- noise in the measurement process, modeled via unsharp measurements, and disorder in the interaction strengths. These findings confirm WGS produced through long-range systems as a resilient and effective resource for MBQC.</description>

      <title>Proper Orthogonal Decomposition of a Superfluid Turbulent Wake</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superfluid turbulent wakes behind a square prism are studied theoretically and numerically by proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). POD is a data science approach that can efficiently extract the principal vibration modes of a physical system, and is widely used in hydrodynamics, including applications in wake structure analysis. It is not straightforward to apply the conventional POD method to superfluid wake systems, as the superfluid velocity field diverges at the center of a vortex whose circulation is quantized. We successfully established a POD method by applying appropriate blurring to the vorticity distribution in a two-dimensional superfluid wake. It is shown that a coherent structure corresponding to two parallel arrays of alternating quantum vortex bundles, called the "quasi-classical" K\'arm\'an vortex street, is latent as a distinctive major mode in the superfluid turbulent wakes that were naively thought to be "irregular". Since our method is also effective for fluid density, it can be applied to the experimental data analysis for ultra-cold atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transitions and Mixed State Order in a Hubbard Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological phase transitions challenge conventional paradigms in many-body physics by separating phases that are locally indistinguishable yet globally distinct. Using a quantum simulator of interacting erbium atoms in an optical lattice, we observe such a transition between one-dimensional crystalline symmetry-protected topological phases (CSPTs). We detect the critical point through non-local string order parameters and reveal its connection to the transition predicted between the Mott and Haldane insulators. Moreover, we demonstrate a striking property: stacking two identical systems eliminates the transition, confirming the predicted group structure and invertibility of SPTs. Finally, while introducing symmetry-breaking disorder also removes the transition, disorder averaging restores it. Consequently, the adjacent phases realize a form of mixed-state quantum order wherein the criticality between them depends on the observer's information. Our results demonstrate how topology and information influence quantum phase transitions, opening the doors to probing novel critical phenomena in programmable quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Probing the Topology of Fermionic Gaussian Mixed States with {U(1)} symmetry by Full Counting Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological band theory has been studied for free fermions for decades, and one of the most profound physical results is the bulk-boundary correspondence. Recently a focus in topological physics is extending topological classification to mixed states. Here, we focus on Gaussian mixed states where the modular Hamiltonians of the density matrix are quadratic free fermion models with {U(1)} symmetry and can be classified by topological invariants. The bulk-boundary correspondence is then manifested as stable gapless modes of the modular Hamiltonian and degenerate spectrum of the density matrix. In this article, we show that these gapless modes can be detected by the full counting statistics, mathematically described by a function introduced as {F(\theta)}. A divergent derivative at {\theta=\pi} can be used to probe the gapless modes in the modular Hamiltonian. Based on this, a topological indicator, whose quantization to unity senses topologically nontrivial mixed states, is introduced. We present the physical intuition of these results and also demonstrate these results with concrete models in both one- and two-dimensions. Our results pave the way for revealing the physical significance of topology in mixed states.</description>

      <title>Chiral vortex-line liquid of three-dimensional interacting Bose systems with moat dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and investigate a novel quantum state, the Chiral Vortex-Line Liquid (CVLL), emerging in three-dimensional interacting Bose systems exhibiting moat-band dispersions. Such dispersions feature extensive degeneracy along closed manifolds in momentum space, significantly amplifying quantum fluctuations that suppress conventional Bose-Einstein condensation. By extending the two-dimensional Chern-Simons (CS) flux-attachment transformation to three dimensions through a combination of planar CS phases and Jordan-Wigner fermionization along vortex lines, we construct the CVLL state, characterized by preserved rotational $SO(2)$ symmetry, broken time-reversal symmetry, nontrivial vortex-line excitations, and topological gapless edge surface states. We construct the associated field theory in a curved spatial geometry and analyze the low-energy effective theory of the CVLL state, demonstrating its topological nature. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we numerically determine the scaling of the chemical potential of the CVLL ground state as a function of boson density for interacting bosons in a cylindrical moat-band geometry and demonstrate that the CVLL phase energetically outcompetes traditional condensate phases at low densities, highlighting its relevance to experimental platforms including frustrated quantum magnets, ultracold atomic gases, excitonic systems, the physics of rotons in $^4$He, and moat regimes in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: Interactions between quantum particles, such as electrons, are the source of important effects, ranging from superconductivity, to the formation of molecular bonds, or the stability of elementary compounds at high-energies. In this article, we illustrate how advances in the cold-atom community to further engineer such long-range interactions have stimulated the simulation of new regimes of these fundamental many-body problems. The goal is two-fold: first, to provide a comprehensive review of the different strategies proposed and/or experimentally realized to induce long-range interactions among atoms moving in optical potentials. Second, to showcase various fields where such platforms can offer new insights, ranging from the simulation of condensed matter phenomena to the study of lattice gauge theories, and the simulation of electronic configurations in chemistry. We then discuss the challenges and opportunities of these platforms compared to other complementary approaches based on digital simulation and quantum computation.</description>
