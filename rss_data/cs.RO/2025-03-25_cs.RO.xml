      <title>Splat-LOAM: Gaussian Splatting LiDAR Odometry and Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDARs provide accurate geometric measurements, making them valuable for ego-motion estimation and reconstruction tasks. Although its success, managing an accurate and lightweight representation of the environment still poses challenges. Both classic and NeRF-based solutions have to trade off accuracy over memory and processing times. In this work, we build on recent advancements in Gaussian Splatting methods to develop a novel LiDAR odometry and mapping pipeline that exclusively relies on Gaussian primitives for its scene representation. Leveraging spherical projection, we drive the refinement of the primitives uniquely from LiDAR measurements. Experiments show that our approach matches the current registration performance, while achieving SOTA results for mapping tasks with minimal GPU requirements. This efficiency makes it a strong candidate for further exploration and potential adoption in real-time robotics estimation tasks.</description>

      <title>Shear-based Grasp Control for Multi-fingered Underactuated Tactile Robotic Hands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a shear-based control scheme for grasping and manipulating delicate objects with a Pisa/IIT anthropomorphic SoftHand equipped with soft biomimetic tactile sensors on all five fingertips. These `microTac' tactile sensors are miniature versions of the TacTip vision-based tactile sensor, and can extract precise contact geometry and force information at each fingertip for use as feedback into a controller to modulate the grasp while a held object is manipulated. Using a parallel processing pipeline, we asynchronously capture tactile images and predict contact pose and force from multiple tactile sensors. Consistent pose and force models across all sensors are developed using supervised deep learning with transfer learning techniques. We then develop a grasp control framework that uses contact force feedback from all fingertip sensors simultaneously, allowing the hand to safely handle delicate objects even under external disturbances. This control framework is applied to several grasp-manipulation experiments: first, retaining a flexible cup in a grasp without crushing it under changes in object weight; second, a pouring task where the center of mass of the cup changes dynamically; and third, a tactile-driven leader-follower task where a human guides a held object. These manipulation tasks demonstrate more human-like dexterity with underactuated robotic hands by using fast reflexive control from tactile sensing.</description>

      <title>LLM-Drone: Aerial Additive Manufacturing with Drones Planned Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) has transformed the production landscape by enabling the precision creation of complex geometries. However, AM faces limitations when applied to challenging environments, such as elevated surfaces and remote locations. Aerial additive manufacturing, facilitated by drones, presents a solution to these challenges. However, despite advances in methods for the planning, control, and localization of drones, the accuracy of these methods is insufficient to run traditional feedforward extrusion-based additive manufacturing processes (such as Fused Deposition Manufacturing). Recently, the emergence of LLMs has revolutionized various fields by introducing advanced semantic reasoning and real-time planning capabilities. This paper proposes the integration of LLMs with aerial additive manufacturing to assist with the planning and execution of construction tasks, granting greater flexibility and enabling a feed-back based design and construction system. Using the semantic understanding and adaptability of LLMs, we can overcome the limitations of drone based systems by dynamically generating and adapting building plans on site, ensuring efficient and accurate construction even in constrained environments. Our system is able to design and build structures given only a semantic prompt and has shown success in understanding the spatial environment despite tight planning constraints. Our method's feedback system enables replanning using the LLM if the manufacturing process encounters unforeseen errors, without requiring complicated heuristics or evaluation functions. Combining the semantic planning with automatic error correction, our system achieved a 90% build accuracy, converting simple text prompts to build structures.</description>

      <title>Extending First-order Motion Planners to Second-order Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends first-order motion planners to robots governed by second-order dynamics. Two control schemes are proposed based on the knowledge of a scalar function whose negative gradient aligns with a given first-order motion planner. When such a function is known, the first-order motion planner is combined with a damping velocity vector with a dynamic gain to extend the safety and convergence guarantees of the first-order motion planner to second-order systems. If no such function is available, we propose an alternative control scheme ensuring that the error between the robot's velocity and the first-order motion planner converges to zero. The theoretical developments are supported by simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.</description>

      <title>Feature Selection Based on Reinforcement Learning and Hazard State Classification for Magnetic Adhesion Wall-Climbing Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic adhesion tracked wall-climbing robots face potential risks of overturning during high-altitude operations, making their stability crucial for ensuring safety. This study presents a dynamic feature selection method based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning, combined with typical machine learning models, aimed at improving the classification accuracy of hazardous states under complex operating conditions. Firstly, this work innovatively employs a fiber rod-based MEMS attitude sensor to collect vibration data from the robot and extract high-dimensional feature vectors in both time and frequency domains. Then, a reinforcement learning model is used to dynamically select the optimal feature subset, reducing feature redundancy and enhancing classification accuracy. Finally, a CNN-LSTM deep learning model is employed for classification and recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the robot's ability to assess hazardous states across various operational scenarios, providing reliable technical support for robotic safety monitoring.</description>

      <title>Transferable Latent-to-Latent Locomotion Policy for Efficient and Versatile Motion Control of Diverse Legged Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable capability in acquiring robot skills, but learning each new skill still requires substantial data collection for training. The pretrain-and-finetune paradigm offers a promising approach for efficiently adapting to new robot entities and tasks. Inspired by the idea that acquired knowledge can accelerate learning new tasks with the same robot and help a new robot master a trained task, we propose a latent training framework where a transferable latent-to-latent locomotion policy is pretrained alongside diverse task-specific observation encoders and action decoders. This policy in latent space processes encoded latent observations to generate latent actions to be decoded, with the potential to learn general abstract motion skills. To retain essential information for decision-making and control, we introduce a diffusion recovery module that minimizes information reconstruction loss during pretrain stage. During fine-tune stage, the pretrained latent-to-latent locomotion policy remains fixed, while only the lightweight task-specific encoder and decoder are optimized for efficient adaptation. Our method allows a robot to leverage its own prior experience across different tasks as well as the experience of other morphologically diverse robots to accelerate adaptation. We validate our approach through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating that the pretrained latent-to-latent locomotion policy effectively generalizes to new robot entities and tasks with improved efficiency.</description>

      <title>Computationally and Sample Efficient Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Adaptive Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety is a critical concern in learning-enabled autonomous systems especially when deploying these systems in real-world scenarios. An important challenge is accurately quantifying the uncertainty of unknown models to generate provably safe control policies that facilitate the gathering of informative data, thereby achieving both safe and optimal policies. Additionally, the selection of the data-driven model can significantly impact both the real-time implementation and the uncertainty quantification process. In this paper, we propose a provably sample efficient episodic safe learning framework that remains robust across various model choices with quantified uncertainty for online control tasks. Specifically, we first employ Quadrature Fourier Features (QFF) for kernel function approximation of Gaussian Processes (GPs) to enable efficient approximation of unknown dynamics. Then the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP) is used to quantify the uncertainty from online observations and combined with the Control Barrier Functions (CBF) to characterize the uncertainty-aware safe control constraints under learned dynamics. Finally, an optimism-based exploration strategy is integrated with ACP-based CBFs for safe exploration and near-optimal safe nonlinear control. Theoretical proofs and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Sense4FL: Vehicular Crowdsensing Enhanced Federated Learning for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To accommodate constantly changing road conditions, real-time model training is essential for autonomous driving (AD). Federated learning (FL) serves as a promising paradigm to enable autonomous vehicles to train models collaboratively with their onboard computing resources. However, existing vehicle selection schemes for FL all assume predetermined and location-independent vehicles' datasets, neglecting the fact that vehicles collect training data along their routes, thereby resulting in suboptimal vehicle selection. To improve the perception quality in AD for a region, we propose Sense4FL, a vehicular crowdsensing-enhanced FL framework featuring trajectory-dependent vehicular training data collection. To this end, we first derive the convergence bound of FL by considering the impact of both vehicles' uncertain trajectories and uploading probabilities, from which we discover that minimizing the training loss is equivalent to minimizing a weighted sum of local and global earth mover's distance (EMD) between vehicles' collected data distribution and global data distribution. Based on this observation, we formulate the trajectory-dependent vehicle selection and data collection problem for FL in AD. Given that the problem is NP-hard, we develop an efficient algorithm to find the solution with an approximation guarantee. Extensive simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in improving object detection performance compared with existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>RAIDER: Tool-Equipped Large Language Model Agent for Robotic Action Issue Detection, Explanation and Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As robots increasingly operate in dynamic human-centric environments, improving their ability to detect, explain, and recover from action-related issues becomes crucial. Traditional model-based and data-driven techniques lack adaptability, while more flexible generative AI methods struggle with grounding extracted information to real-world constraints. We introduce RAIDER, a novel agent that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with grounded tools for adaptable and efficient issue detection and explanation. Using a unique "Ground, Ask&amp; Answer, Issue" procedure, RAIDER dynamically generates context-aware precondition questions and selects appropriate tools for resolution, achieving targeted information gathering. Our results within a simulated household environment surpass methods relying on predefined models, full scene descriptions, or standalone trained models. Additionally, RAIDER's explanations enhance recovery success, including cases requiring human interaction. Its modular architecture, featuring self-correction mechanisms, enables straightforward adaptation to diverse scenarios, as demonstrated in a real-world human-assistive task. This showcases RAIDER's potential as a versatile agentic AI solution for robotic issue detection and explanation, while addressing the problem of grounding generative AI for its effective application in embodied agents.

      <title>Adaptive Perching and Grasping by Aerial Robot with Light-weight and High Grip-force Tendon-driven Three-fingered Hand using Single Actuator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous research, various types of aerial robots equipped with perching mechanisms have been developed to extend operational time. However, most existing perching methods adopt either an upward or downward approach, making it difficult to perch near walls with surrounding obstacles. Additionally, perching hands are typically designed solely for attachment to objects and lack additional functionality, imposing a payload burden during flight. To address these issues, this paper proposes a lightweight robotic hand, the "Tri-force hand", capable of both perching and object grasping, as well as a new perching method called "Pendulum-perching". The Tri-force hand is a tendon-driven, three-fingered hand utilizing a spherical joint and a two-dimensional differential plate, enabling passive actuation with a single actuator. Each finger module, designed with controllable semi-tendon drive, can conform to arbitrary shapes within its operating range, allowing both perching and adaptive object grasping. By integrating this hand into a fully actuated aerial robot, the system can perform multi-directional approaches from the side and landing using gravity. This approach is similar to Crush-perching seen in researches with fixed-wing aerial robots, but it differs in its superior control over approach speed and direction, as well as its ability to achieve stable detachment and re-launch. In experiments, the fabricated Tri-force hand demonstrated the ability to withstand a total weight of up to 27.5 kg, grasp various objects ranging from simple to complex-shaped tools, and achieve a high success rate in both perching and takeoff.</description>

Abstract: Cybersecurity in robotics stands out as a key aspect within Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, also known as the Artificial Intelligence Act, which establishes specific guidelines for intelligent and automated systems. A fundamental distinction in this regulatory framework is the difference between robots with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and those that operate through automation systems without AI, since the former are subject to stricter security requirements due to their learning and autonomy capabilities. This work analyzes cybersecurity tools applicable to advanced robotic systems, with special emphasis on the protection of knowledge bases in cognitive architectures. Furthermore, a list of basic tools is proposed to guarantee the security, integrity, and resilience of these systems, and a practical case is presented, focused on the analysis of robot knowledge management, where ten evaluation criteria are defined to ensure compliance with the regulation and reduce risks in human-robot interaction (HRI) environments.</description>

      <title>GS-LTS: 3D Gaussian Splatting-Based Adaptive Modeling for Long-Term Service Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention in robotics for its explicit, high fidelity dense scene representation, demonstrating strong potential for robotic applications. However, 3DGS-based methods in robotics primarily focus on static scenes, with limited attention to the dynamic scene changes essential for long-term service robots. These robots demand sustained task execution and efficient scene updates-challenges current approaches fail to meet. To address these limitations, we propose GS-LTS (Gaussian Splatting for Long-Term Service), a 3DGS-based system enabling indoor robots to manage diverse tasks in dynamic environments over time. GS-LTS detects scene changes (e.g., object addition or removal) via single-image change detection, employs a rule-based policy to autonomously collect multi-view observations, and efficiently updates the scene representation through Gaussian editing. Additionally, we propose a simulation-based benchmark that automatically generates scene change data as compact configuration scripts, providing a standardized, user-friendly evaluation benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate GS-LTS's advantages in reconstruction, navigation, and superior scene updates-faster and higher quality than the image training baseline-advancing 3DGS for long-term robotic operations. Code and benchmark are available at: https://vipl-vsu.github.io/3DGS-LTS.</description>

      <title>Smart Ankleband for Plug-and-Play Hand-Prosthetic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building robotic prostheses requires the creation of a sensor-based interface designed to provide the robotic hand with the control required to perform hand gestures. Traditional Electromyography (EMG) based prosthetics and emerging alternatives often face limitations such as muscle-activation limitations, high cost, and complex-calibration procedures. In this paper, we present a low-cost robotic system composed of a smart ankleband for intuitive, calibration-free control of a robotic hand, and a robotic prosthetic hand that executes actions corresponding to leg gestures. The ankleband integrates an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor with a lightweight temporal neural network to infer user-intended leg gestures from motion data. Our system represents a significant step towards higher adoption rates of robotic prostheses among arm amputees, as it enables one to operate a prosthetic hand using a low-cost, low-power, and calibration-free solution. To evaluate our work, we collected data from 10 subjects and tested our prototype ankleband with a robotic hand on an individual with upper-limb amputations. Our results demonstrate that this system empowers users to perform daily tasks more efficiently, requiring few compensatory movements.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Navigation And Chemical Application in Precision Agriculture With Deep Reinforcement Learning And Conditional Action Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based planning scheme for optimized robotic management of biotic stresses in precision agriculture. The framework employs a hierarchical decision-making structure with conditional action masking, where high-level actions direct the robot's exploration, while low-level actions optimize its navigation and efficient chemical spraying in affected areas. The key objectives of optimization include improving the coverage of infected areas with limited battery power and reducing chemical usage, thus preventing unnecessary spraying of healthy areas of the field. Our numerical experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, Hierarchical Action Masking Proximal Policy Optimization (HAM-PPO), significantly outperforms baseline practices, such as LawnMower navigation + indiscriminate spraying (Carpet Spray), in terms of yield recovery and resource efficiency. HAM-PPO consistently achieves higher yield recovery percentages and lower chemical costs across a range of infection scenarios. The framework also exhibits robustness to observation noise and generalizability under diverse environmental conditions, adapting to varying infection ranges and spatial distribution patterns.</description>

      <title>Assist-as-needed Hip Exoskeleton Control for Gait Asymmetry Correction via Human-in-the-loop Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gait asymmetry is a significant clinical characteristic of hemiplegic gait that most stroke survivors suffer, leading to limited mobility and long-term negative impacts on their quality of life. Although a variety of exoskeleton controls have been developed for robot-assisted gait rehabilitation, little attention has been paid to correcting the gait asymmetry of stroke patients following the assist-as-need (AAN) principle, and it is still challenging to properly share control between the exoskeleton and stroke patients with partial motor control. In view of this, this article proposes an AAN hip exoskeleton control with human-in-the-loop optimization to correct gait asymmetry in stroke patients. To realize the AAN concept, an objective function was designed for real-time evaluation of the subject's gait performance and active participation, which considers the variability of natural human movement and guides the online tuning of control parameters on a subject-specific basis. In this way, patients were stimulated to contribute as much as possible to movement, thus maximizing the efficiency and outcomes of post-stroke gait rehabilitation. Finally, an experimental study was conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed AAN control on healthy subjects with artificial gait impairment. For the first time, the common hypothesis that AAN controls can improve human active participation was validated from the biomechanics viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Effects of Synthetic Data on End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving (AD) models require diverse, high-quality data to perform well across various driving scenarios. However, collecting large-scale real-world data is expensive and time-consuming, making high-fidelity synthetic data essential for enhancing data diversity and model robustness. Existing driving simulators for synthetic data generation have significant limitations: game-engine-based simulators struggle to produce realistic sensor data, while NeRF-based and diffusion-based methods face efficiency challenges. Additionally, recent simulators designed for closed-loop evaluation provide limited interaction with other vehicles, failing to simulate complex real-world traffic dynamics. To address these issues, we introduce SceneCrafter, a realistic, interactive, and efficient AD simulator based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). SceneCrafter not only efficiently generates realistic driving logs across diverse traffic scenarios but also enables robust closed-loop evaluation of end-to-end models. Experimental results demonstrate that SceneCrafter serves as both a reliable evaluation platform and a efficient data generator that significantly improves end-to-end model generalization.</description>

      <title>Extended Visibility of Autonomous Vehicles via Optimized Cooperative Perception under Imperfect Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) rely on individual perception systems to navigate safely. However, these systems face significant challenges in adverse weather conditions, complex road geometries, and dense traffic scenarios. Cooperative Perception (CP) has emerged as a promising approach to extending the perception quality of AVs by jointly processing shared camera feeds and sensor readings across multiple vehicles. This work presents a novel CP framework designed to optimize vehicle selection and networking resource utilization under imperfect communications. Our optimized CP formation considers critical factors such as the helper vehicles' spatial position, visual range, motion blur, and available communication budgets. Furthermore, our resource optimization module allocates communication channels while adjusting power levels to maximize data flow efficiency between the ego and helper vehicles, considering realistic models of modern vehicular communication systems, such as LTE and 5G NR-V2X. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on pedestrian detection in challenging scenarios, using synthetic data generated by the CARLA simulator. The results demonstrate that our method significantly improves upon the perception quality of individual AVs with about 10% gain in detection accuracy. This substantial gain uncovers the unleashed potential of CP to enhance AV safety and performance in complex situations.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Navigation of a Cable-Towed Load using Quadrupedal Robot Team via MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of enabling a team of quadrupedal robots to collaboratively tow a cable-connected load through cluttered and unstructured environments while avoiding obstacles. Leveraging cables allows the multi-robot system to navigate narrow spaces by maintaining slack when necessary. However, this introduces hybrid physical interactions due to alternating taut and slack states, with computational complexity that scales exponentially as the number of agents increases. To tackle these challenges, we developed a scalable and decentralized system capable of dynamically coordinating a variable number of quadrupedal robots while managing the hybrid physical interactions inherent in the load-towing task. At the core of this system is a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based planner, designed for decentralized coordination. The MARL-based planner is trained using a centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) framework, enabling each robot to make decisions autonomously using only local (ego) observations. To accelerate learning and ensure effective collaboration across varying team sizes, we introduce a tailored training curriculum for MARL. Experimental results highlight the flexibility and scalability of the framework, demonstrating successful deployment with one to four robots in real-world scenarios and up to twelve robots in simulation. The decentralized planner maintains consistent inference times, regardless of the team size. Additionally, the proposed system demonstrates robustness to environment perturbations and adaptability to varying load weights. This work represents a step forward in achieving flexible and efficient multi-legged robotic collaboration in complex and real-world environments.</description>

      <title>GI-SLAM: Gaussian-Inertial SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful representation of geometry and appearance for dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Through rapid, differentiable rasterization of 3D Gaussians, many 3DGS SLAM methods achieve near real-time rendering and accelerated training. However, these methods largely overlook inertial data, witch is a critical piece of information collected from the inertial measurement unit (IMU). In this paper, we present GI-SLAM, a novel gaussian-inertial SLAM system which consists of an IMU-enhanced camera tracking module and a realistic 3D Gaussian-based scene representation for mapping. Our method introduces an IMU loss that seamlessly integrates into the deep learning framework underpinning 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM, effectively enhancing the accuracy, robustness and efficiency of camera tracking. Moreover, our SLAM system supports a wide range of sensor configurations, including monocular, stereo, and RGBD cameras, both with and without IMU integration. Our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art real-time methods on the EuRoC and TUM-RGBD datasets.</description>

      <title>Learning Orientation Field for OSM-Guided Autonomous Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OpenStreetMap (OSM) has gained popularity recently in autonomous navigation due to its public accessibility, lower maintenance costs, and broader geographical coverage. However, existing methods often struggle with noisy OSM data and incomplete sensor observations, leading to inaccuracies in trajectory planning. These challenges are particularly evident in complex driving scenarios, such as at intersections or facing occlusions. To address these challenges, we propose a robust and explainable two-stage framework to learn an Orientation Field (OrField) for robot navigation by integrating LiDAR scans and OSM routes. In the first stage, we introduce the novel representation, OrField, which can provide orientations for each grid on the map, reasoning jointly from noisy LiDAR scans and OSM routes. To generate a robust OrField, we train a deep neural network by encoding a versatile initial OrField and output an optimized OrField. Based on OrField, we propose two trajectory planners for OSM-guided robot navigation, called Field-RRT* and Field-Bezier, respectively, in the second stage by improving the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm and Bezier curve to estimate the trajectories. Thanks to the robustness of OrField which captures both global and local information, Field-RRT* and Field-Bezier can generate accurate and reliable trajectories even in challenging conditions. We validate our approach through experiments on the SemanticKITTI dataset and our own campus dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving superior performance in complex and noisy conditions. Our code for network training and real-world deployment is available at https://github.com/IMRL/OriField.</description>

      <title>Ground Penetrating Radar-Assisted Multimodal Robot Odometry Using Subsurface Feature Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization of robots using subsurface features observed by ground-penetrating radar (GPR) enhances and adds robustness to common sensor modalities, as subsurface features are less affected by weather, seasons, and surface changes. We introduce an innovative multimodal odometry approach using inputs from GPR, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and a wheel encoder. To efficiently address GPR signal noise, we introduce an advanced feature representation called the subsurface feature matrix (SFM). The SFM leverages frequency domain data and identifies peaks within radar scans. Additionally, we propose a novel feature matching method that estimates GPR displacement by aligning SFMs. The integrations from these three input sources are consolidated using a factor graph approach to achieve multimodal robot odometry. Our method has been developed and evaluated with the CMU-GPR public dataset, demonstrating improvements in accuracy and robustness with real-time performance in robotic odometry tasks.</description>

      <title>NMPC-based Unified Posture Manipulation and Thrust Vectoring for Fault Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-rotors face significant risks, as actuator failures at high altitudes can easily result in a crash and the robot's destruction. Therefore, rapid fault recovery in the event of an actuator failure is necessary for the fault-tolerant and safe operation of unmanned aerial robots. In this work, we present a fault recovery approach based on the unification of posture manipulation and thrust vectoring. The key contributions of this work are: 1) Derivation of two flight dynamics models (high-fidelity and reduced-order) that capture posture control and thrust vectoring. 2) Design of a controller based on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) and demonstration of fault recovery in simulation using a high-fidelity model of the Multi-Modal Mobility Morphobot (M4) in Simscape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic parameter tuning methods for planning algorithms, which integrate pipeline approaches with learning-based techniques, are regarded as promising due to their stability and capability to handle highly constrained environments. While existing parameter tuning methods have demonstrated considerable success, further performance improvements require a more structured approach. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical architecture for reinforcement learning-based parameter tuning. The architecture introduces a hierarchical structure with low-frequency parameter tuning, mid-frequency planning, and high-frequency control, enabling concurrent enhancement of both upper-layer parameter tuning and lower-layer control through iterative training. Experimental evaluations in both simulated and real-world environments show that our method surpasses existing parameter tuning approaches. Furthermore, our approach achieves first place in the Benchmark for Autonomous Robot Navigation (BARN) Challenge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is applied research for the development of the Automated Stretch Elastic Waistband Sewing Machine represents a significant advancement in garment manufacturing, addressing the industry's need for increased efficiency, precision, and adaptability. This machine integrates innovative features such as a sensor-based automatic waistband expansion system, synchronized sewing speed and rolling wheel speed, and a differential feed top-loading mechanism. These enhancements streamline the sewing process, reduce manual intervention, and ensure consistent product quality. The machine's design incorporates both 3-wheel and 2-wheel rolling systems, each optimized for different elastic band dimensions and elongation factors. The 3-wheel rolling system accommodates a larger maximum boundary, while the 2-wheel rolling system offers a tighter operational range, providing flexibility to meet diverse manufacturing requirements. The Automated Stretch Elastic Waistband Sewing Machine has a design that controls the pulling apart force so as not to break the elastic waistband. It sets a new standard for quality and innovation, empowering manufacturers to meet the demands of a competitive market with precision and ease.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Forces Exerted by Shoulder and Elbow Fabric-based Pneumatic Actuators for Pediatric Exosuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance pediatric exosuit design, it is crucial to assess the actuator-generated forces. This work evaluates the contact forces exerted by soft fabric-based pneumatic actuators in an upper extremity pediatric exosuit. Two actuators were examined: a single-cell bidirectional actuator for shoulder abduction/adduction and a bellow-type actuator for elbow extension/flexion. Experiments assessed the impact of actuator anchoring points and the adjacent joint's angle on exerted forces and actuated joint range of motion (ROM). These were measured via load cells and encoders integrated into a custom infant-scale engineered apparatus with two degrees of freedom (two revolute joints). For the shoulder actuator, results show that anchoring it further from the shoulder joint center while the elbow is flexed at $90^\circ$ yields the highest ROM while minimizing the peak force exerted on the body. For the elbow actuator, anchoring it symmetrically while the shoulder joint is at $0^\circ$ optimizes actuator performance. These findings contribute a key step toward co-optimizing the considered exosuit design for functionality and wearability.</description>

      <title>P3Nav: A Unified Framework for Embodied Navigation Integrating Perception, Planning, and Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In language-guided visual navigation, agents locate target objects in unseen environments using natural language instructions. For reliable navigation in unfamiliar scenes, agents must possess strong perception, planning, and prediction capabilities. Additionally, when agents revisit previously explored areas during long-term navigation, they may retain irrelevant and redundant historical perceptions, leading to suboptimal results. In this work, we introduce \textbf{P3Nav}, a unified framework that integrates \textbf{P}erception, \textbf{P}lanning, and \textbf{P}rediction capabilities through \textbf{Multitask Collaboration} on navigation and embodied question answering (EQA) tasks, thereby enhancing navigation performance. Furthermore, P3Nav employs an \textbf{Adaptive 3D-aware History Sampling} strategy to effectively and efficiently utilize historical observations. By leveraging the large language models (LLM), P3Nav comprehends diverse commands and complex visual scenes, resulting in appropriate navigation actions. P3Nav achieves a 75\% success rate in object goal navigation on the $\mathrm{CHORES}$-$\mathbb{S}$ benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing robotic agents that can perform well in diverse environments while showing a variety of behaviors is a key challenge in AI and robotics. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods often create agents that specialize in narrow tasks, limiting their adaptability and diversity. To overcome this, we propose a preliminary, evolution-inspired framework that includes a reproduction module, similar to natural species reproduction, balancing diversity and specialization. By integrating RL, imitation learning (IL), and a coevolutionary agent-terrain curriculum, our system evolves agents continuously through complex tasks. This approach promotes adaptability, inheritance of useful traits, and continual learning. Agents not only refine inherited skills but also surpass their predecessors. Our initial experiments show that this method improves exploration efficiency and supports open-ended learning, offering a scalable solution where sparse reward coupled with diverse terrain environments induces a multi-task setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we address the problem of deploying a team of robots in a scenario where some locations of interest must be reached. Thus, a planning for a deployment is required, before sending the robots. The obstacles, the limited communication range, and the need of communicating to a base station, constrain the connectivity of the team and the deployment planning. We propose a method consisting of three algorithms: a distributed path planner to obtain communication-aware trajectories; a deployment planner providing dual-use of the robots, visiting primary goals and performing connectivity tasks; and a clustering algorithm to allocate the tasks to robots, and obtain the best goal visit order for the mission.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent coordination for data gathering with periodic requests and deliveries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this demo work we develop a method to plan and coordinate a multi-agent team to gather information on demand. The data is periodically requested by a static Operation Center (OC) from changeable goals locations. The mission of the team is to reach these locations, taking measurements and delivering the data to the OC. Due to the limited communication range as well as signal attenuation because of the obstacles, the agents must travel to the OC, to upload the data. The agents can play two roles: ones as workers gathering data, the others as collectors traveling invariant paths for collecting the data of the workers to re-transmit it to the OC. The refreshing time of the delivered information depends on the number of available agents as well as of the scenario. The proposed algorithm finds out the best balance between the number of collectors-workers and the partition of the scenario into working areas in the planning phase, which provides the minimum refreshing time and will be the one executed by the agents.</description>

      <title>FF-SRL: High Performance GPU-Based Surgical Simulation For Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic surgery is a rapidly developing field that can greatly benefit from the automation of surgical tasks. However, training techniques such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) require a high number of task repetitions, which are generally unsafe and impractical to perform on real surgical systems. This stresses the need for simulated surgical environments, which are not only realistic, but also computationally efficient and scalable. We introduce FF-SRL (Fast and Flexible Surgical Reinforcement Learning), a high-performance learning environment for robotic surgery. In FF-SRL both physics simulation and RL policy training reside entirely on a single GPU. This avoids typical bottlenecks associated with data transfer between the CPU and GPU, leading to accelerated learning rates. Our results show that FF-SRL reduces the training time of a complex tissue manipulation task by an order of magnitude, down to a couple of minutes, compared to a common CPU/GPU simulator. Such speed-up may facilitate the experimentation with RL techniques and contribute to the development of new generation of surgical systems. To this end, we make our code publicly available to the community.</description>

      <title>Efficient Continual Adaptation of Pretrained Robotic Policy with Online Meta-Learned Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual adaptation is essential for general autonomous agents. For example, a household robot pretrained with a repertoire of skills must still adapt to unseen tasks specific to each household. Motivated by this, building upon parameter-efficient fine-tuning in language models, prior works have explored lightweight adapters to adapt pretrained policies, which can preserve learned features from the pretraining phase and demonstrate good adaptation performances. However, these approaches treat task learning separately, limiting knowledge transfer between tasks. In this paper, we propose Online Meta-Learned adapters (OMLA). Instead of applying adapters directly, OMLA can facilitate knowledge transfer from previously learned tasks to current learning tasks through a novel meta-learning objective. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that OMLA can lead to better adaptation performances compared to the baseline methods.

      <title>RoboEngine: Plug-and-Play Robot Data Augmentation with Semantic Robot Segmentation and Background Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual augmentation has become a crucial technique for enhancing the visual robustness of imitation learning. However, existing methods are often limited by prerequisites such as camera calibration or the need for controlled environments (e.g., green screen setups). In this work, we introduce RoboEngine, the first plug-and-play visual robot data augmentation toolkit. For the first time, users can effortlessly generate physics- and task-aware robot scenes with just a few lines of code. To achieve this, we present a novel robot scene segmentation dataset, a generalizable high-quality robot segmentation model, and a fine-tuned background generation model, which together form the core components of the out-of-the-box toolkit. Using RoboEngine, we demonstrate the ability to generalize robot manipulation tasks across six entirely new scenes, based solely on demonstrations collected from a single scene, achieving a more than 200% performance improvement compared to the no-augmentation baseline. All datasets, model weights, and the toolkit will be publicly released.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-Robot Coordination through Locality-Based Factorized Multi-Agent Actor-Critic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning method called \textbf{Loc}ality based \textbf{Fac}torized \textbf{M}ulti-Agent \textbf{A}ctor-\textbf{C}ritic (Loc-FACMAC). Existing state-of-the-art algorithms, such as FACMAC, rely on global reward information, which may not accurately reflect the quality of individual robots' actions in decentralized systems. We integrate the concept of locality into critic learning, where strongly related robots form partitions during training. Robots within the same partition have a greater impact on each other, leading to more precise policy evaluation. Additionally, we construct a dependency graph to capture the relationships between robots, facilitating the partitioning process. This approach mitigates the curse of dimensionality and prevents robots from using irrelevant information. Our method improves existing algorithms by focusing on local rewards and leveraging partition-based learning to enhance training efficiency and performance. We evaluate the performance of Loc-FACMAC in three environments: Hallway, Multi-cartpole, and Bounded-Cooperative-Navigation. We explore the impact of partition sizes on the performance and compare the result with baseline MARL algorithms such as LOMAQ, FACMAC, and QMIX. The experiments reveal that, if the locality structure is defined properly, Loc-FACMAC outperforms these baseline algorithms up to 108\%, indicating that exploiting the locality structure in the actor-critic framework improves the MARL performance.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Generation of Sub-goals for Lifelong Learning in Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the challenges of open-ended learning in robots is the need to autonomously discover goals and learn skills to achieve them. However, when in lifelong learning settings, it is always desirable to generate sub-goals with their associated skills, without relying on explicit reward, as steppingstones to a goal. This allows sub-goals and skills to be reused to facilitate achieving other goals. This work proposes a two-pronged approach for sub-goal generation to address this challenge: a top-down approach, where sub-goals are hierarchically derived from general goals using intrinsic motivations to discover them, and a bottom-up approach, where sub-goal chains emerge from making latent relationships between goals and perceptual classes that were previously learned in different domains explicit. These methods help the robot to autonomously generate and chain sub-goals as a way to achieve more general goals. Additionally, they create more abstract representations of goals, helping to reduce sub-goal duplication and make the learning of skills more efficient. Implemented within an existing cognitive architecture for lifelong open-ended learning and tested with a real robot, our approach enhances the robot's ability to discover and achieve goals, generate sub-goals in an efficient manner, generalize learned skills, and operate in dynamic and unknown environments without explicit intermediate rewards.</description>

      <title>CP-NCBF: A Conformal Prediction-based Approach to Synthesize Verified Neural Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are a practical approach for designing safety-critical controllers, but constructing them for arbitrary nonlinear dynamical systems remains a challenge. Recent efforts have explored learning-based methods, such as neural CBFs (NCBFs), to address this issue. However, ensuring the validity of NCBFs is difficult due to potential learning errors. In this letter, we propose a novel framework that leverages split-conformal prediction to generate formally verified neural CBFs with probabilistic guarantees based on a user-defined error rate, referred to as CP-NCBF. Unlike existing methods that impose Lipschitz constraints on neural CBF-leading to scalability limitations and overly conservative safe sets--our approach is sample-efficient, scalable, and results in less restrictive safety regions. We validate our framework through case studies on obstacle avoidance in autonomous driving and geo-fencing of aerial vehicles, demonstrating its ability to generate larger and less conservative safe sets compared to conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>Reachable Sets-based Trajectory Planning Combining Reinforcement Learning and iLQR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The driving risk field is applicable to more complex driving scenarios, providing new approaches for safety decision-making and active vehicle control in intricate environments. However, existing research often overlooks the driving risk field and fails to consider the impact of risk distribution within drivable areas on trajectory planning, which poses challenges for enhancing safety. This paper proposes a trajectory planning method for intelligent vehicles based on the risk reachable set to further improve the safety of trajectory planning. First, we construct the reachable set incorporating the driving risk field to more accurately assess and avoid potential risks in drivable areas. Then, the initial trajectory is generated based on safe reinforcement learning and projected onto the reachable set. Finally, we introduce a trajectory planning method based on a constrained iterative quadratic regulator to optimize the initial solution, ensuring that the planned trajectory achieves optimal comfort, safety, and efficiency. We conduct simulation tests of trajectory planning in high-speed lane-changing scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed method can guarantee trajectory comfort and driving efficiency, with the generated trajectory situated outside high-risk boundaries, thereby ensuring vehicle safety during operation.</description>

      <title>IRef-VLA: A Benchmark for Interactive Referential Grounding with Imperfect Language in 3D Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent rise of large language models, vision-language models, and other general foundation models, there is growing potential for multimodal, multi-task robotics that can operate in diverse environments given natural language input. One such application is indoor navigation using natural language instructions. However, despite recent progress, this problem remains challenging due to the 3D spatial reasoning and semantic understanding required. Additionally, the language used may be imperfect or misaligned with the scene, further complicating the task. To address this challenge, we curate a benchmark dataset, IRef-VLA, for Interactive Referential Vision and Language-guided Action in 3D Scenes with imperfect references. IRef-VLA is the largest real-world dataset for the referential grounding task, consisting of over 11.5K scanned 3D rooms from existing datasets, 7.6M heuristically generated semantic relations, and 4.7M referential statements. Our dataset also contains semantic object and room annotations, scene graphs, navigable free space annotations, and is augmented with statements where the language has imperfections or ambiguities. We verify the generalizability of our dataset by evaluating with state-of-the-art models to obtain a performance baseline and also develop a graph-search baseline to demonstrate the performance bound and generation of alternatives using scene-graph knowledge. With this benchmark, we aim to provide a resource for 3D scene understanding that aids the development of robust, interactive navigation systems. The dataset and all source code is publicly released at https://github.com/HaochenZ11/IRef-VLA.</description>

      <title>Likelihood Reward Redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many practical reinforcement learning scenarios, feedback is provided only at the end of a long horizon, leading to sparse and delayed rewards. Existing reward redistribution methods typically assume that per-step rewards are independent, thus overlooking interdependencies among state--action pairs. In this paper, we propose a \emph{Likelihood Reward Redistribution} (LRR) framework that addresses this issue by modeling each per-step reward with a parametric probability distribution whose parameters depend on the state--action pair. By maximizing the likelihood of the observed episodic return via a leave-one-out (LOO) strategy that leverages the entire trajectory, our framework inherently introduces an uncertainty regularization term into the surrogate objective. Moreover, we show that the conventional mean squared error (MSE) loss for reward redistribution emerges as a special case of our likelihood framework when the uncertainty is fixed under the Gaussian distribution. When integrated with an off-policy algorithm such as Soft Actor-Critic, LRR yields dense and informative reward signals, resulting in superior sample efficiency and policy performance on Box-2d and MuJoCo benchmarks.</description>

      <title>TamedPUMA: safe and stable imitation learning with geometric fabrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the language of dynamical systems, Imitation learning (IL) provides an intuitive and effective way of teaching stable task-space motions to robots with goal convergence. Yet, IL techniques are affected by serious limitations when it comes to ensuring safety and fulfillment of physical constraints. With this work, we solve this challenge via TamedPUMA, an IL algorithm augmented with a recent development in motion generation called geometric fabrics. As both the IL policy and geometric fabrics describe motions as artificial second-order dynamical systems, we propose two variations where IL provides a navigation policy for geometric fabrics. The result is a stable imitation learning strategy within which we can seamlessly blend geometrical constraints like collision avoidance and joint limits. Beyond providing a theoretical analysis, we demonstrate TamedPUMA with simulated and real-world tasks, including a 7-DoF manipulator.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Koopman Model Predictive Control of Simple Serial Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximating nonlinear systems as linear ones is a common workaround to apply control tools tailored for linear systems. This motivates our present work where we developed a data-driven model predictive controller (MPC) based on the Koopman operator framework, allowing the embedding of nonlinear dynamics in a higher dimensional, but linear function space. The controller, termed adaptive Koopman model predictive control (KMPC), uses online closed-loop feedback to learn and incrementally update a linear representation of nonlinear system dynamics, without the prior knowledge of a model. Adaptive KMPC differs from most other Koopman-based control frameworks that aim to identify high-validity-range models in advance and then enter closed-loop control without further model adaptations. To validate the controller, trajectory tracking experiments are conducted with 1R and 2R robots under force disturbances and changing model parameters. We compare the controller to classical linearization MPC and Koopman-based MPC without model updates, denoted static KMPC. The results show that adaptive KMPC can, opposed to static KMPC, generalize over unforeseen force disturbances and can, opposed to linearization MPC, handle varying dynamic parameters, while using a small set of basis functions to approximate the Koopman operator.</description>

      <title>PhysTwin: Physics-Informed Reconstruction and Simulation of Deformable Objects from Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating a physical digital twin of a real-world object has immense potential in robotics, content creation, and XR. In this paper, we present PhysTwin, a novel framework that uses sparse videos of dynamic objects under interaction to produce a photo- and physically realistic, real-time interactive virtual replica. Our approach centers on two key components: (1) a physics-informed representation that combines spring-mass models for realistic physical simulation, generative shape models for geometry, and Gaussian splats for rendering; and (2) a novel multi-stage, optimization-based inverse modeling framework that reconstructs complete geometry, infers dense physical properties, and replicates realistic appearance from videos. Our method integrates an inverse physics framework with visual perception cues, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction even from partial, occluded, and limited viewpoints. PhysTwin supports modeling various deformable objects, including ropes, stuffed animals, cloth, and delivery packages. Experiments show that PhysTwin outperforms competing methods in reconstruction, rendering, future prediction, and simulation under novel interactions. We further demonstrate its applications in interactive real-time simulation and model-based robotic motion planning.</description>

      <title>Unseen from Seen: Rewriting Observation-Instruction Using Foundation Models for Augmenting Vision-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data scarcity is a long-standing challenge in the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) field, which extremely hinders the generalization of agents to unseen environments. Previous works primarily rely on additional simulator data or web-collected images/videos to improve the generalization. However, the simulator environments still face limited diversity, and the web-collected data often requires extensive labor to remove the noise. In this paper, we propose a Rewriting-driven AugMentation (RAM) paradigm for VLN, which directly creates the unseen observation-instruction pairs via rewriting human-annotated training data. Benefiting from our rewriting mechanism, new observation-instruction can be obtained in both simulator-free and labor-saving manners to promote generalization. Specifically, we first introduce Object-Enriched Observation Rewriting, where we combine Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive rewritten object-enriched scene descriptions, enabling observation synthesis with diverse objects and spatial layouts via Text-to-Image Generation Models (T2IMs). Then, we propose Observation-Contrast Instruction Rewriting, which generates observation-aligned rewritten instructions by requiring LLMs to reason the difference between original and new observations. We further develop a mixing-then-focusing training strategy with a random observation cropping scheme, effectively enhancing data distribution diversity while suppressing augmentation data noise during training. Experiments on both the discrete environments (R2R, REVERIE, and R4R datasets) and continuous environments (R2R-CE dataset) show the superior performance and impressive generalization ability of our method.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary panoptic reconstruction is a challenging task for simultaneous scene reconstruction and understanding. Recently, methods have been proposed for 3D scene understanding based on Gaussian splatting. However, these methods are multi-staged, suffering from the accumulated errors and the dependence of hand-designed components. To streamline the pipeline and achieve global optimization, we propose PanopticSplatting, an end-to-end system for open-vocabulary panoptic reconstruction. Our method introduces query-guided Gaussian segmentation with local cross attention, lifting 2D instance masks without cross-frame association in an end-to-end way. The local cross attention within view frustum effectively reduces the training memory, making our model more accessible to large scenes with more Gaussians and objects. In addition, to address the challenge of noisy labels in 2D pseudo masks, we propose label blending to promote consistent 3D segmentation with less noisy floaters, as well as label warping on 2D predictions which enhances multi-view coherence and segmentation accuracy. Our method demonstrates strong performances in 3D scene panoptic reconstruction on the ScanNet-V2 and ScanNet++ datasets, compared with both NeRF-based and Gaussian-based panoptic reconstruction methods. Moreover, PanopticSplatting can be easily generalized to numerous variants of Gaussian splatting, and we demonstrate its robustness on different Gaussian base models.</description>

      <title>Joint State-Parameter Observer-Based Robust Control of a UAV for Heavy Load Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a joint state-parameter observer-based controller for trajectory tracking of an octocopter unmanned aerial vehicle (OUAV), for transportation of a heavy load with unknown mass and size. The multi-body dynamic model of the OUAV with a rigidly attached load is obtained, effectively considering the effects of the load parameters into the dynamics of the system. A robust nonlinear W-infinity control strategy is designed for optimal trajectory tracking of the OUAV, with information of the states and load parameters provided by a joint estimation unscented Kalman filter. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is corroborated by numerical results.</description>

      <title>A Robot-Led Intervention for Emotion Regulation: From Expression to Reappraisal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion regulation is a crucial skill for managing emotions in everyday life, yet finding a constructive and accessible method to support these processes remains challenging due to their cognitive demands. In this study, we explore how regular interactions with a social robot, conducted in a structured yet familiar environment within university halls and departments, can provide effective support for emotion regulation through cognitive reappraisal. Twenty-one students participated in a five-session study at a university hall or department, where the robot facilitated structured conversations, encouraging the students to reinterpret emotionally charged situations that they shared with the robot. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate significant improvements in emotion self-regulation, with participants reporting better understanding and control of their emotions. The intervention led to significant changes in constructive emotion regulation tendencies and positive effects on mood and sentiment after each session. The findings also demonstrate that repeated interactions with the robot encouraged greater emotional expressiveness, including longer speech disclosures, increased use of affective language, and heightened facial arousal. Notably, expressiveness followed structured patterns aligned with the reappraisal process, with expression peaking during key reappraisal moments, particularly when participants were prompted to reinterpret negative experiences. The qualitative feedback further highlighted how the robot fostered introspection and provided a supportive space for discussing emotions, enabling participants to confront long-avoided emotional challenges. These findings demonstrate the potential of robots to effectively assist in emotion regulation in familiar environments, offering both emotional support and cognitive guidance.</description>

      <title>Latent Embedding Adaptation for Human Preference Alignment in Diffusion Planners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of personalizing trajectories generated in automated decision-making systems by introducing a resource-efficient approach that enables rapid adaptation to individual users' preferences. Our method leverages a pretrained conditional diffusion model with Preference Latent Embeddings (PLE), trained on a large, reward-free offline dataset. The PLE serves as a compact representation for capturing specific user preferences. By adapting the pretrained model using our proposed preference inversion method, which directly optimizes the learnable PLE, we achieve superior alignment with human preferences compared to existing solutions like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). To better reflect practical applications, we create a benchmark experiment using real human preferences on diverse, high-reward trajectories.</description>

      <title>Any6D: Model-free 6D Pose Estimation of Novel Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18673v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Any6D, a model-free framework for 6D object pose estimation that requires only a single RGB-D anchor image to estimate both the 6D pose and size of unknown objects in novel scenes. Unlike existing methods that rely on textured 3D models or multiple viewpoints, Any6D leverages a joint object alignment process to enhance 2D-3D alignment and metric scale estimation for improved pose accuracy. Our approach integrates a render-and-compare strategy to generate and refine pose hypotheses, enabling robust performance in scenarios with occlusions, non-overlapping views, diverse lighting conditions, and large cross-environment variations. We evaluate our method on five challenging datasets: REAL275, Toyota-Light, HO3D, YCBINEOAT, and LM-O, demonstrating its effectiveness in significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods for novel object pose estimation.

      <title>Robust Tube-based Control Strategy for Vision-guided Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A robust control strategy for autonomous vehicles can improve system stability, enhance riding comfort, and prevent driving accidents. This paper presents a novel interpolation tube-based constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator (itube-CILQR) algorithm for autonomous computer-vision-based vehicle lane-keeping. The goal of the algorithm is to enhance robustness during high-speed cornering on tight turns. The advantages of itube-CILQR over the standard tube-approach include reduced system conservatism and increased computational speed. Numerical and vision-based experiments were conducted to examine the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. The proposed itube-CILQR algorithm is better suited to vehicle lane-keeping than variational CILQR-based methods and model predictive control (MPC) approaches using a classical interior-point solver. Specifically, in evaluation experiments, itube-CILQR achieved an average runtime of 3.16 ms to generate a control signal to guide a self-driving vehicle; itube-MPC typically required a 4.67-times longer computation time to complete the same task. Moreover, the influence of conservatism on system behavior was investigated by exploring the interpolation variable trajectories derived from the proposed itube-CILQR algorithm during lane-keeping maneuvers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents AlphaSpace, a novel methodology designed to enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for 3D Cartesian space navigation. AlphaSpace employs a semantics-based tokenization strategy, encoding height information through specialized semantic tokens, and integrates primarily symbolic synthetic reasoning data. This approach enables LLMs to accurately manipulate objects by positioning them at specific [x, y, z] coordinates. Experimental results demonstrate that AlphaSpace significantly outperforms existing models on manipulation subtasks, achieving a total accuracy of 66.67%, compared to 37.5% for GPT-4o and 29.17% for Claude 3.5 Sonnet.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapped Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) has been demonstrated to be effective in continuous control tasks. When a world model and a value function are available, planning a sequence of actions ahead of time leads to a better policy. Existing methods typically obtain the value function and the corresponding policy in a model-free manner. However, we find that such an approach struggles with complex tasks, resulting in poor policy learning and inaccurate value estimation. To address this problem, we leverage the strengths of MPC itself. In this work, we introduce Bootstrapped Model Predictive Control (BMPC), a novel algorithm that performs policy learning in a bootstrapped manner. BMPC learns a network policy by imitating an MPC expert, and in turn, uses this policy to guide the MPC process. Combined with model-based TD-learning, our policy learning yields better value estimation and further boosts the efficiency of MPC. We also introduce a lazy reanalyze mechanism, which enables computationally efficient imitation learning. Our method achieves superior performance over prior works on diverse continuous control tasks. In particular, on challenging high-dimensional locomotion tasks, BMPC significantly improves data efficiency while also enhancing asymptotic performance and training stability, with comparable training time and smaller network sizes.

      <title>Online 3D Scene Reconstruction Using Neural Object Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing a scene online at the level of objects given an RGB-D video sequence. While current object-aware neural implicit representations hold promise, they are limited in online reconstruction efficiency and shape completion. Our main contributions to alleviate the above limitations are twofold. First, we propose a feature grid interpolation mechanism to continuously update grid-based object-centric neural implicit representations as new object parts are revealed. Second, we construct an object library with previously mapped objects in advance and leverage the corresponding shape priors to initialize geometric object models in new videos, subsequently completing them with novel views as well as synthesized past views to avoid losing original object details. Extensive experiments on synthetic environments from the Replica dataset, real-world ScanNet sequences and videos captured in our laboratory demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art neural implicit models for this task in terms of reconstruction accuracy and completeness.</description>

      <title>AdaWorld: Learning Adaptable World Models with Latent Actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: World models aim to learn action-controlled prediction models and have proven essential for the development of intelligent agents. However, most existing world models rely heavily on substantial action-labeled data and costly training, making it challenging to adapt to novel environments with heterogeneous actions through limited interactions. This limitation can hinder their applicability across broader domains. To overcome this challenge, we propose AdaWorld, an innovative world model learning approach that enables efficient adaptation. The key idea is to incorporate action information during the pretraining of world models. This is achieved by extracting latent actions from videos in a self-supervised manner, capturing the most critical transitions between frames. We then develop an autoregressive world model that conditions on these latent actions. This learning paradigm enables highly adaptable world models, facilitating efficient transfer and learning of new actions even with limited interactions and finetuning. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple environments demonstrate that AdaWorld achieves superior performance in both simulation quality and visual planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18945v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of geometric reconstruction and generative modeling remains a critical challenge in developing AI systems capable of human-like spatial reasoning. This paper proposes Aether, a unified framework that enables geometry-aware reasoning in world models by jointly optimizing three core capabilities: (1) 4D dynamic reconstruction, (2) action-conditioned video prediction, and (3) goal-conditioned visual planning. Through task-interleaved feature learning, Aether achieves synergistic knowledge sharing across reconstruction, prediction, and planning objectives. Building upon video generation models, our framework demonstrates unprecedented synthetic-to-real generalization despite never observing real-world data during training. Furthermore, our approach achieves zero-shot generalization in both action following and reconstruction tasks, thanks to its intrinsic geometric modeling. Remarkably, even without real-world data, its reconstruction performance is comparable with or even better than that of domain-specific models. Additionally, Aether employs camera trajectories as geometry-informed action spaces, enabling effective action-conditioned prediction and visual planning. We hope our work inspires the community to explore new frontiers in physically-reasonable world modeling and its applications.</description>

      <title>Improving robot navigation in crowded environments using intrinsic rewards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation in crowded environments is an open problem with many applications, essential for the coexistence of robots and humans in the smart cities of the future. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning approaches have proven to outperform model-based algorithms. Nevertheless, even though the results provided are promising, the works are not able to take advantage of the capabilities that their models offer. They usually get trapped in local optima in the training process, that prevent them from learning the optimal policy. They are not able to visit and interact with every possible state appropriately, such as with the states near the goal or near the dynamic obstacles. In this work, we propose using intrinsic rewards to balance between exploration and exploitation and explore depending on the uncertainty of the states instead of on the time the agent has been trained, encouraging the agent to get more curious about unknown states. We explain the benefits of the approach and compare it with other exploration algorithms that may be used for crowd navigation. Many simulation experiments are performed modifying several algorithms of the state-of-the-art, showing that the use of intrinsic rewards makes the robot learn faster and reach higher rewards and success rates (fewer collisions) in shorter navigation times, outperforming the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of game-theoretic robot allocation where two players strategically allocate robots to compete for multiple sites of interest. Robots possess offensive or defensive capabilities to interfere and weaken their opponents to take over a competing site. This problem belongs to the conventional Colonel Blotto Game. Considering the robots' heterogeneous capabilities and environmental factors, we generalize the conventional Blotto game by incorporating heterogeneous robot types and graph constraints that capture the robot transitions between sites. Then we employ the Double Oracle Algorithm (DOA) to solve for the Nash equilibrium of the generalized Blotto game. Particularly, for cyclic-dominance-heterogeneous (CDH) robots that inhibit each other, we define a new transformation rule between any two robot types. Building on the transformation, we design a novel utility function to measure the game's outcome quantitatively. Moreover, we rigorously prove the correctness of the designed utility function. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of DOA on computing Nash equilibrium for homogeneous, linear heterogeneous, and CDH robot allocation on graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The networked nature of multi-robot systems presents challenges in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Centralized control policies do not scale with increasing numbers of robots, whereas independent control policies do not exploit the information provided by other robots, exhibiting poor performance in cooperative-competitive tasks. In this work we propose a physics-informed reinforcement learning approach able to learn distributed multi-robot control policies that are both scalable and make use of all the available information to each robot. Our approach has three key characteristics. First, it imposes a port-Hamiltonian structure on the policy representation, respecting energy conservation properties of physical robot systems and the networked nature of robot team interactions. Second, it uses self-attention to ensure a sparse policy representation able to handle time-varying information at each robot from the interaction graph. Third, we present a soft actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm parameterized by our self-attention port-Hamiltonian control policy, which accounts for the correlation among robots during training while overcoming the need of value function factorization. Extensive simulations in different multi-robot scenarios demonstrate the success of the proposed approach, surpassing previous multi-robot reinforcement learning solutions in scalability, while achieving similar or superior performance (with averaged cumulative reward up to x2 greater than the state-of-the-art with robot teams x6 larger than the number of robots at training time). We also validate our approach on multiple real robots in the Georgia Tech Robotarium under imperfect communication, demonstrating zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and scalability across number of robots.</description>

      <title>Towards Safe Mid-Air Drone Interception: Strategies for Tracking &amp; Capture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A unique approach for the mid-air autonomous aerial interception of non-cooperating UAV by a flying robot equipped with a net is presented in this paper. A novel interception guidance method dubbed EPN is proposed, designed to catch agile maneuvering targets while relying on onboard state estimation and tracking. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art approaches in simulations using 100 different trajectories of the target with varying complexity comprising almost 14 hours of flight data, and EPN demonstrates the shortest response time and the highest number of interceptions, which are key parameters of agile interception. To enable robust transfer from theory and simulation to a real-world implementation, we aim to avoid overfitting to specific assumptions about the target, and to tackle interception of a target following an unknown general trajectory. Furthermore, we identify several often overlooked problems related to tracking and estimation of the target's state that can have a significant influence on the overall performance of the system. We propose the use of a novel state estimation filter based on the IMM filter and a new measurement model. Simulated experiments show that the proposed solution provides significant improvements in estimation accuracy over the commonly employed KF approaches when considering general trajectories. Based on these results, we employ the proposed filtering and guidance methods to implement a complete autonomous interception system, which is thoroughly evaluated in realistic simulations and tested in real-world experiments with a maneuvering target going far beyond the performance of any state-of-the-art solution.</description>

      <title>3D-MVP: 3D Multiview Pretraining for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works have shown that visual pretraining on egocentric datasets using masked autoencoders (MAE) can improve generalization for downstream robotics tasks. However, these approaches pretrain only on 2D images, while many robotics applications require 3D scene understanding. In this work, we propose 3D-MVP, a novel approach for 3D Multi-View Pretraining using masked autoencoders. We leverage Robotic View Transformer (RVT), which uses a multi-view transformer to understand the 3D scene and predict gripper pose actions. We split RVT's multi-view transformer into visual encoder and action decoder, and pretrain its visual encoder using masked autoencoding on large-scale 3D datasets such as Objaverse. We evaluate 3D-MVP on a suite of virtual robot manipulation tasks and demonstrate improved performance over baselines. Our results suggest that 3D-aware pretraining is a promising approach to improve generalization of vision-based robotic manipulation policies.

      <title>AVOCADO: Adaptive Optimal Collision Avoidance driven by Opinion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present AVOCADO (AdaptiVe Optimal Collision Avoidance Driven by Opinion), a novel navigation approach to address holonomic robot collision avoidance when the robot does not know how cooperative the other agents in the environment are. AVOCADO departs from a Velocity Obstacle's (VO) formulation akin to the Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance method. However, instead of assuming reciprocity, it poses an adaptive control problem to adapt to the cooperation level of other robots and agents in real time. This is achieved through a novel nonlinear opinion dynamics design that relies solely on sensor observations. As a by-product, we leverage tools from the opinion dynamics formulation to naturally avoid the deadlocks in geometrically symmetric scenarios that typically suffer VO-based planners. Extensive numerical simulations show that AVOCADO surpasses existing motion planners in mixed cooperative/non-cooperative navigation environments in terms of success rate, time to goal and computational time. In addition, we conduct multiple real experiments that verify that AVOCADO is able to avoid collisions in environments crowded with other robots and humans.</description>

      <title>Physics-Aware Combinatorial Assembly Sequence Planning using Data-free Action Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial assembly uses standardized unit primitives to build objects that satisfy user specifications. This paper studies assembly sequence planning (ASP) for physical combinatorial assembly. Given the shape of the desired object, the goal is to find a sequence of actions for placing unit primitives to build the target object. In particular, we aim to ensure the planned assembly sequence is physically executable. However, ASP for combinatorial assembly is particularly challenging due to its combinatorial nature. To address the challenge, we employ deep reinforcement learning to learn a construction policy for placing unit primitives sequentially to build the desired object. Specifically, we design an online physics-aware action mask that filters out invalid actions, which effectively guides policy learning and ensures violation-free deployment. In the end, we apply the proposed method to Lego assembly with more than 250 3D structures. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method plans physically valid assembly sequences to build all structures, achieving a $100\%$ success rate, whereas the best comparable baseline fails more than $40$ structures. Our implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/intelligent-control-lab/PhysicsAwareCombinatorialASP}.</description>

      <title>Kalib: Easy Hand-Eye Calibration with Reference Point Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hand-eye calibration aims to estimate the transformation between a camera and a robot. Traditional methods rely on fiducial markers, which require considerable manual effort and precise setup. Recent advances in deep learning have introduced markerless techniques but come with more prerequisites, such as retraining networks for each robot, and accessing accurate mesh models for data generation. In this paper, we propose Kalib, an automatic and easy-to-setup hand-eye calibration method that leverages the generalizability of visual foundation models to overcome these challenges. It features only two basic prerequisites, the robot's kinematic chain and a predefined reference point on the robot. During calibration, the reference point is tracked in the camera space. Its corresponding 3D coordinates in the robot coordinate can be inferred by forward kinematics. Then, a PnP solver directly estimates the transformation between the camera and the robot without training new networks or accessing mesh models. Evaluations in simulated and real-world benchmarks show that Kalib achieves good accuracy with a lower manual workload compared with recent baseline methods. We also demonstrate its application in multiple real-world settings with various robot arms and grippers. Kalib's user-friendly design and minimal setup requirements make it a possible solution for continuous operation in unstructured environments.</description>

      <title>Socially-Aware Robot Navigation Enhanced by Bidirectional Natural Language Conversations Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robot navigation is crucial across various domains, yet traditional methods focus on efficiency and obstacle avoidance, often overlooking human behavior in shared spaces. With the rise of service robots, socially aware navigation has gained prominence. However, existing approaches primarily predict pedestrian movements or issue alerts, lacking true human-robot interaction. We introduce Hybrid Soft Actor-Critic with Large Language Model (HSAC-LLM), a novel framework for socially aware navigation. By integrating deep reinforcement learning with large language models, HSAC-LLM enables bidirectional natural language interactions, predicting both continuous and discrete navigation actions. When potential collisions arise, the robot proactively communicates with pedestrians to determine avoidance strategies. Experiments in 2D simulation, Gazebo, and real-world environments demonstrate that HSAC-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art DRL methods in interaction, navigation, and obstacle avoidance. This paradigm advances effective human-robot interactions in dynamic settings. Videos are available at https://hsacllm.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Intelligent LiDAR Navigation: Leveraging External Information and Semantic Maps with LLM as Copilot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional robot navigation systems primarily utilize occupancy grid maps and laser-based sensing technologies, as demonstrated by the popular move_base package in ROS. Unlike robots, humans navigate not only through spatial awareness and physical distances but also by integrating external information, such as elevator maintenance updates from public notification boards and experiential knowledge, like the need for special access through certain doors. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), which possesses text understanding and intelligence close to human performance, there is now an opportunity to infuse robot navigation systems with a level of understanding akin to human cognition. In this study, we propose using osmAG (Area Graph in OpensStreetMap textual format), an innovative semantic topometric hierarchical map representation, to bridge the gap between the capabilities of ROS move_base and the contextual understanding offered by LLMs. Our methodology employs LLMs as an actual copilot in robot navigation, enabling the integration of a broader range of informational inputs while maintaining the robustness of traditional robotic navigation systems. Our code, demo, map, experiment results can be accessed at https://github.com/xiexiexiaoxiexie/Intelligent-LiDAR-Navigation-LLM-as-Copilot.</description>

      <title>Intent Prediction-Driven Model Predictive Control for UAV Planning and Navigation in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aerial robots can enhance construction site productivity by autonomously handling inspection and mapping tasks. However, ensuring safe navigation near human workers remains challenging. While navigation in static environments has been well studied, navigating dynamic environments remains open due to challenges in perception and planning. Payload limitations restrict the robots to using cameras with limited fields of view, resulting in unreliable perception and tracking during collision avoidance. Moreover, the rapidly changing conditions of dynamic environments can quickly make the generated optimal trajectory outdated.To address these challenges, this paper presents a comprehensive navigation framework that integrates perception, intent prediction, and planning. Our perception module detects and tracks dynamic obstacles efficiently and handles tracking loss and occlusion during collision avoidance. The proposed intent prediction module employs a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to forecast potential actions of dynamic obstacles with the possible future trajectories. Finally, a novel intent-based planning algorithm, leveraging model predictive control (MPC), is applied to generate navigation trajectories. Simulation and physical experiments demonstrate that our method improves the safety of navigation by achieving the fewest collisions compared to benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When working around humans, it is important to model their perception limitations in order to predict their behavior more accurately. In this work, we consider agents with a limited field of view, viewing range, and ability to miss objects within the viewing range (e.g., transparency). By considering the observation model independently from the motion policy, we can better predict the agent's behavior by considering these limitations and approximating them. We perform a user study where human operators navigate a cluttered scene while scanning the region for obstacles with a limited field of view and range. Using imitation learning, we show that a robot can adopt a human's strategy for observing an environment with limitations on observation and navigate with minimal collision with dynamic and static obstacles. We also show that this learned model helps it successfully navigate a physical hardware vehicle in real-time.</description>

      <title>Diff-DAgger: Uncertainty Estimation with Diffusion Policy for Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14868v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, diffusion policy has shown impressive results in handling multi-modal tasks in robotic manipulation. However, it has fundamental limitations in out-of-distribution failures that persist due to compounding errors and its limited capability to extrapolate. One way to address these limitations is robot-gated DAgger, an interactive imitation learning with a robot query system to actively seek expert help during policy rollout. While robot-gated DAgger has high potential for learning at scale, existing methods like Ensemble-DAgger struggle with highly expressive policies: They often misinterpret policy disagreements as uncertainty at multi-modal decision points. To address this problem, we introduce Diff-DAgger, an efficient robot-gated DAgger algorithm that leverages the training objective of diffusion policy. We evaluate Diff-DAgger across different robot tasks including stacking, pushing, and plugging, and show that Diff-DAgger improves the task failure prediction by 39.0%, the task completion rate by 20.6%, and reduces the wall-clock time by a factor of 7.8. We hope that this work opens up a path for efficiently incorporating expressive yet data-hungry policies into interactive robot learning settings.

      <title>Control Strategies for Pursuit-Evasion Under Occlusion Using Visibility and Safety Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a control strategy for pursuit-evasion problems in environments with occlusions. We address the challenge of a mobile pursuer keeping a mobile evader within its field of view (FoV) despite line-of-sight obstructions. The signed distance function (SDF) of the FoV is used to formulate visibility as a control barrier function (CBF) constraint on the pursuer's control inputs. Similarly, obstacle avoidance is formulated as a CBF constraint based on the SDF of the obstacle set. While the visibility and safety CBFs are Lipschitz continuous, they are not differentiable everywhere, necessitating the use of generalized gradients. To achieve non-myopic pursuit, we generate reference control trajectories leading to evader visibility using a sampling-based kinodynamic planner. The pursuer then tracks this reference via convex optimization under the CBF constraints. We validate our approach in CARLA simulations and real-world robot experiments, demonstrating successful visibility maintenance using only onboard sensing, even under severe occlusions and dynamic evader movements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach, MAGIC (manipulation analogies for generalizable intelligent contacts), for one-shot learning of manipulation strategies with fast and extensive generalization to novel objects. By leveraging a reference action trajectory, MAGIC effectively identifies similar contact points and sequences of actions on novel objects to replicate a demonstrated strategy, such as using different hooks to retrieve distant objects of different shapes and sizes. Our method is based on a two-stage contact-point matching process that combines global shape matching using pretrained neural features with local curvature analysis to ensure precise and physically plausible contact points. We experiment with three tasks including scooping, hanging, and hooking objects. MAGIC demonstrates superior performance over existing methods, achieving significant improvements in runtime speed and generalization to different object categories.

      <description>arXiv:2411.18562v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dexterous manipulation with contact-rich interactions is crucial for advanced robotics. While recent diffusion-based planning approaches show promise for simple manipulation tasks, they often produce unrealistic ghost states (e.g., the object automatically moves without hand contact) or lack adaptability when handling complex sequential interactions. In this work, we introduce DexDiffuser, an interaction-aware diffusion planning framework for adaptive dexterous manipulation. DexDiffuser models joint state-action dynamics through a dual-phase diffusion process which consists of pre-interaction contact alignment and post-contact goal-directed control, enabling goal-adaptive generalizable dexterous manipulation. Additionally, we incorporate dynamics model-based dual guidance and leverage large language models for automated guidance function generation, enhancing generalizability for physical interactions and facilitating diverse goal adaptation through language cues. Experiments on physical interaction tasks such as door opening, pen and block re-orientation, object relocation, and hammer striking demonstrate DexDiffuser's effectiveness on goals outside training distributions, achieving over twice the average success rate (59.2% vs. 29.5%) compared to existing methods. Our framework achieves an average of 70.7% success rate on goal adaptive dexterous tasks, highlighting its robustness and flexibility in contact-rich manipulation.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic Clutches Enable Simultaneous Mechanical Multiplexing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Actuating robotic systems with multiple degrees of freedom (DoF) traditionally requires numerous motors, leading to increased size, weight, cost, and power consumption. Mechanical multiplexing offers a solution by enabling a single actuator to control multiple DoF. However, existing multiplexers have either been limited to electrically controlled time-based multiplexing that control one DoF at a time or have relied on mechanical switching to control multiple DoF simultaneously. There is a strong need for a system that can perform electrically controlled multiplexing for both time-based and simultaneous control of multiple DoF. This study introduces a novel electrostatic capstan clutch-based mechanical multiplexer that enables high-force, single-motor control of multiple DoF. Here, we show that our system achieves both single-input-single-output (SISO) and single-input-multipleoutput (SIMO) actuation, allowing bidirectional control and position holding with minimal power consumption. Each output can actuate a 22.24 N load, limited by clutch performance, up to 5 cm. The number of outputs and actuation length is currently limited by the length of the drive shaft. We demonstrate the integration of our system into a 4-DoF commercial robotic hand using a single motor. These findings show that electrostatic clutchbased multiplexing provides a scalable and energy-efficient design solution for high-DoF robotic platforms, opening new possibilities for lightweight and power-efficient actuation in robotics.</description>

      <title>Evolution 6.0: Evolving Robotic Capabilities Through Generative Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new concept, Evolution 6.0, which represents the evolution of robotics driven by Generative AI. When a robot lacks the necessary tools to accomplish a task requested by a human, it autonomously designs the required instruments and learns how to use them to achieve the goal. Evolution 6.0 is an autonomous robotic system powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Vision-Language Action (VLA) models, and Text-to-3D generative models for tool design and task execution. The system comprises two key modules: the Tool Generation Module, which fabricates task-specific tools from visual and textual data, and the Action Generation Module, which converts natural language instructions into robotic actions. It integrates QwenVLM for environmental understanding, OpenVLA for task execution, and Llama-Mesh for 3D tool generation. Evaluation results demonstrate a 90% success rate for tool generation with a 10-second inference time, and action generation achieving 83.5% in physical and visual generalization, 70% in motion generalization, and 37% in semantic generalization. Future improvements will focus on bimanual manipulation, expanded task capabilities, and enhanced environmental interpretation to improve real-world adaptability.</description>

      <title>CarPlanner: Consistent Auto-regressive Trajectory Planning for Large-scale Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trajectory planning is vital for autonomous driving, ensuring safe and efficient navigation in complex environments. While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</description>

      <title>AVR: Active Vision-Driven Robotic Precision Manipulation with Viewpoint and Focal Length Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation within dynamic environments presents challenges to precise control and adaptability. Traditional fixed-view camera systems face challenges adapting to change viewpoints and scale variations, limiting perception and manipulation precision. To tackle these issues, we propose the Active Vision-driven Robotic (AVR) framework, a teleoperation hardware solution that supports dynamic viewpoint and dynamic focal length adjustments to continuously center targets and maintain optimal scale, accompanied by a corresponding algorithm that effectively enhances the success rates of various operational tasks. Using the RoboTwin platform with a real-time image processing plugin, AVR framework improves task success rates by 5%-16% on five manipulation tasks. Physical deployment on a dual-arm system demonstrates in collaborative tasks and 36% precision in screwdriver insertion, outperforming baselines by over 25%. Experimental results confirm that AVR framework enhances environmental perception, manipulation repeatability (40% $\le $1 cm error), and robustness in complex scenarios, paving the way for future robotic precision manipulation methods in the pursuit of human-level robot dexterity and precision.</description>

      <title>Physically-Feasible Reactive Synthesis for Terrain-Adaptive Locomotion via Trajectory Optimization and Symbolic Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an integrated planning framework for quadrupedal locomotion over dynamically changing, unforeseen terrains. Existing approaches either rely on heuristics for instantaneous foothold selection--compromising safety and versatility--or solve expensive trajectory optimization problems with complex terrain features and long time horizons. In contrast, our framework leverages reactive synthesis to generate correct-by-construction controllers at the symbolic level, and mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for dynamic and physically feasible footstep planning for each symbolic transition. We use a high-level manager to reduce the large state space in synthesis by incorporating local environment information, improving synthesis scalability. To handle specifications that cannot be met due to dynamic infeasibility, and to minimize costly MICP solves, we leverage a symbolic repair process to generate only necessary symbolic transitions. During online execution, re-running the MICP with real-world terrain data, along with runtime symbolic repair, bridges the gap between offline synthesis and online execution. We demonstrate, in simulation, our framework's capabilities to discover missing locomotion skills and react promptly in safety-critical environments, such as scattered stepping stones and rebars.</description>

      <title>MERLION: Marine ExploRation with Language guIded Online iNformative Visual Sampling and Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous and targeted underwater visual monitoring and exploration using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) can be a challenging task due to both online and offline constraints. The online constraints comprise limited onboard storage capacity and communication bandwidth to the surface, whereas the offline constraints entail the time and effort required for the selection of desired key frames from the video data. An example use case of targeted underwater visual monitoring is finding the most interesting visual frames of fish in a long sequence of an AUV's visual experience. This challenge of targeted informative sampling is further aggravated in murky waters with poor visibility. In this paper, we present MERLION, a novel framework that provides semantically aligned and visually enhanced summaries for murky underwater marine environment monitoring and exploration. Specifically, our framework integrates (a) an image-text model for semantically aligning the visual samples to the users' needs, (b) an image enhancement model for murky water visual data and (c) an informative sampler for summarizing the monitoring experience. We validate our proposed MERLION framework on real-world data with user studies and present qualitative and quantitative results using our evaluation metric and show improved results compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. We have open-sourced the code for MERLION at the following link https://github.com/MARVL-Lab/MERLION.git.</description>

      <title>Uni-Gaussians: Unifying Camera and Lidar Simulation with Gaussians for Dynamic Driving Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles necessitates comprehensive simulation of multi-sensor data, encompassing inputs from both cameras and LiDAR sensors, across various dynamic driving scenarios. Neural rendering techniques, which utilize collected raw sensor data to simulate these dynamic environments, have emerged as a leading methodology. While NeRF-based approaches can uniformly represent scenes for rendering data from both camera and LiDAR, they are hindered by slow rendering speeds due to dense sampling. Conversely, Gaussian Splatting-based methods employ Gaussian primitives for scene representation and achieve rapid rendering through rasterization. However, these rasterization-based techniques struggle to accurately model non-linear optical sensors. This limitation restricts their applicability to sensors beyond pinhole cameras. To address these challenges and enable unified representation of dynamic driving scenarios using Gaussian primitives, this study proposes a novel hybrid approach. Our method utilizes rasterization for rendering image data while employing Gaussian ray-tracing for LiDAR data rendering. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This work presents a unified and efficient solution for realistic simulation of camera and LiDAR data in autonomous driving scenarios using Gaussian primitives, offering significant advancements in both rendering quality and computational efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training manipulation policies for humanoid robots with diverse data enhances their robustness and generalization across tasks and platforms. However, learning solely from robot demonstrations is labor-intensive, requiring expensive tele-operated data collection which is difficult to scale. This paper investigates a more scalable data source, egocentric human demonstrations, to serve as cross-embodiment training data for robot learning. We mitigate the embodiment gap between humanoids and humans from both the data and modeling perspectives. We collect an egocentric task-oriented dataset (PH2D) that is directly aligned with humanoid manipulation demonstrations. We then train a human-humanoid behavior policy, which we term Human Action Transformer (HAT). The state-action space of HAT is unified for both humans and humanoid robots and can be differentiably retargeted to robot actions. Co-trained with smaller-scale robot data, HAT directly models humanoid robots and humans as different embodiments without additional supervision. We show that human data improves both generalization and robustness of HAT with significantly better data collection efficiency. Code and data: https://human-as-robot.github.io/</description>

      <title>LaMOuR: Leveraging Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Recovery in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated strong performance in robotic control but remains susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) states, often resulting in unreliable actions and task failure. While previous methods have focused on minimizing or preventing OOD occurrences, they largely neglect recovery once an agent encounters such states. Although the latest research has attempted to address this by guiding agents back to in-distribution states, their reliance on uncertainty estimation hinders scalability in complex environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Recovery (LaMOuR), which enables recovery learning without relying on uncertainty estimation. LaMOuR generates dense reward codes that guide the agent back to a state where it can successfully perform its original task, leveraging the capabilities of LVLMs in image description, logical reasoning, and code generation. Experimental results show that LaMOuR substantially enhances recovery efficiency across diverse locomotion tasks and even generalizes effectively to complex environments, including humanoid locomotion and mobile manipulation, where existing methods struggle.

      <title>GDRNPP: A Geometry-guided and Fully Learning-based Object Pose Estimator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.12145v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 6D pose estimation of rigid objects is a long-standing and challenging task in computer vision. Recently, the emergence of deep learning reveals the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict reliable 6D poses. Given that direct pose regression networks currently exhibit suboptimal performance, most methods still resort to traditional techniques to varying degrees. For example, top-performing methods often adopt an indirect strategy by first establishing 2D-3D or 3D-3D correspondences followed by applying the RANSAC-based PnP or Kabsch algorithms, and further employing ICP for refinement. Despite the performance enhancement, the integration of traditional techniques makes the networks time-consuming and not end-to-end trainable. Orthogonal to them, this paper introduces a fully learning-based object pose estimator. In this work, we first perform an in-depth investigation of both direct and indirect methods and propose a simple yet effective Geometry-guided Direct Regression Network (GDRN) to learn the 6D pose from monocular images in an end-to-end manner. Afterwards, we introduce a geometry-guided pose refinement module, enhancing pose accuracy when extra depth data is available. Guided by the predicted coordinate map, we build an end-to-end differentiable architecture that establishes robust and accurate 3D-3D correspondences between the observed and rendered RGB-D images to refine the pose. Our enhanced pose estimation pipeline GDRNPP (GDRN Plus Plus) conquered the leaderboard of the BOP Challenge for two consecutive years, becoming the first to surpass all prior methods that relied on traditional techniques in both accuracy and speed.

      <description>arXiv:2311.13186v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In robotics, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly recognized for their largely-unrealized potential energy efficiency and low latency particularly when implemented on neuromorphic hardware. Our paper highlights three advancements for SNNs in Visual Place Recognition (VPR). Firstly, we propose Modular SNNs, where each SNN represents a set of non-overlapping geographically distinct places, enabling scalable networks for large environments. Secondly, we present Ensembles of Modular SNNs, where multiple networks represent the same place, significantly enhancing accuracy compared to single-network models. Each of our Modular SNN modules is compact, comprising only 1500 neurons and 474k synapses, making them ideally suited for ensembling due to their small size. Lastly, we investigate the role of sequence matching in SNN-based VPR, a technique where consecutive images are used to refine place recognition. We demonstrate competitive performance of our method on a range of datasets, including higher responsiveness to ensembling compared to conventional VPR techniques and higher R@1 improvements with sequence matching than VPR techniques with comparable baseline performance. Our contributions highlight the viability of SNNs for VPR, offering scalable and robust solutions, and paving the way for their application in various energy-sensitive robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>Distributed Bayesian Estimation in Sensor Networks: Consensus on Marginal Densities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to design and analyze distributed Bayesian estimation algorithms for sensor networks. The challenges we address are to (i) derive a distributed provably-correct algorithm in the functional space of probability distributions over continuous variables, and (ii) leverage these results to obtain new distributed estimators restricted to subsets of variables observed by individual agents. This relates to applications such as cooperative localization and federated learning, where the data collected at any agent depends on a subset of all variables of interest. We present Bayesian density estimation algorithms using data from non-linear likelihoods at agents in centralized, distributed, and marginal distributed settings. After setting up a distributed estimation objective, we prove almost-sure convergence to the optimal set of pdfs at each agent. Then, we prove the same for a storage-aware algorithm estimating densities only over relevant variables at each agent. Finally, we present a Gaussian version of these algorithms and implement it in a mapping problem using variational inference to handle non-linear likelihood models associated with LiDAR sensing.</description>

      <title>NavCoT: Boosting LLM-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation via Learning Disentangled Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), as a crucial research problem of Embodied AI, requires an embodied agent to navigate through complex 3D environments following natural language instructions. Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications.

      <description>arXiv:2410.05869v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can objects that are not visible in an image -- but are in the vicinity of the camera -- be detected? This study introduces the novel tasks of 2D, 2.5D and 3D unobserved object detection for predicting the location of nearby objects that are occluded or lie outside the image frame. We adapt several state-of-the-art pre-trained generative models to address this task, including 2D and 3D diffusion models and vision-language models, and show that they can be used to infer the presence of objects that are not directly observed. To benchmark this task, we propose a suite of metrics that capture different aspects of performance. Our empirical evaluation on indoor scenes from the RealEstate10k and NYU Depth v2 datasets demonstrate results that motivate the use of generative models for the unobserved object detection task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adverse weather conditions pose a significant challenge to the widespread adoption of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by impacting sensors like LiDARs and cameras. Even though Collaborative Perception (CP) improves AV perception in difficult conditions, existing CP datasets lack adverse weather conditions. To address this, we introduce Adver-City, the first open-source synthetic CP dataset focused on adverse weather conditions. Simulated in CARLA with OpenCDA, it contains over 24 thousand frames, over 890 thousand annotations, and 110 unique scenarios across six different weather conditions: clear weather, soft rain, heavy rain, fog, foggy heavy rain and, for the first time in a synthetic CP dataset, glare. It has six object categories including pedestrians and cyclists, and uses data from vehicles and roadside units featuring LiDARs, RGB and semantic segmentation cameras, GNSS, and IMUs. Its scenarios, based on real crash reports, depict the most relevant road configurations for adverse weather and poor visibility conditions, varying in object density, with both dense and sparse scenes, allowing for novel testing conditions of CP models. Benchmarks run on the dataset show that weather conditions created challenging conditions for perception models, with CoBEVT scoring 58.30/52.44/38.90 (AP@30/50/70). The dataset, code and documentation are available at https://labs.cs.queensu.ca/quarrg/datasets/adver-city/.</description>

      <title>ModeSeq: Taming Sparse Multimodal Motion Prediction with Sequential Mode Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anticipating the multimodality of future events lays the foundation for safe autonomous driving. However, multimodal motion prediction for traffic agents has been clouded by the lack of multimodal ground truth. Existing works predominantly adopt the winner-take-all training strategy to tackle this challenge, yet still suffer from limited trajectory diversity and uncalibrated mode confidence. While some approaches address these limitations by generating excessive trajectory candidates, they necessitate a post-processing stage to identify the most representative modes, a process lacking universal principles and compromising trajectory accuracy. We are thus motivated to introduce ModeSeq, a new multimodal prediction paradigm that models modes as sequences. Unlike the common practice of decoding multiple plausible trajectories in one shot, ModeSeq requires motion decoders to infer the next mode step by step, thereby more explicitly capturing the correlation between modes and significantly enhancing the ability to reason about multimodality. Leveraging the inductive bias of sequential mode prediction, we also propose the Early-Match-Take-All (EMTA) training strategy to diversify the trajectories further. Without relying on dense mode prediction or heuristic post-processing, ModeSeq considerably improves the diversity of multimodal output while attaining satisfactory trajectory accuracy, resulting in balanced performance on motion prediction benchmarks. Moreover, ModeSeq naturally emerges with the capability of mode extrapolation, which supports forecasting more behavior modes when the future is highly uncertain.</description>

      <title>DiffusionDrive: Truncated Diffusion Model for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the diffusion model has emerged as a powerful generative technique for robotic policy learning, capable of modeling multi-mode action distributions. Leveraging its capability for end-to-end autonomous driving is a promising direction. However, the numerous denoising steps in the robotic diffusion policy and the more dynamic, open-world nature of traffic scenes pose substantial challenges for generating diverse driving actions at a real-time speed. To address these challenges, we propose a novel truncated diffusion policy that incorporates prior multi-mode anchors and truncates the diffusion schedule, enabling the model to learn denoising from anchored Gaussian distribution to the multi-mode driving action distribution. Additionally, we design an efficient cascade diffusion decoder for enhanced interaction with conditional scene context. The proposed model, DiffusionDrive, demonstrates 10$\times$ reduction in denoising steps compared to vanilla diffusion policy, delivering superior diversity and quality in just 2 steps. On the planning-oriented NAVSIM dataset, with the aligned ResNet-34 backbone, DiffusionDrive achieves 88.1 PDMS without bells and whistles, setting a new record, while running at a real-time speed of 45 FPS on an NVIDIA 4090. Qualitative results on challenging scenarios further confirm that DiffusionDrive can robustly generate diverse plausible driving actions. Code and model will be available at https://github.com/hustvl/DiffusionDrive.</description>

      <title>ETAP: Event-based Tracking of Any Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tracking any point (TAP) recently shifted the motion estimation paradigm from focusing on individual salient points with local templates to tracking arbitrary points with global image contexts. However, while research has mostly focused on driving the accuracy of models in nominal settings, addressing scenarios with difficult lighting conditions and high-speed motions remains out of reach due to the limitations of the sensor. This work addresses this challenge with the first event camera-based TAP method. It leverages the high temporal resolution and high dynamic range of event cameras for robust high-speed tracking, and the global contexts in TAP methods to handle asynchronous and sparse event measurements. We further extend the TAP framework to handle event feature variations induced by motion -- thereby addressing an open challenge in purely event-based tracking -- with a novel feature-alignment loss which ensures the learning of motion-robust features. Our method is trained with data from a new data generation pipeline and systematically ablated across all design decisions. Our method shows strong cross-dataset generalization and performs 136% better on the average Jaccard metric than the baselines. Moreover, on an established feature tracking benchmark, it achieves a 20% improvement over the previous best event-only method and even surpasses the previous best events-and-frames method by 4.1%.

      <title>Emergency-Brake Simplex: Toward A Verifiably Safe Control-CPS Architecture for Abrupt Runtime Reachability Constraint Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a system's constraints change abruptly, the system's reachability safety does no longer sustain. Thus, the system can reach a forbidden/dangerous value. Conventional remedy practically involves online controller redesign (OCR) to re-establish the reachability's compliance with the new constraints, which, however, is usually too slow. There is a need for an online strategy capable of managing runtime changes in reachability constraints. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this topic has not been addressed in the existing literature. In this paper, we propose a fast fault tolerance strategy to recover the system's reachability safety in runtime. Instead of redesigning the system's controller, we propose to change the system's reference state to modify the system's reachability to comply with the new constraints. We frame the reference state search as an optimization problem and employ the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) method as well as the Interior Point Method (IPM) based Newton's method (as a fallback for the KKT method) for fast solution derivation. The optimization also allows more future fault tolerance. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms the conventional OCR method in terms of computational efficiency and success rate. Specifically, the results show that the proposed method finds a solution $10^{2}$ (with the IPM based Newton's method) $\sim 10^{4}$ (with the KKT method) times faster than the OCR method. Additionally, the improvement rate of the success rate of our method over the OCR method is $40.81\%$ without considering the deadline of run time. The success rate remains at $49.44\%$ for the proposed method, while it becomes $0\%$ for the OCR method when a deadline of $1.5 \; seconds$ is imposed.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional Multi-Object Tracking</title>

Abstract: Panoramic imagery, with its 360{\deg} field of view, offers comprehensive information to support Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) in capturing spatial and temporal relationships of surrounding objects. However, most MOT algorithms are tailored for pinhole images with limited views, impairing their effectiveness in panoramic settings. Additionally, panoramic image distortions, such as resolution loss, geometric deformation, and uneven lighting, hinder direct adaptation of existing MOT methods, leading to significant performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose OmniTrack, an omnidirectional MOT framework that incorporates Tracklet Management to introduce temporal cues, FlexiTrack Instances for object localization and association, and the CircularStatE Module to alleviate image and geometric distortions. This integration enables tracking in panoramic field-of-view scenarios, even under rapid sensor motion. To mitigate the lack of panoramic MOT datasets, we introduce the QuadTrack dataset--a comprehensive panoramic dataset collected by a quadruped robot, featuring diverse challenges such as panoramic fields of view, intense motion, and complex environments. Extensive experiments on the public JRDB dataset and the newly introduced QuadTrack benchmark demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed framework. OmniTrack achieves a HOTA score of 26.92% on JRDB, representing an improvement of 3.43%, and further achieves 23.45% on QuadTrack, surpassing the baseline by 6.81%. The established dataset and source code are available at https://github.com/xifen523/OmniTrack.</description>

      <title>Closing the Intent-to-Behavior Gap via Fulfillment Priority Logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Practitioners designing reinforcement learning policies face a fundamental challenge: translating intended behavioral objectives into representative reward functions. This challenge stems from behavioral intent requiring simultaneous achievement of multiple competing objectives, typically addressed through labor-intensive linear reward composition that yields brittle results. Consider the ubiquitous robotics scenario where performance maximization directly conflicts with energy conservation. Such competitive dynamics are resistant to simple linear reward combinations. In this paper, we present the concept of objective fulfillment upon which we build Fulfillment Priority Logic (FPL). FPL allows practitioners to define logical formula representing their intentions and priorities within multi-objective reinforcement learning. Our novel Balanced Policy Gradient algorithm leverages FPL specifications to achieve up to 500\% better sample efficiency compared to Soft Actor Critic. Notably, this work constitutes the first implementation of non-linear utility scalarization design, specifically for continuous control problems.</description>

      <title>A Data-Centric Revisit of Pre-Trained Vision Models for Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained vision models (PVMs) are fundamental to modern robotics, yet their optimal configuration remains unclear. Through systematic evaluation, we find that while DINO and iBOT outperform MAE across visuomotor control and perception tasks, they struggle when trained on non-(single-)object-centric (NOC) data--a limitation strongly correlated with their diminished ability to learn object-centric representations. This investigation indicates that the ability to form object-centric representations from the non-object-centric robotics dataset is the key to success for PVMs. Motivated by this discovery, we designed SlotMIM, a method that induces object-centric representations by introducing a semantic bottleneck to reduce the number of prototypes to encourage the emergence of objectness as well as cross-view consistency regularization for encouraging multiview invariance. Our experiments encompass pre-training on object-centric, scene-centric, web-crawled, and ego-centric data. Across all settings, our approach learns transferrable representations and achieves significant improvements over prior work in image recognition, scene understanding, and robot learning evaluations. When scaled up with million-scale datasets, our method also demonstrates superior data efficiency and scalability. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/SlotMIM.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction has emerged as a transformative technique in autonomous driving, enabling precise modeling of both dynamic and static environments through advanced neural representations. Despite data augmentation, 3D reconstruction inspires pioneering solution for vital tasks in the field of autonomous driving, such as scene understanding and closed-loop simulation. We investigates the details of 3D reconstruction and conducts a multi-perspective, in-depth analysis of recent advancements. Specifically, we first provide a systematic introduction of preliminaries, including data modalities, benchmarks and technical preliminaries of learning-based 3D reconstruction, facilitating instant identification of suitable methods according to sensor suites. Then, we systematically review learning-based 3D reconstruction methods in autonomous driving, categorizing approaches by subtasks and conducting multi-dimensional analysis and summary to establish a comprehensive technical reference. The development trends and existing challenges are summarized in the context of learning-based 3D reconstruction in autonomous driving. We hope that our review will inspire future researches.</description>

      <title>Deep learning framework for action prediction reveals multi-timescale locomotor control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling movement in real-world tasks is a fundamental goal for motor control, biomechanics, and rehabilitation engineering. However, widely used data-driven models of essential tasks like locomotion make simplifying assumptions such as linear and fixed timescale mappings between past inputs and future actions, which do not generalize to real-world contexts. Here, we develop a deep learning-based framework for action prediction with architecture-dependent trial embeddings, outperforming traditional models across contexts (walking and running, treadmill and overground, varying terrains) and input modalities (multiple body states, gaze). We find that neural network architectures with flexible input history-dependence like GRU and Transformer perform best overall. By quantifying the model's predictions relative to an autoregressive baseline, we identify context- and modality-dependent timescales. These analyses reveal that there is greater reliance on fast-timescale predictions in complex terrain, gaze predicts future foot placement before body states, and the full-body state predictions precede those by center-of-mass-relevant states. This deep learning framework for action prediction provides quantifiable insights into the control of real-world locomotion and can be extended to other actions, contexts, and populations.</description>
