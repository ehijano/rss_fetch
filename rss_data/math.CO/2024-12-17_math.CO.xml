      <title>On the Clean Graph of a Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring (not necessarily a commutative ring) with identity. The clean graph $Cl(R)$ of a ring $R$ is a graph with vertices in the form of an ordered pair $(e,u)$, where $e$ is an idempotent and $u$ is a unit of ring $R$, respectively. Two distinct vertices $(e,u)$ and $(f,v)$ are adjacent in $Cl(R)$ if and only if $ef=fe=0$ or $uv=vu=1$. In this study, we considered the induced subgraph $Cl_2(R)$ of $Cl(R)$. We determined the Wiener index of $Cl_2(R)$, and we showed $Cl_2(R)$ has a perfect matching. In addition, we determined the matching number of $Cl_2(R)$ if $|U(R)|$ is not even.</description>

      <title>On Enumerating Higher Bruhat Orders Through Deletion and Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The higher Bruhat orders $\mathcal{B}(n,k)$ were introduced by Manin-Schechtman to study discriminantal hyperplane arrangements and subsequently studied by Ziegler, who connected $\mathcal{B}(n,k)$ to oriented matroids. In this paper, we consider the enumeration of $\mathcal{B}(n,k)$ and improve upon Balko's asymptotic lower and upper bounds on $|\mathcal{B}(n,k)|$ by a factor exponential in $k$. A proof of Ziegler's formula for $|\mathcal{B}(n,n-3)|$ is given and a bijection between a certain subset of $\mathcal{B}(n,n-4)$ and totally symmetric plane partitions is proved. Central to our proofs are deletion and contraction operations for the higher Bruhat orders, defined in analogy with matroids. Dual higher Bruhat orders are also introduced, and we construct isomorphisms relating the higher Bruhat orders and their duals. Additionally, weaving functions are introduced to generalize Felsner's encoding of elements in $\mathcal{B}(n,2)$ to all higher Bruhat orders $\mathcal{B}(n,k)$.</description>

      <title>When is the chromatic quasisymmetric function symmetric?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of when a chromatic quasisymmetric function (CQF) $X_G(x;q)$ of a graph $G$ is in fact symmetric. We first prove the remarkable fact that if a product of two quasisymmetric functions $f$ and $g$ in countably infinitely many variables is symmetric, then in fact $f$ and $g$ must be symmetric. This allows the problem to be reduced to the case of connected graphs.
  We then show that any labeled graph having more than one source or sink has a nonsymmetric CQF. As a corollary, we find that all trees other than a directed path have a nonsymmetric CQF. We also show that a family of graphs we call ``mixed mountain graphs'' always have symmetric CQF.</description>

      <title>A Survey of R\'{e}dei-Berge Symmetric Functions via Matrix Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey provides a detailed exposition of the R\'{e}dei-Berge symmetric function $\mathcal{U}_D$ for digraphs $D$, a specialization of Chow's path-cycle symmetric function. Through the lens of matrix algebra, we consolidate and expand on the work of Chow, Grinberg and Stanley, and Lass concerning the resolution of $\mathcal{U}_D$ in the power sum and Schur bases. Along the way we also revisit various results on Hamiltonian paths in digraphs.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of Translational Tiling with Three Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is there a fixed dimension $n$ such that translational tiling of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with a monotile is undecidable? Several recent results support a positive answer to this question. Greenfeld and Tao disprove the periodic tiling conjecture by showing that an aperiodic monotile exists in sufficiently high dimension $n$ [Ann. Math. 200(2024), 301-363]. In another paper [to appear in J. Eur. Math. Soc.], they also show that if the dimension $n$ is part of the input, then the translational tiling for subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with one tile is undecidable. These two results are very strong pieces of evidence for the conjecture that translational tiling of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with a monotile is undecidable, for some fixed $n$. This paper gives another supportive result for this conjecture by showing that translational tiling of the $4$-dimensional space with a set of three connected tiles is undecidable.</description>

      <title>Partial Chebyshev Polynomials and Fan Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the product formula of the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind $U_n(x)$, we newly introduce the partial Chebyshev polynomials $U^{\mathrm{e}}_n(x)$ and $U^{\mathrm{o}}_n(x)$. We derive their basic properties, relations to the classical Chebyshev polynomials, and new factorization formulas for $U_n(x)$. As an application, we study the quadratic embedding constant (QEC) of a fan graph $K_1+P_n$. By means of a new polynomial $\phi_n(x)$ which is shown to be factorized by the partial Chebyshev polynomial $U^{\mathrm{e}}_n(x)$, we prove that $\mathrm{QEC}(K_1+P_n)$ coincides with the minimal zero of $\phi_n(x)$, of which the values and estimates are also obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the change-making problem, we extend the notion of greediness to sets of positive integers not containing the element $1$, and from there to numerical semigroups. We provide an algorithm to determine if a given set (not necessarily containing the number $1$) is greedy. We also give specific conditions for sets of cardinality three, and we prove that numerical semigroups generated by three consecutive integers are greedy.</description>

      <title>Construction of directed strongly regular graphs with nontrivial automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a method for constructing directed strongly regular graphs with assumed action of an automorphism group. The application of this method leads to first examples of directed strongly regular graphs with parameters $(22,9,6,3,4)$. We have shown that an automorphism of prime order acting on such a graph can only be of order two or three. Furthermore, we have constructed $472$ directed strongly regular graphs with parameters $(22,9,6,3,4)$ and classified all these graphs with an automorphism of order three.</description>

      <title>Well-edge-dominated graphs containing triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of edges $F$ in a graph $G$ is an edge dominating set if every edge in $G$ is either in $F$ or shares a vertex with an edge in $F$. $G$ is said to be well-edge-dominated if all of its minimal edge dominating sets have the same cardinality. Recently it was shown that any triangle-free well-edge-dominated graph is either bipartite or in the set $\{C_5, C_7, C_7^*\}$ where $C_7^*$ is obtained from $C_7$ by adding a chord between any pair of vertices distance three apart. In this paper, we completely characterize all well-edge-dominated graphs containing exactly one triangle, of which there are two infinite families. We also prove that there are only eight well-edge-dominated outerplanar graphs, most of which contain at most one triangle.</description>

      <title>A Hopf algebra generalization of the symmetric functions in partially commutative variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasisymmetric functions, $QSym$, are generalized for a finite alphabet $A$ by the colored quasisymmetric functions, $QSym_A$, in partially commutative variables. Their dual, $NSym_A$, generalizes the noncommutative symmetric functions, $NSym$, through a relationship with a Hopf algebra of trees. We define an algebra $Sym_A$, contained within $QSym_A$, that is isomorphic to the symmetric functions, $Sym$, when $A$ is an alphabet of size one. We show that $Sym_A$ is a Hopf algebra and define its graded dual, $PSym_A$, which is the commutative image of $NSym_A$ and also generalizes $Sym$. The seven algebras listed here can be placed in a commutative diagram connected by Hopf morphisms. In addition to defining generalizations of the classic bases of the symmetric functions to $Sym_A$ and $PSym_A$, we describe multiplication, comultiplication, and the antipode in terms of a basis for both algebras. We conclude by defining a pair of dual bases that generalize the Schur functions and listing open questions.</description>

      <title>A Fundamental Theorem on Graph Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph operator is a function $\Gamma$ defined on some set of graphs such that whenever two graphs $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic, written $G\simeq H$, then $\Gamma(G)\simeq \Gamma(H)$. For a graph $G$ not in the domain of $\Gamma$, we put $\Gamma(G)=\emptyset$. Also, let us define $\Gamma^0(G)=G$, and for any integr $k\ge1$, $\Gamma^k(G)=\Gamma(\Gamma^{k-1}(G))$
  We prove that if $\Gamma$ is a graph operator, then the sequence $\langle \Gamma^k(G)\rangle_{k=0}^\infty$ has only three possible types of behaviour. Either $\Gamma^k(G)=\emptyset$ for some integer $k&gt;0$, or $\displaystyle\lim_{k\to\infty}|V(\Gamma^k(G))|=\infty$, or there exist integers $m\ge0$, $p&gt;0$ such that the graphs $\Gamma^j(G)$ are non-isomorphic ($0\le j\le m)$, and $\Gamma^{n+p}\simeq \Gamma ^n(G)$ for all integers $n\ge m$. We illustrate this using two new graph operators, namely, the path graph operator and the claw graph operator.</description>

      <title>The Fine interior of dilations of a rational polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nondegenerate toric hypersurface of negative Kodaira dimension can be characterized by the empty Fine interior of its Newton polytope according to recent work by Victor Batyrev, where the Fine interior is the rational subpolytope consisting of all points which have an integral distance of at least 1 to all integral supporting hyperplanes of the Newton polytope. Moreover, we get more information in this situation if we can describe how the Fine interior behaves for dilations of the Newton polytope, e.g. if we can determine the smallest dilation with a non-empty Fine interior. Therefore, in this article we give a purely combinatorial description of the Fine interiors of all dilations of a rational polytope, which allows us in particular to compute this smallest dilation and to classify all lattice 3-polytopes with empty Fine interior, for which we have only one point as Fine interior of the smallest dilation with non-empty Fine interior.</description>

Abstract: A new combinatorial object, called generalised nice set, is classified up to collineations of the Fano plane. This classification is necessary to find the graded contractions of all the exceptional complex Lie algebras of dimension at least 52, endowed with $\mathbb Z_2^3$-gradings coming from the octonions. Our classification is of purely combinatorial nature.</description>

      <title>Enumerating Diagonalizable Matrices over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although a good portion of elementary linear algebra concerns itself with matrices over a field such as $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, many combinatorial problems naturally surface when we instead work with matrices over a finite field. As some recent work has been done in these areas, we turn our attention to the problem of enumerating the square matrices with entries in $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$ that are diagonalizable over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$. This turns out to be significantly more nontrivial than its finite field counterpart due to the presence of zero divisors in $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a subset of a finite abelian group such that $A$ has a small difference set $A-A$ and the density of $A$ is small. We prove that, counter--intuitively, the smallness (in terms of $|A-A|$) of the Fourier coefficients of $A$ guarantees that $A$ is correlated with a large Bohr set. Our bounds on the size and the dimension of the resulting Bohr set are close to exact.</description>

We focus on compositions with parts restricted to 1 and 2 and consider the array of counts for such compositions of $n$ with $k$ water cells, establishing generating functions for the columns and diagonal sums, recurrences within the array in the spirit of Pascal's lemma, and connections to other restricted compositions. Most of our proofs are combinatorial, but we also make connections to Riordan arrays.</description>

      <title>Borel Local Lemma: arbitrary random variables and limited exponential growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lov\'asz Local Lemma (the LLL for short) is a powerful tool in probabilistic combinatorics that is used to verify the existence of combinatorial objects with desirable properties. Recent years saw the development of various "constructive" versions of the LLL. A major success of this research direction is the Borel version of the LLL due to Cs\'oka, Grabowski, M\'ath\'e, Pikhurko, and Tyros, which holds under a subexponential growth assumption. A drawback of their approach is that it only applies when the underlying random variables take values in a finite set. We present an alternative proof of a Borel version of the LLL that holds even if the underlying random variables are continuous and applies to dependency graphs of limited exponential growth.</description>

      <title>The existence of a $\{K_{1,2},K_{1,3},K_{5}\}$-factor based on the size or the $A_{\alpha}$-spectral radius of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph of order $n$ with $n\geq16$. A $\{K_{1,2},K_{1,3},K_{5}\}$-factor of $G$ is a spanning subgraph of $G$, in which each component is isomorphic to a member in $\{K_{1,2},K_{1,3},K_{5}\}$. The $A_{\alpha}$-spectral radius of $G$ is denoted by $\rho_{\alpha}(G)$. In this paper, we obtain a lower bound on the size (resp. the $A_{\alpha}$-spectral radius for $\alpha\in[0,\frac{1}{2}]$) of $G$ to guarantee that $G$ has a $\{K_{1,2},K_{1,3},K_{5}\}$-factor, and show that $G$ has a $\{K_{1,2},K_{1,3},K_{5}\}$-factor if $\rho_{\alpha}(G)&gt;\tau(n)$, where $\tau(n)$ is the largest root of $x^3-((\alpha+1)n+\alpha-3)x^2+(\alpha n^2+(\alpha^2-\alpha-1)n-2\alpha+1)x-\alpha^2n^2+(3\alpha^2-\alpha+1)n-4\alpha^2+5\alpha-3=0$.</description>

      <title>A half-automated study of a 2-parameter family of integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of some parametric integrals is presented with a combined approach of analytical development, the usage of a Computed Algebra System (CAS) and of the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. The methodology for the solution includes a) an analytical investigation for the study of the parametric integral, b) computations with a CAS of the integral for specific values of the parameter, c) investigation of the connection between the integral and special functions or classical numbers, and d) derivation of a general algorithm for the complete computation of the parametric integral. The central example of the paper is the parametric integral \begin{equation*} \label{the general integral} I_{n}^{(p)}=\int_0^{\pi /4} x^p \tan^n x\; dx, \end{equation*} The work reveals a connection of this parametric integral with Catalan numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Schubert variety of a pair of linear subspaces in $\mathbf{C}^n$ and the external activity complex of a pair of not necessarily realizable matroids. Both of these generalize constructions of Ardila et al., which occur when one of the linear spaces is one-dimensional. We prove that our external activity complex is Cohen-Macaulay and deduce a formula for its $K$-polynomial in terms of exterior powers of the dual tautological quotient classes of matroids. As a consequence, we deduce a non-negative formula for the matroid invariant $\omega(M)$ of Fink, Shaw, and Speyer in terms of certain homology groups of links within an external activity complex, proving the 2008 tropical $f$-vector conjecture of Speyer.</description>

      <title>Partitions of planar (oriented) graphs into a connected acyclic and an independent set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A question at the intersection of Barnette's Hamiltonicity and Neumann-Lara's dicoloring conjecture is: Can every Eulerian oriented planar graph be vertex-partitioned into two acyclic sets? A CAI-partition of an undirected/oriented graph is a partition into a tree/connected acyclic subgraph and an independent set. Consider any plane Eulerian oriented triangulation together with its unique tripartition, i.e. partition into three independent sets. If two of these three sets induce a subgraph G that has a CAI-partition, then the above question has a positive answer. We show that if G is subcubic, then it has a CAI-partition, i.e. oriented planar bipartite subcubic 2-vertex-connected graphs admit CAI-partitions. We also show that series-parallel 2-vertex-connected graphs admit CAI-partitions. Finally, we present a Eulerian oriented triangulation such that no two sets of its tripartition induce a graph with a CAI-partition. This generalizes a result of Alt, Payne, Schmidt, and Wood to the oriented setting.</description>

      <title>Completely independent spanning trees in the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say two spanning trees of a graph are completely independent if their edge sets are disjoint, and for each pair of vertices, the paths between them in each spanning tree do not have any other vertex in common. Pai and Chang constructed two such spanning trees in the hypercube $Q_n$ for sufficiently large $n$, while Kandekar and Mane recently showed there are $3$ pairwise completely independent spanning trees in hypercubes $Q_n$ for sufficiently large $n$. We prove that for each $k$, there exist $k$ completely independent spanning trees in $Q_n$ for sufficiently large $n$. In fact, we show that there are $(\frac{1}{12}+o(1))n$ spanning trees in $Q_n$, each with diameter $(2+o(1))n$. As the minimal diameter of any spanning tree of $Q_n$ is $2n-1$, this diameter is asymptotically optimal. We prove a similar result for the powers $H^n$ of any fixed graph $H$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extremal eigenvalues including maximum eigenvalues and the minimum eigenvalues about outerplanar graphs are investigated in this paper. Some structural characterizations about the (edge) maximal bipartite outerplanar graphs are represented. With these characterizations, among all bipartite outerplanar graphs of order $n\geq 55$, the maximum spectral radius is completely determined, and moreover, among all general outerplanar graphs of order $n\geq 55$, the minimum least eigenvalue is completely determined.</description>

      <title>The Frankl-Pach upper bound is not tight for any uniformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any positive integers $n\ge d+1\ge 3$, what is the maximum size of a $(d+1)$-uniform set system in $[n]$ with VC-dimension at most $d$? In 1984, Frankl and Pach initiated the study of this fundamental problem and provided an upper bound $\binom{n}{d}$ via an elegant algebraic proof. Surprisingly, in 2007, Mubayi and Zhao showed that when $n$ is sufficiently large and $d$ is a prime power, the Frankl-Pach upper bound is not tight. They also remarked that their method requires $d$ to be a prime power, and asked for new ideas to improve the Frankl-Pach upper bound without extra assumptions on $n$ and $d$.
  In this paper, we provide an improvement for any $d\ge 2$ and $n\ge 2d+2$, which demonstrates that the long-standing Frankl-Pach upper bound $\binom{n}{d}$ is not tight for any uniformity. Our proof combines a simple yet powerful polynomial method and structural analysis.</description>

      <title>The Erd\H{o}s unit distance problem for small point sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve the best known upper bound on the number of edges in a unit-distance graph on $n$ vertices for each $n\in\{15,\ldots,30\}$. When $n\leq 21$, our bounds match the best known lower bounds, and we fully enumerate the densest unit-distance graphs in these cases.
  On the combinatorial side, our principle technique is to more efficiently generate $\mathcal{F}$-free graphs for a set of forbidden subgraphs $\mathcal{F}$. On the algebraic side, we are able to determine programmatically whether many graphs are unit-distance, using a custom embedder that is more efficient in practice than tools such as cylindrical algebraic decomposition.</description>

      <title>On vertex-transitive distance-regular covers of complete graphs with an extremal smallest eigenvalue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the study of abelian (in the sense defined by Godsil and Hensel) distance-regular $r$-covers of the complete graphs $K_n$. According to the construction by Coutinho, Godsil, Shirazi, and Zhan (2016), each such cover yields an equiangular set of lines of size $n$ that attains the relative bound. Moreover, there are four families of abelian covers that, through this construction, yield sets of lines attaining the absolute bound. All known representatives of these families -- the hexagon, the icosahedron graph, Taylor extensions of the Schl\"afli and McLaughlin graphs together with their distance-$2$ graphs, and three other examples arising from generalized quadrangles -- have a vertex-transitive automorphism group with at most two orbits on the arc set of the cover. We aim to classify the covers from these families under the condition that the automorphism group of the cover is vertex-transitive and has at most two orbits on its arc set, which holds precisely when this group induces a transitive permutation group of rank at most $3$ on the set of cover fibres. We apply several fundamental classification results on permutation groups of rank at most $3$ to describe the family of covers for which $r$ is odd and the smallest eigenvalue is extremal, equaling $-\sqrt{\sqrt{n}+1}$, which corresponds to lines in a complex Hilbert space. The results obtained encompass cases where the automorphism group of the cover induces a primitive or imprimitive group of rank at most $3$ on the set of fibres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shallow permutations are those that satisfy the lower bound of the Diaconis-Graham inequality. It is well-known that shallow permutations avoiding 321 satisfy both the upper and lower bound of this inequality, and exhibit many other interesting properties. Motivated by this connection between shallow permutations and pattern avoidance, we investigate shallow permutations which avoid $\sigma$ for $\sigma \in {\mathcal{S}}_3$. We start by investigating the structure of shallow permutations, and then use these results to enumerate shallow permutations avoiding patterns of length 3. We additionally enumerate pattern-avoiding shallow permutations by number of descents, and enumerate those that exhibit certain symmetries.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian polynomials and the incidence geometry of tropical linear spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of Lorentzian proper position in close analogy to proper position of stable polynomials. Using this notion, we give a new characterization of elementary quotients of M-convex function that parallels the Lorentzian characterization of M-convex functions. We thereby use Lorentzian proper position to study the incidence geometry of tropical linear spaces, and vice versa. In particular, we prove new structural results on the moduli space of codimension-1 tropical linear subspaces of a given tropical linear space and show that it is tropically convex.
  Applying these results, we show that some properties of classical linear incidence geometry fail for tropical linear spaces. For instance, we show that the poset of all matroids on $[n]$, partially ordered by matroid quotient, is not submodular when $n\geq 8$. On the other hand, we introduce a notion of adjoints for tropical linear spaces, generalizing adjoints of matroids, and show that certain incidence properties expected from classical geometry hold for tropical linear spaces that have adjoints.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hiring problem where a sequence of applicants is sequentially interviewed, and a decision on whether to hire an applicant is immediately made based on the applicant's score. For the maximal and average improvement strategies, the decision depends on the applicant's score and the scores of all employees, i.e., previous successful applicants. For local improvement strategies, an interviewing committee randomly chosen for each applicant makes the decision depending on the score of the applicant and the scores of the members of the committee. These idealized hiring strategies capture the challenges of decision-making under uncertainty. We probe the average score of the best employee, the probability of hiring all first $N$ applicants, the fraction of superior companies in which, throughout the evolution, every hired applicant has a score above expected, etc.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Positive Definite Matrices over Symmetrized Tropical Algebras and Valued Ordered fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of positive definite and positive semi-definite symmetric matrices within the framework of symmetrized tropical algebra, an extension of tropical algebra adapted to ordered valued fields.
  We focus on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices. We prove that the eigenvalues of a positive (semi)-definite matrix in the tropical symmetrized setting coincide with its diagonal entries. Then, we show that the images by the valuation of the eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix over a valued nonarchimedean ordered field coincide with the eigenvalues of an associated matrix in the symmetrized tropical algebra. Moreover, under a genericity condition, we characterize the images of the eigenvectors under the map keeping track both of the nonarchimedean valuation and sign, showing that they coincide with tropical eigenvectors in the symmetrized algebra.
  These results offer new insights into the spectral theory of matrices over tropical semirings, and provide combinatorial formulas for log-limits of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of parametric families of real positive definite matrices.</description>

      <title>A Diagrammatic Approach to Improve Computational Efficiency in Group Equivariant Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group equivariant neural networks are growing in importance owing to their ability to generalise well in applications where the data has known underlying symmetries. Recent characterisations of a class of these networks that use high-order tensor power spaces as their layers suggest that they have significant potential; however, their implementation remains challenging owing to the prohibitively expensive nature of the computations that are involved. In this work, we present a fast matrix multiplication algorithm for any equivariant weight matrix that maps between tensor power layer spaces in these networks for four groups: the symmetric, orthogonal, special orthogonal, and symplectic groups. We obtain this algorithm by developing a diagrammatic framework based on category theory that enables us to not only express each weight matrix as a linear combination of diagrams but also makes it possible for us to use these diagrams to factor the original computation into a series of steps that are optimal. We show that this algorithm improves the Big-$O$ time complexity exponentially in comparison to a na\"{i}ve matrix multiplication.</description>

      <title>Fourier growth of degree $2$ polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove bounds for the absolute sum of all level-$k$ Fourier coefficients for $(-1)^{p(x)}$, where polynomial $p:\mathbf{F}_2^n \to \mathbf{F}_2$ is of degree $\le 2$. First we prove the bound
  $\lesssim (1+\sqrt{2})^k$. Then, by a different method, we make it sharp: $\lesssim k^{-1/2} (1+\sqrt{2})^k$.</description>

      <title>Galois orbits of torsion points over polytopes near atoral sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an essentially atoral Laurent polynomial $P$, we show an equidistribution theorem for the function $\operatorname{log}|P|$ on specific subsets of Galois orbits of torsion points of the $d$-dimensional algebraic torus $\mathbb{G}^d_m(\overline{\mathbb{Q}})$. The specific subsets under consideration are the preimages of $d$-dimensional polytopes within the hypercube $[0,1]^d$ under the cotropicalization map. This generalises an equidistribution theorem of V. Dimitrov and P. Habegger, who considered only all Galois orbits that correspond to the entire hypercube $[0,1]^d$. In addition, we provide an estimate for the convergence speed of this equidistribution, expressed as a negative power of the strictness degree. Our approach is to derive an alternative version of Koksma's inequality over polytopes.
  As an application, we provide the convergence speed of heights on a sequence of projective points for a specific two-dimensional example, answering a question posed by R. Gualdi and M. Sombra. In the appendix, we present an algorithm to compute the explicit value of the power of the strictness degree.</description>

      <title>An arithmetic algebraic regularity lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an 'arithmetic regularity lemma' for groups definable in finite fields, analogous to Tao's 'algebraic regularity lemma' for graphs definable in finite fields. More specifically, we show that, for any $M&gt;0$, any finite field $\mathbf{F}$, and any definable group $(G,\cdot)$ in $\mathbf{F}$ and definable subset $D\subseteq G$, each of complexity at most $M$, there is a normal definable subgroup $H\leqslant G$, of index and complexity $O_M(1)$, such that the following holds: for any cosets $V,W$ of $H$, the bipartite graph $(V,W,xy^{-1}\in D)$ is $O_M(|\mathbf{F}|^{-1/2})$-quasirandom. Various analogous regularity conditions follow; for example, for any $g\in G$, the Fourier coefficient $||\widehat{1}_{H\cap Dg}(\pi)||_{\mathrm{op}}$ is $O_M(|\mathbf{F}|^{-1/8})$ for every non-trivial irreducible representation $\pi$ of $H$.</description>

      <title>Cyclic polytopes through the lens of iterated integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The volume of a cyclic polytope can be obtained by forming an iterated integral, known as the path signature, along a suitable piecewise linear path running through its edges. Different choices of such a path are related by the action of a subgroup of the combinatorial automorphisms of the polytope. Motivated by this observation, we look for other polynomials in the vertices of a cyclic polytope that arise as path signatures and are invariant under the subgroup action. We prove that there are infinitely many such invariants which are algebraically independent in the shuffle algebra.</description>

Abstract: Paul Erd\H{o}s and R. Daniel Mauldin asked a series of questions on certain types of polygons of area $1$, the vertices of which can be found in every planar set of infinite Lebesgue measure. We address two of these questions, one on cyclic quadrilaterals and the other on convex polygons with congruent sides, with respectively positive and negative answers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1607.04144v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exposition on the Fuss--Catalan numbers, which are a generalization of the well known Catalan numbers. The literature on the subject is scattered (especially for the case of multiple independent parameters, as will be explained in the text), with overlapping definitions by different authors and duplication of proofs. This paper collects the main theorems and identities, with a consistent notation. Contact is made with the works of numerous authors, including the early works of Lambert and Euler. We demonstrate the application of the formalism to solve algebraic equations by infinite series. Our main result in this context is a new necessary and sufficient formula for the domain of absolute convergence of the series solutions of algebraic equations, which corrects and extends previous work in the field. Some historical material is placed in an Appendix.</description>

      <title>The Undirected Optical Indices of Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:1808.09256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a connected graph $G$, an instance $I$ is a set of pairs of vertices and a corresponding routing $R$ is a set of paths specified for all vertex-pairs in $I$. Let $\mathfrak{R}_I$ be the collection of all routings with respect to $I$. The undirected optical index of $G$ with respect to $I$ refers to the minimum integer $k$ to guarantee the existence of a mapping $\phi:R\to\{1,2,\ldots,k\}$, such that $\phi(P)\neq\phi(P')$ if $P$ and $P'$ have common edge(s), over all routings $R\in\mathfrak{R}_I$. A natural lower bound of the undirected optical index is the edge-forwarding index, which is defined to be the minimum of the maximum edge-load over all possible routings. Let $w(G,I)$ and $\pi(G,I)$ denote the undirected optical index and edge-forwarding index with respect to $I$, respectively. In this paper, we derive the inequality $w(T,I_A)&lt;\frac{3}{2}\pi(T,I_A)$ for any tree $T$, where $I_A:=\{\{x,y\}:\,x,y\in V(T)\}$ is the all-to-all instance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the Wiener-entropy, which is together with the eccentricity-entropy one of the most natural distance-based graph entropies. By deriving the (asymptotic) extremal behaviour, we conclude that the Wiener-entropy of graphs of a given order is more spread than is the case for the eccentricity-entropy. We solve $3$ conjectures on the eccentricity-entropy and give a conjecture on the Wiener-entropy related to some surprising behaviour on the graph minimizing it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph is reducible if it is the lexicographic product of two smaller non-trivial graphs. It is well-known a 1-planar graph with $n ~(\ge3)$ vertices has at most $4n-8$ edges, and a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices is optimal if $G$ has exactly $4n-8$ edges. In this paper, we characterize the reducibility of optimal 1-planar graphs. This work is motivated by a problem posed by Bucko and Czap in 2015, which concerns determining the 1-planarity of the lexicographic product of a graph and two isolated vertices.</description>

Abstract: For affine Coxeter groups of affine types $\tilde D$ and $\tilde B$, we model the interval $[1,c]_T$ in the absolute order by symmetric noncrossing partitions of an annulus with one or two double points. In type $\tilde B$ (and \emph{almost} in type $\tilde D$), the diagrams also model the larger lattice defined by McCammond and Sulway.</description>

There is no solid proof that presented algorithm is exhaustive or correct, but it produces same results on already known difference families for line lengths $3..6$. Due to calculation-based approach this paper probably won't be published, but will be submitted to arxiv as it contains some new results</description>

      <title>Conditional Non-Soficity of p-adic Deligne Extensions: on a Theorem of Gohla and Thom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long standing problem asks whether every group is sofic, i.e., can be separated by almost-homomorphisms to the symmetric group $Sym(n)$. Similar problems have been asked with respect to almost-homomorphisms to the unitary group $U(n)$, equipped with various norms. One of these problems has been solved for the first time in [De Chiffre, Gelbsky, Lubotzky, Thom, 2020]: some central extensions $\widetilde{\Gamma}$ of arithmetic lattices $\Gamma$ of $Sp(2g,\mathbb{Q}_p)$ were shown to be non-Frobenius approximated by almost homomorphisms to $U(n)$. Right after, it was shown that similar results hold with respect to the $p$-Schatten norms in [Lubotzky, Oppenheim, 2020]. It is natural, and has already been suggested in [Chapman, Lubotzky, 2024] and [Gohla, Thom, 2024], to check whether the $\widetilde{\Gamma}$ are also non-sofic. In order to show that they are (also) non-sofic, it suffices:
  (a) To prove that the permutation Cheeger constant of the simplicial complex underlying $\Gamma$ is positive, generalizing [Evra, Kaufman, 2016]. This would imply that $\Gamma$ is stable.
  (b) To prove that the (flexible) stability of $\Gamma$ implies the non-soficity of $\widetilde{\Gamma}$.
  Clause (b) was proved by Gohla and Thom. Here we offer a more algebraic/combinatorial treatment to their theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of $k$-subsets of an $n$-set. Write $\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{F}}(S;t)=\left\{ F\in\mathcal{F}: \left|F\cap S\right|&lt;t\right\}$ for a set $S$. The family $\mathcal{F}$ is called $s$-almost $t$-intersecting if $\left|\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{F}}(F;t)\right|\leq s$ for any $F\in \mathcal{F}$. In this paper, we prove that $s$-almost $t$-intersecting families with maximum size are $t$-intersecting. We also consider $s$-almost $t$-intersecting families which are not $t$-intersecting, and characterize such families with maximum size.</description>

      <title>The Chirotropical Grassmannian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in particle physics have revealed deep connections between scattering amplitudes and tropical geometry. From the heart of this relationship emerged the chirotropical Grassmannian $\text{Trop}^\chi \text{G}(k,n)$ and the chirotropical Dressian $\text{Dr}^\chi(k,n)$, polyhedral fans built from uniform realizable chirotopes that encode the combinatorial structure of Generalized Feynman Diagrams. We prove that $\text{Trop}^\chi \text{G}(3,n) = \text{Dr}^\chi(3,n)$ for $n = 6,7,8$, and develop algorithms to compute these objects from their rays modulo lineality. Using these algorithms, we compute all chirotropical Grassmannians $\text{Trop}^\chi \text{G}(3,n)$ for $n = 6,7,8$ across all isomorphism classes of chirotopes. We prove that each chirotopal configuration space $X^\chi(3,6)$ is diffeomorphic to a polytope and propose an associated canonical logarithmic differential form. Finally, we show that the equality between chirotropical Grassmannian and Dressian fails for $(k,n) = (4,8)$.</description>

In 2022, Nagel posed a generalisation of this problem, suggesting that the $k$th most popular element in a union-closed set family must be contained in at least $\frac{1}{2^{k-1} + 1} |\mathcal{F}|$ sets.
  We combine the entropic method of Gilmer with the combinatorial arguments of Knill to show that this is indeed the case for all $k \ge 3$, and when $k = 2$ and either $|\mathcal{F}| \le 44$ or $|\mathcal{F}| \ge 114$, and characterise the families that achieve equality.
  Furthermore, we show that when $|\mathcal{F}| \to \infty$, the $k$th most frequent element will appear in at least $\left( \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - o(1) \right) |\mathcal{F}|$ sets, reflecting the recent progress made for the Union-Closed Set Conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Kazhdan and Lusztig introduce the $W$-graphs to describe the cells and molecules corresponding to the Coxeter groups. Building on this foundation, Lusztig defines the a-funtion to classify the cells, as well as the molecules. Marberg then generalizes Kazhdan and Lusztig's $W$-graphs, using fixed-point-free involutions as their indices. The molecules of the two new $S_n$-graphs are then classified via two correspondence similar to RSK correspondence by Marberg and me. In this paper, we define an analogue of the Lusztig a-function and finish the classification of cells by proving that every molecule in the $S_n$-graphs is indeed a cell.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Environment Seen from Geodesics in Exponential Last-Passage Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.05242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A well-known question in planar first-passage percolation concerns the convergence of the empirical distribution of weights as seen along geodesics. We demonstrate this convergence for an explicit model, directed last-passage percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with i.i.d. exponential weights, and provide explicit formulae for the limiting distributions, which depend on the asymptotic direction. For example, for geodesics in the direction of the diagonal, the limiting weight distribution has density $(1/4+x/2+x^2/8)e^{-x}$, and so is a mixture of Gamma($1,1$), Gamma($2,1$) and Gamma($3,1$) distributions with weights $1/4$, $1/2$, and $1/4$ respectively. More generally, we study the local environment as seen from vertices along geodesics (including information about the shape of the path and about the weights on and off the path in a local neighborhood). We consider finite geodesics from $(0,0)$ to $n\boldsymbol{\rho}$ for some vector $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ in the first quadrant, in the limit as $n\to\infty$, as well as semi-infinite geodesics in direction $\boldsymbol{\rho}$. We show almost sure convergence of the empirical distributions of the environments along these geodesics, as well as convergence of the distributions of the environment around a typical point in these geodesics, to the same limiting distribution, for which we give an explicit description.
  We make extensive use of a correspondence with TASEP as seen from an isolated second-class particle for which we prove new results concerning ergodicity and convergence to equilibrium. Our analysis relies on geometric arguments involving estimates for last-passage times, available from the integrable probability literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we combine sums of squares (SOS) and sums of nonnegative circuit (SONC) forms, two independent nonnegativity certificates for real homogeneous polynomials. We consider the convex cone SOS+SONC of forms that decompose into a sum of an SOS and a SONC form and study it from a geometric point of view. We show that the SOS+SONC cone is proper and neither closed under multiplications nor under linear transformation of variables. Moreover, we present an alternative proof of an analog of Hilbert's 1888 Theorem for the SOS+SONC cone and prove that in the non-Hilbert cases it provides a proper superset of both the SOS and the SONC cone. This follows by exploiting a new necessary condition for membership in the SONC cone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the upper seminormal crystal structure for the $\mu$-supported $\delta$-vectors for any quiver with potential with reachable frozen vertices, or equivalently for the tropical points of the corresponding cluster $\mc{X}$-variety. We show that the crystal structure can be algebraically lifted to the generic basis of the upper cluster algebra. This can be viewed as an additive categorification of the crystal structure arising from cluster algebras. We introduce the biperfect bases in the cluster algebra setting and give a description of all biperfect bases, which are parametrized by lattice points in a product of polyhedral sets. We illustrate this theory from classical examples and new examples.</description>

      <title>Neighbour Sum Patterns : Chessboards to Toroidal Worlds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say that a chessboard filled with integer entries satisfies the neighbour-sum property if the number appearing on each cell is the sum of entries in its neighbouring cells, where neighbours are cells sharing a common edge or vertex. We show that an $n\times n$ chessboard satisfies this property if and only if $n\equiv 5\pmod 6$. Existence of solutions is further investigated of rectangular, toroidal boards, as well as on Neumann neighbourhoods, including a nice connection to discrete harmonic functions. Construction of solutions on infinite boards are also presented. Finally, answers to three dimensional analogues of these boards are explored using properties of cyclotomic polynomials and relevant ideas conjectured.</description>

      <title>The partition algebra and the plethysm coefficients II: ramified plethysm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The plethysm coefficient $p(\nu, \mu, \lambda)$ is the multiplicity of the Schur function $s_\lambda$ in the plethysm product $s_\nu \circ s_\mu$. In this paper we use Schur--Weyl duality between wreath products of symmetric groups and the ramified partition algebra to interpret an arbitrary plethysm coefficient as the multiplicity of an appropriate composition factor in the restriction of a module for the ramified partition algebra to the partition algebra. This result implies new stability phenomenon for plethysm coefficients when the first parts of $\nu$, $\mu$ and $\lambda$ are all large. In particular, it gives the first positive formula in the case when $\nu$ and $\lambda$ are arbitrary and $\mu$ has one part. Corollaries include new explicit positive formulae and combinatorial interpretations for the plethysm coefficients $p((n-b,b), (m), (mn-r,r))$, and $p((n-b,1^b), (m), (mn-r,r))$ when $m$ and $n$ are large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A connected graph is called \emph{geodetic} if there is a unique geodesic between each pair of vertices. In this paper we prove that if a finitely generated group admits a Cayley graph which is geodetic, then the group must be virtually free. Before now, it was open whether finitely generated and geodetic implied hyperbolic. In fact we prove something more general: if a quasi-transitive locally finite connected undirected graph is geodetic then it is quasi-isometric to a tree. Our main tool is to define a \emph{boundary} of a graph and understand how the local behaviour influences it when the graph is geodetic. Our results unify, and represent significant progress on, research initiated by Ore, Shapiro, and Madlener and Otto.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2022, using methods from ergodic theory, Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson resolved a longstanding conjecture of Erd\H{o}s about sumsets in large subsets of the natural numbers. In this paper, we extend this result to several important classes of amenable groups, including all finitely generated virtually nilpotent groups, and all abelian groups $(G,+)$ with the property that the subgroup $2G := \{g+g : g\in G\}$ has finite index. We prove that in any group $G$ from the above classes, any $A\subset G$ with positive upper Banach density contains a shifted product set of the form $\{tb_ib_j\colon i&lt;j\}$, for some infinite sequence $(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ and some $t\in G$. In fact, we show this result for all amenable groups that posses a property which we call square absolute continuity. Our results provide answers to several questions and conjectures posed in a recent survey of Kra, Moreira, Richter and Robertson.</description>

      <title>On Covering Simplices by Dilations in Dimensions 3 and 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a conjecture regarding the integrally closedness of lattice polytopes with large lattice lengths. We demonstrate that a lattice simplex in dimension 3 (resp. 4) with lattice length of at least 2 (resp. 3 and no edge has lattice length 5) can be covered by dilated simplices of the form $sQ$, where integer $s\ge 2$ (resp. 3) and $Q$ is a lattice simplex. The covering property implies these simplices are integrally closed. As an application, we obtain a simple criterion for the projective normality of ample line bundles on 3-(resp. 4-) dimensional $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial toric Fano varieties with Picard number one. Along the way, we discover certain unexpected phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: A set of points with finite density is constructed in $\mathbb{R}^d$, with $d\geq2$, by adding points to a Poisson process such that any line segment of length $O\left(\varepsilon^{-(d-1)}\ln\varepsilon^{-1}\right)$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ will contain one of the points of the set within distance $\varepsilon$ of it. The constant implied by the big-$O$ notation depends on the dimension only.</description>

      <title>Optimal Constant-Weight and Mixed-Weight Conflict-Avoiding Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A conflict-avoiding code (CAC) is a deterministic transmission scheme for asynchronous multiple access without feedback. When the number of simultaneously active users is less than or equal to $w$, a CAC of length $L$ with weight $w$ can provide a hard guarantee that each active user has at least one successful transmission within every consecutive $L$ slots. In this paper, we generalize some previously known constructions of constant-weight CACs, and then derive several classes of optimal CACs by the help of Kneser's Theorem and some techniques in Additive Combinatorics. Another spotlight of this paper is to relax the identical-weight constraint in prior studies to study mixed-weight CACs for the first time, for the purpose of increasing the throughput and reducing the access delay of some potential users with higher priority. As applications of those obtained optimal CACs, we derive some classes of optimal mixed-weight CACs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For each simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of simply-laced type, Hernandez and Leclerc introduced a certain category $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ of finite-dimensional representations of the quantum affine algebra of $\mathfrak{g}$, as well as certain subcategories $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{\leq \xi}$ depending on a choice of height function adapted to an orientation of the Dynkin graph of $\mathfrak{g}$. In our previous work we constructed an algebra homomorphism $\widetilde{D}_{\xi}$ whose domain contains the image of the Grothendieck ring of $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{\leq \xi}$ under the truncated $q$-character morphism $\widetilde{\chi}_q$ corresponding to $\xi$. We exhibited a close relationship between the composition of $\widetilde{D}_{\xi}$ with $\widetilde{\chi}_q$ and the morphism $\overline{D}$ recently introduced by Baumann, Kamnitzer and Knutson in their study of the equivariant homology of Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen cycles. In this paper, we extend $\widetilde{D}_{\xi}$ in order to investigate its composition with Frenkel-Reshetikhin's original $q$-character morphism. Our main result consists in proving that the $q$-characters of all standard modules in $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ lie in the kernel of $\widetilde{D}_{\xi}$. This provides a large family of new non-trivial rational identities suggesting possible geometric interpretations.</description>

Abstract: Any semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ of stochastic matrices induces a semigroup majorization relation $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$ on the set $\Delta_{n-1}$ of probability $n$-vectors. Pick $X,Y$ at random in $\Delta_{n-1}$: what is the probability that $X$ and $Y$ are comparable under $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$? We review recent asymptotic ($n\to\infty$) results and conjectures in the case of majorization relation (when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of doubly stochastic matrices), discuss natural generalisations, and prove a new asymptotic result in the case of majorization, and new exact finite-$n$ formulae in the case of UT-majorization relation, i.e. when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of upper-triangular stochastic matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the edge limit of Gaussian/Laguerre Beta ensembles is given by Airy($\beta$) point process. We prove an universality result that this also holds for a general class of additions of Gaussian and Laguerre ensembles. In order to make sense of $\beta$-addition, we introduce type A Bessel function as the characteristic function of our matrix ensemble following the line of Gorin-Marcus, Benaych Georges-Cuenca-Gorin. Then we extract its moment information through the action of Dunkl operators, a class of differential operators originated from special function theory. We do the action explicitly on the Bessel generating functions of our additions, and after the asymptotic analysis, we obtain certain limiting functional in terms of conditional Brownian bridges of the Laplace transform of Airy($\beta$), which is universal up to proper rescaling among all our additions.</description>

Abstract: We define a combinatorial object that can be associated with any conic-line arrangement with ordinary singularities, which we call the combinatorial Poincar\'e polynomial. We prove a Terao-type factorization statement on the splitting of such a polynomial over the rationals under the assumption that our conic-line arrangements are free and admit ordinary quasi-homogeneous singularities. Then we focus on the so-called $d$-arrangements in the plane. In particular, we provide a combinatorial constraint for free $d$-arrangements admitting ordinary quasi-homogeneous singularities.</description>
