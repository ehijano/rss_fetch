      <title>On the perceptions of empirical randomness of an experiment: Extending the Golden Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, Bernoulli's Law of Large Numbers, also known as the Golden theorem, has been extended to study the relations between empirical probability and empirical randomness of an otherwise random experiment. Using the example of a coin toss and a dice role, some interesting results are drawn. Analytically and using numerical computations, empirical randomness of each outcome has been shown to increase by \textit{ chance}, which itself depends on the growth rate of empirical probabilities. The analyses presented in this work, apart form depicting the nature of flow of random experiments in repetitions, also present dynamical behaviours of the random experiment, and experimental and simulation-based verifications of the mathematical analyses. It also presents an appreciation of the beauty of Bernoulli's Golden theorem and its applications by extension.</description>

      <title>Isolating Unisolated Upsilons with Anomaly Detection in CMS Open Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first study of anti-isolated Upsilon decays to two muons ($\Upsilon \to \mu^+ \mu^-$) in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Using a machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection strategy, we "rediscover" the $\Upsilon$ in 13 TeV CMS Open Data from 2016, despite overwhelming anti-isolated backgrounds. We elevate the signal significance to $6.4 \sigma$ using these methods, starting from $1.6 \sigma$ using the dimuon mass spectrum alone. Moreover, we demonstrate improved sensitivity from using an ML-based estimate of the multi-feature likelihood compared to traditional "cut-and-count" methods. Our work demonstrates that it is possible and practical to find real signals in experimental collider data using ML-based anomaly detection, and we distill a readily-accessible benchmark dataset from the CMS Open Data to facilitate future anomaly detection developments.</description>

      <title>Causality Analysis of COVID-19 Induced Crashes in Stock and Commodity Markets: A Topological Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a comprehensive causality analysis of the US stock and commodity markets during the COVID-19 crash. The dynamics of different sectors are also compared. We use Topological Data Analysis (TDA) on multidimensional time-series to identify crashes in stock and commodity markets. The Wasserstein Distance WD shows distinct spikes signaling the crash for both stock and commodity markets. We then compare the persistence diagrams of stock and commodity markets using the WD metric. A significant spike in the $WD$ between stock and commodity markets is observed during the crisis, suggesting significant topological differences between the markets. Similar spikes are observed between the sectors of the US market as well. Spikes obtained may be due to either a difference in the magnitude of crashes in the two markets (or sectors), or from the temporal lag between the two markets suggesting information flow. We study the Granger-causality between stock and commodity markets and also between different sectors. The results show a bidirectional Granger-causality between commodity and stock during the crash period, demonstrating the greater interdependence of financial markets during the crash. However, the overall analysis shows that the causal direction is from stock to commodity. A pairwise Granger-causal analysis between US sectors is also conducted. There is a significant increase in the interdependence between the sectors during the crash period. TDA combined with Granger-causality effectively analyzes the interdependence and sensitivity of different markets and sectors.</description>

      <title>Random walks with homotopic spatial inhomogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study a generalization of the standard random walk, an homotopic random walk (HRW), using a deformed translation unitary step that arises from a homotopy of the position-dependent masses associated to the Tsallis and Kaniadakis nonexensive statistics. The HRW implies an associated homotopic Fokker-Planck equation (HFPE) provided with a bi-parameterized inhomogeneous diffusion. The trajectories of the HRW exhibit convergence to a position, randomness as well as divergence, according to deformation and homotopic parameters. The HFPE obtained from associated master equation to the HRW presents the features: a) it results an special case of the van Kampen diffusion equation (5) of Ref. [N. G. van Kampen, \emph{Z. Phys. B Condensed Matter} \textbf{68}, 135 (1987)]; b) it exhibits a superdiffusion in function of deformation and homotopic parameters; c) Tsallis and Kaniadakis deformed FPE are recovered as special cases; d) a homotopic mixtured diffusion is observed; and e) it has a stationary entropic density, characterizing a inhomogeneous screening of the medium, obtained from a homotopic version of the H-Theorem.</description>

      <title>On the role of symmetry and geometry in global quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global sensing enables parameter estimation across arbitrary parameter ranges with a finite number of shots. While various formulations exist, the Bayesian paradigm offers a flexible approach to optimal protocol design under minimal assumptions. However, there are several sets of assumptions capturing the notions of prior ignorance and uninformed estimation, leading to two main approaches: invariance of the prior distribution under specific parameter transformations, and adherence to the geometry of a state space. While the first approach often leads to simpler priors and estimators and is more broadly applicable in adaptive settings, the second can lead to faster posterior convergence in a well-defined measurement setting. We examine the practical consequences of both approaches and show how to apply them in examples of rate and coherence estimation in noisy scenarios. More importantly, by employing the notion of location-isomorphic parameters, we unify the two approaches into a practical and versatile framework for optimal global quantum sensing, detailing when and how each set of assumptions should be employed - a blueprint for the design of quantum sensors.</description>
