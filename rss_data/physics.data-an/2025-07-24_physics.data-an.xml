      <title>Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD): An Informational Ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05979v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics has transformed our understanding of reality, yet deep philosophical puzzles remain unresolved. Is there a consistent way to describe quantum measurement, the emergence of space and time, and the role of observers within one coherent ontology? This paper introduces Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD), an interpretation that places relationships and information, not isolated objects, at the foundation of physics. Unlike traditional views, such as the Copenhagen interpretation, Everett's many-worlds theory, or hidden-variable approaches, RQD denies a single observer-independent reality, instead proposing that facts only become definite within specific observational contexts. It explicitly addresses foundational no-go results, including Bell's theorem, the Kochen-Specker theorem, and the Frauchiger-Renner paradox, by replacing absolute facts with relational, context-dependent truths. RQD rests on five interlocking principles: (1) quantum states are contextual and observer-relative, (2) time emerges from quantum interactions rather than existing as an external parameter, (3) space is constructed from patterns of quantum entanglement, (4) observers emerge as systems with highly integrated information, and (5) classical reality appears through quantum decoherence without special wavefunction collapse. Philosophically, RQD aligns with ontic structural realism, proposing that the fundamental ontology of the universe consists entirely of informational relations. It avoids collapsing into relativism or solipsism by ensuring intersubjective agreement through physical interactions. Ultimately, RQD may offer a unified picture in which quantum mechanics, spacetime, and observers are no longer separate domains but aspects of one interconnected informational web.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Frontiers of kNN Noisy Feature Detection and Recovery for Self-Driving Labs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) have shown promise to accelerate materials discovery by integrating machine learning with automated experimental platforms. However, errors in the capture of input parameters may corrupt the features used to model system performance, compromising current and future campaigns. This study develops an automated workflow to systematically detect noisy features, determine sample-feature pairings that can be corrected, and finally recover the correct feature values. A systematic study is then performed to examine how dataset size, noise intensity, and feature value distribution affect both the detectability and recoverability of noisy features. In general, high-intensity noise and large training datasets are conducive to the detection and correction of noisy features. Low-intensity noise reduces detection and recovery but can be compensated for by larger clean training data sets. Detection and correction results vary between features with continuous and dispersed feature distributions showing greater recoverability compared to features with discrete or narrow distributions. This systematic study not only demonstrates a model agnostic framework for rational data recovery in the presence of noise, limited data, and differing feature distributions but also provides a tangible benchmark of kNN imputation in materials data sets. Ultimately, it aims to enhance data quality and experimental precision in automated materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Restricted Boltzmann machine as a probabilistic Enigma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a symmetric encryption scheme based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines that functions as a probabilistic Enigma device, encoding information in the marginal distributions of visible states while utilizing bias permutations as cryptographic keys. Theoretical analysis reveals significant advantages including factorial key space growth through permutation matrices, excellent diffusion properties, and computational complexity rooted in sharp P-complete problems that resist quantum attacks. Compatible with emerging probabilistic computing hardware, the scheme establishes an asymmetric computational barrier where legitimate users decrypt efficiently while adversaries face exponential costs. This framework unlocks probabilistic computers' potential for cryptographic systems, offering an emerging encryption paradigm between classical and quantum regimes for post-quantum security.</description>

      <title>From Atoms to Dynamics: Learning the Committor Without Collective Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Brief Communication introduces a graph-neural-network architecture built on geometric vector perceptrons to predict the committor function directly from atomic coordinates, bypassing the need for hand-crafted collective variables (CVs). The method offers atom-level interpretability, pinpointing the key atomic players in complex transitions without relying on prior assumptions. Applied across diverse molecular systems, the method accurately infers the committor function and highlights the importance of each heavy atom in the transition mechanism. It also yields precise estimates of the rate constants for the underlying processes. The proposed approach opens new avenues for understanding and modeling complex dynamics, by enabling CV-free learning and automated identification of physically meaningful reaction coordinates of complex molecular processes.</description>

      <title>Correct Estimation of Higher-Order Spectra: From Theoretical Challenges to Practical Multi-Channel Implementation in SignalSnap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order spectra (Brillinger's polyspectra) offer powerful methods for solving critical problems in signal processing and data analysis. Despite their significant potential, their practical use has remained limited due to unresolved mathematical issues in spectral estimation, including the absence of unbiased and consistent estimators and the high computational cost associated with evaluating multidimensional spectra. Consequently, existing tools frequently produce artifacts, no existing software library correctly implements Brillinger's cumulant-based trispectrum, or fail to scale effectively to real-world data volumes, leaving crucial applications like multi-detector spectral analysis largely unexplored. In this paper, we revisit higher-order spectra from a modern perspective, addressing the root causes of their historical underuse. We reformulate higher-order spectral estimation using recently derived multivariate k-statistics, yielding unbiased and consistent estimators that eliminate spurious artifacts and precisely align with Brillinger's theoretical definitions. Our methodology covers single- and multi-channel spectral analysis up to the bispectrum (third order) and trispectrum (fourth order), enabling robust investigations of inter-frequency coupling, non-Gaussian behavior, and time-reversal symmetry breaking. Additionally, we introduce quasi-polyspectra to uncover non-stationary, time-dependent higher-order features. We implement these new estimators in SignalSnap, an open-source GPU-accelerated library capable of efficiently analyzing datasets exceeding hundreds of gigabytes within minutes. In applications such as continuous quantum measurements, SignalSnap's rigorous estimators enable precise quantitative matching between experimental data and theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Optimal Calibration of Qubit Detuning and Crosstalk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing and calibrating physical qubits is essential for maintaining the performance of quantum processors. A key challenge in this process is the presence of crosstalk that complicates the estimation of individual qubit detunings. In this work, we derive optimal strategies for estimating detuning and crosstalk parameters by optimizing Ramsey interference experiments using Fisher information and the Cramer-Rao bound. We compare several calibration protocols, including measurements of a single quadrature at multiple times and of two quadratures at a single time, for a fixed number of total measurements. Our results predict that the latter approach yields the highest precision and robustness in both cases of isolated and coupled qubits. We validate experimentally our approach using a single NV center as well as superconducting transmons. Our approach enables accurate parameter extraction with significantly fewer measurements, resulting in up to a 50% reduction in calibration time while maintaining estimation accuracy.</description>
