      <title>Lie groups in tangent join restriction categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Principal bundles have at least three different definitions, depending on the category of geometric objects studied.
  In Differential Geometry, they are defined as locally trivial projection map of smooth manifolds with an atlas whose transition maps are given by group multiplication. In Topology they are $G$-equivariantly trivial $G$-spaces. In Algebraic Geometry, they are \'Etale locally isotrivial geometric quotients of $G$-varieties.
  The goal of this work is to have a categorical notion that recovers all of them. While they are different structures, they are all locally isomorphic to the Cartesian product of a base space with a group.
  There are a variety of other results on group objects and their tangent bundle. In particular we show that the tangent bundle is the product of the tangent space and the group object and that the tangent space has an external Lie algebra structure, generalizing the correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras.
  In order to give a purely categorical definition of a principal bundle, we formulate this notion in the language of join restriction categories. Restriction categories were developed by Cockett and Lack to generalize partial maps (maps defined only on a subset of the domain) and have since then found applications in mathematics and computer science. Join restriction categories, as described by Guo are restriction categories where local restrictions can be joined to obtain a global map. Together with a manifold construction due to Grandis, that allows us to glue together objects, we can describe principal bundles entirely in the language of join-restriction categories.</description>

      <title>Functor categories, Recollements, Triangular Matrix category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study triangular matrix categories using the theory of recollements of abelian categories. Given a triangular matrix category we construct two canonical recollements. We show that if certain funtors of these recollements are exact then the category appearing in the middle term is actually a triangular matrix category. This result is a generalization of one given by Liping Li in \cite{LipingLi}. We also show that if $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathcal{C})$ admits a nontrivial torsion pair by abelian categories then $\mathcal{C}$ is equivalent to a triangular matrix category.</description>

      <title>Compositional System Dynamics: The Higher Mathematics Underlying System Dynamics Diagrams &amp; Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work establishes a robust mathematical foundation for compositional System Dynamics modeling, leveraging category theory to formalize and enhance the representation, analysis, and composition of system models. Here, System Dynamics diagrams, such as stock &amp; flow diagrams, system structure diagrams, and causal loop diagrams, are formulated as categorical constructs, enabling scalable, transparent, and systematic reasoning. By encoding these diagrams as data using attributed C-sets and utilizing advanced categorical tools like structured cospans, pushouts, pullbacks, and functor mappings, the framework supports modular composition, stratification, and seamless mapping between syntax and semantics.
  The approach underwrites traditional practice with firm mathematical structure, facilitates the identification of certain forms of pathways and feedback loops, the detection of simple patterns within complex diagrams, common structure between diagrams, and structure-preserving mappings between diverse diagram types. Additionally, this framework supports alternative semantics, such as stochastic transition dynamics, extending beyond traditional ordinary differential equation (ODE) representations. Applications in compositional modeling, modularity, and team-based collaboration demonstrate the practical advantages of this advanced framework.
  Future directions include integrating dimensional annotations, supporting hybrid and agent-based modeling paradigms, and expanding the framework's applicability to global and local temporal reasoning through temporal sheaves. By revealing and formalizing the hidden mathematical structure of System Dynamics diagrams, this work empowers practitioners to tackle complex systems with clarity, scalability, and rigor.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Extension of Intuitionistic Linear Logic: The $L_!^S$-Calculus and Its Categorical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the $L_!^S$-calculus, a linear lambda-calculus extended with scalar multiplication and term addition, that acts as a proof language for intuitionistic linear logic (ILL). These algebraic operations enable the direct expression of linearity at the syntactic level, a property not typically available in standard proof-term calculi. Building upon previous work, we develop the $L_!^S$-calculus as an extension of the $L^S$-calculus with the $!$ modality. We prove key meta-theoretical properties--subject reduction, confluence, strong normalisation, and an introduction property--as well as preserve the expressiveness of the original $L^S$-calculus, including the encoding of vectors and matrices, and the correspondence between proof-terms and linear functions. A denotational semantics is provided in the framework of linear categories with biproducts, ensuring a sound and adequate interpretation of the calculus. This work is part of a broader programme aiming to build a measurement-free quantum programming language grounded in linear logic.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Perspective on Braid Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study categories whose objects are the braid representations, i.e. strict monoidal functors $F\colon B\rightarrow Mat$ from the braid category $B$ to the category of matrices $Mat$. Braid representations are equivalent to solutions to the (constant) Yang-Baxter equation. A major part of the contribution here is to introduce, compare, and contrast suitable notions of isomorphism of representations. A significant contribution here is an extensive range of key examples and counterexamples.
  Our approach is mainly motivated by the recent classification of charge conserving Yang-Baxter operators, in which the target $Mat$ is replaced by the subcategory $Match^N$. One objective is to understand from the categorical perspective how the classification was facilitated by this change (with the aim of generalising). Progress is made here by observing that the category of functors $MonFun(B,Mat)$ is itself a monoidal category (Theorem 5.3). In addition, we introduce the notion of sub and quotient objects, proving that an object that is both sub and quotient corresponds to an endomorphism in $MonFun(B,Mat)$ (Theorem 5.18). We also observe that objects with target $Match^N$ always have sub and quotient objects. This monoidal category leads us to consider monoidal subcategories whose objects share a given property, giving rise to a new way to see how group-type and involutive solutions, for example, fit into our framework.
  Another objective is to understand how universal such a restricted target is. Here we give various properties exposing the implications of different choices of equivalence and describe some relationships among them (Theorem 7.18, Theorem 7.9, Conj. 7.19, Conj. 7.22).
  A key result of this paper is Th.2.9, which shows that, in a `sufficiently free' setting including our case, every monoidal functor is equivalent to a strict one.</description>
