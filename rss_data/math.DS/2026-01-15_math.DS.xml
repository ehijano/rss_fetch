      <title>On multidimensional infinite dihedral group extensions of Gibbs Markov maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a local central limit theorem for cocycles associated with a class of non abelian and non compact group extensions of Gibbs Markov maps. This class consists of multidimensional infinite dihedral groups. Unlike in the set up of the random walks on groups, we cannot use the convolution of measures on the group and instead we resort to an approach based on irreducible representations. Depending on the dimension of the group, we obtain either mixing, and thus ergodicity, or dissipativity. Also, we obtain the asymptotics of the first return time of the group extension to the origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We begin development of a method for studying dynamical systems using concepts from computational complexity theory. We associate families of decision problems, called telic problems, to dynamical systems of a certain class. These decision problems formalize finite-time reachability questions for the dynamics with respect to natural coarse-grainings of state space. Our main result shows that complexity-theoretic lower bounds have dynamical consequences: if a system admits a telic problem for which every decider runs in time $2^{\Omega(n)}$, then it must have positive topological entropy. This result and others lead to methods for classifying dynamical systems through proving bounds on the runtime of algorithms solving their associated telic problems, or by constructing polynomial-time reductions between telic problems coming from distinct dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent order spectrum for transitive homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Emergent Order Spectrum $\Omega(x,y)$ is a topological invariant of dynamical systems providing order-types induced by the limit order of order-compatible nested $\varepsilon_n$-chains (with $\varepsilon_n\to 0$) from $x$ to $y$. In this paper, we investigate how rich these spectra can be under natural dynamical hypotheses. For a transitive homeomorphism $f$ on a compact metric space $X$ with $\lvert X\rvert=\mathfrak{c}$, we show that the global spectrum $\Omega_f(X^2)$ is universal at the countable scattered level: every countable scattered order-type together with the order-type of the rationals appear in $\Omega_f(X^2)$. More precisely, there exists a comeagre subset $M\subseteq X^2$ such that, for every $(x,y)\in M$, the individual spectrum $\Omega_f(x,y)$ already realizes all countably infinite scattered order-types; moreover, the order-type of the rationals belongs to $\Omega_f(x,y)$ for every pair $(x,y)\in X^2$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concepts of hypocoercivity and hypocontractivity and their relationship are studied for semi-dissipative continuous-time and discrete-time evolution equations in a Hilbert space setting. New proofs for the characterization of the short-time decay of the solution from the initial value are presented, that in particular characterize the constants in the leading terms of the solution when expanded in time. Maximally coercive/contractive representations of hypocoercive and hypocontractive semi-dissipative systems are presented, as well as the effect of different representations on the error estimates for the numerical solution.</description>

      <title>Learning a Stochastic Differential Equation Model of Tropical Cyclone Intensification from Reanalysis and Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tropical cyclones are dangerous natural hazards, but their hazard is challenging to quantify directly from historical datasets due to limited dataset size and quality. Models of cyclone intensification fill this data gap by simulating huge ensembles of synthetic hurricanes based on estimates of the storm's large scale environment. Both physics-based and statistical/ML intensification models have been developed to tackle this problem, but an open question is: can a physically reasonable and simple physics-style differential equation model of intensification be learned from data? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative by presenting a 10-term cubic stochastic differential equation model of Tropical Cyclone intensification. The model depends on a well-vetted suite of engineered environmental features known to drive intensification and is trained using a high quality dataset of hurricane intensity (IBTrACS) with estimates of the cyclone's large scale environment from a data-assimilated simulation (ERA5 reanalysis), restricted to the Northern Hemisphere. The model generates synthetic intensity series which capture many aspects of historical intensification statistics and hazard estimates in the Northern Hemisphere. Our results show promise that interpretable, physics style models of complex earth system dynamics can be learned using automated system identification techniques.</description>

      <title>Multiple cluster algebra structures for TCD maps I: theoretical framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce triple crossing diagram (TCD) maps, which encode projective configurations of points and lines, as a unified framework for constructions arising in various areas of geometry, such as discrete differential geometry, discrete geometric dynamics and hyperbolic geometry. We define two types of local moves for TCD maps, one of which is governed by the discrete Schwarzian KP (dSKP) equation, and establish their multi-dimensional consistency. We construct two distinct cluster structures on the space of TCD maps, called projective and affine cluster structures, and show that they are related via an operation called section. This framework organizes and unifies a wide range of examples, including Q-nets, Darboux maps, line complexes, T-graphs, t-embeddings, triangulations and geometric discrete integrable systems such as the pentagram map and cross-ratio dynamics, which are further developed in a companion paper and in (arXiv:2108.12692).</description>

      <title>Stability and robustness of a generalized pump-leak model for epithelial cell and lumen volume regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epithelial cells regulate ion concentrations and volume through coordinated membrane pumps, ion channels, and paracellular pathways which can be modeled by classical single-compartment pump-leak equations (PLEs). Many epithelial functions, however, depend on the interaction between a cell and an enclosed luminal space, a geometry that cannot be captured by classical PLEs. To address this, we develop a two-compartment model consisting of an intracellular compartment coupled to a luminal compartment through the apical membrane, with both compartments interfacing an infinite extracellular bath and connected to it through the basolateral membrane and a paracellular pathway. Building on the five-dimensional single-cell PLEs, we formulate a ten-dimensional PLE system for this geometry and derive analytical equilibria and steady-state formulas for both the passive system and the Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) driven active system. We characterize how these equilibria depend on physiologically relevant parameters, analyze local stability across wide parameter ranges, and apply global sensitivity and robustness methods to identify the principal determinants of ion and volume homeostasis. The model reveals fundamental differences between basolateral and apical placement of the NKA, including the onset of luminal volume blow-up when apical potassium recycling is insufficient. More broadly, this framework provides a mathematically tractable and physiologically grounded foundation for studying epithelial transport and for predicting conditions under which pump localization and conductance changes lead to stable function or pathological lumen expansion.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Implicit Lagrange-Poincar\'e Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider reduction of the stochastic Hamilton-Pontryagin principle formulated on the Pontryagin bundle of a manifold $Q$. We prove that a stochastic action invariant under the free and proper action of a Lie group $G$ drops to a reduced variational principle expressed in terms of variables of the Pontryagin bundle of the reduced space $Q/G$, the associated adjoint bundle $\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}:= (Q\times \mathfrak{g})/G$ and its dual bundle $\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}^*$. This provides a stochastic analogue of the deterministic implicit Lagrange-Poincar\'e reduction. The stochastic Euler-Lagrange equations drop to a set of stochastic horizontal and vertical Lagrange-Poincar\'e equations on $T(Q/G)\oplus T^*(Q/G)\oplus\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}\oplus\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}^*$. As examples, we consider stochastic perturbations of the rigid body with a rotor, as well as a Kaluza-Klein description of stochastic perturbations of a charged particle in a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Spectral dynamics for the infinite dihedral group and the lamplighter group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a tuple $A=(A_0,A_1,\cdots,A_n)$ of elements in a Banach algebra $\mathfrak{B}$, its projective (joint) spectrum $p(A)$ is the collection of $z\in \mathbb{P}^n$ such that $A(z)=z_0A_0+z_1A_1+\cdots+z_nA_n$ is not invertible. If $\mathfrak{B}$ is the group $C^*$-algebra for a discrete group $G$ generated by $A_0, A_1,\dots, A_n$ with a representation $\rho$, then $p(A)$ is an invariant of (weak) equivalence for $\rho$. In \cite{BY}, B. Goldberg and R. Yang proved that the Julia set $\mathcal{J}(F)$ of the induced rational map $F$ for the infinite dihedral group $D_\infty$ is the union of the projective spectrum with the extended indeterminacy set. But the extended indeterminacy set $E_F$ is complicated. To obtain a better relationship between the projective spectrum and the Julia set, by replacing $A_\pi(z)=z_0+z_1\pi(a)+z_2\pi(t)$ with the extended pencil $A_\pi(z)=z_0+z_1\pi(a)+z_2\pi(t)+z_3\pi(at)$, where $\pi$ is the Koopman representation, and using the method of operator recursions, we show that $p(A_\pi)=\mathcal{J}(F).$ Further, we study the spectral dynamics for the Lamplighter group $\mathcal{L}$, and prove that $\mathcal{J}(Q)=E_Q$, where $Q$ is the rational map associated with $\mathcal{L}$.</description>

      <title>Nonstationary Markov Partitions and Multidimensional Continued Fraction Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known from results of Sina\u{\i} and Bowen that a hyperbolic toral automorphism admits a Markov partition. Our aim is to generalize this concept to the nonstationary case, i.e., we associate Markov partitions to nonstationary sequences of toral automorphisms. Special emphasis is placed on sequences of toral automorphisms produced by strongly convergent multidimensional continued fraction algorithms. The convergence of the algorithms is expressed in terms of a Pisot type condition which yields hyperbolicity for the nonstationary dynamics with a splitting into two subspaces of dimension 1 and codimension 1, respectively.
  For a multidimensional continued fraction map, we first consider its natural extension, whose orbits are given by bi-infinite sequences of matrices with determinant $\pm 1$. The Pisot type condition allows us to interpret an orbit of this natural extension as an Anosov mapping family, i.e., as a bi-infinite sequence of toral automorphisms with well-defined stable and unstable manifolds. We prove that this Anosov mapping family admits a bi-infinite sequence of explicit nonstationary Markov partitions. To obtain the atoms of the Markov partitions, a combinatorial structure, expressed in terms of symbolic dynamical systems, namely substitutive and $\mathcal{S}$-adic shifts, has to be superimposed on the Anosov mapping family. In particular, the atoms of the Markov partitions are geometric realizations of $\mathcal{S}$-adic shifts, defined by suspensions of so-called $\mathcal{S}$-adic Rauzy fractals.
  These Markov partitions then provide a symbolic model as a nonstationary edge shift for the Anosov mapping family. Restacking of the Markov partition yields a renormalization process that allows us to interpret a multidimensional continued fraction algorithm as a sequence of iteratively induced toral rotations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We illustrate how the recent theory of Spectral Submanifolds (SSM) can capture global bifurcations and complex dynamics in mechanical systems even under delay and spatial discretization. Specifically, we build a parameter-dependent SSM-reduced model that predicts global heteroclinic and local bifurcations in a Furuta pendulum under control with delay, and verify these predictions numerically. Under additional spatial discretization of the digital controller, we also obtain an SSM-reduced model that correctly reproduces a numerically and experimentally observed microchaotic attractor in the system.</description>

      <title>Tipping Point Forecasting in Non-Stationary Dynamics on Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tipping points are abrupt, drastic, and often irreversible changes in the evolution of non-stationary and chaotic dynamical systems. For instance, increased greenhouse gas concentrations are predicted to lead to drastic decreases in low cloud cover, referred to as a climatological tipping point. In this paper, we learn the evolution of such non-stationary dynamical systems using a novel recurrent neural operator (RNO), which learns mappings between function spaces. After training RNO on only the pre-tipping dynamics, we employ it to detect future tipping points using an uncertainty-based approach. In particular, we propose a conformal prediction framework to forecast tipping points by monitoring deviations from physics constraints (such as conserved quantities and partial differential equations), enabling forecasting of these abrupt changes along with a rigorous measure of uncertainty. We illustrate our proposed methodology on non-stationary ordinary and partial differential equations, such as the Lorenz-63 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations. We also apply our methods to forecast a climate tipping point in stratocumulus cloud cover and airfoil wake and stall transitions using only limited knowledge of the governing equations. For the latter, we show that our proposed method zero-shot generalizes to forecasting multiple future tipping points under varying Reynolds numbers. In our experiments, we demonstrate that even partial or approximate physics constraints can be used to accurately forecast future tipping points.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of a kinetic model describing social interactions on a graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the optimal control of a kinetic model describing agents who migrate on a graph and interact within its nodes exchanging a physical quantity. As a prototype model, we consider the spread of an infectious disease on a graph, so that the exchanged quantity is the viral-load. The control, exerted on both the mobility and on the interactions separately, aims at minimising the average macroscopic viral-load.
  We prove that minimising the average viral-load weighted by the mass in each node is the most effective and convenient strategy. We consider two different interactions: in the first one the infection (gain) and the healing (loss) processes happen within the same interaction, while in the second case the infection and healing result from two different processes. With the appropriate controls, we prove that in the first case it is possible to stop the increase of the disease, but paying a very high cost in terms of control, while in the second case it is possible to eradicate the disease. We test numerically the role of each intervention and the interplay between the mobility and the interaction control strategies in each model.</description>

      <title>Attractors for Singular-Degenerate Porous Medium Type Equations Arising in Models for Biofilm Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time behaviour of solutions of a class of singular-degenerate porous medium type equations in bounded domains with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The existence of global attractors is shown under very general assumptions. Assuming, in addition, that solutions are globally H\"older continuous and the reaction terms satisfy a suitable sign condition in the vicinity of the degeneracy, we also prove the existence of an exponential attractor, which, in turn, yields the finite fractal dimension of the global attractor. Moreover, we extend the results for scalar equations to systems where the degenerate equation is coupled to a semilinear reaction-diffusion equation. The study of such systems is motivated by models for biofilm growth.</description>

      <title>The Small-Gain Condition for Infinite Networks Modeled on $\ell^{\infty}$-Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03925v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, attempts have been made to extend nonlinear small-gain theorems for input-to-state stability (ISS) from finite networks to countably infinite networks with finite indegrees. Under specific assumptions about the interconnection gains and the ISS formulation, corresponding infinite-dimensional small-gain results have been proven. However, concerning these assumptions, the results are still too narrow to be considered a full extension of the state-of-the-art for finite networks. We take a step to closing this gap by developing a general technical framework within which the small-gain condition for both finite and infinite networks can be analyzed. This includes a thorough investigation of various monotone operators associated with a network and a specific ISS formulation. Our results extend and generalize the existing theory for finite networks, yield complete characterizations of the small-gain condition for specific ISS formulations, and show which obstacles still have to be overcome to obtain a complete theory for the most general infinite case.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-and $\mathbb{F}_{p}[t]$-fixed points of a discrete dynamical system with applications from arithmetic statistics, III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this follow-up paper, we again inspect a surprising relationship between the set of fixed points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ or $\in \mathbb{Z}_{p}$ or $\in \mathbb{F}_{p}[t]$ and the coefficient $c$, where $K$ is any number field of degree $n &gt; 1$, $p&gt;2$ is any prime, $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ (resp., $\mathbb{F}_{p}[t]$) is the ring of all $p$-adic integers (resp., the ring of all polynomials over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p}$) and $d&gt;2$ is an integer. As before, we again wish to study counting problems which are inspired by advances in arithmetic statistics, and also by Narkiewicz on totally complex $K$-periodic points along with Adam-Fares on $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$-periodic points in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any prime $p\geq 3$ and for any $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$, the average number of distinct fixed points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ (modulo $p\mathbb{Z}_{p}$) is bounded or zero or unbounded as $c\to \infty$ . Motivated further by $\mathbb{F}_{p}(t)$-periodic point-counting result of Benedetto in arithmetic dynamics, we then also find that the average number of fixed points in $\mathbb{F}_{p}[t]$-setting behaves in the same way as in $\mathcal{O}_{K}$-setting. Finally, we then apply here counting and statistical results from arithmetic statistics, and as a result obtain counting and statistical results on irreducible monic ($p$-adic) integer polynomials, number fields and subfields of global function fields arising naturally in our polynomial discrete dynamical settings.</description>

      <title>A simple chaos indicator based on the Lagrangian descriptor difference of neighboring orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a chaos indicator derivable from Lagrangian descriptors (LDs), defined as the difference in LD values between two neighboring trajectories. This difference LD is remarkably easy to implement and interpret, offering a direct and intuitive measure of dynamical behavior. We provide a heuristic argument linking its growth to the regularity or chaoticity due to the underlying initial condition, considering the arclength-based formulation of LDs. To evaluate its effectiveness, we benchmark it against more elaborate LD-based chaos indicators and the Smaller Aligment Index (SALI) using two prototypical systems: the H\'enon-Heiles system and the Chirikov Standard Map. Our results show that, despite its simplicity, the difference LD matches the accuracy of more sophisticated methods, making it a robust and accessible tool for chaos detection in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Sturmian lattices and Aperiodic tile sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an explicit algorithm to construct aperiodic tile sets based on Sturmian words of quadratic slopes. The method works for any quadratic irrational slope, and we can produce infinitely many aperiodic tile sets whose underlying scaling constant is a unit of any real quadratic field. There are two key ingredients in our construction. The first one is ``Sturmian lattices''; an interesting grid structure generated by Sturmian words that emerged in an aperiodic monotile called Smith Turtle. We shall give a classification of Sturmian lattices. The second is the bounded displacement equivalence of Delone sets, which plays a central role in this construction.</description>

      <title>Reversibility in finite-dimensional collapse dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study finite dimensional quantum systems with arbitrary collapse events, establishing, under no-information-erasure conditions, a structural no-go for trajectory-level operational irreversibility. More precisely, we prove that, for every physically admissible selector of the collapse dynamics, there exists a topologically closed, forward-invariant subset of the projective state space on which any two states can be connected with arbitrarily fine Fubini-Study precision and arbitrarily small integrated energetic cost. This shows that the preservation of information along a realized branch of outcomes guarantees islands of quasi-reversibility, while genuine irreversibility requires additional ingredients such as non-compactness or information erasure.
  KEYWORDS: Quantum collapse dynamics; Quasi-reversibility; Chain-recurrence; Information non-erasure.</description>
