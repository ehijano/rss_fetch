      <title>Well-posedness and large time behavior of a size-structured growth-coagulation-fragmentation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to a size-structured growth-coagulation-fragmentation (GCF) equation with a renewal boundary condition are shown for a class of unbounded coagulation and fragmentation kernels. The existence proof is based on a weak compactness framework in the weighted $L^1$-space. This result extends the existence results of Banasiak and Lamb [14] and Ackleh et al. [2,4]. Furthermore, we establish a stability result and derive uniqueness as a direct consequence of it. Moreover, this study explores the large time behavior of weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Large time behavior for a quasilinear diffusion equation with weighted source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large time behavior of general solutions to a class of quasilinear diffusion equations with a weighted source term $$ \partial_tu=\Delta u^m+\varrho(x)u^p, \quad (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^N\times(0,\infty), $$ with $m&gt;1$, $1&lt;p&lt;m$ and suitable functions $\varrho(x)$, is established. More precisely, we consider functions $\varrho\in C(\mathbb{R}^N)$ such that $$ \lim\limits_{|x|\to\infty}(1+|x|)^{-\sigma}\varrho(x)=A\in(0,\infty), $$ with $\sigma\in(\max\{-N,-2\},0)$ such that $L:=\sigma(m-1)+2(p-1)&lt;0$. We show that, for all these choices of $\varrho$, solutions with initial conditions $u_0\in C(\mathbb{R}^N)\cap L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^N)\cap L^r(\mathbb{R}^N)$ for some $r\in[1,\infty)$ are global in time and, if $u_0$ is compactly supported, present the asymptotic behavior $$ \lim\limits_{t\to\infty}t^{-\alpha}\|u(t)-V_*(t)\|_{\infty}=0, $$ where $V_*$ is a suitably rescaled version of the unique compactly supported self-similar solution to the equation with the singular weight $\varrho(x)=|x|^{\sigma}$: $$ U_*(x,t)=t^{\alpha}f_*(|x|t^{-\beta}), \qquad \alpha=-\frac{\sigma+2}{L}, \quad \beta=-\frac{m-p}{L}. $$ This behavior is an interesting example of \emph{asymptotic simplification} for the equation with a regular weight $\varrho(x)$ towards the singular one as $t\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Mathematical analysis of subwavelength resonant acoustic scattering in multi-layered high-contrast structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-layered structures are widely used in the construction of metamaterial devices to realize various cutting-edge waveguide applications. This paper makes several contributions to the mathematical analysis of subwavelength resonances in a structure of $N$-layer nested resonators. Firstly, based on the Dirichlet-to-Neumann approach, we reduce the solution of the acoustic scattering problem to an $N$-dimensional linear system, and derive the optimal asymptotic characterization of subwavelength resonant frequencies in terms of the eigenvalues of an $N\times N$ tridiagonal matrix, which we refer to as the generalized capacitance matrix. Moreover, we provide a modal decomposition formula for the scattered field, as well as a monopole approximation for the far-field pattern of the acoustic wave scattered by the $N$-layer nested resonators. Finally, some numerical results are presented to corroborate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>The $L^p$-boundedness of wave operators for nonhomogeneous fourth-order Schr\"odinger operators in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the $L^p$-boundedness of wave operators associated with the nonhomogeneous fourth-order Sch\"odinger operator $H = \Delta^2 - \Delta + V(x)$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Assuming the real-valued potential $ V $ exhibits sufficient decay and regularity, we prove that for all dimensions $ n \geq 5 $, the wave operators $ W_{\pm}(H, H_0)$ are bounded on $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) $ for all $ 1 \leq p \leq \infty $, provided that zero is a regular threshold of $H $.
  As applications, we derive the sharp $L^p$-$L^{p'}$ dispersive estimates for Schr\"odinger group $e^{-itH}$, as well as for the solutions operators $\cos(t \sqrt{H})$ and $\frac{\sin (t \sqrt{H})}{ \sqrt{H}}$ associated with the following beam equations with potentials: $$
  \partial_t^2 u + \left(\Delta^2 -\Delta+ V(x) \right) u = 0, \ \
  u(0, x) = f(x), \quad \partial_t u(0, x) = g(x),\ \ (t, x) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^n,\ n\geq5, $$
  where $p'$ denotes the H\"older conjugate of $p$, with $1 \leq p \leq 2$. Moreover, we remark that the same results hold for the operator $ \epsilon \Delta^2 - \Delta + V$ with a parameter $\epsilon&gt;0,$ providing greater flexibility for the analysis of related equations.</description>

      <title>Multi-bubble solutions for the Dirichlet problem of the $H$-system with higher degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Dirichlet problem of the $H$-system \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} \Delta v = 2v_x\wedge v_y ~&amp; \text{ in }\mathcal{D},\\ v=\varepsilon \tilde g ~&amp; \text{ on }\partial{\mathcal{D}}, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\mathcal D\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is the unit disk, $v:\mathcal D\to \mathbb{R}^3$, and $\tilde g:\partial \mathcal D\to \mathbb{R}^3$ is a given smooth map. As $\varepsilon\to 0^+$, we construct multi-bubble solutions concentrating at distinct points, taking around each point the profile of degree 2 $H$-bubble. This gives a partial answer to a conjecture due to Brezis-Coron \cite{BrezisCoron} and Chanillo-Malchiodi \cite{chanillomalchiodi2005cagasymptotic} concerning the limiting configuration in the case of higher degrees. This seems to be the first construction in employing higher-degree harmonic maps as the primary configurations.</description>

      <title>Derivation of nonlinear aggregation-diffusion equation from a kinetic BGK-type equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the diffusion limit of a kinetic BGK-type equation, focusing on its relaxation to a nonlinear aggregation-diffusion equation, where the diffusion exhibits a porous-medium-type nonlinearity. Unlike previous studies by Dolbeault et al. [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 186, (2007), 133-158] and Addala and Tayeb [J. Hyperbolic Differ. Equ., 16, (2019), 131-156], which required bounded initial data, our work considers initial data that need not be bounded. We develop new techniques for handling weak entropy solutions that satisfy the natural bounds associated with the kinetic entropy inequality. Our proof employs the relative entropy method and various compactness arguments to establish the convergence and properties of these solutions.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and $L^1-L^p$ Smoothing Effect of the Porous Media Equation under Poincar\'e Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05722v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the well-posedness and uniqueness of the Cauchy problem for a class of porous media equations defined on $\mathbb{R}^d$, and demonstrate the $L^1-L^p$ smoothing effect. In particular, we establish that the logarithm of the ratio of the $L^p$ norm to the $L^1$ norm decreases super-exponentially fast during the initial phase, subsequently decaying to zero exponentially fast in the latter phase. This implies that if the initial data is solely in $L^1$, then for $t&gt;0$, the solution will belong to $L^p$ for any $p\in [1,\infty)$. The results are obtained under the assumption of a Poincar\'e inequality.</description>

      <title>Derivation of Kirchhoff-type plate theories for elastic materials with voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously derive a Blake-Zisserman-Kirchhoff theory for thin plates with material voids, starting from a three-dimensional model with elastic bulk and interfacial energy featuring a Willmore-type curvature penalization. The effective two-dimensional model comprises a classical elastic bending energy and surface terms which reflect the possibility that voids can persist in the limit, that the limiting plate can be broken apart into several pieces, or that the plate can be folded. Building upon and extending the techniques used in the authors' recent work on the derivation of one-dimensional theories for thin brittle rods with voids, the present contribution generalizes the results of Santili and Schmidt (2022), by considering general geometries on the admissible set of voids and constructing recovery sequences for all admissible limiting configurations.</description>

      <title>A note on the stability of self-similar blow-up solutions for superconformal semilinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the stability of self-similar blow-up solutions for superconformal semilinear wave equations in all dimensions. A central aspect of our analysis is the spectral equivalence of the linearized operators under Lorentz transformations in self-similar variables. This observation serves as a useful tool in proving mode stability and provides insights that may aid the study of self-similar solutions in related problems. As a direct consequence, we establish the asymptotic stability of the ODE blow-up family, extending the classical results of Merle and Zaag [Merle-Zaag, 2007, 2016] to the superconformal case and generalizing the recent findings of Ostermann [Ostermann, 2024] to include the entire ODE blow-up family.</description>

      <title>Quantum inverse scattering for time-dependent repulsive Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a multidimensional inverse scattering problem under the time-dependent repulsive Hamiltonian. The time-dependent coefficient on the repulsive term decays as the inverse square of time, which is the threshold between the standard free Schroedinger operator and the time-independent repulsive Hamiltonian. Applying the Enss-Weder time-dependent method, we can determine uniquely the short-range potential functions with Coulomb-like singularities from the velocity limit of the scattering operator.</description>

      <title>A nongraphical obstacle problem for elastic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an obstacle problem for the length-penalized elastic bending energy for open planar curves pinned at the boundary. We first consider the case without length penalization and investigate the role of global minimizers among graph curves in our minimization problem for planar curves. In addition, for large values of the length-penalization parameter $\lambda&gt;0$, we expose an explicit threshold parameter above which minimizers touch the obstacle, regardless of its shape. On contrary, for small values of $\lambda&gt;0$ we show that the minimizers do not touch the obstacle, and they are given by an explicit elastica.</description>

      <title>Sharp fractional Hardy's inequality for half-spaces in the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05949v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we establish the following fractional Hardy's inequality
  $$C\int_{\mathbb{H}^n_+}\frac{|f(\xi)|^p}{x_1^{sp+\alpha}}d\xi\leq \int_{\mathbb{H}^n}\int_{\mathbb{H}^n}\frac{|f(\xi)-f(\xi')|^p}{d({\xi}^{-1}\circ \xi')^{Q+sp}|z'-z|^\alpha}d\xi'd\xi,\ \ \forall f\in C_c^{\infty}(\mathbb{H}^n_+)$$
  for the half-space $\mathbb{H}^n_+=\{\xi=(x,y,t)=(x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_n)\in\mathbb{H}^n:x_1&gt;0\}$ in the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$ without any restriction on parameters, and compute the corresponding sharp constant. In a previous joint work, we established a variant of Hardy's inequality for the same half-space, but with certain parameter restrictions. However, all integrals in that work were considered over half-spaces, and here the seminorm is taken over the entire $\mathbb{H}^n$. Although this inequality holds for all values of the quantity $sp+\alpha$, we are only able to compute the corresponding sharp constant when $sp+\alpha&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Existence of periodic solutions for the Grushin critical problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Grushin critical problem in a strip domain which satisfies the periodic boundary conditions. By applying the finite-dimensional reduction method, we construct a periodic solution when the prescribed curvature function is periodic. Furthermore, we also consider the Grushin critical problem in $\mathbb{R}^{N} (N \geq 5)$. Compared with Billel et al. (Differential Integral Equations 32: 49-90, 2019), we use the method by Guo and Yan (Math. Ann. 388: 795-830, 2024) to construct periodic solutions under some weaker conditions, avoiding the complicated estimates and uniqueness proof. Notably, Guo and Yan (Math. Ann. 388: 795-830, 2024) obtained solutions periodic with respect to some of the first variables, while the solutions in this paper are periodic with respect to some intermediate variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with eigenelements of the Laplacian in bounded domains, under Robin boundary conditions, without any assumption on the sign of the Robin parameter. We quantify the asymptotics of the variation of simple eigenvalues under the singular perturbation produced by removing a shrinking set and imposing the same Robin condition on its boundary. We also study the convergence rate of the corresponding eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for Critical magnetic Schr\"odinger operators on flat Euclidean cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Schr\"{o}dinger operator $\mathcal{H}_{\mathbf{A}}$ perturbed by critical magnetic potentials on the 2D flat cone $\Sigma = C(\mathbb{S}_\rho^1) = (0, \infty) \times \mathbb{S}_\rho^1$, which is a product cone over the circle $\mathbb{S}_\rho^1 = \mathbb{R}/2\pi \rho \mathbb{Z}$ with radius $\rho &gt; 0$, and equipped with the metric $g = dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2$. The goal of this work is to establish Strichartz estimates for $\mathcal{H}_{\mathbf{A}}$ in this setting. A key aspect of our approach is the construction of the Schwartz kernel of the resolvent and the spectral measure for Schr\"{o}dinger operator on the flat Euclidean cone $(\Sigma, g)$. The results presented here generalize previous work in \cite{Ford, BFM, FZZ, Zhang1}.</description>

Abstract: The concept of a fluid algebra was introduced by Sullivan over a decade ago as an algebraic construct which contains everything necessary in order to write down a form of the Euler equation, as an ODE whose solutions have invariant quantities which can be identified as energy and enthalpy. The natural (infinite-dimensional) fluid algebra on co-exact 1-forms on a three-dimensional closed oriented Riemannian manifold leads to an Euler equation which is equivalent to the classical Euler equation which describes non-viscous fluid flow. In this paper, the recently introduced transverse intersection algebra associated to a cubic lattice of An-Lawrence-Sullivan is used to construct a finite-dimensional fluid algebra on a cubic lattice (with odd periods). The corresponding Euler equation is an ODE which it is proposed is a `good' discretisation of the continuum Euler equation. This paper contains all the explicit details necessary to implement numerically the corresponding Euler equation. Such an implementation has been carried out by our team and results are pending.</description>

      <title>A Liouville-type property for degenerate-elliptic equations modeled on H\"ormander vector fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain Liouville type theorems for degenerate elliptic equation with a drift term and a potential. The diffusion is driven by H\"ormander operators. We show that the conditions imposed on the coefficients of the operator are optimal. Indeed, when they fail we prove that infinitely many bounded solutions exist.</description>

      <title>On Onsager-type conjecture for the Els\"{a}sser energies of the ideal MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations on tours $\TTT^d$. For $d=3$, we resolve the flexible part of Onsager-type conjecture for Els\"{a}sser energies of the ideal MHD equations. More precisely, for \(\beta &lt; 1/3\), we construct weak solutions \((u, b) \in C^\beta([0,T] \times \mathbb{T}^3)\) with both the total energy dissipation and failure of cross helicity conservation. The key idea of the proof relies on a symmetry reduction that embeds the ideal MHD system into a 2$\frac{1}{2}$D Euler flow and the Newton-Nash iteration technique recently developed in \cite{GR}. For $d=2$, we show the non-uniqueness of H\"{o}lder-continuous weak solutions with non-trivial magnetic fields. Specifically, for \(\beta &lt; 1/5\), there exist infinitely many solutions \((u, b) \in C^\beta([0,T] \times \mathbb{T}^2)\) with the same initial data while satisfying the total energy dissipation with non-vanishing velocity and magnetic fields. The new ingredient is developing a spatial-separation-driven iterative scheme that incorporates the magnetic field as a controlled perturbation within the convex integration framework for the velocity field, thereby providing sufficient oscillatory freedom for Nash-type perturbations in the 2D setting. As a byproduct, we prove that any H\"{o}lder-continuous Euler solution can be approximated by a sequence of $C^\beta$-weak solutions for the ideal MHD equations in the $L^p$-topology for $1\le p&lt;\infty$.</description>

      <title>Talenti comparison results for solutions to $p$-Laplace equation on multiply connected domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last years comparison results of Talenti type for Elliptic Problems have been widely investigated. In this paper we obtain a comparison result for the $p$-Laplace operator in multiply connected domains with Robin boundary condition on the exterior boundary and non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on the interior one, generalizing the results obtained in \cite{ANT, AGM} to this type of domains. This will be a generalization to Robin boundary condition of the results obtained in \cite{B, B2}, with an improvement of the $L^2$ comparison in the case $p=2$. As a consequence, we obtain a Bossel-Daners and Saint-Venant type inequalities for multiply connected domains.</description>

      <title>Semilinear Heat Equations in Morse-Transue Spaces and Nonlinearities of Rapid Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the question of well-posedness for a general class of semilinear heat equations with initial data in the Morse-Transue subspace of an Orlicz space. Significantly, we obtain our results without imposing growth restrictions on the nonlinearity or the underlying space {\em a priori}.
  The key findings are as follows: a completely new smoothing estimate for the action of the heat semigroup between two arbitrary Orlicz spaces; sufficient conditions for local and global (for small initial data) well-posedness in the Morse-Transue space; a comparison principle in the case of monotone nonlinearities; for nonlinearities enjoying additional structure (e.g. convexity) and growing sufficiently rapidly at infinity (as measured by the variation of $\log f$), an explicit characterisation of a critical Morse-Transue space for local well-posedness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{CMP17} a novel distributional approach has been introduced to provide a well-posed formulation of a class of crystalline mean curvature flows. In this paper, such an approach is extended to the nonlocal setting. Applications include the fractional mean curvature flow and the Minkowski flow; i.e., the geometric flow generated by the $(N-1)$-dimensional Minkowski pre-content.</description>

      <title>Global solutions for cubic quasilinear ultrahyperbolic Schr\"odinger flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work, two of the authors proposed a broad global well-posedness conjecture for cubic quasilinear dispersive equations in two space dimensions, which asserts that global well-posedness and scattering holds for small initial data in Sobolev spaces. As a first validation they proved the conjecture for quasilinear Schr\"odinger flows.
  In the present article we expand the reach of these ideas and methods to the case of quasilinear ultrahyperbolic Schr\"odinger flows, which is the first example with a nonconvex dispersion relation.
  The study of local well-posedness for this class of problems, in all dimensions, was initiated in pioneering work of Kenig-Ponce-Vega for localized initial data, and then continued by Marzuola-Metcalfe-Tataru (MMT) and Pineau-Taylor (PT) for initial data in Sobolev spaces in the elliptic and non-elliptic cases, respectively.
  Our results here mirror the earlier results in the elliptic case: (i) a new, potentially sharp local well-posedness result in low regularity Sobolev spaces, one derivative below MMT and just one-half derivative above scaling, (ii) a small data global well-posedness and scattering result at the same regularity level. One key novelty in this setting is the introduction of a new family of interaction Morawetz functionals which are suitable for obtaining bilinear estimates in the ultrahyperbolic setting. We remark that this method appears to be robust enough to potentially be of use in a large data regime when the metric is not a small perturbation of a Euclidean one.</description>

      <title>A structure and asymptotic preserving scheme for the quasineutral limit of the Vlasov-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new numerical method for the Vlasov-Poisson system that is both asymptotically consistent and stable in the quasineutral regime, i.e. when the Debye length is small compared to the characteristic spatial scale of the physical domain. Our approach consists in reformulating the Vlasov-Poisson system as a hyperbolic problem by applying a spectral expansion in the basis of Hermite functions in the velocity space and in designing a structure-preserving scheme for the time and spatial variables. Through this Hermite formulation, we establish a convergence result for the electric field toward its quasineutral limit together with optimal error estimates. Following this path, we then propose a fully discrete numerical method for the Vlasov-Poisson system, inspired by the approach in arXiv:2306.14605 , and rigorously prove that it is uniformly consistent in the quasineutral limit regime. Finally, we present several numerical simulations to illustrate the behavior of the proposed scheme. These results demonstrate the capability of our method to describe quasineutral plasmas and confirm the theoretical findings: stability and asymptotic preservation.</description>

      <title>A rigorous formulation of Density Functional Theory for spinless electrons in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a completely rigorous formulation of Kohn-Sham density functional theory for spinless electrons living in one dimensional space. More precisely, we consider Schr\"odinger operators of the form $H_N(v,w) = -\Delta + \sum_{i\neq j}^N w(x_i,x_j) + \sum_{j=1}^N v(x_i)$ acting on $\wedge^N \mathrm{L}^2([0,1])$, where the external and interaction potentials $v$ and $w$ belong to a suitable class of distributions. In this setting, we obtain a complete characterization of the set of pure-state $v$-representable densities on the interval. Then, we prove a Hohenberg-Kohn theorem that applies to the class of distributional potentials studied here. Lastly, we establish the differentiability of the exchange-correlation functional and therefore the existence of a unique exchange-correlation potential. We then combine these results to provide a rigorous formulation of the Kohn-Sham scheme. In particular, these results show that the Kohn-Sham scheme is rigorously exact in this setting.</description>

Assuming that the initial data $u_0$ belongs to the critical space $L^{3}$ almost surely, we construct a unique local-in-time probabilistically strong solution.

      <title>Contraction and concentration of measures with applications to theoretical neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of probability measures associated with stochastic dynamical systems featuring either globally contracting or $B_{r}$-contracting drift terms. While classical results often assume constant diffusion and gradient-based drifts, we extend the analysis to spatially inhomogeneous diffusion and non-integrable vector fields. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of stationary measures under global contraction, showing that convergence is preserved when the contraction rate dominates diffusion inhomogeneity. For systems contracting only outside of a compact set and with constant diffusion, we demonstrate mass concentration near the minima of an associated non-convex potential, like in multistable regimes. The theoretical findings are illustrated through Hopfield networks, highlighting implications for memory retrieval dynamics in noisy environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05695v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that overparametrized neural networks are able to generalize with a test error that is independent of the level of overparametrization, and independent of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. We prove explicit bounds that only depend on the metric geometry of the test and training sets, on the regularity properties of the activation function, and on the operator norms of the weights and norms of biases. For overparametrized deep ReLU networks with a training sample size bounded by the input space dimension, we explicitly construct zero loss minimizers without use of gradient descent, and prove that the generalization error is independent of the network architecture.</description>

      <title>Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and Viscosity solutions for an optimal control problem for stochastic convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the following two- and three-dimensional stochastic convective Brinkman-Forchheimer (SCBF) equations in torus $\mathbb{T}^d,\ d\in\{2,3\}$:
  \begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{u}+\left[-\mu \Delta\boldsymbol{u}+(\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{u}+\alpha\boldsymbol{u}+\beta|\boldsymbol{u}|^{r-1}\boldsymbol{u}+\nabla p\right]\mathrm{d}t=\mathrm{d}\mathrm{W}, \ \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0,
  \end{align*}
  where $\mu,\alpha,\beta&gt;0$, $r\in[1,\infty)$ and $\mathrm{W}$ is a Hilbert space valued $\mathrm{Q}-$Wiener process. The above system can be considered as damped stochastic Navier-Stokes equations. Using the dynamic programming approach, we study the infinite-dimensional second-order Hamilton-Jacobi equation associated with an optimal control problem for SCBF equations. For the supercritical case, that is, $r\in(3,\infty)$ for $d=2$ and $r\in(3,5)$ for $d=3$ ($2\beta\mu\geq 1$ for $r=3$ in $d\in\{2,3\}$), we first prove the existence of a viscosity solution for the infinite-dimensional HJB equation, which we identify with the value function of the associated control problem. By establishing a comparison principle for $r\in(3,\infty)$ and $r=3$ with $2\beta\mu\geq1$ in $d\in\{2,3\}$, we prove that the value function is the unique viscosity solution and hence we resolve the global unique solvability of the HJB equation in both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>On non-local exchange and scattering operators in domain decomposition methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-local exchange and scattering operators arising in domain decomposition algorithms for solving elliptic problems on domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Motivated by recent formulations of the Optimized Schwarz Method introduced by Claeys, we rigorously analyze the behavior of a family of non-local exchange operators $\Pi_\gamma$, defined in terms of boundary integral operators associated to the fundamental solution for $-\Delta + \gamma^{-2}$, with $\gamma &gt; 0$. Our first main result establishes precise estimates comparing $\Pi_\gamma$ to its local counterpart $\Pi_0$ as $\gamma \to 0$, providing a quantitative bridge between the classical and non-local formulations of the Optimized Schwarz Method. In addition, we investigate the corresponding scattering operators, proving norm estimates that relate them to their classical analogues through a detailed analysis of the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators. Our results clarify the relationship between classical and non-local formulations of domain decomposition methods and yield new insights that are essential for the analysis of these algorithms, particularly in the presence of cross points and for domains with curvilinear polygonal boundaries.</description>

Abstract: We address convergence of the unique weak solutions of the 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with Navier boundary conditions, as the boundary friction is taken uniformly to infinity, to the unique weak solution under the no-slip condition. Our result is that for initial velocity in $L^2_x$, the convergence holds in probability in $C_tW^{-\varepsilon,2}_x \cap L^2_tL^2_x$ for any $0 &lt; \varepsilon$. The noise is of transport-stretching type, although the theorem holds with other transport, multiplicative and additive noise structures. This seems to be the first work concerning the large boundary friction limit with noise, and convergence for weak solutions, due to only $L^2_{x}$ initial data, appears new even deterministically.</description>

      <title>Global solutions for 1D cubic dispersive equations, Part III: the quasilinear Schr\"odinger flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first target of this article is the local well-posedness question for 1D quasilinear Schr\"odinger equations with cubic nonlinearities. The study of this class of problems, in all dimensions, was initiated in pioneering work of Kenig-Ponce-Vega for localized initial data, and then continued by Marzuola-Metcalfe-Tataru for initial data in Sobolev spaces. Our objective here is to fully redevelop the study of this problem in the 1D case, and to prove a \emph{sharp local well-posedness} result.
  The second goal of this article is to consider the long time/global existence of solutions for the same problem. This is motivated by a broad conjecture formulated by the authors in earlier work, which reads as follows: ``\emph{Cubic defocusing dispersive one dimensional flows with small initial data have global dispersive solutions}''; the conjecture was initially proved for a well chosen semilinear model of Schr\"odinger type.
  Our work here establishes the above conjecture for 1D quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger flows. Precisely, we show that if the problem has \emph{phase rotation symmetry} and is \emph{conservative and defocusing}, then small data in Sobolev spaces yields global, scattering solutions. This is the first result of this type for 1D quasilinear dispersive flows. Furthermore, we prove it at the minimal Sobolev regularity in our local well-posedness result.
  The defocusing condition is essential in our global result. Without it, the authors have conjectured that \emph{small, $\epsilon$ size data yields long time solutions on the $\epsilon^{-8}$ time-scale}. A third goal of this paper is to also prove this second conjecture for 1D quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger flows.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we delve into the intricacies of boundary stabilization for the linearized KP-II equation within the constraints of a bounded domain, a phenomenon known as ``critical length." Our primary aim is to design a feedback law that ensures the existence and exponential stabilization of solutions in the energy space, without length restrictions on the domain $ \Omega = (0, L) \times (0, L)$, $ L &gt; 0 $. Furthermore, we examine the interaction between the drift term $ u_x $ under these constraints.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the equation \[ -\Delta u +(\log |\cdot|*|u|^2)u=(\log|\cdot|*|u|^q)|u|^{q-2}u, \qquad \hbox{ in }\mathbb{R}^2, \] where $8/3 &lt; q &lt; 4$. By means of variational arguments, we find infinitely many radially symmetric classical solutions. The main difficulties rely on the competition between the two nonlocal terms and on the presence of logarithmic kernels, which have not a prescribed sign. In addition, in order to find finite energy solutions, a suitable functional setting analysis is required.</description>

      <title>Global solutions for cubic quasilinear Schroedinger flows in two and higher dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent work the authors proposed a broad global well-posedness conjecture for cubic defocusing dispersive equations in one space dimension, and then proved this conjecture in two cases, namely for one dimensional semilinear and quasilinear Schr\"odinger flows.
  Inspired by the circle of ideas developed in the proof of the above conjecture, in this paper we expand the reach of these methods to higher dimensional quasilinear cubic Schr\"odinger flows. The study of this class of problems, in all dimensions, was initiated in pioneering work of Kenig-Ponce-Vega for localized initial data, and then continued by Marzuola-Metcalfe-Tataru (MMT) for initial data in Sobolev spaces.
  The outcomes of this work are (i) a new, potentially sharp local well-posedness result in low regularity Sobolev spaces, one derivative below MMT and just one half derivative above scaling, (ii) a small data global well-posedness and scattering result at the same regularity level, the first result of its kind at least in two space dimensions, and (iii) a new way to think about this class of problems, which, we believe, will become the standard approach in the future.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we classify the solutions of the critical semilinear problem involving the logarithmic Laplacian $$(E)\qquad \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \mathcal{L}_\Delta u= k u\log u,\qquad u\geq0 \quad \ {\rm in}\ \ \mathbb{R}^n, \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad$$ where $k\in(0,+\infty)$, $\mathcal{L}_\Delta$ is the logarithmic Laplacian in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\in\mathbb{N}$, and $s\log s=0$ if $s=0$. When $k=\frac4n$, problem $(E)$ only has the solutions with the form $$u_{\tilde x,t}(x)=\beta_n \Big(\frac{t}{t^2+|x-\tilde x|^2)}\Big)^{\frac{n}{2}}\quad \text{ for any $t&gt;0$, $\tilde x\in\mathbb{R}^n$},$$ where $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $\beta_n=2^{\frac n2} e^{\frac n2\psi(\frac n2) }&gt;0$. When $k\in(0,+\infty)\setminus\{\frac 4n\}$, problem $(E)$ has no any positive solution.</description>

Abstract: We give a sufficient condition for H\"older continuity at a boundary point for quasiminima of double-phase functionals of $p,q$-Laplace type, in the setting of metric measure spaces equipped with a doubling measure and supporting a Poincar\'e inequality. We use a variational approach based on De Giorgi-type conditions to give a pointwise estimate near a boundary point. The proofs are based on a careful phase analysis and estimates in the intrinsic geometries.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Dynamics of Incoherent Branched Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Waves propagating through weakly disordered smooth linear media undergo a universal phenomenon called branched flow. Branched flow has been observed and studied experimentally in various systems by considering coherent waves. Recent experiments have reported the observation of optical branched flow by using an incoherent light source, thus revealing the key role of coherent phase-sensitive effects in the development of incoherent branched flow. By considering the paraxial wave equation as a generic representative model, we elaborate a stochastic theory of both coherent and incoherent branched flow. We derive closed-form equations that determine the evolution of the intensity correlation function, as well as the value and the propagation distance of the maximum of the scintillation index, which characterize the dynamical formation of incoherent branched flow. We report accurate numerical simulations that are found in quantitative agreement with the theory without free parameters. Our theory highlights the important impact of coherence and interference on branched flow, thereby providing a framework for exploring branched flow in nonlinear media, in relation with the formation of freak waves in oceans.</description>

      <title>Representation and Stability Analysis of 1D PDEs with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22896v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PDEs with periodic boundary conditions are frequently used to model processes in large spatial environments, assuming solutions to extend periodically beyond some bounded interval. However, solutions to these PDEs often do not converge to a unique equilibrium, but instead converge to non-stationary trajectories existing in the nullspace of the spatial differential operator (e.g. $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$). To analyse this convergence behaviour, in this paper, it is shown how such trajectories can be modeled for a broad class of linear, 2nd order, 1D PDEs with periodic as well as more general boundary conditions, using the Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. In particular, it is first shown how any PDE state satisfying these boundary conditions can be uniquely expressed in terms of two components, existing in the image and the nullspace of the differential operator $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$, respectively. An equivalent representation of linear PDEs is then derived as a PIE, explicitly defining the dynamics of both state components. Finally, a notion of exponential stability is defined that requires only one of the state components to converge to zero, and it is shown how this stability notion can be tested by solving a linear operator inequality. The proposed methodology is applied to two examples, demonstrating that exponential stability can be verified with tight bounds on the rate of decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a general mathematical framework for analyzing electostatics within multi-layer metamaterial structures. The multi-layer structure can be designed by nesting complementary negative and regular materials together, and it can be easily achieved by truncating bulk metallic material in a specific configuration. Using layer potentials and symmetrization techniques, we establish the perturbation formula in terms of Neumann-Poincar\'e (NP) operator for general multi-layered medium, and obtain the spectral properties of the NP operator, which demonstrates that the number of plasmon modes increases with the number of layers. Based on Fourier series, we present an exact matrix representation of the NP operator in an apparently unsymmetrical structure, exemplified by multi-layer confocal ellipses. By highly intricate and delicate analysis, we establish a handy algebraic framework for studying the splitting of the plasmon modes within multi-layer structures. Moreover, the asymptotic profiles of the plasmon modes are also obtained. This framework helps reveal the effects of material truncation and rotational symmetry breaking on the splitting of the plasmon modes, thereby inducing desired resonances and enabling the realization of customized applications.</description>

Abstract: Under Wigdersons' framework and by sorting out the technical points in the recent work of Tang and Dias-Luef-Prata, we prove an abstract uncertainty principle for functions in the $L^p$ setting. An immediate consequence is a new uncertainty principle for the Fourier transform, unifying and extending many existing results. More applications are shown for PDEs, including the moment growth estimates for some linear and nonlinear dispersive equations, and a type of weighted lower bound estimate for the spacetime moment of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and heat equation inspired by the control theory.</description>

Abstract: We establish the optimal regularity of viscosity solutions to

Specifically, we prove that under the zero Dirichlet boundary condition on $\{x_n=0\}$, the optimal regularity of $u$ up to the flat boundary $\{x_n=0\}$ is $C^{1,1-\gamma}$. Moreover, for the homogeneous equations, we establish that the optimal regularity of $u$ is $C^{2,1-\gamma}$ in the spatial variables, and that $x_n^{-\gamma}u$ is smooth in the variables $x'$ and $t$.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of Dirac operators for dislocated potentials with a purely imaginary jump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a complete spectral analysis of Dirac operators with non-Hermitian matrix potentials of the form $i\operatorname{sgn}(x)+V(x)$ where $V\in L^1$. For $V=0$ we compute explicitly the matrix Green function. This allows us to determine the spectrum, which is purely essential, and its different types. It also allows us to find sharp enclosures for the pseudospectrum and its complement, in all parts of the complex plane. Notably, this includes the instability region, corresponding to the interior of the band that forms the numerical range. Then, with the help of a Birman-Schwinger principle, we establish in precise manner how the spectrum and pseudospectrum change when $V\not=0$, assuming the hypotheses $\|V\|_{L^1}&lt;1$ or $V\in L^1\cap L^p$ where $p&gt;1$. We show that the essential spectra remain unchanged and that the $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum stays close to the instability region for small $\varepsilon$. We determine sharp asymptotic for the discrete spectrum, whenever $V$ satisfies further conditions of decay at infinity. Finally, in one of our main findings, we give a complete description of the weakly-coupled model.</description>
