      <title>The zeta-determinant of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator of the Steklov Problem on forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a compact Riemannian manifold $M$ with boundary $Y$, we express the log of the zeta-determinant of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator acting on $q$-forms on $Y$ as the difference of the log of the zeta-determinant of the Laplacian on $q$-forms on $M$ with absolute boundary conditions and that of the Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions with some additional terms which are expressed by curvature tensors. When the dimension of $M$ is $2$ or $3$, we compute these terms explicitly. We also discuss the value of the zeta function at zero associated to the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator by using a conformal rescaling method. As an application, we recover the result of the conformal invariance obtained in C. Guillarmou and L. Guillop\'e, The determinant of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for surfaces with boundary, Int. Math. Res. Not. IMRN 2007, no. 22, Art. ID rnm099, when the dimension of $M$ is $2$.</description>

      <title>Alexandrov spaces are CS sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the extremal stratification of an Alexandrov space by Perelman-Petrunin is a CS stratification in the sense of Siebenmann. We also show that every space of directions of an Alexandrov space without proper extremal subsets is homeomorphic to a sphere. In the appendix we give an example of a primitive extremal subset of codimension 2 that is not an Alexandrov space with respect to the induced intrinsic metric.</description>

      <title>Formal structure of scalar curvature in generalized K\"ahler geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on works of Boulanger and Goto, we show that Goto's scalar curvature is the moment map for an action of generalized Hamiltonian automorphisms of the associated Courant algebroid, constrained by the choice of an adapted volume form. We derive an explicit formula for Goto's scalar curvature, and show that it is constant for generalized K\"ahler-Ricci solitons. Restricting to the generically symplectic type case, we realize the generalized K\"ahler class as the complexified orbit of the Hamiltonian action above. This leads to a natural extension of Mabuchi's metric and $K$-energy, implying a conditional uniqueness result. Finally, in this setting we derive a Calabi-Matsushima-Lichnerowicz obstruction and a Futaki invariant.</description>

      <title>The volume of conformally flat manifolds as hypersurfaces in the light-cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a conformally flat Riemannian manifold $(M^n,g)$ of dimension $n$ isometrically immersed into the $(n+1)$-dimensional light-cone $\Lambda^{n+1}$ as a hypersurface. We compute the first and the second variational formulas on the volume of such hypersurfaces. Such a hypersurface $M^n$ is not only immersed in $\Lambda^{n+1}$ but also isometrically realized as a hypersurface of a certain null hypersurface $N^{n+1}$ in the Minkowski spacetime, which is different from $\Lambda^{n+1}$. Moreover, $M^n$ has a volume-maximizing property in $N^{n+1}$.</description>

      <title>A characterization of Pfaffian embeddings from (2, 3, 5)- into flat (4, 7)-geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two smooth manifolds with tangent subbundle distributions, an embedding is Pfaffian if its differential sends the distribution on the source into the distribution on the target. In this paper, we consider the question of existence of Pfaffian embeddings in the specific case where the source is a (2,3,5)-manifold, the target is the 7-dimensional space of isotropic 2-planes in a 6-dimensional symplectic vector space, and the Pfaffian condition is that the derived 3-distribution on the source be mapped into the natural 4-distribution on the target. This is one of the simpler non-trivial cases of the general question on existence of Pfaffian embeddings, but already the answer here requires solution of an interesting differential equation. It turns out that a generic (2,3,5)-manifold does not embed, the first obstruction being the fact that a Pfaffian embeddable (2,3,5)-manifold necessarily has a double root for its Cartan quartic at each point. We determine a complete characterization of embeddable (2,3,5)-manifolds in terms of their associated Cartan geometries, which characterization depends on higher order (non-harmonic) curvature as well.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the hypersymplectic flow on $T^4$ with $T^3$-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hypersymplectic structure on a 4-manifold is a triple $\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3$ of 2-forms for which every non-trivial linear combination $a^1\omega_1 + a^2 \omega_2 + a^3 \omega_3$ is a symplectic form. Donaldson has conjectured that when the underlying manifold is compact, any such structure is isotopic in its cohomolgy class to a hyperk\"ahler triple. We prove this conjecture for a hypersymplectic structure on $T^4$ which is invariant under the standard $T^3$ action. The proof uses the hypersymplectic flow, a geometric flow which attempts to deform a given hypersymplectic structure to a hyperk\"ahler triple. We prove that on $T^4$, when starting from a $T^3$-invariant hypersymplectic structure, the flow exists for all time and converges modulo diffeomorphisms to the unique cohomologous hyperk\"ahler structure.</description>

      <title>Global Chern currents of coherent sheaves and Baum Bott currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide global extensions of previous results about representations of characteristic classes of coherent analytic sheaves and of Baum-Bott residues of holomorphic foliations. We show in the first case that they can be represented by currents with support on the support of the given coherent analytic sheaf, and in the second case, by currents with support on the singular set of the foliation. In previous works, we have constructed such representatives provided global resolutions of the appropriate sheaves existed. In this article, we show that the definition of Chern classes of Green and the associated techniques, which work on arbitrary complex manifolds without any assumption on the existence of global resolutions, may be combined with our previous constructions to yield the desired representatives.
  We also prove a transgression formula for such representatives, which is new even in the case when global resolutions exist. More precisely, the representatives depend on local resolutions of the sheaf, and on choices of metrics and connections on these bundles, i.e., the currents for two different choices differ by a current of the form $dN$, where $N$ is an explicit current, which in the first case above has support on the support of the given coherent analytic sheaf, and in the second case above has support on the singular set of the foliation.</description>

      <title>Score matching for sub-Riemannian bridge sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation of conditioned diffusion processes is an essential tool in inference for stochastic processes, data imputation, generative modelling, and geometric statistics. Whilst simulating diffusion bridge processes is already difficult on Euclidean spaces, when considering diffusion processes on Riemannian manifolds the geometry brings in further complications. In even higher generality, advancing from Riemannian to sub-Riemannian geometries introduces hypoellipticity, and the possibility of finding appropriate explicit approximations for the score of the diffusion process is removed. We handle these challenges and construct a method for bridge simulation on sub-Riemannian manifolds by demonstrating how recent progress in machine learning can be modified to allow for training of score approximators on sub-Riemannian manifolds. Since gradients dependent on the horizontal distribution, we generalise the usual notion of denoising loss to work with non-holonomic frames using a stochastic Taylor expansion, and we demonstrate the resulting scheme both explicitly on the Heisenberg group and more generally using adapted coordinates. We perform numerical experiments exemplifying samples from the bridge process on the Heisenberg group and the concentration of this process for small time.</description>

      <title>Inverse Spectral Problems for Collapsing Manifolds I: Uniqueness and Stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:1209.5875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the geometric inverse problem of determining a closed Riemannian manifold from measurements of the heat kernel in an open subset of the manifold. In this paper we analyze the stability of this problem in the class of $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with bounded diameter and sectional curvature. It is well-known that a sequence in this class of manifolds can collapse to a lower dimensional stratified space when the injectivity radius of the sequence of manifolds goes to zero. We prove the uniqueness of the inverse problem on the limiting spaces of the collapsing manifolds. As a result, we obtain stability results for the inverse problem in the class of manifolds with bounded diameter and sectional curvature.</description>

      <title>The geometric data on the boundary of convex subsets of hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a geodesically convex subset in a convex co-compact hyperbolic manifold $M$ with incompressible boundary. We assume that each boundary component of $N$ is either a boundary component of $\partial_\infty M$, or a smooth, locally convex surface in $M$. We show that $N$ is uniquely determined by the boundary data defined by the conformal structure on the boundary components at infinity, and by either the induced metric or the third fundamental form on the boundary components which are locally convex surfaces. We also describe the possible boundary data. This provides an extension of both the hyperbolic Weyl problem and the Ahlfors-Bers Theorem.
  Using this statement for quasifuchsian manifolds, we obtain existence results for similar questions for convex domains $\Omega\subset \HH^3$ which meets the boundary at infinity $\partial_{\infty}\HH^3$ either along a quasicircle or along a quasidisk. The boundary data then includes either the induced metric or the third fundamental form in $\HH^3$, but also an additional "gluing" data between different components of the boundary, either in $\HH^3$ or in $\partial_\infty\HH^3$.</description>

We will show that it admits a solvable Lie group structure and moreover the Amari-Chentsov connection $\nabla^{A}$ on $(\mathcal{N}, g^F)$ will be characterized by the conjugate symmetry, i.e., a curvatures identity $R=R^*$ of a connection $\nabla$ and its conjugate connection $\nabla^*$.</description>

      <title>Semi-Riemannian manifolds with linear differential conditions on the curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-Riemannian manifolds that satisfy (homogeneous) linear differential conditions of arbitrary order on the curvature are analyzed. They include, in particular, the spaces with (higher-order) recurrent curvature, (higher-order) symmetric spaces, as well as entire new families of semi-Riemannian manifolds rarely, or never, considered before in the literature --such as the spaces whose derivative of the Riemann tensor field is recurrent, among many others. Definite proof that all types of such spaces do exist is provided by exhibiting explicit examples of all possibilities in all signatures, except in the Riemannian case with a positive definite metric. Several techniques of independent interest are collected and presented. Of special relevance is the case of Lorentzian manifolds, due to its connection to the physics of the gravitational field. This connection is discussed with particular emphasis on Gauss-Bonnet gravity and in relation with Penrose limits. Many new lines of research open up and a handful of conjectures, based on the results found hitherto, is put forward.</description>

      <title>Exploring new extrinsic upper bounds on the first eigenvalue of the Laplace operator for compact submanifolds in Euclidean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upper bounds of the first non-trivial eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of the Laplace operator of a compact submanifold $M^n$ of Euclidean space $\R^{m+1}$, by means of a new technique, are obtained. Each of the upper bounds of $\lambda_1$ depends on the length of mean curvature vector field, the dimension $n$, the volume of $M^n$, and of a vector of $\R^{m+1}$. When $M^n$ does not lie minimally in a hypersphere of $\R^{m+1}$, classical Reilly's inequality \cite{Re} is improved and new upper bounds are explicitly computed. For instance, considering a torus of revolution whose generating circle has a radius of $1$ and is centered at distance $\sqrt{2}$ from the axis of revolution, we find $\lambda_1 &lt; \frac{4}{3}(\sqrt{2}-1)\approx 0.552284$, whereas Reilly's upper bound gives $\lambda_1 &lt; 1/\sqrt{2}\approx 0.707106$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We set up a framework of 2-Hilbert bundles, which allows to rigorously define the "stringor bundle", a higher differential geometric object anticipated by Stolz and Teichner in an unpublished preprint about 20 years ago. Our framework includes an associated bundle construction, allowing us to associate a 2-Hilbert bundle with a principal 2-bundle and a unitary representation of its structure 2-group. We prove that the Stolz-Teichner stringor bundle is canonically isomorphic to the 2-Hilbert bundle obtained from applying our associated bundle construction to a string structure on a manifold and the stringor representation of the string 2-group that we discovered in earlier work. This establishes a perfect analogy to spin manifolds, representations of the spin groups, and spinor bundles.</description>

Abstract: We give a full classification of general affine connections on Galilei manifolds in terms of independently specifiable tensor fields. This generalises the well-known case of (torsional) Galilei connections, i.e. connections compatible with the metric structure of the Galilei manifold. Similarly to the well-known pseudo-Riemannian case, the additional freedom for connections that are not metric-compatible lies in the covariant derivatives of the two tensors defining the metric structure (the clock form and the space metric), which however are not fully independent of each other.</description>
