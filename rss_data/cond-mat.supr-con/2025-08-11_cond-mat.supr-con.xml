      <title>Spin-resolved Josephson diode effect through strongly spin-polarized conical magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the spin-resolved Josephson diode effect in junctions comprising strongly spin-polarized conical magnets (FM) coupled to singlet superconductors (SC). The system is treated by making use of the Gor$^\prime$kov and quasiclassical Green$^\prime$s function methods. Modeling the SC/FM interfaces as spin-dependent $\delta$-potentials, we apply our model to an SC/FM/SC junction and account for the Josephson current-phase relation (CPR). The nontrivial coupling between the spin bands in the conical magnet gives rise to a strong Josephson diode effect with an efficiency greater than 40%. The effect essentially depends on the quantum spin-geometric phase that enters the Josephson CPR in a very similar manner to the superconducting phase difference. The former is generated non-locally by the intrinsically noncoplanar spin arrangement of the conical magnet, which breaks the time-reversal and inversion symmetries. Strong spin polarization and a helical pitch of the conical magnet comparable to the superconducting coherence length are essential for the effect. We perform a harmonic analysis of the Josephson CPR and interpret the effect in terms of coherent transfer of multiple equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs across the conical magnet.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Critical Current Density in Josephson Junctions with Phase Non-linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we show that the standard Dynes-Fulton analysis, commonly used to reconstruct the critical current density from interference patterns, breaks down in Josephson junctions with nonlinear phase distributions, leading to non-physical artifacts. To address this, we developed a simple iterative reconstruction algorithm and validated it both numerically and experimentally using a planar Josephson junction model. Unlike conventional approaches based on the logarithmic Hilbert transform, the proposed method allows for incorporating prior knowledge about the system and addresses the fundamental issue of ambiguity in reconstructing the critical current density from interference patterns.</description>

      <title>Scalable High-Temperature Superconducting Diodes in Intrinsic Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting diodes, characterized by nonreciprocal supercurrent transport, offer transformative opportunities for ultra-low-power circuits. However, achieving reliable operation at temperatures above liquid nitrogen remains a major challenge, limiting their practical applicability. Here, we present a scalable strategy for high-temperature superconducting diodes based on intrinsic Josephson junctions naturally present in a cuprate superconductor. We demonstrate that strong nonreciprocity arises not only from broken spatial and time-reversal symmetries, but also from enhanced anharmonicity in the current-phase relation, enabled by the atomically thin barrier of the intrinsic junction. The diode efficiency strongly depends on the number of stacked intrinsic junctions, with the highest efficiency occurring in single-junction devices. Notably, these high-temperature superconducting diodes are readily scalable to large arrays, marking a critical step toward practical implementation in energy-efficient computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Plasmonic Superconductivity in Layered Materials via Dynamical Coulomb Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional Coulomb engineering, through controlled manipulation of the environment, offers an effective route to tune the correlation properties of atomically thin van der Waals materials via static screening. Here we present tunable dynamical screening as a method for precisely tailoring bosonic modes to optimize many-body properties. We show that ``bosonic engineering'' of plasmon modes can be used to enhance plasmon-induced superconducting critical temperatures of layered superconductors in metallic environments by up to an order of magnitude, due to the formation of interlayer hybridized plasmon modes with enhanced superconducting pairing strength. We determine optimal properties of the screening environment to maximize critical temperatures. We show how bosonic engineering can aid the search for experimental verification of plasmon mediated superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Photodynamic melting of phase-reversed charge stripes and enhanced condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between charge stripes and pairing is a longstanding point of scrutiny in a broad class of unconventional superconductors since, in some cases, it is unclear whether their intertwining benefits the ensuing superfluidity. Experiments that explore the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of these systems try to tip the balance in favor of one phase or the other by selective coupling to relevant modes. Leveraging the fact that competition between stripes and pairing is not exclusive to fermionic systems, we explore the photoirradiation dynamics of interacting hardcore bosons, in which density wave phase-reversal melting gives rise to enhanced superfluid properties, quantified by the dynamic amplification of zero-momentum occupancy and charge stiffness. Our results, obtained using unbiased methods for an interacting system on a ladder geometry, demonstrate how one can engineer time-dependent perturbations to release suppressed orders, potentially providing insight into the underlying mechanism in related experiments.</description>

      <title>Finite Length Effects and Coulomb Interaction in Ge Quantum Well-Based Josephson Junctions Probed with Microwave Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proximitized Ge quantum wells have emerged as a novel platform for studying Andreev bound states (ABSs), due to their expected strong spin-orbit interaction and high mobility. Here, we used microwave spectroscopy techniques to investigate ABSs in Josephson junctions (JJs) realized in proximitized Ge quantum wells. Spectroscopic signatures observed in a 350 nm junction indicated the presence of multiple ABSs, and were reproduced with a model including finite-length effects. The ABS spectra measured for a $1.2~\mu$m junction were explained by a model including three ABSs in two conduction channels and finite Coulomb interaction. Our work highlights the importance of interactions in JJs and serves as a basis for understanding and manipulating ABSs in Ge-based hybrid devices.</description>

      <title>Multiorbital character of the density wave instability in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates exhibit high-temperature superconductivity closely intertwined with charge and spin density wave order. However, fundamental questions persist regarding the interplay between the associated density wave (DW) fluctuations and superconductivity, as well as the orbital character and symmetry underlying the DW instabilities. Here we utilize polarized Raman scattering to investigate the phononic and electronic Raman responses of the trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ across its concomitant charge and spin density wave transitions. In addition to distinct phonon anomalies occurring below the transition temperature, we observe a depletion of continuum spectral weight up to 114 meV and a pronounced peak centered at this energy. By combining momentum-selective information from polarized electronic Raman scattering with model calculations involving both Ni-3$d_{x^2 - y^2}$ and Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals, we identify 114 meV as the energy scale $2\Delta_\mathrm{DW}$ of the DW gap, characterized by incoherent opening and non-mean-field behavior. Furthermore, the model calculations reveal that the corresponding $2\Delta_\mathrm{DW}$ peak exhibits a multiorbital origin, thus shedding light on the nature of the DW instabilities in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Interference of Spin-Triplet Superconductors: Application to UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) obtained from scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a powerful method to help extract the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors. We examine the general properties of QPI on surfaces of spin-triplet superconductors, where the properties of the $\vec d$-vector order parameter and topological surface bound states offer important differences from QPI on spin-singlet superconducting materials. We then apply the theory to a model specific to UTe$_2$, and compare the resulting QPI with recent STM measurements. We conclude that the two candidate Cooper pair instabilities $B_{2u}$ and $B_{3u}$ exhibit distinct features in the QPI intensity to discriminate these using the experimental data. Characteristic features of the emergent topological surface states protected by chiral symmetry in general, and by mirror symmetries in the case of UTe$_2$, provide further unique signatures to help pinpointing the pairing symmetry channel in this material.</description>

      <title>Striped Superconductor in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of a superconductor is fundamentally determined by the symmetries broken in its order parameter. Here, we report an exceptionally exotic superconducting phase in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene that simultaneously breaks rotational, translational, and time-reversal symmetries. We show that superconductivity emerges from a quarter-metallic state and is accompanied by the onset of stripe charge order. This unique intertwinement is revealed by angle-resolved transport measurements, which demonstrate dissipationless current confined to a single principal axis-forming one-dimensional-like superconducting channels -- while the orthogonal direction remains resistive down to the lowest temperatures. The formation of stripe order is marked by a first-order melting transition, evidenced by pronounced thermal hysteresis upon warming and cooling. In addition, magnetic-field-induced switching between superconducting states -- reminiscent of behavior previously observed in rhombohedral tetra- and pentalayer graphene -- signals time-reversal symmetry breaking. Collectively, these observations reveal a previously unrecognized quantum phase: a chiral superconductor embedded within a stripe-ordered anomalous Hall state.</description>
