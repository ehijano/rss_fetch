      <title>Belief System Dynamics as Network of Single Layered Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As problems in political polarization and the spread of misinformation become serious, belief propagation on a social network becomes an important question to explore. Previous breakthroughs have been made in algorithmic approaches to understanding how group consensus or polarization can occur in a population. This paper proposed a modified model of the Friedkin-Johnsen model that tries to explain the underlying stubbornness of individual as well as possible back fire effect by treating each individual as a single layer neural network on a set of evidence for a particular statement with input being confidence level on each evidence, and belief of the statement is the output of this neural network.
  In this papar, we reafirmed the importance of Madison's cure for the mischief of faction, and found that when structure of understanding is polarized, a network with a giant component can decrease the variance in the belief distribution more than a network with two communities, but creates more social pressure by doing so. We also found that when community structure is formed, variance in the belief distribution become less sensitive to confidence level of individuals. The model can have various applications to political and historical problems caused by misinfomation and conflicting economic interest as well as applications to personality theory and behavior psychology.</description>

      <title>Does Excellence Correspond to Universal Inequality Level?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the inequality of citations received for different publications of various researchers and Nobel laureates in Physics, Chemistry, Medicine and Economics using Google Scholar data from 2012 to 2024. Citation distributions are found to be highly unequal, with even greater disparity among Nobel laureates. Measures of inequality, such as the Gini and Kolkata indices, emerge as useful indicators for distinguishing Nobel laureates from others. Such high inequality corresponds to growing critical fluctuations, suggesting that excellence aligns with an imminent (self-organized dynamical) critical point. Additionally, Nobel laureates exhibit systematically lower values of the Tsallis--Pareto parameter \( b \) and Shannon entropy, indicating more structured citation distributions. We also analyze the inequality in Olympic medal tallies across countries and find similar levels of disparity. Our results suggest that inequality measures can serve as proxies for competitiveness and excellence.</description>

      <title>A new sociology of humans and machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From fake social media accounts and generative artificial intelligence chatbots to trading algorithms and self-driving vehicles, robots, bots and algorithms are proliferating and permeating our communication channels, social interactions, economic transactions and transportation arteries. Networks of multiple interdependent and interacting humans and intelligent machines constitute complex social systems for which the collective outcomes cannot be deduced from either human or machine behaviour alone. Under this paradigm, we review recent research and identify general dynamics and patterns in situations of competition, coordination, cooperation, contagion and collective decision-making, with context-rich examples from high-frequency trading markets, a social media platform, an open collaboration community and a discussion forum. To ensure more robust and resilient human-machine communities, we require a new sociology of humans and machines. Researchers should study these communities using complex system methods; engineers should explicitly design artificial intelligence for human-machine and machine-machine interactions; and regulators should govern the ecological diversity and social co-development of humans and machines.</description>

      <title>The illusion of households as entities in social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data recording connections between people in communities and villages are collected and analyzed in various ways, most often as either networks of individuals or as networks of households. These two networks can differ in substantial ways. The methodological choice of which network to study, therefore, is an important aspect in both study design and data analysis. In this work, we consider various key differences between household and individual social network structure, and ways in which the networks cannot be used interchangeably. In addition to formalizing the choices for representing each network, we explore the consequences of how the results of social network analysis change depending on the choice between studying the individual and household network -- from determining whether networks are assortative or disassortative to the ranking of influence-maximizing nodes. As our main contribution, we draw upon related work to propose a set of systematic recommendations for determining the relevant network representation to study. Our recommendations include assessing a series of entitativity criteria and relating these criteria to theories and observations about patterns and norms in social dynamics at the household level: notably, how information spreads within households and how power structures and gender roles affect this spread. We draw upon the definition of an illusion of entitativity to identify cases wherein grouping people into households does not satisfy these criteria or adequately represent given cultural or experimental contexts. Given the widespread use of social network data for studying communities, there is broad impact in understanding which network to study and the consequences of that decision. We hope that this work gives guidance to practitioners and researchers collecting and studying social network data.</description>
