      <title>Qusicryslals in Vernam cipher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modification of the classical Vernam cipher based on properties of one-dimensional quasicrystals. The method uses the sequence of quasicrystal minimal distances as an one-time pad. The main advantages are strict aperiodicity of such sets and rather short key that uniquely defines quasicrystal.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical scar on tori in high dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the eigenfunctions of the self-adjoint elliptic $h-$differential operator $P_{h}(t)$ exhibits semiclassical scar phenomena on the $d-$dimensional torus, under the $\sigma$-Bruno-R\"{u}ssmann condition, instead of the Diophantine one. Its equivalence is described as: for almost all perturbed Hamiltonian's KAM Lagrangian tori $\Lambda_{\omega}$, there exists a semiclassical measure with positive mass on $\Lambda_{\omega}$. The premise is that we can obatain a family of quasimodes for the $h-$differential operator $P_{h}(t)$ in the semiclassical limit as $h\rightarrow0$, under the $\sigma$-Bruno-R\"{u}ssmann condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the singular sequence method to investigate the finiteness problem for stationary configurations of the planar N-vortex problem. The initial step of the singular sequence method involves identifying all two-colored diagrams. These diagrams represent potential scenarios where finiteness may fail. We develop a symbolic computation algorithm to determine all two-colored diagrams for central configurations of the planar N-vortex problem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of a generalization of the Mycielski construction to quantum graphs. We discuss quantum symmetries of quantum Mycielskians and their relation to quantum symmetries of the original quantum graphs. We introduce a quantum generalization of the notion of graphs with twin vertices and check that this concept coincides with its classical version for classical graphs with few vertices. Finally, we propose the quantum generalization of the distinguishing number and study its behavior under the quantum Mycielski construction.</description>

      <title>Annealed Potts models on rank-1 inhomogeneous random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the annealed ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on sparse rank-1 random graphs, where vertices are equipped with a vertex weight, and the probability of an edge is proportional to the product of the vertex weights. In an annealed system, we take the average on both numerator and denominator of the ratio defining the Boltzmann-Gibbs measure of the Potts model. We show that the thermodynamic limit of the pressure per particle exists for rather general vertex weights. In the infinite-variance weight case, we show that the critical temperature equals infinity. For finite-variance weights, we show that, under a rather general condition, the phase transition is {\em first order} for all $q\geq 3$. However, we cannot generally show that the discontinuity of the order parameter is {\em unique}. We prove this uniqueness under a reasonable condition that holds for various distributions, including uniform, gamma, log-normal, Rayleigh and Pareto distributions. Further, we show that the first-order phase transition {\em persists} even for some small positive external field. In the rather relevant case of Pareto distributions with power-law exponent $\tau$, remarkably, the phase transition is first order when $\tau\geq 4$, but not necessarily when the weights have an infinite third-moment, i.e., when $\tau\in(3,4)$. More precisely, the phase transition is second order for $\tau\in (3,\tau(q)]$, while it is first order when $\tau&gt;\tau(q)$, where we give an explicit equation that $\tau(q)$ solves.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fourier transform computational accuracy analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a rigorous accuracy analysis of the quantum Fourier transform (QFT), that identifies three natural sources of accuracy degeneracy: (i) discretization accuracy inherited from classical sampling theory, (ii) accuracy degeneracy due to limited resolution in eigenvalue (phase) estimation, and (iii) accuracy degeneracy resulting from finite quantum resources. We formalize these accuracy degradation sources by proving two theorems that relate the minimal amplitude and eigenvalue resolution to the number of qubits. In addition, we describe a gate-level implementation of the QFT and present simulation results on small-scale quantum systems that illustrate our theoretical findings. Our results clarify the interplay between classical signal discretization limits and quantum hardware limitations, and they provide guidelines for the resource requirements needed to achieve a desired precision.</description>

      <title>Robust construction of the incipient infinite cluster in high dimensional critical percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new construction of the incipient infinite cluster (IIC) associated with high-dimensional percolation in a broad setting and under minimal assumptions. Our arguments differ substantially from earlier constructions of the IIC; we do not directly use the machinery of the lace expansion or similar diagrammatic expansions. We show that the IIC may be constructed by conditioning on the cluster of a vertex being infinite in the supercritical regime $p &gt; p_c$ and then taking $p \searrow p_c$. Furthermore, at criticality, we show that the IIC may be constructed by conditioning on a connection to an arbitrary distant set $V$, generalizing previous constructions where one conditions on a connection to a single distant vertex or the boundary of a large box.
  The input to our proof are the asymptotics for the two-point function obtained by Hara, van der Hofstad, and Slade. Our construction thus applies in all dimensions for which those asymptotics are known, rather than an unspecified high dimension considered in previous works. The results in this paper will be instrumental in upcoming work related to structural properties and scaling limits of various objects involving high-dimensional percolation clusters at and near criticality.</description>

      <title>Hyperdeterminism? Spacetime 'Analyzed'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When modelling spacetime and classical physical fields, one typically assumes smoothness (infinite differentiability). But this assumption and its philosophical implications have not been sufficiently scrutinized. For example, we can appeal to analytic functions instead, which are also often used by physicists. Doing so leads to very different philosophical interpretations of a theory. For instance, our world would be 'hyperdeterministic' with analytic functions, in the sense that every field configuration is uniquely determined by its restriction to an arbitrarily small region. Relatedly, the hole argument of general relativity does not get off the ground. We argue that such an appeal to analytic functions is technically feasible and, conceptually, not obviously objectionable. The moral is to warn against rushing to draw philosophical conclusions from physical theories, given their drastic sensitivity to mathematical formalisms.</description>

      <title>SVM/SVR Kernels as Quantum Propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish the equivalence between Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernels and quantum Green's functions. Drawing on the analogy between margin maximization in SVMs and action extremization in Lagrangian mechanics, we show that many standard kernels correspond naturally to Green's functions and that this correspondence arises from the inversion of physical operators. We further demonstrate how positive semi-definiteness, which is essential for valid SVM kernels, aligns with the spectral properties that ensure well-defined Green's functions.
  We employ the Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) to create custom kernels for cases where the commonly employed kernels don't lead to a convergence. These custom kernels approximate the desired Green's functions. We furthermore demonstrate numerically on examples taken from physical problems, such as electrical conductivity, scattering amplitudes, photonic crystals, and energy levels of anharmonic oscillators, that selecting kernel functions that mirror the mathematical form of the associated Green's function can significantly enhance the predictive accuracy of machine learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that introducing a deformed algebra with a minimum length modifies the field equations for an inhomogeneous spacetime, resulting in the emergence of acceleration. Specifically, we examine the analytic effects of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle on the classical field equations of the Szekeres system. Our findings show that the deformed algebra leads to a modified Szekeres system capable of describing cosmic acceleration. Moreover, the spatial curvature of the spacetime is influenced by the presence of the minimum length.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new extension in symbolic dynamics on two sets of alphabets, called the zip shift space. In finite case, it represents a finite-to-1 local homeomorphism called zip shift map. Such extension, offers a conjugacy between some endomorphisms and some zip shift map over two-sided space with finite sets of alphabets. As an application, the topological conjugacy of an N-to-1 uniformly hyperbolic horseshoe map with a zip shift map and its orbit structure is investigated. Moreover, the pre-image studies over zip shift space and the concepts of stable and unstable sets and homoclinic orbits, with a precise description for N-to-1 horseshoe are illustrated.</description>

      <title>A large data semi-global existence and convergence theorem for vacuum Einstein's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I prove a convergence theorem in the context of $3+1$ dimensional vacuum Einstein's equations including a positive cosmological constant on spacetimes $\widetilde{M}$ of topological type $M\times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a closed connected oriented Riemannian $3-$manifold of negative Yamabe type. The theorem concerns the global existence of the solutions of the vacuum Einstein$-\Lambda$ equations for arbitrary large initial data and convergence of the spatial geometry to a constant negative scalar curvature metric in a constant mean extrinsic curvature (CMC) transported spatial gauge. This theorem could be interpreted as a weak cosmic censorship result in the cosmological framework under \textit{generic} initial data. An important corollary of the theorem is the failure of cosmological principle as a derived consequence of Einstein's equations including a positive cosmological constant as well as the failure of geometrization of spatial slice in the sense of Thurston. A similar theorem is stated for positive Yamabe slices under a technical assumption.</description>

      <title>Tunnels Under Geometries (or Instantons Know Their Algebras)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the tight binding model with multiple degenerate vacua we might treat wave function overlaps as instanton tunnelings between different wells (vacua). An amplitude for such a tunneling process might be constructed as $\mathsf{T}_{i\to j}\sim e^{-S_{\mathrm{ inst}}}{\mathbf{v}}_j^{+}{\mathbf{v}}_i^{-}$, where there is canonical instanton action suppression, and $\mathbf{v}_i^{-}$ annihilates a particle in the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ vacuum, whereas $\mathbf{v}_j^{+}$ creates a particle in the $j^{\mathrm{th}}$ vacuum. Adiabatic change of the wells leads to a Berry-phase evolution of the couplings, which is described by the zero-curvature Gauss-Manin connection i.e. by a quantum $R$-matrix. Zero-curvature is actually a consequence of level repulsion or topological protection, and its implication is the Yang-Baxter relation for the $R$-matrices. In the simplest case the story is pure Abelian and not very exciting. But when the model becomes more involved, incorporates supersymmetry, gauge and other symmetries, such amplitudes obtain more intricate structures. Operators $\mathbf{v}_i^{-}$, $\mathbf{v}_j^{+}$ might also evolve from ordinary Heisenberg operators into a more sophisticated algebraic object -- a ``tunneling algebra''. The result for the tunneling algebra would depend strongly on geometry of the QFT we started with, and, unfortunately, at the moment we are unable to solve the reverse engineering problem. In this note we revise few successful cases of the aforementioned correspondence: quantum algebras $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ and affine Yangians $Y(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$. For affine Yangians we demonstrate explicitly how instantons ``perform'' equivariant integrals over associated quiver moduli spaces appearing in the alternative geometric construction.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time asymptotic limits of generalized Kuramoto models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two uniform-in-time asymptotic limits for generalized Kuramoto (GK) models. For these GK type models, we first derive the uniform stability estimates with respect to initial data, natural frequency and communication network under a suitable framework, and then as direct applications of this uniform stability estimate, we establish two asymptotic limits which are valid in the whole time interval, namely uniform-in-time continuum and mean-filed limit to the continuum and kinetic GK models, respectively. In the mean-field limit setting (the number of particles tends to infinity), we show global-in-time existence of measure-valued solutions to the corresponding kinetic equation. On the other hand, in a continuum limit setting (the lattice size tends to zero), we show that the lattice GKM solutions converge to a classical solution to the continuum GK model in supremum norm. Two asymptotic limits improve earlier results for the generalized GK type models.</description>

Abstract: We show that the conservation law of the overdetermined system $u_t - 4u_x^3 - u_{xxx} = 0$, $u_y = 0$, associated with the characteristic $(u_{xy}, 0)$, is non-trivial despite the characteristic vanishing on the system.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium distribution function in ultra-fast processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple expression for the non-equilibrium distribution function in ultra-fast transient processes is proposed. Postulating its dependence on temporal derivatives of the equilibrium integrals of motion, non-equilibrium analogues of the thermodynamic relationships are derived and the conditions that maximize the non-equilibrium entropy are identified. A rigorous threshold between ``slow" and ``fast" processes is suggested, identifying the range of applicability of classical quasi-equilibrium description. The proposed theory is validated by deriving the known law of inertial heat conduction, which accounts for finite speed of thermal propagation. Finally, a new expression for the non-equilibrium work is derived, revealing two kinds of pressure that emerge in fast non-equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been conjectured by Bogosel, Henrot, and Michetti that the second positive eigenvalue of the Neumann Laplacian is maximized, among all planar convex domains of fixed perimeter, by the rectangle with one edge length equal to twice the other. In this note we prove that this conjecture is true within the class of parallelogram domains.</description>

      <title>Open orbits in causal flag manifolds, modular flows and wedge regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study open orbits of symmetric subgroups of a simple connected
  Lie group G on a causal flag manifold.
  First we show that a flag manifold M of G carries an invariant causal structure if and only if G is hermitian
  of tube type and M is the conformal completion
  of the corresponding simple euclidean Jordan algebra,
  resp., the Shilov boundary of the associated symmetric tube domain.
  We then study open orbits in M under symmetric subgroups,
  also called causal
  Makarevic spaces, from the perspective of applications in Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT). A key motivation is the geometry of corresponding modular flows.
  The open orbits are reductive causal symmetric
  spaces, which arise in two flavors:
  compactly causal and non-compactly causal ones.
  In the non-compactly causal case we determine the corresponding Euler elements
  and their positivity regions. For compactly causal spaces,
  modular flows do not always exist and we determine
  when this is the case. Then the positivity regions of the modular flows are not globally hyperbolic,
  but these spaces contain other interesting
  globally hyperbolic subsets that can be described
  in terms of the conformally flat Jordan coordinates via Cayley charts.
  We discuss the Lorentzian case, involving de Sitter
  and anti-de Sitter space in some detail.</description>

      <title>Mixing for dynamical systems driven by stationary noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with the problem of long-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions for classes of ODEs and PDEs, perturbed by stationary noises. The latter are not assumed to be $\delta$-correlated in time, so that the evolution in question is not necessarily Markovian. We first prove an abstract result which imply the mixing for random dynamical systems satisfying appropriate dissipativity and controllability conditions. It is applicable to a large class of evolution equations, and we illustrate it on the examples of a chain of anharmonic oscillators coupled to heat reservoirs, the 2d Navier-Stokes system, and a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Our results also apply to the general theory of random processes on the 1d lattice and allow one to get for them results related to Dobrushin's theorems on reconstructing processes via their conditional distributions. The proof is based on an iterative construction with quadratic convergence. It uses the method of Kantorovich functional, introduced in [KPS02, Kuk02, Kuk06] in the context of randomly forced PDEs, and some ideas suggested in [Shi15, KNS20] to prove mixing with the help of controllability properties of an associated system</description>

      <title>Finite-time blowup of a Brownian particle in a repulsive potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Brownian particle performing an overdamped motion in a power-law repulsive potential. If the potential grows with the distance faster than quadratically, the particle escapes to infinity in a finite time. We determine the average blowup time and study the probability distribution of the blowup time. In particular, we show that the long-time tail of this probability distribution decays purely exponentially, while the short-time tail exhibits an essential singularity. These qualitative features turn out to be quite universal, as they occur for all rapidly growing power-law potentials in arbitrary spatial dimensions. The quartic potential is especially tractable, and we analyze it in more detail.</description>

Abstract: Bonnet has characterized his surfaces by a geometric condition. What is done here is a characterization of the same surfaces by two analytic conditions: (i) the mean curvature $H$ of a surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ should admit a reduction to an ordinary differential equation; (ii) this latter equation should possess the Painlev\'e property.</description>

      <title>Unitary orthonormal bases of finite dimensional inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study unitary orthonormal bases in the sense of Pimsner and Popa for inclusions $(\mathcal{B}\subseteq \mathcal{A}, E),$ where $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}$ are finite dimensional von Neumann algebras and $E$ is a conditional expectation map from $\mathcal{A}$ onto $\mathcal{B}$. It is shown that existence of such bases requires that the associated inclusion matrix satisfies a spectral condition forcing dimension vectors to be Perron-Frobenius eigenvectors and the conditional expectation map preserves the Markov trace. Subject to these conditions, explicit unitary orthonormal bases are constructed if either one of the algebras is abelian or simple. They generalize complex Hadamard matrices, Weyl unitary bases, and a recent work of Crann et al which correspond to the special cases of $\mathcal{A}$ being abelian, simple, and general multi-matrix algebras respectively with $\mathcal{B}$ being the algebra of complex numbers. For the first time $\mathcal{B}$ is more general. As an application of these results it is shown that if $(\mathcal{B}\subseteq \mathcal{A}, E),$ admits a unitary orthonormal basis then the Connes-St{\o}rmer relative entropy $H(\mathcal{A}_1|\mathcal{A})$ equals the logarithm of the square of the norm of the inclusion matrix, where $\mathcal{A}_1$ denotes the Jones basic construction of the inclusion. As a further application, we prove the existence of unitary orthonormal bases for a large class of depth 2 subfactors with abelian relative commutant.</description>

Abstract: A nearest-neighbor, frustration-free spin $\frac{1}{2}$ chain can be constructed {\it via} projectors of various ranks \'{a} la Bravyi-Gosset. We show that in the rank 1 case this system is gapped and has two ground states resembling ferromagnetic states. These states spontaneously break the non-invertible symmetry connecting them. The latter is proved using the machinery of algebraic quantum theory. The non-invertible symmetries of this system do not come from a duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the semiclassical Bochner-Schr\"odinger operator $H_{p}=\frac{1}{p^2}\Delta^{L^p\otimes E}+V$ on tensor powers $L^p$ of a Hermitian line bundle $L$ twisted by a Hermitian vector bundle $E$ on a Riemannian manifold of bounded geometry. For any function $\varphi\in C^\infty_c(\mathbb R)$, we consider the bounded linear operator $\varphi(H_p)$ in $L^2(X,L^p\otimes E)$ defined by the spectral theorem. We prove that its smooth Schwartz kernel on the diagonal admits a complete asymptotic expansion in powers of $p^{-1}$ in the semiclassical limit $p\to \infty$. In particular, when the manifold is compact, we get a complete asymptotic expansion for the trace of $\varphi(H_p)$.</description>

Abstract: We consider long-range percolation, Ising model, and self-avoiding walk on $\mathbb Z^d$, with couplings decaying like $|x|^{-(d+\alpha)}$ where $0 &lt; \alpha \le 2$, above the upper critical dimensions. In the spread-out setting where the lace expansion applies, we show that the two-point function for each of these models exactly coincides with a random walk two-point function, up to a constant prefactor. Using this, we prove a uniform upper bound of the form $|x|^{-(d-\alpha)} \min\{ 1, (p_c - p)^{-2} |x|^{-2\alpha} \}$ (with logarithmic corrections if $\alpha = 2$) for the two-point function near the critical point $p_c$. We also give a simple proof of the convergence of the lace expansion, assuming diagrammatic estimates.</description>

Abstract: Complex operator systems are an important category containing the C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras, which is increasingly of interest in modern analysis and also in modern quantum physics (such as quantum information theory). They have an extensive theory, and have very important applications in all of these subjects. We present here the real case of the theory of (complex) operator systems, and also the real case of their remarkable tensor product theory, due in the complex case to Paulsen and his coauthors and students (such as Kavruk), building on pioneering earlier work of Kirchberg and others. For example in the final two sections of our paper we study real versions of the Kirchberg conjectures etc, and show that they are equivalent. We also develop very many foundational structural results for real operator systems, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic constructions in the subject.</description>

Abstract: We prove bounds on the minimal time for quantum messaging, propagation/creation of correlations, and control of states for general lattice quantum many-body systems. The proofs are based on a maximal velocity bound, which states that the many-body evolution stays, up to small leaking probability tails, within a light cone of the support of the initial conditions. This estimate is used to prove the light-cone approximation of dynamics and Lieb-Robinson-type bound, which in turn yield the results above. Our conditions cover long-range interactions. The main results of this paper as well as some key steps of the proofs were first presented in [36].</description>

      <title>The Pauli-Villars regularised free energy of Dirac's vacuum in purely magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12733v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dirac vacuum is a non-linear polarisable medium rather than an empty space. This non-linear behaviour starts to be significant for extremely large electromagnetic fields such as the magnetic field on the surface of certain neutron stars. Even though the null temperature case was deeply studied in the past decades, the problem at non-zero temperature needs to be better understood. In this work, we present the first rigorous derivation of the one-loop effective magnetic Lagrangian at positive temperature, a non-linear functional describing the free energy of the Dirac vacuum in a classical magnetic field. After introducing our model, we properly define the free energy functional using the Pauli-Villars regularisation technique in order to remove the worst ultraviolet divergences, which represent a well known issue of the theory. The study of the properties of this functional is addressed before focusing on the limit of slowly varying classical magnetic fields. In this regime, we prove the convergence of this functional to the Euler-Heisenberg formula with thermal corrections, recovering the effective Lagrangian first derived by Dittrich in 1979.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of bodies with "active" microstructure described by vector-valued phase fields. For waves with time-varying amplitude, the associated evolution equation involves a matrix that can be non-normal, depending on the constitutive choices adopted for the microstructural actions associated with the considered phase field. The occurrence of non-normality requires to look at the pseudospectrum of the considered matrix, namely the set of all possible eigenvalues of matrices in a $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of the matrix itself, because the eigenvalues of non-normal matrices can be very sensitive to small perturbations and therefore the spectral analysis alone would not be sufficient to distinguish with certainty between table and unstable behavior. We develop the relevant analyses in the case of quasicrystals for which the values of some constitutive parameters are not known or are uncertain from an experimental point of view, a circumstance suggesting parametric analyses. We find circumstances in which the pseudospectra obtained by means of the so-called structured perturbations predict instability when, instead, the spectral analysis indicates stability.</description>

      <title>General Lagrangian Formulation for Higher Spin Fields with Arbitrary Index Symmetry. I. Bosonic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5044</link>
      <description>arXiv:1110.5044v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a Lagrangian description of irreducible integer higher-spin representations of the Poincare group with an arbitrary Young tableaux having k rows, on a basis of the universal BRST approach. Starting with a description of bosonic mixed-symmetry higher-spin fields in a flat space of any dimension in terms of an auxiliary Fock space associated with special Poincare module, we realize a conversion of the initial operator constraint system (constructed with respect to the relations extracting irreducible Poincare-group representations) into a first-class constraint system. For this purpose, we find, for the first time, auxiliary representations of the constraint subalgebra, to be isomorphic due to Howe duality to sp(2k) algebra, and containing the subsystem of second-class constraints in terms of new oscillator variables. We propose a universal procedure of constructing unconstrained gauge-invariant Lagrangians with reducible gauge symmetries describing the dynamics of both massless and massive bosonic fields of any spin. It is shown that the space of BRST cohomologies with a vanishing ghost number is determined only by the constraints corresponding to an irreducible Poincare-group representation. As examples of the general procedure, we formulate the method of Lagrangian construction for bosonic fields subject to arbitrary Young tableaux having 3 rows and derive the gauge-invariant Lagrangian for new model of massless rank-4 tensor field with spin $(2,1,1)$ and second-stage reducible gauge symmetries.</description>

      <title>Reliable Simulation of Quantum Channels: the Error Exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.04475v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Reverse Shannon Theorem has been a milestone in quantum information theory. It states that asymptotically reliable simulation of a quantum channel, assisted by unlimited shared entanglement, requires a rate of classical communication equal to the channel's entanglement-assisted classical capacity. In this paper, we study the error exponent of quantum channel simulation, which characterizes the optimal speed of exponential convergence of the performance towards the perfect, as the blocklength increases. Based on channel purified distance, we derive lower and upper bounds for the error exponent. Then we show that the two bounds coincide when the classical communication rate is below a critical value, and hence, we have determined the exact formula of the error exponent in the low-rate case. This enables us to obtain an operational interpretation to the channel's sandwiched R\'enyi information of order from 1 to 2, since our formula is expressed as a transform of this quantity. In the derivation, we have also obtained an achievability bound for quantum channel simulation in the finite-blocklength setting, which is of realistic significance.</description>

      <title>The moduli of annuli in random conformal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.12398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain exact formulae for three basic quantities in random conformal geometry that depend on the modulus of an annulus. The first is for the law of the modulus of the Brownian annulus describing the scaling limit of uniformly sampled planar maps with annular topology, which is as predicted from the ghost partition function in bosonic string theory. The second is for the law of the modulus of the annulus bounded by a loop of a simple conformal loop ensemble (CLE) on a disk and the disk boundary. The formula is as conjectured from the partition function of the O$(n)$ loop model on the annulus derived by Saleur-Bauer (1989) and Cardy (2006). The third is for the annulus partition function of the SLE$_{8/3}$ loop introduced by Werner (2008), {confirming another} prediction of Cardy (2006). The physics principle underlying our proofs is that 2D quantum gravity coupled with conformal matters can be decomposed into three conformal field theories (CFT): the matter CFT, the Liouville CFT, and the ghost CFT. At the technical level, we rely on two types of integrability in Liouville quantum gravity, one from the scaling limit of random planar maps, the other from the Liouville CFT.</description>

      <title>An exotic calculus of Berezin-Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09596v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a calculus of Berezin-Toeplitz operators quantizing exotic classes of smooth functions on compact K\"ahler manifolds and acting on holomorphic sections of powers of positive line bundles. These functions (classical observables) are exotic in the sense that their derivatives are allowed to grow in ways controlled by local geometry and the power of the line bundle. The properties of this quantization are obtained via careful analysis of the kernels of the operators using Melin and Sj\"ostrand's method of complex stationary phase. We obtain a functional calculus result, a trace formula, and a parametrix construction for this larger class of functions. These results are crucially used in proving a probabilistic Weyl-law for randomly perturbed (standard) Berezin-Toeplitz operators.</description>

      <title>Bulk-to-boundary anyon fusion from microscopic models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum error correction based on the manipulation of the anyonic defects constitutes one of the most promising frameworks towards realizing fault-tolerant quantum devices. Hence, it is crucial to understand how these defects interact with external defects such as boundaries or domain walls. Motivated by this line of thought, in this work, we study the fusion events between anyons in the bulk and at the boundary in fixed-point models of 2+1-dimensional non-chiral topological order defined by arbitrary fusion categories. Our construction uses generalized tube algebra techniques to construct a bi-representation of bulk and boundary defects. We explicitly derive a formula to calculate the fusion multiplicities of a bulk-to-boundary fusion event for twisted quantum double models and calculate some exemplary fusion events for Abelian models and the (twisted) quantum double model of S3, the simplest non-Abelian group-theoretical model. Moreover, we use the folding trick to study the anyonic behavior at non-trivial domain walls between twisted S3 and twisted Z2 as well as Z3 models. A recurring theme in our construction is an isomorphism relating twisted cohomology groups to untwisted ones. The results of this work can directly be applied to study logical operators in two-dimensional topological error correcting codes with boundaries described by a twisted gauge theory of a finite group.</description>

      <title>Border Ranks of Positive and Invariant Tensor Decompositions: Applications to Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The matrix rank and its positive versions are robust for small approximations, i.e. they do not decrease under small perturbations. In contrast, the multipartite tensor rank can collapse for arbitrarily small errors, i.e. there may be a gap between rank and border rank, leading to instabilities in the optimization over sets with fixed tensor rank. Can multipartite positive ranks also collapse for small perturbations? In this work, we prove that multipartite positive and invariant tensor decompositions exhibit gaps between rank and border rank, including tensor rank purifications and cyclic separable decompositions. We also prove a correspondence between positive decompositions and membership in certain sets of multipartite probability distributions, and leverage the gaps between rank and border rank to prove that these correlation sets are not closed. It follows that testing membership of probability distributions arising from resources like translational invariant Matrix Product States is impossible in finite time. Overall, this work sheds light on the instability of ranks and the unique behavior of bipartite systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the existence and the properties of ground states at fixed mass for a focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in dimension two with a point interaction, an attractive Coulomb potential and a nonlinearity of power type. We prove that for any negative value of the Coulomb charge, for any positive value of the mass and for any L$^2$-subcritical power nonlinearity, such ground states exist and exhibit a logarithmic singularity where the interaction is placed. Moreover, up to multiplication by a phase factor, they are positive, radially symmetric and decreasing. An analogous result is obtained also for minimizers of the action restricted to the Nehari manifold, getting the existence also in the L$^2$-critical and supercritical cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04772v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The R\"ossler System is one of the best known chaotic dynamical systems, exhibiting a plethora of complex phenomena - and yet, only a few studies tackled its complexity analytically. In this paper we find sufficient conditions for the existence of chaotic dynamics for the R\"ossler System at some specific parameter values at which the flow satisfies a certain heteroclinic condition. This will allow us to prove the existence of infinitely many periodic trajectories for the flow, and study their bifurcations in the parameter space of the R\"ossler system.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness for Ohkitani model and long-time existence for surface quasi-geostrophic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the logarithmically singular surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation, introduced by Ohkitani, $$\partial_t \theta - \nabla^\perp \log(10+(-\Delta)^{\frac12})\theta \cdot \nabla \theta = 0 ,$$ and establish local existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions in the scale of Sobolev spaces with exponent decreasing with time. Such a decrease of the Sobolev exponent is necessary, as we have shown in the companion paper that the problem is strongly ill-posed in any fixed Sobolev spaces. The time dependence of the Sobolev exponent can be removed when there is a dissipation term strictly stronger than log. These results improve wellposedness statements by Chae, Constantin, C\'{o}rdoba, Gancedo, and Wu in \cite{CCCGW}.
  This well-posedness result can be applied to describe the long-time dynamics of the $\delta$-SQG equations, defined by $$\partial_t \theta + \nabla^\perp (10+(-\Delta)^{\frac12})^{-\delta}\theta \cdot \nabla \theta = 0,$$ for all sufficiently small $\delta&gt;0$ depending on the size of the initial data. For the same range of $\delta$, we establish global well-posedness of smooth solutions to the logarithmically dissipative counterpart: $$\partial_t \theta + \nabla^\perp (10+(-\Delta)^{\frac12})^{-\delta}\theta \cdot \nabla \theta + \log(10+(-\Delta)^{\frac12})\theta = 0.$$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a microscopic definition of finite cut-off JT quantum gravity on the disk, both in the discretized and in the continuum points of view. The discretized formulation involves a new model of so-called self-overlapping random polygons. The measure is not uniform, implying that the degrees of freedom are not in one-to-one correspondence with the shape of the boundary. The continuum formulation is based on a boundary $\text{CFT}_{1}$ from which we predict some critical exponents of the self-overlapping polygon model. The coupling to an arbitrary bulk matter CFT is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The periodic KPZ fixed point is the conjectural universal limit of the KPZ universality class models on a ring when both the period and time critically tend to infinity. For the case of the periodic narrow wedge initial condition, we consider the conditional distribution when the periodic KPZ fixed point is unusually large at a particular position and time. We prove a conditional limit theorem up to the ``pinch-up" time. When the period is large enough, the result is the same as that for the KPZ fixed point on the line obtained by Liu and Wang in 2022. We identify the regimes in which the result changes and find probabilistic descriptions of the limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The symplectic/orthogonal contents of partitions are related to the dimensions of irreducible representations of symplectic/orthogonal groups. In 2012, motivated by Nekrasov--Okounkov's hook-length formula and Stanley's hook-content formula, Amdeberhan proposed several conjectures about infinite product formulas for certain generating functions of hook-lengths and symplectic/orthogonal contents. Some special cases of his conjectures were recently proved by Amdeberhan, Andrews and Ballantine. In this paper, we prove the general cases of Amdeberhan's conjectures.</description>

      <title>Permutation invariant matrix quantum thermodynamics and negative specific heat capacities in large N systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of the simplest gauged permutation invariant matrix quantum mechanical system of oscillators, for general matrix size $N$. In the canonical ensemble, the model has a transition at a temperature $T$ given by $x = e^{ -1/ T } \sim x_c=e^{-1/T_c}=\frac{\log N}{N}$, characterised by a sharp peak in the specific heat capacity (SHC), which separates a high temperature from a low temperature region. The peak grows and the low-temperature region shrinks to zero with increasing $N$. In the micro-canonical ensemble, for finite $N$, there is a low energy phase with negative SHC and a high energy phase with positive SHC. The low-energy phase is dominated by a super-exponential growth of degeneracies as a function of energy which is directly related to the rapid growth in the number of directed graphs, with any number of vertices, as a function of the number of edges. The two ensembles have matching behaviour above the transition temperature. We further provide evidence that these thermodynamic properties hold in systems with $U(N)$ symmetry such as the zero charge sector of the 2-matrix model and in certain tensor models. We discuss the implications of these observations for the negative specific heat capacities in gravity using the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time estimates on corrections to mean field for interacting Brownian particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19306v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of classical Brownian particles interacting via a smooth long-range potential in the mean-field regime, and we analyze the propagation of chaos in form of sharp, uniform-in-time estimates on many-particle correlation functions. Our results cover both the kinetic Langevin setting and the corresponding overdamped Brownian dynamics. The approach is mainly based on so-called Lions expansions, which we combine with new diagrammatic tools to capture many-particle cancellations, as well as with fine ergodic estimates on the linearized mean-field equation, and with discrete stochastic calculus with respect to initial data. In the process, we derive some new ergodic estimates for the linearized Vlasov-Fokker-Planck kinetic equation that are of independent interest. Our analysis also leads to a uniform-in-time quantitative central limit theorem and to uniform-in-time concentration estimates for the empirical measure associated with the particle dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The $\alpha$-induction of graded local conformal nets is studied. We show that inclusions of graded local conformal nets give rise to braided subfactors so that the $\alpha$-induction is still effective for graded local conformal nets. As an application, we give a shorter proof of classification of $N=2$ superconformal nets in the discrete series.</description>

      <title>Analytic trajectory bootstrap for matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the large $N$ two-matrix model with $\text{tr}[A,B]^2$ interaction and quartic potentials by the analytic trajectory bootstrap, where $A$ and $B$ represent the two matrices. In the large $N$ limit, we can focus on the single trace moments associated with the words composed of the letters $A$ and $B$. Analytic continuations in the lengths of the words and subwords lead to analytic trajectories of single trace moments and intriguing intersections of different trajectories. Inspired by the one-cut solutions of one-matrix models, we propose some simple ansatzes for the singularity structure of the two-matrix generating functions and the corresponding single trace moments. Together with the self-consistent constraints from the loop equations, we determine the free parameters in the ansatzes and obtain highly accurate solutions for the two-matrix model at a low computational cost. For a given length cutoff $L_\text{max}$, our results are within and more accurate than the positivity bounds from the relaxation method, such as about 6-digit accuracy for $L_\text{max}=18$. The convergence pattern suggests that we achieve about $8$-digit accuracy for $L_\text{max}=22$. As the singularity structure is closely related to the eigenvalue distributions, we further present the results for various types of eigenvalue densities. In the end, we study the symmetry breaking solutions using more complicated ansatzes.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry Amplification by a Nonadiabatic Passage through a Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and solve a minimal model of dynamic passage through a second-order phase transition in the presence of symmetry breaking interactions and no dissipation. Our model generalizes the Hamiltonian dynamics of the Painleve'-2 equation to the case with many degrees of freedom, while maintaining the integrability property. The evolution eventually leads to a highly asymmetric state, no matter how weak the symmetry breaking parameter of the Hamiltonian is. This suggests a potential mechanism for strong asymmetry in the production of quasi-particles with nearly identical characteristics. The model's integrability also yields exact exponents for the scaling of the density of the nonadiabatically excited quasi-particles.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue systems for integer orthogonal bases of multi-matrix invariants at finite N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-matrix invariants, and in particular the scalar multi-trace operators of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM with $U(N)$ gauge symmetry, can be described using permutation centraliser algebras (PCA), which are generalisations of the symmetric group algebras and independent of $N$. Free-field two-point functions define an $N$-dependent inner product on the PCA, and bases of operators have been constructed which are orthogonal at finite $N$. Two such bases are well-known, the restricted Schur and covariant bases, and both definitions involve representation-theoretic quantities such as Young diagram labels, multiplicity labels, branching and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for symmetric groups. The explicit computation of these coefficients grows rapidly in complexity as the operator length increases. We develop a new method for explicitly constructing all the operators with specified Young diagram labels, based on an $N$-independent integer eigensystem formulated in the PCA. The eigensystem construction naturally leads to orthogonal basis elements which are integer linear combinations of the multi-trace operators, and the $N$-dependence of their norms are simple known dimension factors. We provide examples and give computer codes in SageMath which efficiently implement the construction for operators of classical dimension up to 14. While the restricted Schur basis relies on the Artin-Wedderburn decomposition of symmetric group algebras, the covariant basis relies on a variant which we refer to as the Kronecker decomposition. Analogous decompositions exist for any finite group algebra and the eigenvalue construction of integer orthogonal bases extends to the group algebra of any finite group with rational characters.</description>

      <title>Quantum Probability Geometrically Realized in Projective Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The principal goal of this paper is to pass all quantum probability formulas to the projective space associated to the complex Hilbert space of a given quantum system, providing a more complete geometrization of quantum theory. Quantum events have consecutive and conditional probabilities, which have been used in the author's previous work to clarify `collapse' and to generalize the concept of entanglement by incorporating it into quantum probability theory. In this way all of standard textbook quantum theory can be understood as a geometric theory of projective subspaces without any special role for the zero-dimensional projective subspaces, which are also called pure states. The upshot is that quantum theory is the probability theory of projective subspaces, or equivalently, of quantum events. For the sake of simplicity the ideas are developed here in the context of a type I factor, but comments will be given about how to adopt this approach to more general von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The isotropic harmonic oscillator and the Kepler-Coulomb system are two examples of second-order (maximally) superintegrable (Hamiltonian) systems, and they are pivotal models in the Sciences. They are classified in dimension two and, partially, in dimension three.
  We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for second-order superintegrable systems with a $(n+1)$-parameter potential to extend to so-called non-degenerate systems, i.e.\ systems with a larger family of compatible potentials. Concretely, we show that a $(n+1)$-parameter potential is the restriction of a non-degenerate potential if and only if a certain trace-free tensor field vanishes.</description>

      <title>A simple way to reduce the number of contours in the multi-fold Mellin-Barnes integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mellin-Barnes integral representation of one-loop off-shell box massless diagram is five-fold by construction. On the other hand, it is known from the year 1992 that it may be reduced to certain two-fold Mellin-Barnes integral. We propose a way to reduce the number of the Mellin-Barnes integration contours from five to two by using the Mellin-Barnes integral representation only in combination with basic methods of mathematical analysis such as analytical regularization. We do not use any Barnes lemma to prove the reduction but we use the integral Cauchy formula instead. We recover first the well-known two-fold Mellin-Barnes representation for the one-loop triangle massless diagram and then show how the five-fold Mellin-Barnes integral representation of one-loop box diagram with all the indices 1 in four spacetime dimensions may be reduced to the two-fold Mellin-Barnes representation for one-loop triangle diagram. Singular integrals over Feynman parameters appear in the integrand of the five-fold Mellin-Barnes integral representation at the intermediate step. Such integrals should be treated as distributions with respect to certain linear combinations of the initial Mellin-Barnes integration variables in the Mellin-Barnes integrands. These distributions may be integrated out with a finite number of residues in the limit of removing the analytical regularization. We explain how to apply this strategy to an arbitrary Feynman diagram in order to reduce the number of Mellin-Barnes integration contours. On the practical side, we analyze connections between the obtained results and the knot theory, Trotter integrals, quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Multi-component Toda lattice hierarchy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a detailed account of the N -component Toda lattice hierarchy. This hierarchy is an extended version of the one introduced by Ueno and Takasaki. Our version contains N discrete variables rather than one. We start from the Lax formalism, deduce the bilinear relation for the wave functions from it and then, based on the latter, prove existence of the tau-function. We also show how the multi-component Toda lattice hierarchy is embedded into the universal hierarchy which is basically the multi-component KP hierarchy. At last, we show how the bilinear integral equation for the tau-function can be obtained using the free fermion technique. An example of exact solutions (a multi-component analogue of one-soliton solutions) is given.</description>

      <title>Higher Representations and Quark Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of a (de)confined phase in QFT is well-defined in the presence of $1$-form symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, in scenarios where such symmetries are absent, confinement is not a well-defined phase property. In this work, we propose that, when restricting to a specific submanifold of the parameter space -- namely at zero temperature and fixed quark mass -- the confined and adjoint Higgs phases of scalar QCD can be distinguished through the different organization of their spectra, as seen from the perspective of the baryon symmetry. The analysis is performed in terms of an appropriate higher-categorical representation theory, recently developed for generalized symmetries. Consistent with expectations, we find that the confined phase permits only particles with integer baryon charges, while the Higgs phase is characterized by the coexistence of bare quarks and center vortices, exhibiting a non-trivial Aharonov-Bohm effect between these excitations.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Test for Quantum Integrability and Nonintegrability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether or not a quantum many-body system is integrable, which is characterized by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities, drastically impacts the dynamics of isolated systems, including thermalization. Nevertheless, a rigorous and comprehensive method for deciding integrability or nonintegrability has remained elusive. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing rigorously provable tests for integrability and nonintegrability of quantum spin systems with finite-range interactions. Our approach establishes a new paradigm, moving beyond the conventional artisanal methods in the study of nonintegrability. Furthermore, it partially resolves the long-standing conjecture that integrability is governed by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities with small supports. The proposed framework guarantees that the nonintegrability of one-dimensional spin systems with translational symmetry can be confirmed algorithmically, regardless of system size.</description>

Abstract: We obtain the exact full counting statistics of a cellular automaton with freely propagating vacancies and charged particles that are stochastically scattered or transmitted upon collision by identifying the problem as a colored stochastic six-vertex model with one inert color. Typical charge current fluctuation at vanishing net charge follow a one-parameter distribution that interpolates between the distribution of the charged single-file class in the limit of pure reflection and a Gaussian distribution in the limit of pure transmission.</description>

Abstract: Recent technical and conceptual advancements in the asymptotic safety approach to quantum gravity have enabled studies of the UV completion of Lorentzian Einstein gravity, emphasizing the role of the state dependence. We present here the first complete investigation of the flow equations of the Einstein-Hilbert action within a cosmological spacetime, namely de Sitter spacetime. Using the newly derived graviton propagator for general gauges and masses in de Sitter spacetime, we analyze the dependence on the gauge and on finite renormalization parameters. Our results provide evidence of a UV fixed point for the most commonly used gauges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a refinement to the convex split lemma by replacing the max mutual information with the collision mutual information, transforming the inequality into an equality. This refinement yields tighter achievability bounds for quantum source coding tasks, including state merging and state splitting. Furthermore, we derive a universal upper bound on the smoothed max mutual information, where "universal" signifies that the bound depends exclusively on R\'enyi entropies and is independent of the system's dimensions. This result has significant implications for quantum information processing, particularly in applications such as the reverse quantum Shannon theorem.</description>

      <title>The Statistical Mechanics of Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics are well understood in the frameworks of quantum field theory and general relativity, with contemporary extensions in string theory, AdS/CFT, and loop quantum gravity. However, an open question remains: Can Hawking radiation be consistently described using statistical mechanics? This challenge arises due to the ambiguous quantum nature of Hawking particles and constraints imposed by information conservation. This study develops a heuristic statistical model using a worldine Lagrangian formalism, treating Hawking particles as timelike with an effective mass and following an arbitrary statistical distribution. The flow of information is modeled as a transfer of microstates from the event horizon to the radiation background within a closed ensemble. From this framework, the Hawking particle mass $m_H=\hbar/(2\pi r_S)$ is recovered, and the worldline Lagrangian yields the black hole's thermal energy, $E=\hbar/(8\pi GM)$. Beyond preserving conventional insights, reinforcing the statistical nature of black hole evaporation, this approach introduces novel perspectives: modeling the black hole as a structured energy well containing microstates, quantifying the evaporation rate of individual microstates, and determining the total number of microstates from the horizon's surface area. This study leaves the door open for a stochastic mechanical analysis, which is introduced in the Discussion section.</description>
