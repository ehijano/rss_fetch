      <title>EIE calculation and Collisional-Radiative modeling for Na-like Kr and Xe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an extension to our previous work [1], a comprehensive theoretical study for Na-like Krypton and Xenon is carried out. Using MCDHF (Multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartee-Fock) along with RDW (Relativistic distorted wave) theory we calculate key atomic properties, electron-impact excitation (EIE), rate coefficients, and collision strength for these ions. We use these parameters to build a Collisional-Radiative model for Na-like Krypton and Xenon. For Na-like Krypton we compare our computed excitation energy, EIE cross-sections, rate coefficients, emission line intensity with previous work. Additionally we investigate variation of line ratios with temperature. For Na-like Xenon we compared excitation energy for various fine-structure with NIST( [2]) database and then provide our computed results for EIE cross-section,intensity profile, and the temperature dependence of line ratios for Na-like Xenon. Our findings offer atomic data for studies related Na-like ions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sensing of 3.4 GHz microwave in multi-level Rydberg atomic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rydberg-based microwave detection is an all-optical technology that uses the strong coherent interaction between Rydberg atoms and microwave field. Different from the traditional microwave meter, the Rydberg atomic sensing is a new-type microwave detector that transforms the microwave spectrum into a coherent optical spectrum, and arouses increasingly the interests due to its high sensibility. For this kind of sensor, the coherence effect induced by coupling atoms with microwave plays a key role, and the decoherence may reduce the sensitivity. A multi-level Rydberg atomic scheme with optimized quantum coherence, which enhances both the bandwidth and the sensitivity for 4 GHz microwave sensing, is demonstrated experimentally in this work. The enhanced quantum coherence of Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and microwave induced Autler-Townes (AT) splitting in EIT windows are shown using optical pumping at D1 line. The enhanced sensitivity at 3.4 GHz with 0.3 GHz bandwidth can be realized, based on the enhanced EIT-AT spectrum. The experimental results show that in the stepped Rydberg EIT system, the spectral width of EIT and microwave field EIT-AT can be narrowed by optical pumping (OP), so the sensitivity of microwave electric field measurement can be improved. After optimizing the EIT amplitude and adding single-frequency microwaves, the sensitivity of the microwave electric field measurement observed by the AT splitting interval is improved by 1.3 times. This work provides a reference for utilizing atomic microwave detection.</description>

      <title>A cryogenic Paul trap for probing the nuclear isomeric excited state $^{229\text{m}}$Th$^{3+}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While laser excitation of the nuclear isomeric transition in $^{229}$Th has been recently achieved for thorium atoms embedded in large-bandgap crystals, laser excitation and characterization of the nuclear transition in trapped $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$ ions has not yet been accomplished. To address these experiments, a cryogenic Paul trap setup has been designed, built, and commissioned at LMU Munich. Here, we present the specifications of the new experimental platform and demonstrate its successful operation, showing the extraction, subsequent ion-guiding, mass-purification, and trapping of $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$ and $^{229\text{m}}$Th$^{3+}$ ions from a newly designed buffer-gas stopping cell as well as of $^{88}$Sr$^{+}$ ions from laser ablation of a solid target. Further, we show sympathetic laser cooling of $^{229\text{(m)}}$Th$^{3+}$ by Doppler-cooled $^{88}$Sr$^{+}$ ions and the formation of mixed-species Coulomb crystals.</description>

      <title>An intense and controlled beam of S($^1D_2$) atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the production of an intense and controlled beam of electronically excited sulfur atoms in the $^1D_2$ state using a multistage Zeeman decelerator. Sulfur atoms, generated via photolysis of CS$_2$, are produced in both the ground $^3P_J$ and excited $^1D_2$ states. We demonstrate that both can be manipulated using the decelerator, and that temporal separation between them can be achieved by operating in deceleration mode. This enables the generation of sulfur atom beams with a well-defined velocity, narrow velocity spreads, and an enhanced quantum-state purity. To assess the suitability of the beam for scattering studies, we performed a proof-of-principle elastic collision experiment with S($^1D_2$) and argon atoms. The observed velocity-map-imaging signal confirms that the S($^1D_2$) beam density is sufficient for detailed scattering studies. These results form the foundation for future studies of reactive and quenching processes involving S($^1D_2$) atoms at tunable and well-defined collision energies.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Dependent Evolution of Coherence, Entropy, and Photon Statistics in Photoluminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoluminescence (PL) is a fundamental light-matter interaction in which absorbed photons are re-emitted, playing a key role in science and engineering. It is commonly modeled by introducing a non-zero chemical potential into Planck's law to capture its deviation from thermal emission. In this work, we establish, for the first time to our knowledge, a fundamental relationship that expresses the chemical potential as a function of temperature, material properties, and excitation conditions, enabling a treatment of PL analogous to Planck's law with thermal radiation. This formulation allows for the analysis of temperature-dependent PL properties, including spectral emission, entropy, temporal coherence, and photon statistics, capturing the transition from narrowband pump-induced to broadband thermal emission. Notably, we identify a temperature range where the emission rate is quasi-conserved, associated with the previously reported blueshift. This is followed by a rapid transition to thermal behavior, reflected in both the chemical potential and entropy. Conversely, the coherence time and photon statistics evolve smoothly across the entire temperature range. Alongside its scientific contribution, this framework provides a foundation for designing temperature-tunable light sources, enabling control over coherence length and photon statistics.</description>

      <title>atommovr: An open-source simulation framework for rearrangement in atomic arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of atom rearrangement has emerged in the last decade as a fundamental building block for the development of neutral atom-based quantum processors. However, despite many recent efforts to develop algorithms with favorable asymptotic scaling, no time-optimal algorithm has been developed for any rearrangement task. Moreover, no open-source code exists to reproduce or benchmark existing algorithms, and to assist the development of new rearrangement protocols. To address this deficiency, we develop an open-source simulation framework for developing, comparing, and benchmarking algorithms under realistic and customizable noise models. Using this framework, we \textbf{a)} numerically extract lower bounds for the scaling of a time-optimal rearrangement algorithm and compare it to existing heuristic algorithms \textbf{b)} develop a naive dual-species algorithm able to prepare arbitrary targets with near-unity success rate. With this framework, we hope to develop a common tool for the community to study rearrangement, lower the barrier to entry for new experimental groups, and stimulate progress in developing algorithms which approach time-optimal scaling.</description>
