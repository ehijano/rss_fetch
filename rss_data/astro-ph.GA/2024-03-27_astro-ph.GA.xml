      <title>The Relevance of Dynamical Friction for the MW/LMC/SMC Triple System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of structure formation in the standard cold dark matter cosmological model quantify the dark matter halos of galaxies. Taking into account dynamical friction between the dark matter halos, we investigate the past orbital dynamical evolution of the Magellanic Clouds in the presence of the Galaxy. Our calculations are based on a three-body model of rigid Navarro-Frenk-White profiles for the dark matter halos, but were verified in a previous publication by comparison to high-resolution N-body simulations of live self-consistent systems. Under the requirement that the LMC and SMC had an encounter within 20 kpc between 1 and 4 Gyr ago, in order to allow the development of the Magellanic Stream, and using the latest astrometric data, the dynamical evolution of the MW/LMC/SMC system is calculated backwards in time. With the employment of the genetic algorithm and a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo method, the present state of this system is unlikely with a probability of &lt;10^{-9} (6 sigma complement), because solutions found do not fit into the error bars for the observed plane-of-sky velocity components of the Magellanic Clouds. This implies that orbital solutions that assume dark matter halos according to cosmological structure formation theory to exist around the Magellanic Clouds and the Milky Way are not possible with a confidence of more than 6 sigma</description>

      <title>Testing kinematic distances under a realistic Galactic potential</title>

Abstract: Obtaining reliable distance estimates to gas clouds within the Milky Way is challenging in the absence of certain tracers. The kinematic distance approach has been used as an alternative, derived from the assumption of circular trajectories around the Galactic centre. Consequently, significant errors are expected in regions where gas flow deviates from purely circular motions. We aim to quantify the systematic errors that arise from the kinematic distance method in the presence of a Galactic potential that is non-axisymmetric. We investigate how these errors differ in certain regions of the Galaxy and how they relate to the underlying dynamics. We perform 2D isothermal hydrodynamical simulation of the gas disk with the moving-mesh code Arepo, adding the capability of using an external potential provided by the Agama library for galactic dynamics. We introduce a new analytic potential of the Milky Way, taking elements from existing models and adjusting parameters to match recent observational constraints. We find significant errors in the kinematic distance estimate for gas close to the Sun, along sight lines towards the Galactic centre and anti-centre, and significant deviations associated with the Galactic bar. Kinematic distance errors are low within the spiral arms as gas resides close to local potential minima and the resulting line-of-sight velocity is close to what is expected for an axisymmetric potential. Interarm regions exhibit large deviations at any given Galactic radius. This is caused by the gas being sped up or slowed down as it travels into or out of the spiral arm. We are able to define 'zones of avoidance' in the lv-diagram, where the kinematic distance method is particularly unreliable and should only be used with caution. We report a power law relation between the kinematic distance error and the deviation of the project line-of-sight velocity from circular motion.</description>

      <title>Discovery of widespread non-metastable ammonia masers in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for ammonia maser emission in 119 Galactic high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFRs) known to host 22 GHz H$_2$O maser emission. Our survey has led to the discovery of non-metastable NH$_3$ inversion line masers toward 14 of these sources. This doubles the number of known non-metastable ammonia masers in our Galaxy, including nine new very high excitation ($J,K$)~=~(9,6) maser sources. These maser lines, including NH$_3$ (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,8), (10,8), and (11,9), arise from energy levels of 342 K, 513 K, 465 K, 606 K, 834 K, 1090 K, 942 K, 1226 K, and 1449 K above the ground state. Additionally, we tentatively report a new metastable NH$_3$ (3,3) maser in G048.49 and an NH$_3$ (7,7) maser in G029.95. Our observations reveal that all of the newly detected NH$_3$ maser lines exhibit either blueshifted or redshifted velocities with respect to the source systemic velocities. Among the non-metastable ammonia maser lines, larger velocity distributions, offset from the source systemic velocities, are found in the ortho-NH$_3$ ($K=3n$) than in the para-NH$_3$ ($K\neq3n$) transitions.</description>

      <title>Partial alignment between jets and megamasers: coherent or selective accretion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spins play a crucial role in the appearance, evolution and occupation fraction of massive black holes. To date observational estimates of massive black hole spins are scarce, and the assumptions commonly made in such estimates have been recently questioned. Similarly, theoretical models for massive black hole spin evolution, while reproducing the few observational constraints, are based on possibly oversimplified assumptions. New independent constraints on massive black hole spins are therefore of primary importance. We present a rigorous statistical analysis of the relative orientation of radio jets and mega-maser discs in ten low-redshift galaxies. We find a strong preference for (partial) alignment between jets and mega-masers, that can be attributed to two different causes: "coherent" and "selective" accretion. In the first case the partial alignment is due to an anisotropy in the gas reservoir fueling the growth of MBHs. In the second case the spin-dependent anisotropic feedback allows for long-lived accretion only if the orbits of the gas inflows are almost aligned to the MBH equatorial plane. A discussion of the implications of the two accretion scenarios on the evolution of MBHs is presented, together with an outlook on future observational tests aiming at discriminating between the two scenarios and at checking if any of the two apply to different redshifts and black hole mass regimes.</description>

      <title>MUSE view of PDS 456: kpc-scale wind, extended ionized gas and close environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PDS 456 is the most luminous RQQ at z&lt;0.3 and can be regarded as a local counterpart of the powerful QSOs shining at Cosmic Noon. It hosts a strong nuclear X-ray ultra-fast outflow, and a massive and clumpy CO(3-2) molecular outflow extending up to 5 kpc from the nucleus. We analyzed the first MUSE WFM and AO-NFM optical integral field spectroscopic observations of PDS456. The AO-NFM observations provide an unprecedented spatial resolution, reaching up to 280 pc. Our findings reveal a complex circumgalactic medium around PDS 456, extending up to a maximum projected size of ~46 kpc. This includes a reservoir of gas with a mass of ~1e7-1e8 Modot, along with eight companion galaxies, and a multi-phase outflow. WFM and NFM MUSE data reveal an outflow on a large scale (~12 kpc from the quasar) in [OIII], and on smaller scales (within 3 kpc) with higher resolution (about 280 pc) in Halpha, respectively. The [OIII] outflow mass rate is 2.3 +/- 0.2 Modot/yr which is significantly lower than those typically found in other luminous quasars. Remarkably, the Ha outflow shows a similar scale, morphology, and kinematics to the CO(3-2) molecular outflow, with the latter dominating in terms of kinetic energy and mass outflow rate by two and one orders of magnitude, respectively. Our results therefore indicate that mergers, powerful AGN activity, and feedback through AGN-driven winds will collectively contribute to shaping the host galaxy evolution of PDS 456, and likely, that of similar objects at the brightest end of the AGN luminosity function across all redshifts. Moreover, the finding that the momentum boost of the total outflow deviates from the expected energy-conserving expansion for large-scale outflows highlights the need of novel AGN-driven outflow models to comprehensively interpret these phenomena.</description>

      <title>FAUST XIII. Dusty cavity and molecular shock driven by IRS7B in the Corona Australis cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the chemical diversity observed around low-mass protostars probably resides in the earliest history of these systems. We aim to investigate the impact of protostellar feedback on the chemistry and grain growth in the circumstellar medium of multiple stellar systems. In the context of the ALMA Large Program FAUST, we present high-resolution (50 au) observations of CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO, and SiO and continuum emission at 1.3 mm and 3 mm towards the Corona Australis star cluster. Methanol emission reveals an arc-like structure at $\sim$1800 au from the protostellar system IRS7B along the direction perpendicular to the major axis of the disc. The arc is located at the edge of two elongated continuum structures that define a cone emerging from IRS7B. The region inside the cone is probed by H$_2$CO, while the eastern wall of the arc shows bright emission in SiO, a typical shock tracer. Taking into account the association with a previously detected radio jet imaged with JVLA at 6 cm, the molecular arc reveals for the first time a bow shock driven by IRS7B and a two-sided dust cavity opened by the mass-loss process. For each cavity wall, we derive an average H$_2$ column density of $\sim$7$\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, a mass of $\sim$9$\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_\odot$, and a lower limit on the dust spectral index of $1.4$. These observations provide the first evidence of a shock and a conical dust cavity opened by the jet driven by IRS7B, with important implications for the chemical enrichment and grain growth in the envelope of Solar System analogues.</description>

      <title>Ancient stellar populations in the outskirts of nearby grand-design spirals: Investigation of their star formation histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is the tight relation between the galaxy stellar mass and its star formation rate (SFR) and was observed up to z ~ 6. The MS relation can be used as a reference for understanding the differences among galaxies, characterised by different rates of stellar production (starbursts, SFGs, and passive galaxies), and those inside a galaxy made up of different components (bulge, disk, and halo). To investigate peculiar features found in our sample galaxies, we focus here on their star formation history (SFH). We performed a spectral energy distribution fitting procedure that accounted for the energetic balance between UV and far-IR radiation on a sample of eight nearby face-on spiral galaxies from the DustPedia sample. This approach allowed us to study the spatially resolved MS of the sample and to recover the past SFH. By exploiting the BAGPIPES code, we constrained the SFHs for each galaxy with a delayed exponentially declining model to derive their mass-weighted age (tMW). A central old region (tMW up to~7Gyr, consistent with the presence of a bulge for various systems) is followed by younger regions in which the disks are still forming stars (tMW~4Gyr). At larger distances, tMW increases mildly in general. Strikingly, in two galaxies (NGC4321 and NGC5194), we found a steep increase in tMW that reached levels similar to those of the bulge. These old stellar populations in the very galaxy outskirts are unexpected. We discuss their potential origin by considering the different gas phases of the source with the most prominent quenched ring, NGC4321, and argue for two main possibilities: 1) some environmental effect (e.g. starvation) or 2) the circumgalactic medium of sources outside of high-density clusters might have stopped to supply pristine gas to the galaxy (e.g. if its specific angular moment is too high for being accreted).</description>

      <title>On the M87 jet structure near the central engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At present, there is no doubt that relativistic jets observed in active galactic nuclei pass from highly magnetized to weakly magnetized stage, which is observed as a break in the dependence on their width $d_{\rm jet}(z)$ on the distance $z$ to the central engine. In this paper, we discuss the possibility of observing another break, which should be located at shorter distances. The position of this break can be associated with the region of formation of the dense central core near the jet axis which was predicted both analytically and numerically more than a decade ago, but has not yet received sufficient attention. In this case, the observed width should be determined by the dense core, and not by the total transverse size of the jet. The calculations carried out in this paper, which took into account both the transverse electromagnetic structure of the jet and the change in the spectrum of emitting particles along its axis, indeed showed such behaviour. We also found the evidence of the predicted break in the jet expansion profile using stacked 15 GHz VLBA image of M87 radio jet and constrain the light cylinder radius.</description>

      <title>Dust Extinction Measures for $z\sim 8$ Galaxies using Machine Learning on JWST Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a machine learning study to measure the dust content of galaxies observed with JWST at z &gt; 6 through the use of trained neural networks based on high-resolution IllustrisTNG simulations. Dust is an important unknown in the evolution and observability of distant galaxies and is degenerate with other stellar population features through spectral energy fitting. As such, we develop and test a new SED-independent machine learning method to predict dust attenuation and sSFR of high redshift (z &gt; 6) galaxies. Simulated galaxies were constructed using the IllustrisTNG model, with a variety of dust contents parameterized by E(B-V) and A(V) values, then used to train Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models using supervised learning through a regression model. We demonstrate that within the context of these simulations, our single and multi-band models are able to predict dust content of distant galaxies to within a 1$\sigma$ dispersion of A(V) $\sim 0.1$. Applied to spectroscopically confirmed z &gt; 6 galaxies from the JADES and CEERS programs, our models predicted attenuation values of A(V) &lt; 0.7 for all systems, with a low average (A(V) = 0.28). Our CNN predictions show larger dust attenuation but lower amounts of star formation compared to SED fitted values. Both results show that distant galaxies with confirmed spectroscopy are not extremely dusty, although this sample is potentially significantly biased. We discuss these issues and present ideas on how to accurately measure dust features at the highest redshifts using a combination of machine learning and SED fitting.</description>

      <title>Velocity Distribution of Dark Matter Spike around Schwarzschild Black Holes and Effects on Gravitational Waves from EMRIs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) constitutes the predominant portion of matter in our universe. Despite compelling evidence, the precise characteristics of DM remain elusive. Among the leading DM candidates are weakly interacting massive particles, which may aggregate into steep concentrations around the central black holes of galaxies, forming dense spikes. Employing Schwarzschild geometry, we assess the density and velocity distribution of DM within such spikes. Through variations in black hole masses and dark halo parameters, we identify universal features in the density profile of DM and fit them with Gaussian distributions. Additionally, we investigate the impact of dynamical friction on gravitational waves (GWs) generated by extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) within DM spikes. Our findings uncover phase shifts in the time-domain waveform, potentially providing significant insights for the GW-based detection of DM in galactic centers.</description>

      <title>Optical Identification of Galaxy Clusters among SRG/eROSITA X-ray Sources Based on Photometric Redshift Estimates for Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss an algorithm whereby the massive galaxy clusters detected in the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey are identified and their photometric redshifts are estimated. For this purpose, we use photometric redshift estimates for galaxies and WISE forced photometry. To estimate the algorithm operation quality, we used a sample of 634 massive galaxy clusters from the Planck survey with known spectroscopic redshifts in the range $0.1 &lt; z_{spec} &lt; 0.6$. The accuracy of the photometric redshift estimates for this sample is $\delta z_{phot}/(1+z_{phot}) \approx 0.5$%, the fraction of large deviations is 1.3%. We show that these large deviations arise mainly from the projections of galaxy clusters or other large-scale structures at different redshifts in the X-ray source field. Measuring the infrared (IR) luminosities of galaxy clusters allows one to estimate the reliability of the optical identification of the clusters detected in the SRG/eROSITA survey and to obtain an additional independent measurement of their total gravitational masses, $M_{500}$. We show that the masses $M_{500}$ of the galaxy clusters estimated from their IR luminosity measurements have an accuracy $\sigma_{\lg\,M_{500}} = 0.124$, comparable to the accuracy of the mass estimation for the galaxy clusters from their X-ray luminosities.</description>

Abstract: We present the results of the optical identification and spectroscopic redshift measurements of 216 galaxy clusters detected in the SRG/eROSITA all-sky X-ray survey. The spectroscopic observations were performed in 2020-2023 with the 6-m BTA telescope at the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the 2.5-m telescope at the Caucasus Mountain Observatory of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute of the Moscow State University, the 1.6-m AZT-33IK telescope at the Sayan Solar Observatory of the Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the 1.5-m Russian-Turkish telescope (RTT-150) at the T\"{U}B\.{I}TAK Observatory. For all of the galaxy clusters presented here the spectroscopic redshift measurements have been obtained for the first time. Of these, 139 galaxy clusters have been detected for the first time in the SRG/eROSITA survey and 22 galaxy clusters are at redshifts $z_{spec} \gtrsim 0.7$, including three at $z_{spec} \gtrsim 1$. Deep direct images with the rizJK filters have also been obtained for four distant galaxy clusters at $z_{spec} &gt; 0.7$. For these observations the most massive clusters are selected. Therefore, most of the galaxy clusters presented here most likely will be included in the cosmological samples of galaxy clusters from the SRG/eROSITA survey.</description>

      <title>Signatures of magnetic braking in Class 0 protostars ? Exploring the gas kinematics in magnetized models of low-mass star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Only indirect evidence of the role of magnetic braking in regulating gravitational collapse and the formation of circumstellar disks was found from observational work, such as compact disk sizes and the launching of high-velocity collimated protostellar jets. More direct tests of the magnetic braking shaping the angular momentum (AM) of the gas in Class 0 protostars are crucially needed. In the present work we have used non-ideal MHD models of protostellar collapse and synthetic observations of molecular gas spectral emission that we analyze to test whether possible kinematic signatures of the magnetic braking in the gas velocity field can be captured from maps of the molecular gas emission in protostellar envelopes. By comparing the 3D Specific AM of models with varying turbulent energy and magnetization, we show that, in the numerical models of protostellar evolution explored, the increase in magnetization and its consequences on the spatial redistribution of SAM modifies the shapes of the radial profiles of SAM. We show that widely used observational methods fail to quantitatively capture the magnitude of SAM of the gas in protostellar envelopes, and that no method allows to measure the differences in radial evolution of SAM due to different magnetization at all envelope radii. This is especially true in the more magnetized cases. However, our analysis suggests that the detection of symmetric patterns and organized velocity fields, in the moment-1 maps of the molecular line emission as well as monotonous radial profiles of the SAM showing a power-law decline, should be suggestive of a less magnetized scenario. Protostellar cores where efficient magnetic braking is at work are more likely to present a highly asymmetric velocity field, and more prone to show complex radial profiles of their specific angular momentum measured in the equatorial plane.</description>

      <title>Study of 26 Galactic open clusters with extended main-sequence turnoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that some Galactic open clusters (OCs) exhibit extended main-sequence turnoff (eMSTO) in their colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). However, the number of Galactic OCs with eMSTO structures detected so far is limited, and the reasons for their formation are still unclear. This work identifies 26 Galactic OCs with undiscovered eMSTOs and investigates the causes of these features. Stellar population types and fundamental parameters of cluster samples are acquired using CMD fitting methods. Among them, the results of 11 OCs are reliable as the observed CMDs are well-reproduced. We propose the crucial role of stellar binarity and confirm the importance of stellar rotation in reproducing eMSTO morphologies. The results also show that the impact of age spread is important, as it can adequately explain the structure of young OCs and fit the observed CMDs of intermediate-age OCs better.</description>

      <title>Developing a Theoretical Model for the Resummation of Infrared Effects in the Pre- and Post-Reconstruction Galaxy Bispectra (https://youtu.be/bHdlIi3jQ4A)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While substantial progress has been made in studying the pre-reconstruction galaxy bispectrum, investigations of the post-reconstruction bispectrum are still in nascent stages. In this paper, we present a bispectrum model that incorporates one-loop corrections in the Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT), while simultaneously addressing infrared (IR) effects in the post-reconstruction density fluctuations in a non-perturbative approach. This model accurately captures the nonlinear behavior of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal within the post-reconstruction bispectrum framework. Furthermore, the incorporation of the one-loop correction extends its applicability to smaller scales. Given that the approach to addressing IR effects remains invariant before and after the reconstruction process, the resulting IR-resummed bispectrum model exhibits uniformity across both scenarios. Throughout this analysis, we achieve a comprehensive and unified description of the bispectrum that seamlessly spans the pre- and post-reconstruction phases.

      <title>Infrared properties of carbon stars in our Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the characteristics of carbon stars within our Galaxy through a comprehensive analysis of observational data spanning visual and infrared (IR) bands. Leveraging datasets from IRAS, ISO, Akari, MSX, 2MASS, WISE, Gaia DR3, AAVSO, and the SIMBAD object database, we conduct a detailed comparison between the observational data and theoretical models. To facilitate this comparison, we introduce various IR two-color diagrams (2CDs), IR color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We find that the CMDs, which utilize the latest distance and extinction data from Gaia DR3 for a substantial number of carbon stars, are very useful to distinguish carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (CAGB) stars from extrinsic carbon stars that are not in the AGB phase. To enhance the accuracy of our analysis, we employ theoretical radiative transfer models for dust shells around CAGB stars. These theoretical dust shell models demonstrate a commendable ability to approximate the observations of CAGB stars across various SEDs, 2CDs, and CMDs. We present the infrared properties of known pulsating variables and explore the infrared variability of the sample stars by analyzing WISE photometric data spanning the last 14 yr. Additionally, we present a novel catalog of CAGB stars, offering enhanced reliability and a wealth of additional information.</description>

      <title>Cepheids with giant companions: A new, abundant source of Cepheid astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a progress report of our project aiming to increase the number of known Cepheids in double-lined binary (SB2) systems from six to 100 or more. This will allow us, among other goals, to accurately measure masses for a large sample of Cepheids. Currently, only six accurate Cepheid masses are available, which hinders our understanding of their physical properties and renders the Cepheid mass--luminosity relation poorly constrained. At the same time, Cepheids are widely used for essential measurements (e.g., extragalactic distances, the Hubble constant). To examine Cepheid period--luminosity relations, we selected as binary candidates Cepheids that are too bright for their periods. To date, we have confirmed 56 SB2 systems, including the detection of significant orbital motions of the components for 32. We identified systems with orbital periods up to five times shorter than the shortest reported period to date, as well as systems with mass ratios significantly different from unity (suggesting past merger events). Both features are essential to understand how multiplicity affects the formation and destruction of Cepheid progenitors and what effect this has on global Cepheid properties. We also present eight new systems composed of two Cepheids (only one such system was known before). Among confirmed SB2 Cepheids, there are also several wide-orbit systems. In the future, these may facilitate independent accurate geometric distance measurements to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.</description>

      <title>Fermi and eROSITA Bubbles as Persistent Structures of The Milky Way Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles, large diffuse structures in our Galaxy, can be the by-products of the steady star formation activity. To simultaneously explain the star formation history of the Milky Way and the metallicity of $\sim$ Z$_\odot$ at the Galactic disk, a steady Galactic wind driven by cosmic-rays is required. For tenuous gases with a density of $\lesssim$10$^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$, the cosmic-ray heating dominates over radiative cooling, and the gas can maintain the virial temperature of $\sim$0.3 keV ideal for escape from the Galactic system as the wind. A part of the wind falls back onto the disk like a galactic fountain flow. We model the wind dynamics according to the Galactic evolution scenario and find that the scale height and surface brightness of the X-ray and the hadronic gamma-ray emissions from such fountain flow region can be consistent with the observed properties of the Fermi and eROSITA bubbles. This implies that the bubbles are persistent structures of the Milky Way existing over (at least) the last $\sim$1 Gyr, rather than evanescent structures formed by non-trivial, $\sim$10 Myr past Galactic Center transient activities.</description>

      <title>On the properties of free floating planets originating in circumbinary planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free-floating planets are a new class of planets recently discovered. These planets don't orbit within stellar systems, instead living a nomadic life within the galaxy. How such objects formed remains elusive. Numerous works have explored mechanisms to form such objects, but have not yet provided predictions on their distributions that could differentiate between formation mechanisms. In this work we form these objects within circumbinary systems, where these planets are readily formed and ejected through interactions with the central binary stars. We find significant differences between planets ejected through planet-planet interactions and those by the binary stars. The main differences that arise are in the distributions of excess velocity, where binary stars eject planets with faster velocities. These differences should be observable amongst known free-floating planets in nearby star-forming regions. We predict that targeted observations of directly imaged free-floating planets in these regions should be able to determine their preferred formation pathway, either by planet formation in single or multiple stellar systems, or through processes akin to star formation. Additionally the mass distributions of free-floating planets can yield important insights into the underlying planet populations. We find that for planets more massive than 20 $\rm M_{\oplus}$, their frequencies are similar to those planets remaining bound and orbiting near the central binaries. This similarity allows for effective and informative comparisons between mass distributions from microlensing surveys, to those of transit and radial velocities. Ultimately, by observing the velocity dispersion and mass distribution of free-floating planets, it will be possible to effectively compare with predictions from planet formation models, and to further understand the formation and evolution of these exotic worlds.</description>

      <title>Revising the cross correlation technique at high spectral resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-correlation techniques have been used since 1974 for measuring velocity shifts and velocity dispersions from stellar and nebular spectra and, since 1979, the analysis based on the Fourier Method has been applied. However, we are currently obtaining data with spectral resolutions higher than those for which this technique was developed, hence some revision seems timely. The principal aim of this work is adapting Tonry and Davis' method and implementing it for the treatment of very high spectral resolution data. We have applied this technique to two different sets of spectroscopic data of moderate and high resolutions obtained with the MUSE and MEGARA spectrographs respectively. Using stellar spectra obtained with these two instruments (i) we have optimised the input parameters; (ii) we have analysed the method assumptions; and (iii) we have compared the results for the two sets of data. For MEGARA data, we have found that the cross-correlation function lost its Gaussian behavior at higher resolutions. Thus, we have developed an equivalent mathematical method that can be used for this kind of data. Additionally, the velocity dispersion error analysis suggests that the greatest error introduced in this method is due to the subtraction or masking of the nebular lines. For the application of cross-correlation techniques to high spectral resolution data, we propose to calculate the galaxy-galaxy and star-galaxy correlations, with widths $\mu_{gg}$ and $\mu_{gt}$ respectively. Then, the width of the broadening function can be calculated as $\sigma = \sqrt{\mu_{gg}^2 - \mu_{gt}^2}$.</description>

      <title>High-Spectral Resolution Observations of the Optical Filamentary Nebula in NGC 1275</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new high-spectral resolution observations (R = $\lambda/\Delta\lambda$ = 7000) of the filamentary nebula surrounding NGC 1275, the central galaxy of the Perseus cluster. These observations have been obtained with SITELLE, an imaging Fourier transform spectrometer installed on the Canada-France-Hawai Telescope (CFHT) with a field of view of $11\text{ arcmin }\times 11 \text{ arcmin}$ encapsulating the entire filamentary structure of ionised gas despite its large size of $80 \text{ kpc}\times50 \text{ kpc}$. Here, we present renewed flux, velocity and velocity dispersion maps that show in great detail the kinematics of the optical nebula at \sii$\lambda6716$, \sii$\lambda6731$, \nii$\lambda6584$, H$\alpha$(6563\AA), and \nii$\lambda6548$. These maps reveal the existence of a bright flattened disk-shaped structure in the core extending to r $\sim 10$ kpc and dominated by a chaotic velocity field. This structure is located in the wake of X-ray cavities and characterised by a high mean velocity dispersion of $134$ km/s. The disk-shaped structure is surrounded by an extended array of filaments spread out to $r\sim 50$ kpc that are 10 times fainter in flux, remarkably quiescent and has a uniform mean velocity dispersion of $44$ km/s. This stability is puzzling given that the cluster core exhibits several energetic phenomena. Based on these results, we argue that there are two mechanisms to form multiphase gas in clusters of galaxies: a first triggered in the wake of X-ray cavities leading to more turbulent multiphase gas and a second, distinct mechanism, that is gentle and leads to large-scale multiphase gas spread throughout the core.</description>

      <title>The fate of the interstellar medium in early-type galaxies. III. The mechanism of ISM removal and quenching of star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how galaxies quench their star formation is crucial for studies of galaxy evolution. Quenching is related to the cold gas decrease. In the first paper we showed that the dust removal timescale in early-type galaxies (ETGs) is about 2.5 Gyr. Here we present carbon monoxide (CO) and 21 cm hydrogen (H I) line observations of these galaxies and measure the timescale of removal of the cold interstellar medium (ISM). We find that all the cold ISM components (dust, molecular and atomic gas) decline at similar rates. This allows us to rule out a wide range of potential ISM removal mechanisms (including starburst-driven outflows, astration, a decline in the number of asymptotic giant branch stars), and artificial effects like stellar mass-age correlation, environmental influence, mergers, and selection bias, leaving ionization by evolved low-mass stars and ionization/outflows by supernovae Type Ia or active galactic nuclei as viable mechanisms. We also provide evidence for an internal origin of the detected ISM. Moreover, we find that the quenching of star formation in these galaxies cannot be explained by a reduction in gas amount alone, because the star formation rates (SFRs) decrease faster (on a timescale of about 1.8 Gyr) than the amount of cold gas. Furthermore, the star formation efficiency of the ETGs (SFE = SFR/MH2) is lower than that of star-forming galaxies, whereas their gas mass fractions (fH2 = MH2/M*) are normal. This may be explained by the stabilization of gas against fragmentation, for example due to morphological quenching, turbulence, or magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: Open clusters (OCs) are common in the Milky Way, but most of them remain undiscovered. There are numerous techniques (e.g., machine-learning algorithms) available for the exploration of OCs. However, each method has its limitations and therefore, different approaches to discovering OCs hold significant value. We develop a comprehensive approach method to automatically explore the data space and identify potential OC candidates with relatively reliable membership determination. This approach combines the techniques of HDBSCAN, GMM, and a novel cluster member identification technique, color excess constraint. The new method exhibits efficiency in detecting OCs while ensuring precise determination of cluster memberships. It is called Blind Search-Extra Constraint (BSEC) method. It is successfully applied to the Gaia DR3, and 83 new OCs are found. This study also reports 621 new OC candidates with discernible main sequence or red giant branch. The BSEC technique can discard some false negatives of previous works, which takes about 3 percentage of known clusters. As an extra constraint, color excess (or 2-color) constraint is useful for removing fake cluster member stars from the clusters that are identified from the positions and proper motions of stars, and getting more precise CMDs, when differential reddening of member stars of a cluster is not large (e.g., \DeltaE(G_BP -G_RP)&lt;0.5 mag). It makes the CMDs of 15 percent clusters clearer (in particular for the region near turnoff) and therefore is helpful for CMD and stellar population studies. Our result suggests that color excess constraint is more appropriate for clusters with small differential reddening, such as globular clusters or older OCs, and clusters that the distances of member stars cannot be determined accurately.</description>

      <title>ELUCID VIII: Simulating the Coma Galaxy Cluster to Calibrate Model and Understand Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conducted an investigation of the Coma cluster of galaxies by running a series of constrained hydrodynamic simulations with GIZMO-SIMBA and GADGET-3, based on initial conditions reconstructed from the SDSS survey volume in the ELUCID project. We compared simulation predictions and observations for galaxies, ICM and IGM in and around the Coma cluster to constrain galaxy formation physics. Our results demonstrate that this type of constrained investigation allows us to probe in more detail the implemented physical processes, because the comparison between simulations and observations is free of cosmic variance and hence can be conducted in a ''one-to-one'' manner. We found that an increase in the earlier star formation rate and the supernova feedback of the original GIZMO-SIMBA model is needed to match observational data on stellar, ISM and ICM metallicity. The simulations without AGN feedback can well reproduce the observational ICM electron density, temperature, and entropy profiles, ICM substructures, and the IGM temperature-density relation, while the ones with AGN feedback usually fail. However, one requires something like AGN feedback to reproduce a sufficiently large population of quiescent galaxies, particularly in low-density regions. The constrained simulations of the Coma cluster thus provide a test bed to understand processes that drive galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Insight into the Galactic Bulge Chemodynamical Properties from Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the chemodynamical properties of the Galaxy in the azimuthal velocity $V_\phi$ and metallicity [Fe/H] space using red giant stars from Gaia Data Release 3. The row-normalized $V_\phi$-[Fe/H] maps form a coherent sequence from the bulge to the outer disk, clearly revealing the thin/thick disk and the Splash. The metal-rich stars display bar-like kinematics while the metal-poor stars show dispersion-dominated kinematics. The intermediate-metallicity population ($-1&lt;$[Fe/H]$&lt;-0.4$) can be separated into two populations, one that is bar-like, i.e. dynamically cold ($\sigma_{V_R}\sim80$ $\rm km\ s^{-1}$) and fast rotating ($V_\phi\gtrsim100$ $\rm km\ s^{-1}$), and the Splash, which is dynamically hot ($\sigma_{V_R}\sim110$ $\rm km\ s^{-1}$) and slow rotating ($V_\phi\lesssim100$ $\rm km\ s^{-1}$). We compare the observations in the bulge region with an Auriga simulation where the last major merger event occurred $\sim10$ Gyr ago: only stars born around the time of the merger reveal a Splash-like feature in the $V_\phi$-[Fe/H] space, suggesting that the Splash is likely merger-induced, predominantly made-up of heated disk stars and the starburst associated with the last major merger. Since the Splash formed from the proto-disk, its lower metallicity limit coincides with that of the thick disk. The bar formed later from the dynamically hot disk with [Fe/H] $&gt;-1$ dex, with the Splash not participating in the bar formation and growth. Moreover, with a set of isolated evolving $N$-body disk simulations, we confirm that a non-rotating classical bulge can be spun up by the bar and develop cylindrical rotation, consistent with the observation for the metal-poor stars.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of quantum black and white hole horizons in an improved dynamic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14535v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quantum geometric effects near the locations where classical black hole horizons used to appear in Einstein's classical theory, within the framework of an improved dynamic approach, in which the internal region of a black hole is modeled by the Kantowski-Sachs (KS) spacetime and the two polymerization parameters are functions of the phase space variables. Our detailed analysis shows that the effects are so strong that black and white hole horizons of the effective quantum theory do not exist at all and instead are replaced by transition surfaces, across which the metric coefficients and their inverses are smooth and remain finite, as are the corresponding curvatures, including the Kretschmann scalar. These surfaces always separate trapped regions from anti-trapped regions. The number of such surfaces is infinite, so the corresponding KS spacetimes become geodesically complete, and no black and white hole-like structures exist in this scheme.</description>

      <title>The origin of supermassive black holes at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the steady spherically symmetric accretion in the combined potential of a central black hole and a dark matter halo. For the halo, we consider a Hernquist and an NFW potential and calculate the critical points of the flow. We find that the trans-sonic solution to the centre is not possible without a black hole, whereas two types of trans-sonic solutions are possible in its presence. We also derive the mass accretion rate for a black hole at the centre of a dark matter halo. Our results indicate two phases of accretion. The first is an initial phase with a low accretion rate that depends on the black hole mass, followed by a second phase with a high accretion rate that depends on the halo mass. In the second phase, the black hole mass increases rapidly to supermassive scales, which explains the existence of quasars at redshift $z\ge 6$ and also the recently detected supermassive black holes (SMBHs) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Further, we calculate the evolution of the Eddington ratio for growing black holes. The accretion is mostly sub-Eddington except for a short super-Eddington episode when the mass accretion rate transitions from low to high. However, during that episode, the black hole mass is likely inadequate to hinder accretion through radiative feedback.</description>

      <title>Resolving the explosion of supernova 2023ixf in Messier 101 within its complex circumstellar environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observing a supernova explosion shortly after it occurs can reveal important information about the physics of stellar explosions and the nature of the progenitor stars of supernovae (SNe). When a star with a well-defined edge explodes in vacuum, the first photons to escape from its surface appear as a brief shock-breakout flare. The duration of this flare can extend to at most a few hours even for nonspherical breakouts from supergiant stars, after which the explosion ejecta should expand and cool. Alternatively, for stars exploding within a distribution of sufficiently dense optically thick circumstellar material, the first photons escape from the material beyond the stellar edge, and the duration of the initial flare can extend to several days, during which the escaping emission indicates photospheric heating. The difficulty in detecting SN explosions promptly after the event has so far limited data regarding supergiant stellar explosions mostly to serendipitous observations that, owing to the lack of ultraviolet (UV) data, were unable to determine whether the early emission is heating or cooling, and hence the nature of the early explosion event. Here, we report observations of SN 2023ixf in the nearby galaxy M101, covering the early days of the event. Using UV spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as well as a comprehensive set of additional multiwavelength observations, we trace the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of the event and are able to temporally resolve the emergence and evolution of the SN emission.</description>

      <title>Fermi-bubble bulk and edge analysis reveals dust, cooling breaks, and cosmic-ray diffusion, facilitating a self-consistent model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The full, radio to $\gamma$-ray spectrum of the Fermi bubbles is shown to be consistent with standard strong-shock electron acceleration at the bubble edge, without the unnatural energy cutoffs and unrealistic electron cooling of previous studies, if the ambient interstellar radiation is strong; the $\gamma$-ray cooling break should then have a microwave counterpart, undetected until now. Indeed, a broadband bubble-edge analysis uncovers a pronounced downstream dust component, which masked the anticipated $\sim35$ GHz spectral break, and the same overall radio softening consistent with Kraichnan diffusion previously reported in $\gamma$-rays.</description>

      <title>XMM-Newton --NuSTAR monitoring campaign of the Seyfert 1 galaxy IC 4329A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a joint {\it XMM-Newton} and {\it NuSTAR} campaign on the active galactic nucleus (AGN) IC 4329A, consisting of 9 $\times$ 20 ks {\it XMM-Newton} observations, and 5 $\times$ 20 ks {\it NuSTAR} observations within nine days, performed in August 2021. Within each observation, the AGN is not very variable, with the fractional variability never exceeding 5%. Flux variations are observed between the different observations, on timescales of days, with a 30% ratio between the minimum and the maximum 2-10 keV flux. These variations follow the softer-when-brighter behavior typically observed in AGN. In all observations, a soft excess is clearly present. Consistently with previous observations, the X-ray spectra of the source exhibit a cut-off energy between 140 and 250 keV, constant within the error in the different observations. We detected a prominent component of the $6.4$\,keV Fe~K$\alpha$ line consistent with being constant during the monitoring, consisting of an unresolved narrow core and a broader component likely originating in the inner accredion disc. We find that the reflection component is weak ($R_{\rm max}=0.009\pm0.002$) and most likely originating in distant neutral medium. We also found the presence of a warm absorber component together with an ultra-fast outflow. Looking at their energetic, these outflows have enough mechanical power to exercise a significant feedback impact on the AGN surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>Non-evolutionary effects on period change in Magellanic Cepheids I. New binary systems revealed from Light Travel Time Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Period change studies give a window to probe into the evolution and dynamics of Cepheids. While evolutionary period changes have been well studied both observationally and theoretically, non-evolutionary period changes lack a systematic and quantitative description. The overall objective is to have a quantitative understanding of the full picture of non-evolutionary period changes in Cepheids, to develop a formalism to disentangle it from the secular evolutionary period change. In the first part of the series of works, we aim to conduct a systematic search for non-evolutionary period changes to search for Cepheids in likely binary configuration and quantify their incidence rates in the Magellanic Clouds. We collect more than decade-long time-series photometry from the publically available survey, Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), with more than 7200 Cepheids collectively from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our sample contains both fundamental-mode and first overtone-mode Cepheids. Then we calculate observed minus calculated ($O-C$) diagrams to reveal the light-travel time effect (LTTE). In our search, out of an overall sample of more than 7200 Cepheids, we found 52 candidate Cepheid binary systems in the LMC (30 fundamental and 22 first overtone-mode) and 145 in the SMC (85 fundamental and 60 first overtone-mode). The majority of the sample is characterized by orbital periods of 2000-4000\,d and eccentricities of 0.2-0.5. Moreover, we report two candidates in each galaxy with the Cepheid likely existing with a giant companion. The incidence rate ratio for SMC to LMC calculated from our sample is in agreement with binary Cepheid population synthesis predictions.</description>
