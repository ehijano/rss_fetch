      <title>Error Estimators for the Small-Biot Lumped Approximation for the Conduction Dunking Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dunking problem: a solid body at uniform temperature $T_{\text i}$ is placed in a environment characterized by farfield temperature $T_\infty$ and spatially uniform time-independent heat transfer coefficient. We permit heterogeneous material composition: spatially dependent density, specific heat, and thermal conductivity. Mathematically, the problem is described by a heat equation with Robin boundary conditions. The crucial parameter is the Biot number -- a nondimensional heat transfer (Robin) coefficient; we consider the limit of small Biot number.
  We introduce first-order and second-order asymptotic approximations (in Biot number) for several quantities of interest, notably the spatial domain average temperature as a function of time; the first-order approximation is simply the standard engineering `lumped' model. We then provide asymptotic error estimates for the first-order and second-order approximations for small Biot number, and also, for the first-order approximation, alternative strict bounds valid for all Biot number. Companion numerical solutions of the heat equation confirm the effectiveness of the error estimates for small Biot number.
  The second-order approximation and the first-order and second-order error estimates depend on several functional outputs associated to an elliptic partial differential equation; the latter is derived from Biot-sensitivity analysis of the heat equation eigenproblem in the limit of small Biot number. Most important is $\phi$, the only functional output required for the first-order error estimates; $\phi$ admits a simple physical interpretation in terms of conduction length scale. We investigate the domain and property dependence of $\phi$: most notably, we characterize spatial domains for which the standard lumped-model error criterion -- Biot number (based on volume-to-area length scale) small -- is deficient.</description>

      <title>Complex variable solution on noncircular and asymmetrical tunnelling embedded by bidirectional conformal mapping incorporating Charge Simulation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical issues of noncircular and asymmetrical tunnelling can be estimated using complex variable method with suitable conformal mapping. Exsiting solution schemes of conformal mapping for noncircular tunnel generally need iteration or optimization strategy, and are thereby mathematically complicated. This paper proposes a new bidirectional conformal mapping for deep and shallow tunnels of noncircular and asymmetrical shapes by incorporating Charge Simulation Method. The solution scheme of this new bidirectional conformal mapping only involves a pair of linear systems, and is therefore logically straight-forward, computationally efficient, and practically easy in coding. New numerical strategies are developed to deal with possible sharp corners of cavity by small arc simulation and densified collocation points. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the geometrical usage of the new bidirectional conformal mapping. Furthermore, the new bidirectional conformal mapping is embedded into two complex variable solutions of noncircular and asymmetrical shallow tunnelling in gravitational geomaterial with reasonable far-field displacement. The respective result comparisons with finite element solution and exsiting analytical solution show good agreements, indicating the feasible mechanical usage of the new bidirectional conformal mapping.</description>

      <title>Generalized Moving Least-Squares for Solving Vector-valued PDEs on Unknown Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the Generalized Moving Least-Squares (GMLS) method in two different ways to solve the vector-valued PDEs on unknown smooth 2D manifolds without boundaries embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, identified with randomly sampled point cloud data. The two approaches are referred to as the intrinsic method and the extrinsic method. For the intrinsic method which relies on local approximations of metric tensors, we simplify the formula of Laplacians and covariant derivatives acting on vector fields at the base point by calculating them in a local Monge coordinate system. On the other hand, the extrinsic method formulates tangential derivatives on a submanifold as the projection of the directional derivative in the ambient Euclidean space onto the tangent space of the submanifold. One challenge of this method is that the discretization of vector Laplacians yields a matrix whose size relies on the ambient dimension. To overcome this issue, we reduce the dimension of vector Laplacian matrices by employing an appropriate projection. The complexity of both methods scales well with the dimension of manifolds rather than the ambient dimension. We also present supporting numerical examples, including eigenvalue problems, linear Poisson equations, and nonlinear Burgers' equations, to examine the numerical accuracy of proposed methods on various smooth manifolds.</description>

      <title>Discrete Variable Topology Optimization Using Multi-Cut Formulation and Adaptive Trust Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new framework for solving general topology optimization (TO) problems that find an optimal material distribution within a design space to maximize the performance of a structure while satisfying design constraints. These problems involve state variables that nonlinearly depend on the design variables, with objective functions that can be convex or non-convex, and may include multiple candidate materials. The framework is designed to greatly enhance computational efficiency, primarily by diminishing optimization iteration counts and thereby reducing the solving of associated state-equilibrium partial differential equations (PDEs). It maintains binary design variables and addresses the large-scale mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem that arises from discretizing the design space and PDEs. The core of this framework is the integration of the generalized Benders' decomposition and adaptive trust regions. The trust-region radius adapts based on a merit function. To mitigate ill-conditioning due to extreme parameter values, we further introduce a parameter relaxation scheme where two parameters are relaxed in stages at different paces. Numerical tests validate the framework's superior performance, including minimum compliance and compliant mechanism problems in single-material and multi-material designs. We compare our results with those of other methods and demonstrate significant reductions in optimization iterations by about one order of magnitude, while maintaining comparable optimal objective function values. As the design variables and constraints increase, the framework maintains consistent solution quality and efficiency, underscoring its good scalability. We anticipate this framework will be especially advantageous for TO applications involving substantial design variables and constraints and requiring significant computational resources for PDE solving.</description>

      <title>Projection Methods for Operator Learning and Universal Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a new universal approximation theorem for continuous operators on arbitrary Banach spaces using the Leray-Schauder mapping. Moreover, we introduce and study a method for operator learning in Banach spaces $L^p$ of functions with multiple variables, based on orthogonal projections on polynomial bases. We derive a universal approximation result for operators where we learn a linear projection and a finite dimensional mapping under some additional assumptions. For the case of $p=2$, we give some sufficient conditions for the approximation results to hold. This article serves as the theoretical framework for a deep learning methodology whose implementation will be provided in subsequent work.</description>

      <title>On semi-implicit schemes for the incompressible Euler equations via the vanishing viscosity limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new type of systematic approach to study the incompressible Euler equations numerically via the vanishing viscosity limit is proposed in this work. We show the new strategy is unconditionally stable that the $L^2$-energy dissipates and $H^s$-norm is uniformly bounded in time without any restriction on the time step. Moreover, first-order convergence of the proposed method is established including both low regularity and high regularity error estimates. The proposed method is extended to full discretization with a newly developed iterative Fourier spectral scheme. Another main contributions of this work is to propose a new integration by parts technique to lower the regularity requirement from $H^4$ to $H^3$ in order to perform the $L^2$-error estimate. To our best knowledge, this is one of the very first work to study incompressible Euler equations by designing stable numerical schemes via the inviscid limit with rigorous analysis. Furthermore, we will present both low and high regularity errors from numerical experiments and demonstrate the dynamics in several benchmark examples.</description>

      <title>A note on improvement by iteration for the approximate solutions of second kind Fredholm integral equations with Green's kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a linear operator equation $x - Kx = f$, where $f$ is given and $K$ is a Fredholm integral operator with a Green's function type kernel defined on $C[0, 1]$. For $r \geq 1$, we employ the interpolatory projection at $2r + 1$ collocation points (not necessarily Gauss points) onto a space of piecewise polynomials of degree $\leq 2r$ with respect to a uniform partition of $[0, 1]$. Previous researchers have established that the iteration in case of the collocation method improves the order of convergence by projection methods and its variants in the case of smooth kernel with piecewise polynomials of even degree only. In this article, we demonstrate the improvement in order of convergence by modified collocation method when the kernel is of Green's function type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an energy-based model, which seems especially suited for constrained systems. The proposed model provides an alternative to the popular port-Hamiltonian framework and exhibits similar properties such as energy dissipation as well as structure-preserving interconnection and Petrov-Galerkin projection. In terms of time discretization, the midpoint rule and discrete gradient methods are dissipation-preserving. Besides the verification of these properties, we present ten examples from different fields of application.</description>

      <title>An extrapolation-driven network architecture for physics-informed deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has emerged as a highly popular and effective approach for solving partial differential equations(PDEs). In this paper, we first investigate the extrapolation capability of the PINN method for time-dependent PDEs. Taking advantage of this extrapolation property, we can generalize the training result obtained in the time subinterval to the large interval by adding a correction term to the network parameters of the subinterval. The correction term is determined by further training with the sample points in the added subinterval. Secondly, by designing an extrapolation control function with special characteristics and combining it with the correction term, we construct a new neural network architecture whose network parameters are coupled with the time variable, which we call the extrapolation-driven network architecture. Based on this architecture, using a single neural network, we can obtain the overall PINN solution of the whole domain with the following two characteristics: (1) it completely inherits the local solution of the interval obtained from the previous training, (2) at the interval node, it strictly maintains the continuity and smoothness that the true solution has. The extrapolation-driven network architecture allows us to divide a large time domain into multiple subintervals and solve the time-dependent PDEs one by one in chronological order. This training scheme respects the causality principle and effectively overcomes the difficulties of the conventional PINN method in solving the evolution equation on a large time domain. Numerical experiments verify the performance of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Generalized mixed and primal hybrid methods with applications to plate bending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extended framework for hybrid finite element approximations of self-adjoint, positive definite operators. It covers the cases of primal, mixed, and ultraweak formulations, both at the continuous and discrete levels, and gives rise to conforming discretizations. Our framework allows for flexible continuity restrictions across elements, and includes the extreme cases of conforming and discontinuous hybrid methods. We illustrate an application of the framework to the Kirchhoff-Love plate pending model and present three primal hybrid and two mixed hybrid methods, four of them with numerical examples. In particular, we present conforming frameworks for (in classical meaning) non-conforming elements of Morley, Zienkiewicz triangular, and Hellan-Herrmann-Johnson types.</description>

      <title>The significance of the configuration space Lie group for the constraint satisfaction in numerical time integration of multibody systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics simulation of multibody systems (MBS) using spatial velocities (non-holonomic velocities) requires time integration of the dynamics equations together with the kinematic reconstruction equations (relating time derivatives of configuration variables to rigid body velocities). The latter are specific to the geometry of the rigid body motion underlying a particular formulation, and thus to the used configuration space (c-space). The proper c-space of a rigid body is the Lie group SE(3), and the geometry is that of the screw motions. The rigid bodies within a MBS are further subjected to geometric constraints, often due to lower kinematic pairs that define SE(3) subgroups. Traditionally, however, in MBS dynamics the translations and rotations are parameterized independently, which implies the use of the direct product group $SO\left( 3\right) \times {\Bbb R}^{3}$ as rigid body c-space, although this does not account for rigid body motions. Hence, its appropriateness was recently put into perspective. In this paper the significance of the c-space for the constraint satisfaction in numerical time stepping schemes is analyzed for holonomicaly constrained MBS modeled with the 'absolute coordinate' approach, i.e. using the Newton-Euler equations for the individual bodies subjected to geometric constraints. It is shown that the geometric constraints a body is subjected to are exactly satisfied if they constrain the motion to a subgroup of its c-space. Since only the $SE\left( 3\right) $ subgroups have a practical significance it is regarded as the appropriate c-space for the constrained rigid body. Consequently the constraints imposed by lower pair joints are exactly satisfied if the joint connects a body to the ground. For a general MBS, where the motions are not constrained to a subgroup, the SE(3) and $SO\left( 3\right) \times {\Bbb R}^{3}$ yield the same order of accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We present a natural framework for constructing energy-stable time discretization schemes. By leveraging the Onsager principle, we demonstrate its efficacy in formulating partial differential equation models for diverse gradient flow systems.

      <title>Sparsifying dimensionality reduction of PDE solution data with Bregman learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical model reduction techniques project the governing equations onto a linear subspace of the original state space. More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. Whilst those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initialized a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modelling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% less parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.</description>

      <title>Modeling, Inference, and Prediction in Mobility-Based Compartmental Models for Epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical compartmental models in epidemiology often struggle to accurately capture real-world dynamics due to their inability to address the inherent heterogeneity of populations. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that incorporates heterogeneity through a mobility variable, transforming the traditional ODE system into a system of integro-differential equations that describe the dynamics of population densities across different compartments. Our results show that, for the same basic reproduction number, our mobility-based model predicts a smaller final pandemic size compared to classic compartmental models, whose population densities are represented as Dirac delta functions in our density-based framework. This addresses the overestimation issue common in many classical models. Additionally, we demonstrate that the time series of the infected population is sufficient to uniquely identify the mobility distribution. We reconstruct this distribution using a machine-learning-based framework, providing both theoretical and algorithmic support to effectively constrain the mobility-based model with real-world data.</description>

      <title>Block Matrix and Tensor Randomized Kaczmarz Methods for Linear Feasibility Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The randomized Kaczmarz methods are a popular and effective family of iterative methods for solving large-scale linear systems of equations, which have also been applied to linear feasibility problems. In this work, we propose a new block variant of the randomized Kaczmarz method, B-MRK, for solving linear feasibility problems defined by matrices. We show that B-MRK converges linearly in expectation to the feasible region.Furthermore, we extend the method to solve tensor linear feasibility problems defined under the tensor t-product. A tensor randomized Kaczmarz (TRK) method, TRK-L, is proposed for solving linear feasibility problems that involve mixed equality and inequality constraints. Additionally, we introduce another TRK method, TRK-LB, specifically tailored for cases where the feasible region is defined by linear equality constraints coupled with bound constraints on the variables. We show that both of the TRK methods converge linearly in expectation to the feasible region. Moreover, the effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated through numerical experiments on various Gaussian random data and applications in image deblurring.</description>

Abstract: We present a new, monolithic first--order (both in time and space) BSSNOK formulation of the coupled Einstein--Euler equations. The entire system of hyperbolic PDEs is solved in a completely unified manner via one single numerical scheme applied to both the conservative sector of the matter part and to the first--order strictly non--conservative sector of the spacetime evolution. The coupling between matter and space-time is achieved via algebraic source terms. The numerical scheme used for the solution of the new monolithic first order formulation is a path-conservative central WENO (CWENO) finite difference scheme, with suitable insertions to account for the presence of the non--conservative terms. By solving several crucial tests of numerical general relativity, including a stable neutron star, Riemann problems in relativistic matter with shock waves and the stable long-time evolution of single and binary puncture black holes up and beyond the binary merger, we show that our new CWENO scheme, introduced two decades ago for the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics, can be successfully applied also to numerical general relativity, solving all equations at the same time with one single numerical method. In the future the new monolithic approach proposed in this paper may become an attractive alternative to traditional methods that couple central finite difference schemes with Kreiss-Oliger dissipation for the space-time part with totally different TVD schemes for the matter evolution and which are currently the state of the art in the field.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Computational Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes are an introduction to fluctuating hydrodynamics (FHD) and the formulation of numerical schemes for the resulting stochastic partial differential equations (PDEs). Fluctuating hydrodynamics was originally introduced by Landau and Lifshitz as a way to put thermal fluctuations into a continuum framework by including a stochastic forcing to each dissipative transport process (e.g., heat flux). While FHD has been useful in modeling transport and fluid dynamics at the mesoscopic scale, theoretical calculations have been feasible only with simplifying assumptions. As such there is great interest in numerical schemes for Computational Fluctuating Hydrodynamics (CFHD). There are a variety of algorithms (e.g., spectral, finite element, lattice Boltzmann) but in this introduction we focus on finite volume schemes. Accompanying these notes is a demonstration program in Python available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Almost conservation of the harmonic actions for fully discretized nonlinear Klein--Gordon equations at low regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Close to the origin, the nonlinear Klein--Gordon equations on the circle are nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems which have infinitely many almost conserved quantities called harmonic actions or super-actions. We prove that, at low regularity and with a CFL number of size 1, this property is preserved if we discretize the nonlinear Klein--Gordon equations with the symplectic mollified impulse methods. This extends previous results of D. Cohen, E. Hairer and C. Lubich to non-smooth solutions.</description>

      <title>A hybrid reduced-order model for segregated fluid-structure interaction solvers in an ALE approach at high Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a first step for constructing a hybrid reduced-order models (ROMs) for segregated fluid-structure interaction in an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach at a high Reynolds number using the Finite Volume Method (FVM). The ROM is driven by proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with hybrid techniques that combines the classical Galerkin projection and two data-driven methods (radial basis networks , and neural networks/ long short term memory). Results demonstrate the ROM ability to accurately capture the physics of fluid-structure interaction phenomena. This approach is validated through a case study focusing on flow-induced vibration (FIV) of a pitch-plunge airfoil at a high Reynolds number 10000000.</description>

      <title>The Mathematics of Dots and Pixels: On the Theoretical Foundations of Image Halftoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of image halftoning, from its analog roots to contemporary digital methodologies, encapsulates a fascinating journey marked by technological advancements and creative innovations. Yet the theoretical understanding of halftoning is much more recent.
  In this article, we explore various approaches towards shedding light on the design of halftoning approaches and why they work. We discuss both halftoning in a continuous domain and on a pixel grid.
  We start by reviewing the mathematical foundation of the so-called electrostatic halftoning method, which departed from the heuristic of considering the back dots of the halftoned image as charged particles attracted by the grey values of the image in combination with mutual repulsion. Such an attraction-repulsion model can be mathematically represented via an energy functional in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space allowing for a rigorous analysis of the resulting optimization problem as well as a convergence analysis in a suitable topology.
  A second class of methods that we discuss in detail is the class of error diffusion schemes, arguably among the most popular halftoning techniques due to their ability to work directly on a pixel grid and their ease of application. The main idea of these schemes is to choose the locations of the black pixels via a recurrence relation designed to agree with the image in terms of the local averages. We discuss some recent mathematical understanding of these methods that is based on a connection to Sigma-Delta quantizers, a popular class of algorithms for analog-to-digital conversion.</description>

      <title>Zeroing neural dynamics solving time-variant complex conjugate matrix equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex conjugate matrix equations (CCME) have aroused the interest of many researchers because of computations and antilinear systems. Existing research is dominated by its time-invariant solving methods, but lacks proposed theories for solving its time-variant version. Moreover, artificial neural networks are rarely studied for solving CCME. In this paper, starting with the earliest CCME, zeroing neural dynamics (ZND) is applied to solve its time-variant version. Firstly, the vectorization and Kronecker product in the complex field are defined uniformly. Secondly, Con-CZND1 model and Con-CZND2 model are proposed and theoretically prove convergence and effectiveness. Thirdly, three numerical experiments are designed to illustrate the effectiveness of the two models, compare their differences, highlight the significance of neural dynamics in the complex field, and refine the theory related to ZND.</description>

      <title>A Compact Coupling Interface Method with Accurate Gradient Approximation for Elliptic Interface Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.12414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the Compact Coupling Interface Method (CCIM), a finite difference method capable of obtaining second-order accurate approximations of not only solution values but their gradients, for elliptic complex interface problems with interfacial jump conditions. Such elliptic interface boundary value problems with interfacial jump conditions are a critical part of numerous applications in fields such as heat conduction, fluid flow, materials science, and protein docking, to name a few. A typical example involves the construction of biomolecular shapes, where such elliptic interface problems are in the form of linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equations, involving discontinuous dielectric constants across the interface, that govern electrostatic contributions. Additionally, when interface dynamics are involved, the normal velocity of the interface might be comprised of the normal derivatives of solution, which can be approximated to second-order by our method, resulting in accurate interface dynamics. Our method, which can be formulated in arbitrary spatial dimensions, combines elements of the highly-regarded Coupling Interface Method, for such elliptic interface problems, and Smereka's second-order accurate discrete delta function. The result is a variation and hybrid with a more compact stencil than that found in the Coupling Interface Method, and with advantages, borne out in numerical experiments involving both geometric model problems and complex biomolecular surfaces, in more robust error profiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new Monte Carlo-based estimator for digital options with assets modelled by a stochastic differential equation (SDE). The new estimator is based on repeated path splitting and relies on the correlation of approximate paths of the underlying SDE that share parts of a Brownian path. Combining this new estimator with Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) leads to an estimator with a computational complexity that is similar to the complexity of a MLMC estimator when applied to options with Lipschitz payoffs.

Abstract: In this paper, two new families of fourth-order explicit exponential Runge--Kutta (ERK) methods with four stages are studied for solving first-order differential systems $y'(t)+My(t)=f(y(t))$. By comparing the Taylor series of the exact solution, the order conditions of these ERK methods are derived, which are exactly identical to the order conditions of explicit Runge--Kutta methods, and these ERK methods reduce to classical Runge--Kutta methods once $M\rightarrow \mathbf{0}$. Moreover, we analyze the stability properties and the convergence of the new methods. Several numerical examples are implemented to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of these ERK methods by comparison with standard exponential integrators.</description>

      <title>Two arbitrary-order constraint-preserving schemes for the Yang--Mills equations on polyhedral meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two numerical schemes are proposed and investigated for the Yang--Mills equations, which can be seen as a nonlinear generalisation of the Maxwell equations set on Lie algebra-valued functions, with similarities to certain formulations of General Relativity. Both schemes are built on the Discrete de Rham (DDR) method, and inherit from its main features: an arbitrary order of accuracy, and applicability to generic polyhedral meshes. They make use of the complex property of the DDR, together with a Lagrange-multiplier approach, to preserve, at the discrete level, a nonlinear constraint associated with the Yang--Mills equations. We also show that the schemes satisfy a discrete energy dissipation (the dissipation coming solely from the implicit time stepping). Issues around the practical implementations of the schemes are discussed; in particular, the assembly of the local contributions in a way that minimises the price we pay in dealing with nonlinear terms, in conjunction with the tensorisation coming from the Lie algebra. Numerical tests are provided using a manufactured solution, and show that both schemes display a convergence in $L^2$-norm of the potential and electrical fields in $\mathcal O(h^{k+1})$ (provided that the time step is of that order), where $k$ is the polynomial degree chosen for the DDR complex. We also numerically demonstrate the preservation of the constraint.</description>

      <title>Variational Model-Based Reconstruction Techniques for Multi-Patch Data in Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>

Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging is an emerging imaging modality through which it is possible to detect tracers containing superparamagnetic nanoparticles. The exposure of the particles to dynamic magnetic fields generates a non-linear response that is used to locate the particles and produce an image of their distribution. The bounding box that can be covered by a single scan curve depends on the strength of the gradients of the magnetic fields applied, which is limited due to the risk of causing peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) in the patients. To address this issue, multiple scans are performed. The scan data must be merged together to produce reconstructions of larger regions of interest. In this paper we propose a mathematical framework which can deal with rather general multi-patching scenarios including rigid transformations of the field of view (FoV), the specimen and of the scanner. We show the flexibility of this framework in a variety of different scanning scenarios. Moreover, we describe an iterative reconstruction algorithm that yields a reconstruction of the target distribution by minimizing a convex functional which includes positivity constraints and sparsity enforcing priors. We show its convergence to a minimizer and perform numerical experiments on simulated data.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the discretization of a homogenization and dimension reduction model for the elastic deformation of microstructured thin plates proposed by Hornung, Neukamm, and Vel\v{c}i\'c in 2014. Thereby, a nonlinear bending energy is based on a homogenized quadratic form which acts on the second fundamental form associated with the elastic deformation. Convergence is proven for a multi-affine finite element discretization of the involved three-dimensional microscopic cell problems and a discrete Kirchhoff triangle discretization of the two-dimensional isometry-constrained macroscopic problem. Finally, the convergence properties are numerically verified in selected test cases and qualitatively compared with deformation experiments for microstructured sheets of paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze and test using Fourier extensions that minimize a Hilbert space norm for the purpose of solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on surfaces. In particular, we prove that the approach is arbitrarily high-order and also show a general result relating boundedness, solvability, and convergence that can be used to find eigenvalues. The method works by extending a solution to a surface PDE into a box-shaped domain so that the differential operators of the extended function agree with the surface differential operators, as in the Closest Point Method. This differs from approaches that require a basis for the surface of interest, which may not be available. Numerical experiments are also provided, demonstrating super-algebraic convergence. Current high-order methods for surface PDEs are often limited to a small class of surfaces or use radial basis functions (RBFs). Our approach offers certain advantages related to conditioning, generality, and ease of implementation. The method is meshfree and works on arbitrary surfaces (closed or non-closed) defined by point clouds with minimal conditions.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel eXtended virtual element method, an extension of the conforming virtual element method. The XVEM is formulated by incorporating appropriate enrichment functions in the local spaces. The method is designed to handle highly generic enrichment functions, including singularities arising from fractured domains. By achieving consistency on the enrichment space, the method is proven to achieve arbitrary approximation orders even in the presence of singular solutions. The paper includes a complete convergence analysis under general assumptions on mesh regularity, and numerical experiments validating the method's accuracy on various mesh families, demonstrating optimal convergence rates in the $L^2$- and $H^1$-norms on fractured or L-shaped domains.</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation of complex Ginzburg--Landau equations using high-order exponential-type methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the task of efficiently computing the numerical solution of evolutionary complex Ginzburg--Landau equations on Cartesian product domains with homogeneous Dirichlet/Neumann or periodic boundary conditions. To this aim, we employ for the time integration high-order exponential methods of splitting and Lawson type with constant time step size. These schemes enjoy favorable stability properties and, in particular, do not show restrictions on the time step size due to the underlying stiffness of the models. The needed actions of matrix exponentials are efficiently realized by using a tensor-oriented approach that suitably employs the so-called $\mu$-mode product (when the semidiscretization in space is performed with finite differences) or with pointwise operations in Fourier space (when the model is considered with periodic boundary conditions). The overall effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by running simulations on a variety of two- and three-dimensional (systems of) complex Ginzburg--Landau equations with cubic or cubic-quintic nonlinearities, which are widely considered in literature to model relevant physical phenomena. In fact, we show that high-order exponential-type schemes may outperform standard techniques to integrate in time the models under consideration, i.e., the well-known second-order split-step method and the explicit fourth-order Runge--Kutta integrator, for stringent accuracies.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Primitive Conservative Solver for the Euler Equations with Arbitrary Equation of State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a procedure to solve the Euler equations by explicitly updating, in a conservative manner, a generic thermodynamic variable such as temperature, pressure or entropy instead of the total energy. The presented procedure is valid for any equation of state and spatial discretization. When using complex equations of state such as Span-Wagner, choosing the temperature as the generic thermodynamic variable yields great reductions in the computational costs associated to thermodynamic evaluations. Results computed with a state of the art thermodynamic model are presented, and computational times are analyzed. Particular attention is dedicated to the conservation of total energy, the propagation speed of shock waves and jump conditions. The procedure is thoroughly tested using the Span-Wagner equation of state through the CoolProp thermodynamic library and the Van der Waals equation of state, both in the ideal and non-ideal compressible fluid-dynamics regimes, by comparing it to the standard total energy update and analytical solutions where available.</description>

      <title>Randomized Large-Scale Quaternion Matrix Approximation: Practical Rangefinders and One-Pass Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, randomized algorithms for low-rank approximation of quaternion matrices have received increasing attention. However, for large-scale problems, existing quaternion orthonormalizations are inefficient, leading to slow rangefinders. To address this, by appropriately leveraging efficient scientific computing libraries in the complex arithmetic, this work devises two practical quaternion rangefinders, one of which is non-orthonormal yet well-conditioned. They are then integrated into the quaternion version of a one-pass algorithm, which originally takes orthonormal rangefinders only. We establish the error bounds and demonstrate that the error is proportional to the condition number of the rangefinder. The probabilistic bounds are exhibited for both quaternion Gaussian and sub-Gaussian embeddings. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the one-pass algorithm with the proposed rangefinders significantly outperforms previous techniques in efficiency. Additionally, we tested the algorithm in a 3D Navier-Stokes equation ($5.22$GB) and a 4D Lorenz-type chaotic system ($5.74$GB) data compression, as well as a $31365\times 27125$ image compression to demonstrate its capability for handling large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Pathwise uniform convergence of a full discretization for a three-dimensional stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a full discretization of a three-dimensional stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with multiplicative noise. The discretization uses the Euler scheme for temporal discretization and the finite element method for spatial discretization. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of a novel stability estimate for a discrete stochastic convolution, which plays a crucial role in establishing pathwise uniform convergence estimates for fully discrete approximations of nonlinear stochastic parabolic equations. By using this stability estimate in conjunction with the discrete stochastic maximal $L^p$-regularity estimate, the study derives a pathwise uniform convergence rate that encompasses general general spatial $L^q$-norms. Moreover, the theoretical convergence rate is verified by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Finite-difference least square methods for solving Hamilton-Jacobi equations using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple algorithm to approximate the viscosity solution of Hamilton-Jacobi~(HJ) equations by means of an artificial deep neural network. The algorithm uses a stochastic gradient descent-based algorithm to minimize the least square principle defined by a monotone, consistent numerical scheme. We analyze the least square principle's critical points and derive conditions that guarantee that any critical point approximates the sought viscosity solution. The use of a deep artificial neural network on a finite difference scheme lifts the restriction of conventional finite difference methods that rely on computing functions on a fixed grid. This feature makes it possible to solve HJ equations posed in higher dimensions where conventional methods are infeasible. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm through numerical studies on various canonical HJ equations across different dimensions, showcasing its potential and versatility.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation analysis of a two-dimensional magnetic Rayleigh-B\'enard problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a bifurcation analysis of a two-dimensional magnetic Rayleigh--B\'enard problem using a numerical technique called deflated continuation. Our aim is to study the influence of the magnetic field on the bifurcation diagram as the Chandrasekhar number $Q$ increases and compare it to the standard (non-magnetic) Rayleigh--B\'enard problem. We compute steady states at a high Chandrasekhar number of $Q=10^3$ over a range of the Rayleigh number $0\leq \Ra\leq 10^5$. These solutions are obtained by combining deflation with a continuation of steady states at low Chandrasekhar number, which allows us to explore the influence of the strength of the magnetic field as $Q$ increases from low coupling, where the magnetic effect is almost negligible, to strong coupling at $Q=10^3$. We discover a large profusion of states with rich dynamics and observe a complex bifurcation structure with several pitchfork, Hopf, and saddle-node bifurcations. Our numerical simulations show that the onset of bifurcations in the problem is delayed when $Q$ increases, while solutions with fluid velocity patterns aligning with the background vertical magnetic field are privileged. Additionally, we report a branch of states that stabilizes at high magnetic coupling, suggesting that one may take advantage of the magnetic field to discriminate solutions.</description>

      <title>A generalizable framework for low-rank tensor completion with numerical priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05881v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Tensor Completion, a method which exploits the inherent structure of tensors, has been studied extensively as an effective approach to tensor completion. Whilst such methods attained great success, none have systematically considered exploiting the numerical priors of tensor elements. Ignoring numerical priors causes loss of important information regarding the data, and therefore prevents the algorithms from reaching optimal accuracy. Despite the existence of some individual works which consider ad hoc numerical priors for specific tasks, no generalizable frameworks for incorporating numerical priors have appeared. We present the Generalized CP Decomposition Tensor Completion (GCDTC) framework, the first generalizable framework for low-rank tensor completion that takes numerical priors of the data into account. We test GCDTC by further proposing the Smooth Poisson Tensor Completion (SPTC) algorithm, an instantiation of the GCDTC framework, whose performance exceeds current state-of-the-arts by considerable margins in the task of non-negative tensor completion, exemplifying GCDTC's effectiveness. Our code is open-source.</description>

      <title>Generalized pair-wise logit dynamic and its connection to a mean field game: theoretical and computational investigations focusing on resource management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logit dynamics are evolution equations that describe transitions to equilibria of actions among many players. We formulate a pair-wise logit dynamic in a continuous action space with a generalized exponential function, which we call a generalized pair-wise logit dynamic, depicted by a new evolution equation nonlocal in space. We prove the well-posedness and approximability of the generalized pair-wise logit dynamic to show that it is computationally implementable. We also show that this dynamic has an explicit connection to a mean field game of a controlled pure-jump process, with which the two different mathematical models can be understood in a unified way. Particularly, we show that the generalized pair-wise logit dynamic is derived as a myopic version of the corresponding mean field game, and that the conditions to guarantee the existence of unique solutions are different from each other. The key in this procedure is to find the objective function to be optimized in the mean field game based on the logit function. The monotonicity of the utility is unnecessary for the generalized pair-wise logit dynamic but crucial for the mean field game. Finally, we present applications of the two approaches to fisheries management problems with collected data.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo on Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explicit, momentum-based dynamics for optimizing functions defined on Lie groups was recently constructed, based on techniques such as variational optimization and left trivialization. We appropriately add tractable noise to the optimization dynamics to turn it into a sampling dynamics, leveraging the advantageous feature that the trivialized momentum variable is Euclidean despite that the potential function lives on a manifold. We then propose a Lie-group MCMC sampler, by delicately discretizing the resulting kinetic-Langevin-type sampling dynamics. The Lie group structure is exactly preserved by this discretization. Exponential convergence with explicit convergence rate for both the continuous dynamics and the discrete sampler are then proved under $W_2$ distance. Only compactness of the Lie group and geodesically $L$-smoothness of the potential function are needed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence result for kinetic Langevin on curved spaces, and also the first quantitative result that requires no convexity or, at least not explicitly, any common relaxation such as isoperimetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Newton's method for finding zeros of mappings from a manifold $\mathcal{X}$ into a vector bundle $\mathcal{E}$. In this setting a connection on $\mathcal{E}$ is required to render the Newton equation well defined, and a retraction on $\mathcal{X}$ is needed to compute a Newton update. We discuss local convergence in terms of suitable differentiability concepts, using a Banach space variant of a Riemannian distance. We also carry over an affine covariant damping strategy to our setting. Finally, we will discuss some applications of our approach, namely, finding fixed points of vector fields, variational problems on manifolds and finding critical points of functionals.</description>

      <title>BiLO: Bilevel Local Operator Learning for PDE inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new neural network based method for solving inverse problems for partial differential equations (PDEs) by formulating the PDE inverse problem as a bilevel optimization problem. At the upper level, we minimize the data loss with respect to the PDE parameters. At the lower level, we train a neural network to locally approximate the PDE solution operator in the neighborhood of a given set of PDE parameters, which enables an accurate approximation of the descent direction for the upper level optimization problem. The lower level loss function includes the L2 norms of both the residual and its derivative with respect to the PDE parameters. We apply gradient descent simultaneously on both the upper and lower level optimization problems, leading to an effective and fast algorithm. The method, which we refer to as BiLO (Bilevel Local Operator learning), is also able to efficiently infer unknown functions in the PDEs through the introduction of an auxiliary variable. Through extensive experiments over multiple PDE systems, we demonstrate that our method enforces strong PDE constraints, is robust to sparse and noisy data, and eliminates the need to balance the residual and the data loss, which is inherent to the soft PDE constraints in many existing methods.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Difficulty of Solving Cauchy Problems with PINNs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained popularity in scientific computing in recent years. However, they often fail to achieve the same level of accuracy as classical methods in solving differential equations. In this paper, we identify two sources of this issue in the case of Cauchy problems: the use of $L^2$ residuals as objective functions and the approximation gap of neural networks. We show that minimizing the sum of $L^2$ residual and initial condition error is not sufficient to guarantee the true solution, as this loss function does not capture the underlying dynamics. Additionally, neural networks are not capable of capturing singularities in the solutions due to the non-compactness of their image sets. This, in turn, influences the existence of global minima and the regularity of the network. We demonstrate that when the global minimum does not exist, machine precision becomes the predominant source of achievable error in practice. We also present numerical experiments in support of our theoretical claims.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, square-root formulations of the statistical linear regression filter and smoother are developed. Crucially, the method uses QR decompositions rather than Cholesky downdates. This makes the method inherently more numerically robust than the downdate based methods, which may fail in the face of rounding errors. This increased robustness is demonstrated in an ill-conditioned problem, where it is compared against a reference implementation in both double and single precision arithmetic. The new implementation is found to be more robust, when implemented in lower precision arithmetic as compared to the alternative.</description>

      <title>Boundary-field formulation for transient electromagnetic scattering by dielectric scatterers and coated conductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the transient scattered and transmitted fields generated when an incident electromagnetic wave impinges on a dielectric scatterer or a coated conductor embedded in an infinite space. By applying a boundary-field equation method, we reformulate the problem in the Laplace domain using the electric field equation inside the scatterer and a system of boundary integral equations for the scattered electric field in free space. To analyze this nonlocal boundary problem, we replace it by an equivalent boundary value problem. Existence, uniqueness and stability of the weak solution to the equivalent BVP are established in appropriate function spaces in terms of the Laplace transformed variable. The stability bounds are translated into time-domain estimates which determine the regularity of the solution in terms of the regularity of the problem data. These estimates can be easily converted into error estimates for a numerical discretization on the convolution quadrature for time evolution.</description>

      <title>Approximate Contraction of Arbitrary Tensor Networks with a Flexible and Efficient Density Matrix Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network contractions are widely used in statistical physics, quantum computing, and computer science. We introduce a method to efficiently approximate tensor network contractions using low-rank approximations, where each intermediate tensor generated during the contractions is approximated as a low-rank binary tree tensor network. The proposed algorithm has the flexibility to incorporate a large portion of the environment when performing low-rank approximations, which can lead to high accuracy for a given rank. Here, the environment refers to the remaining set of tensors in the network, and low-rank approximations with larger environments can generally provide higher accuracy. For contracting tensor networks defined on lattices, the proposed algorithm can be viewed as a generalization of the standard boundary-based algorithms. In addition, the algorithm includes a cost-efficient density matrix algorithm for approximating a tensor network with a general graph structure into a tree structure, whose computational cost is asymptotically upper-bounded by that of the standard algorithm that uses canonicalization. Experimental results indicate that the proposed technique outperforms previously proposed approximate tensor network contraction algorithms for multiple problems in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</description>
