      <title>Modelling shock propagation and resilience in financial temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling how a shock propagates in a temporal network and how the system relaxes back to equilibrium is challenging but important in many applications, such as financial systemic risk. Most studies so far have focused on shocks hitting a link of the network, while often it is the node and its propensity to be connected that are affected by a shock. Using as starting point the configuration model, a specific Exponential Random Graph model, we propose a vector autoregressive (VAR) framework to analytically compute the Impulse Response Function (IRF) of a network metric conditional to a shock on a node. Unlike the standard VAR, the model is a nonlinear function of the shock size and the IRF depends on the state of the network at the shock time. We propose a novel econometric estimation method that combines the Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Kalman filter to estimate the dynamics of the latent parameters and compute the IRF, and we apply the proposed methodology to the dynamical network describing the electronic Market of Interbank Deposit (e-MID).</description>

      <title>A new approach to principal-agent problems with volatility control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent work by Cvitani\'c, Possama\"i, and Touzi (2018) [9] presents a general approach for continuous-time principal-agent problems, through dynamic programming and second-order backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). In this paper, we provide an alternative formulation of the principal-agent problem, which can be solved simply by relying on the theory of BSDEs. This reformulation is strongly inspired by an important remark in [9], namely that if the principal observes the output process in continuous-time, she can compute its quadratic variation pathwise. While in [9], this information is used in the contract, our reformulation consists in assuming that the principal could directly control this process, in a `first-best' fashion. The resolution approach for this alternative problem actually follows the line of the so-called `Sannikov's trick' in the literature on continuous-time principal-agent problems, as originally introduced by Sannikov (2008) [28]. We then show that the solution to this `first-best' formulation is identical to the solution of the original problem. More precisely, using the contract form introduced in [9] as `penalisation contracts', we highlight that this `first-best' scenario can be achieved even if the principal cannot directly control the quadratic variation. Nevertheless, we do not have to rely on the theory of 2BSDEs to prove that such contracts are optimal, as their optimality is ensured by showing that the `first-best' scenario is achieved. We believe that this more straightforward approach to solve continuous-time principal-agent problems with volatility control will facilitate the dissemination of these problems across many fields, and its extension to even more intricate problems.</description>

      <title>The heterogeneous impact of the EU-Canada agreement with causal machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a causal machine learning approach to investigate the impact of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA). We propose a matrix completion algorithm on French customs data to obtain multidimensional counterfactuals at the firm, product and destination levels. We find a small but significant positive impact on average at the product-level intensive margin. On the other hand, the extensive margin shows product churning due to the treaty beyond regular entry-exit dynamics: one product in eight that was not previously exported substitutes almost as many that are no longer exported. When we delve into the heterogeneity, we find that the effects of the treaty are higher for products at a comparative advantage. Focusing on multiproduct firms, we find that they adjust their portfolio in Canada by reallocating towards their first and most exported product due to increasing local market competition after trade liberalization. Finally, multidimensional counterfactuals allow us to evaluate the general equilibrium effect of the CETA. Specifically, we observe trade diversion, as exports to other destinations are re-directed to Canada.</description>
