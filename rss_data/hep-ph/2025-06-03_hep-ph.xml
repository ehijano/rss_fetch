      <title>Energy loss and theoretical uncertainties in small quark-gluon plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a perturbative-quantum-chromodynamics-based energy loss model with small system size corrections to both radiative and elastic energy loss, incorporating realistic collision geometry, production spectra, and fragmentation. We use the Djordjevic-Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev (DGLV) radiative energy loss model and add back in previously neglected terms suppressed by system size. This small system size correction, derived by Kolbe and Horowitz, is large for high-momentum pions, raising concerns about key approximations in the radiative energy loss. We analyse the self-consistency of these approximations, finding that a particular approximation - the large formation time approximation - is not satisfied self-consistently within the model. We explore a kinematic cutoff on the transverse radiated gluon momentum, which restores the self-consistency of this approximation, but at the cost of an increased sensitivity to the exact cutoff chosen. We investigate the common application of the central limit theorem to approximate the elastic energy loss as a Gaussian distribution. Our results are insensitive to this approximation - understood not by many scatterings, but rather from an expansion of $R_{AA}$ in terms of moments of the energy loss probability distributions. We also explore uncertainty from the crossover between hard thermal loop and vacuum propagators. We perform a one-parameter fit of the strong coupling $\alpha_s$ to RHIC and LHC large-system data, accounting for two important theoretical uncertainties. Most uncertainties can be absorbed into a shift in $\alpha_s$, but residual uncertainty bands remain. Differences in elastic energy loss persist even after the fit, producing distinct $p_T$ and system size dependencies. We show model predictions for $p / d / {}^3 \text{He} + A$ collisions, finding agreement with RHIC small system data but disagreement with LHC results.</description>

      <title>Differential Equations for Energy Correlators in Any Angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy Correlators (EC) are the simplest IR finite observables, which connect theories and experiments. In this paper, we provide a systematic algorithm to calculate the canonical differential equations for energy correlators at generic angle in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory. The integrand is obtained from the 5-point form factor square for scalar half-BPS operators. Applying the algorithm, we obtain the canonical basis for three-point EC and the full set of master integrals for four-point EC. We analyze the function space for four-point case. For multiple polylogrithmic (MPLs) integrals, we calculate their symbols, and for integrals beyond MPLs, we make further investigation by Picard-Fuchs operators. We find two elliptic curves and one genus 2 hyperelliptic curve. The results are achieved by means of integration by part (IBP) reduction and differential equations powered by computational algebraic geometry methods. We provide a package that implements the algorithm. The data is a valuable reference for exploring the structure of physical observables in perturbation theories.</description>

      <title>Blast-frozen Dark Matter and Modulated Density Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions (FOPT) are ubiquitous in beyond the Standard Model physics and leave distinctive echoes in the history of early universe. We consider a FOPT serving the well-motivated role of dark matter mass generation and present {\it blast-frozen dark matter} (BFDM), which transitions from radiation to non-relativistic relic in a period much shorter than the corresponding Hubble time. Its cosmological imprint are strong oscillations in the dark matter density perturbations that seed structure formation on large and small scales. For a FOPT occurring not long before the matter-radiation equality, next generation cosmological surveys bear a strong potential to discover BFDM and in turn establish the origin of dark matter mass.</description>

      <title>Off forward non-SCHC contributions to exclusive vector quarkonium production from the "spin dependent BFKL Pomeron"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel contribution to off-forward, exclusive vector quarkonium production, $\gamma^{(*)}+p \to V+p$, at high energy is derived which corresponds to a $t$-channel exchange of a BFKL hard Pomeron, with a helicity flip of the proton. This ``spin-dependent BFKL Pomeron" is required in a consistent expansion in powers of the momentum transfer $ t \approx -\Delta_\perp^2$ beyond first order. The spin-dependent Pomeron violates $s$-channel helicity conservation (SCHC) at ${\cal O}(\Delta_\perp^2)$, and beyond. Expanding to leading twist only, it corresponds to GPD $E_g(x,t)$ for vanishing skewness. We derive explicit expressions for the eikonal BFKL amplitudes, to all orders in dipole size times momentum transfer, for all helicity configurations of the particles in the initial and final states. We also provide numerical estimates of the helicity flip two gluon exchange amplitude at moderate $x$ from a light-cone quark model of the proton. The spin dependent BFKL Pomeron could, in principle, be discovered via double spin asymmetries in $e+p \to e+p+J/\psi$ with transversely polarized proton and longitudinally polarized electron in the initial state.</description>

      <title>Investigating the inclusive $D^0$ photoproduction in ultraperipheral $PbPb$ collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inclusive $D^0$ photoproduction in $PbPb$ collisions at the center - of - mass energies of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is investigated considering the color dipole $S$ - matrix approach. The analytical expressions for the differential distributions are derived in the impact parameter and transverse momentum spaces and predictions for the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions are presented considering three distinct models for the unintegrated gluon distribution of the nuclear target. In particular, we compare the predictions derived assuming a linear dynamics, with and without the inclusion of nuclear effects, with those obtained by solving the running coupling Balitsky - Kovchegov equation. A comparison of these predictions with the recent (preliminary) CMS data is also performed. Our results indicate that a detailed analysis of this observable will be very useful to improve our understanding of the strong interaction theory at high energies and in a nuclear medium.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter in X-rays: Revised XMM-Newton Limits and New Constraints from eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two classes of dark matter (DM) candidates, sub-GeV particles and primordial black holes (PBHs), that can inject low-energy electrons and positrons into the Milky Way and leave observable signatures in the X-ray sky. In the case of sub-GeV DM, annihilation or decay into $e^+e^-$ contributes to the diffuse sea of cosmic-ray (CR) leptons, which can generate bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton (IC) emission on Galactic photon fields, producing a broad spectrum from X-rays to $\gamma$-rays detectable by instruments such as eROSITA and XMM-Newton. For PBHs with masses below $\sim10^{17}$ g, Hawking evaporation similarly yields low-energy $e^\pm$, leading to comparable diffuse emission. Using the first data release from eROSITA and incorporating up-to-date CR propagation and diffusion parameters, we derive new constraints on both scenarios. For sub-GeV DM, we exclude thermally averaged annihilation cross sections in the range $\sim 10^{-27}-10^{-25} \ \mathrm{cm^3/s}$ and decay lifetimes of $\sim 10^{24}-10^{25}$ s for masses between 1 MeV and 1 GeV, with eROSITA outperforming previous X-ray constraints below $\sim$ 30 MeV. For asteroid-mass PBHs, we set new bounds on the DM fraction based on their Hawking-induced emission. Finally, we revisit earlier constraints from XMM-Newton, finding that they were approximately four orders of magnitude too stringent due to the use of the instrument's geometric solid angle rather than its exposure-weighted solid angle. Upon using the exposure-weighted solid angle, we show that the revised XMM-Newton limits are slightly weaker than those from eROSITA.</description>

      <title>Four-point correlation functions in axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study parity violation in the early universe by examining the four-point correlation function within the axion inflation model. Using an open quantum system formalism from our previous work, we calculate the influence functional to fourth order, from which we then derive the inflaton four-point correlation function. When we decompose this function using isotropic basis functions, the expansion coefficients $\zeta_{\ell',\ell'',\ell'''}$ naturally split into parity-even and parity-odd components. In the large $\xi$ approximation, which enhances the production of right-handed photons in the model, the derivation of these coefficients simplifies. We work out the lowest-order nonvanishing parity-odd $\zeta_{234}$ term which clearly indicates the presence of parity violation. Moreover, our derived values of the coefficients are consistent with recent observational data from galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Muon (and Lepton) Anomalous Magnetic Moments and Limits on Their Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limits on lepton radii and contact interaction scales are used to derive limits on the deviations of lepton anomalous magnetic dipole moments (g-2)/2 from the Standard Model predictions. In the case of quadratic dependence of the deviations on the lepton mass the limits for electrons are better compared to low energy measurements, for muons somewhat weaker than the latest precision experiments, and for taus by far the best.</description>

      <title>Chiral-odd generalized parton distributions for the low-lying octet baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the chiral-odd generalized parton distributions (GPDs) for the octet baryons within the framework of diquark spectator model, emphasizing the difference arising from different quark flavors of $p$, $\Sigma^+$ and $\Xi^o$. The quark-quark correlator for the tensor current has been solved to investigate the transversely polarized quark dynamics using light-cone wave functions. In the forward limit, transversity distributions of all the constituent quark flavors of $p$, $\Sigma^+$, and $\Xi^o$ have been studied. Additionally, the lowest moment of GPD $H_T$ and the combination of GPDs $E_T$ and $\tilde{H}_T$ have also been investigated. Our results are comparable with other available model predictions and lattice data for the case of $p$. Furthermore, we have presented a comparative analysis of tensor charges and anomalous tensor magnetic moments for all the constituent quark flavors of the considered baryons, comparing them with available data obtained from different approaches.</description>

      <title>The Non-perturbative term for the Vector Form Factor of Pion Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vector form factor of the decay $\pi^{+} \rightarrow \gamma + e^{+} + \nu_e$ is calculated by the method for the pseudovector pion-nucleon system. The non-perturbative term is taken into account by using the parameter for the self-energy of nucleon following our previous calculation of the pion form factor. The suppression of the anomalous interaction of proton in the loop integral is significant to understand the experimental value.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and greybody factors of charge black hole in bumblebee gravity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Dirac field, scalar field and electromagnetic field perturbations of Reissner-Nordstorm-de Sitter (RNdS) and Reissner-Nordstorm-(anti)-de Sitter (RNAdS)-like black holes within the frame work of Einstein-bumblebee gravity. The effective potential, greybody factor and quasinormal modes (QNMs) are also explored by using Dirac equation, Klein-Gordon equation and Maxwell's equation. We find that for RNdS-like black hole increasing the Lorentz violation parameter $L$ consistently leads to decrease in the effective potential for all types of perturbations but for RNAdS case the influence of $L$ varies depending on the types of perturbation. Further for both RNdS and RNAdS-like black holes, increasing charge $Q$ reduces the effective potential in all the perturbations. The greybody factors of all the types of perturbations are also discussed. The results show that the greybody factors depend on the shape of the effective potential: higher (lower) potentials gives lower (higher) greybody factors. The QNMs frequencies of RNdS-like black hole for the massless field perturbations are discussed by using 6th order WKB approximation and Pad\'e approximation. We also analyze the time-domain profiles of the perturbations. The effects of Lorentz violation parameter $L$ and charge $Q$ to the photon sphere radius and shadow radius are also discussed. It is noted that increasing $Q$ and $L$ reduce the rise of shadow radius for RNdS-like black hole.</description>

      <title>The Study of Pole Trajectory within a bare state in the coupled channel model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two-particle scattering and two-particle scattering with a bare basis state using Hamiltonian Effective Field Theory (HEFT). We analyze the distribution of two-body scattering poles in the momentum and energy planes under relativistic conditions. Compared to the non-relativistic case, there are significant differences in the distribution of bound state poles and resonance poles in the relativistic case, primarily due to the square root term in the relativistic formula. By considering pure two-particle scattering, we examine the relationship between the form factor and the number of poles. Additionally, we clearly elucidate the effects of attractive and repulsive interactions on the bound state poles and resonance poles. More importantly, we extend our model by including a bare state and explore the poles originating from the bare state or coupled channels through the trajectories of pole positions, as well as the compositeness of bound states.</description>

      <title>Impact of sea quark-gluon configurations on the magnetic octupole deformation of decuplet baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic octupole moment of $J^P= \frac{3}{2}^+$ decuplet baryons are discussed in the statistical framework, treating baryons as an ensembles of quark-gluon Fock states. The probabilities associated with multiple strange and non-strange Fock states depict the importance of sea in spin, flavor $\&amp;$ color space, which are further merged into statistical parameters. The individual contribution of valence and sea (scalar, vector and tensor) to the magnetic octupole moment is calculated. The symmetry breaking in both sea and valence is experienced by a suppression factor $k(1-C_l)^{n-1}$ and a mass correction parameter 'r', respectively. The factor $k(1-C_l)^{n-1}$ systematically reduces the probabilities of Fock states containing multiple strange quark pairs. The octupole moment value is obtained -ve for $\Delta^{++}, \Delta^+, \Sigma^{*+}$ and +ve for $\Delta^{-}, \Sigma^{*-}, \Xi^{*-}, \Omega^-$ baryons with the domination of scalar (spin-0) sea. The computed results are compared with existing theoretical predictions, demonstrating good consistency. These predictions may serve as valuable inputs for future high-precision experiments and theoretical explorations in hadron structure.</description>

      <title>Correlating lepton flavour violating $b \to s$ and leptonic decay modes in a minimal abelian extension of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an abelian extension of the Standard Model (SM) comprising a new gauge group $U(1)^\prime$, with the neutral gauge boson $Z^\prime$ having flavour violating couplings to quarks and leptons. The fermion content is the same as in SM except for the addition of three right-handed neutrinos. The model describes the couplings of $Z^\prime$ to fermions in terms of three rational parameters $\epsilon_{1,2,3}$ that sum to zero imposing the cancellation of the gauge anomalies. Each $\epsilon_i$ is common to all fermions in a generation, a feature producing correlations among quark and lepton observables. We focus on $b \to s \ell_1^- \ell_2^+$ transitions for the lepton flavour conserving $\ell_1=\ell_2$ and lepton flavour violating case $\ell_1 \neq \ell_2$. Small deviations with respect to the SM predictions are found in the first case, which reflects a feature of the model where quark and lepton sectors prevent each other to manifest large discrepancies with respect to SM. We investigate the correlations with the flavour violating leptonic decays $\mu^- \to e^- \gamma$, $\tau^- \to \mu^- \mu^+ \mu^-$. The experimental upper bound on the branching ratio of $\mu^- \to e^- \gamma$ constrains the range for the lepton flavour violating $B_{d,s}$ decays, which however are predicted to be within the reach of the planned new facilities.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we explore various lab-frame angular observables at Large Hadron-electron Collider (LHeC) to test their sensitivity on the most general structure of the Higgs ($H$) to neutral weak boson ($Z$) coupling ($HZZ$) via the process $e^- p \rightarrow e^- H j$ at the center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}~\approx$ 1.3 TeV. The most general Lorentz structure of the $HZZ$ coupling beyond the standard model is composed of two CP-even ($\lambda_{1Z}$ and $\lambda_{2Z}$) and one CP-odd (${\tilde \lambda_Z}$) components. In a previous study, we looked at the absolute value of azimuthal correlation ($|\Delta \phi|$) between the final state electron and the jet to derive constraints on the non-standard $HZZ$ couplings. This choice of observable is motivated by its potential to discriminate between CP-odd and CP-even couplings in the $e^- p \rightarrow \nu_e H j$ process. Since the process $e^- p \rightarrow e^- H j$ has an electron in the final state, one can construct more angular observables. In addition to $|\Delta \phi|$, we identify new angular observables: the sign-sensitive azimuthal correlation ($\Delta \phi$) and the polar angle of the final state electron ($\theta$), suitable for constraining non-standard $HZZ$ coupling. Our analysis shows that these new angles improve the constraints on $\lambda_{2Z}$ and ${\tilde \lambda}_Z$ in the range of 48-67\%. We also study the potential of the asymmetry in $\Delta \phi$ to constrain the parameters corresponding to the CP-odd coupling.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass model at a three-loop level from a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a three-loop induced neutrino mass scenario from a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ flavor symmetry and reach the minimum scenario leading predictions of the lepton masses, mixing angles, and Dirac and Majorana phases, which are shown through the chi square analyses. In addition, we discuss the lepton flavor violations, muon anomalous magnetic moment, lepton universality, and relic density of the dark matter candidate. And, we find that we need to extend our model if we satisfy the observed relic density of dark matter within the limit of perturbation where it can be done by adding one singlet scalar boson without changing predictions in neutrino sector.</description>

      <title>Loop-corrected Trilinear Higgs Self-Couplings in the NMSSM with Inverse Seesaw Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The higher-order corrections for the SM-like Higgs boson mass and the trilinear Higgs self-couplings in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (NMSSM) with Inverse Seesaw Mechanism are significant and highly correlated. We present here the full one-loop corrections to the trilinear Higgs self-couplings supplemented by the dominant top-Yukawa and strong coupling induced two-loop corrections from our previous calculations in the complex NMSSM. These corrections are performed consistently with the corresponding Higgs boson mass corrections. We discuss in detail the new effects from the extended neutrino and sneutrino sectors on both the trilinear Higgs self-couplings and the SM-like Higgs boson mass. When compared to the case of the NMSSM without Inverse Seesaw Mechanism, the new effects can be up to 10\% for the effective SM-like trilinear Higgs self-couplings, and up to 4.5\% for the SM-like Higgs boson mass for valid parameter points, i.e. points satisfying the Higgs data, the neutrino data, the constraints from the charged lepton flavor-violating decays, and the new physics constraints from the oblique parameters $S, T, U$. The new corrections are also included in the Higgs-to-Higgs decays for the heavy Higgs states and implemented in the new version of the Fortran code NMSSMCALC-nuSS.</description>

      <title>Beyond leading twist: $\rho$ meson decay constants and distribution amplitudes in a self-consistent light-front quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of decay constants and chiral-even and chiral-odd distribution amplitudes (DAs) up to twist 4 for the $\rho$ meson in the standard light-front quark model (LFQM) based on the Bakamjian-Thomas (BT) construction. For the $\rho$ meson, which possesses both longitudinal $(h=0)$ and transverse $(h=\pm 1)$ polarizations, two types of decay constants, $f_{\rho}^{\parallel}$ and $f_{\rho}^{\perp}$, arises accordingly. We demonstrate that these decay constants can be self-consistently extracted from both local ($z^\mu=0$) and nonlocal ($z^\mu\neq 0$) matrix elements $\langle 0 | \bar{q}(z)\, \Gamma\, q(-z) | \rho(P,h) \rangle$, with $\Gamma = (\gamma^\mu, \sigma^{\mu\nu}, \gamma^\mu\gamma_5, \mathbf{1})$, in a manner independent of current components, polarizations, and reference frames. In particular, we emphasize the role of nonlocal matrix elements involving axial-vector and scalar currents, where mixing between $f_\rho^{\parallel}$ and $f_\rho^{\perp}$ occurs. We show that this mixing is consistently resolved through the BT construction, ensuring the proper extraction of these decay constants. Additionally, we investigate the structure of chiral-even DAs ($\phi_{2;\mathrm{V}}^\parallel, \phi_{3;\mathrm{V}}^\parallel, \psi_{3;\mathrm{A}}^\perp, \phi_{4;\mathrm{V}}^\parallel$) and chiral-odd DAs ($\phi_{2;\mathrm{T}}^\perp, \phi_{3;\mathrm{T}}^\perp, \psi_{3;\mathrm{S}}^\parallel, \phi_{4;\mathrm{T}}^\perp$) beyond leading twists, and present their corresponding $\xi$-moments and Gegenbauer moments. These results provide deeper insight into the nonperturbative structure of vector mesons and demonstrate the robustness and self-consistency of the LFQM based on the BT framework.</description>

      <title>About electroweak domain walls in Majoron models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some time ago it was claimed in "Spontaneous Breaking of Lepton Number and Cosmological Domain Wall Problem" (Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 151301 (2019)) that non perturbative instantons of the weak interaction $\text{SU}(2)_\text{W}$ lead to the formation of domain walls in Majoron models owing to the anomaly of the spontaneously broken global lepton number $L$ symmetry $\text{U}(1)_L$ with respect to $\text{SU}(2)_\text{W}$. We point out that it has long been known, that this effect can be completely rotated away unless there is a source of explicit $B+L$ breaking present, where $B$ denotes baryon number. We further estimate the tiny instanton induced Majoron mass from $B+L$ breaking and analyze the cosmological impact of such domain walls including possible finite temperature effects. In general this scenario does not lead to a cosmological catastrophe.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the three-flavor quark-meson diquark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the properties of the two- and three-flavor quark-meson diquark (QMD) model as a renormalizable low-energy effective model for color superconductivity in dense QCD. The effective degrees of freedom are scalars, pseudo-scalars, diquarks, and quarks. The parameters in the scalar/pseudo-scalar sector can be determined by matching the meson pole masses and decay constants to their observed values using the on-shell renormalization scheme. The remaining parameters are in the diquark sector and a priori unknown. In principle, they can be calculated from QCD, but we consider them free. We renormalize the thermodynamic potential in the 2SC phase for two flavors and in the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase for three flavors, determining the counterterms of the couplings in the diquark sector. We derive a set of renormalization group equations for these couplings that are used to improve the thermodynamic potential. As an application, we calculate the gap and the speed of sound in the ideal CFL phase. It is shown that the gap approaches a constant as $\mu_B\rightarrow\infty$ and that the speed of sound relaxes to the conformal limit from above.</description>

      <title>Discrete Spacetime Theories Can Explain the Muon Magnetic Moment Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An unsolved problem of particle physics is a discrepancy between the measured value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment and the theoretical prediction based on standard quantum electrodynamics. In this paper we show that if spacetime possesses a fundamental length scale, the ensuing modifications to the photon propagator can account for the discrepancy if the scale is chosen to be $10^{-22}$~m; the corresponding energy being about $30$~TeV. The possibility that spacetime possesses a graininess on a fine enough scale has a long history. One class of theories that develops this idea is Doubly Special Relativity (DSR), and we choose this as a model for our calculation. We note that the derived length scale is many orders of magnitude larger than the Planck length, but comparable to that of some higher dimensional gravitational theories. It is also within scope of experimental confirmation in the next generation of colliders.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Constraints on Non-Thermal Light Massive Relics from Future CMB Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present Fisher forecasts on non-thermal LiMR models for the upcoming CMB Stage IV experiment -- particularly focusing on a model of inflaton/moduli decay giving rise to non-thermally distributed dark sector particles, and also comparing our results with those for sterile particles following the Dodelson-Widrow distribution. Two independent parameters, the effective number of extra relativistic species $\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}$ and the effective mass $M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}$ of the relic, influence linear cosmological observables. We find $\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}$ to be more tightly constrained with $\sigma(\Delta N_\mathrm{eff})\sim10^{-3}$, for a less abundant, heavier LiMR which becomes fully non-relativistic around matter-radiation equality than a more abundant, lighter LiMR which becomes fully non-relativistic just after recombination, for which $\sigma(\Delta N_\mathrm{eff})\sim10^{-2}$. The uncertainties on $M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}$ differ by a factor of $\sim3$ between the two cases. Our analysis also reveals distinct parameter correlations: the phenomenological parameters $\{\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}, M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}\}$ are found to be negatively correlated for the former case and positively correlated for the latter. We obtain similar constraints on the cosmological parameters (in either case) for both the inflaton/moduli decay and the Dodelson-Widrow models when the first two moments of the LiMR distribution function, related to the phenomenological parameters, are matched. Finally, by constructing a modified distribution that matches the first two moments of the Dodelson-Widrow but deviates maximally in the third moment, we demonstrate that CMB Stage IV data is not expected to be sensitive to higher moments of the distribution.</description>

      <title>On-shell recursion relations for higher-spin Compton amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recursively construct tree-level electromagnetic and gravitational Compton amplitudes of higher-spin massive particles by the all-line transverse momentum shift. With three-point amplitude as input, we demonstrate that higher-point electromagnetic and gravitational Compton amplitudes are on-shell constructible up to spin $s = 3/2$ and $s = 5/2$, respectively, under the all-line transverse shift after imposing the current constraint condition. We unambiguously derive the four-point electromagnetic and gravitational Compton amplitudes for $s \leq 3/2$ and $s \leq 5/2$, which are uniquely determined by the on-shell recursion relation and are free from unphysical spurious poles. In addition, we explore amplitudes of spin-$3/2$ particles with non-minimal three-point interactions with photon, as well as $s &gt; 3/2$ particles, and comment on their notable features. Our work furthers the understanding of on-shell methods for massive amplitudes, with hopes to shed light on physical observables in particle physics and higher-spin amplitudes relevant for Kerr black-hole scattering.</description>

      <title>The particle spectra of parity-violating theories: A less radical approach and an upgrade of PSALTer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to computational barriers, the effects of parity violation have so far been grossly neglected in gravitational model-building, leading to a serious gap in the space of prior models. We present a new algorithm for efficiently computing the particle spectrum for any parity-violating tensorial field theory. It allows to extract conditions for the absence of massive ghosts without resorting to any manipulation of radicals in cases where the particle masses are irrational functions of the Lagrangian coupling coefficients. We test it against several examples, among which is the most general parity-indefinite Einstein-Cartan/Poincar\'e gravity that propagates two healthy massive scalars (in addition to the massless graviton). Importantly, we upgrade the PSALTer software in the Wolfram Language to accommodate parity-violating theories. PSALTer is a contribution to the xAct project.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves from Phase Transitions during Reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study primordial gravitational waves (GWs) generated from first-order phase transitions (PTs) during cosmic reheating. Using a minimal particle physics model, and a general parametrization of the inflaton energy density and the evolution of the Standard Model temperature, we explore the conditions under which PTs occur and determine the corresponding PT parameters (the PT temperature, duration and strength), which depend on the evolution of the background during reheating. We find that, in certain cosmological scenarios, PTs can be delayed and prolonged compared to the standard post-inflationary evolution. Incorporating these PT parameters, we compute the resulting GW spectrum generated from the various processes occurring during a first-order PT: bubble collisions, sound waves, and magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence. We find that, in comparison to the standard cosmological history, the GW amplitude and peak frequency can be modified by several orders of magnitude due to the additional enhancement or suppression arising from the cosmological evolution during reheating. In particular, the GW spectra could be within the reach of next-generation GW and CMB observatories.</description>

      <title>Nonminimal infrared gravitational reheating in light of ACT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflation is known to produce large infrared scalar fluctuations. Further, if a scalar field $(\chi)$ is non-minimally coupled with gravity through $\xi \chi^2 R$, those infrared modes experience \textit{tachyonic instability} during and after inflation. Those large non-perturbative infrared modes can collectively produce hot Big Bang universe upon their horizon entry during the post-inflationary period. We indeed find that for reheating equation of state (EoS), $w_{\phi} &gt; 1/3$, and coupling strength, $\xi&gt;1/6$, large infrared fluctuations lead to successful reheating. We further analyze perturbative reheating by solving the standard Boltzmann equation in both Jordan and Einstein frames, and compare the results with the non-perturbative ones. Finally, embedding this infrared reheating scenario into the well-known $\alpha-$attractor inflationary model, we examine possible constraints on the model parameters in light of the latest ACT, DESI results. To arrive at the constraints, we take into account the latest bounds on tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{0.05}\leq 0.038$, isocurvature power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{S}} \lesssim 8.3\times 10^{-11}$, and effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 0.17 $. Subject to these constraints, we find successful reheating to occur only for EoS $w_{\phi}\gtrsim 0.6$, which translates to a sub-class of $\alpha-$attractor models being favored and placing them within the 2$\sigma$ region in the $ n_s-r$ plane of the latest ACT, DESI data. In this range of EoS, we find that the coupling strength should lie within $2.11\lesssim\xi\lesssim 2.95$ for $w_{\phi}=0.6$. Finally, we compute secondary gravitational wave signals induced by the scalar infrared modes, which are found to be strong enough to be detected by future GW observatories, namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulators offer great potential for investigating dynamical properties of quantum field theories. However, preparing accurate non-trivial initial states for these simulations is challenging. Classical Euclidean-time Monte-Carlo methods provide a wealth of information about states of interest to quantum simulations. Thus, it is desirable to facilitate state preparation on quantum simulators using this information. To this end, we present a fully classical pipeline for generating efficient quantum circuits for preparing the ground state of an interacting scalar field theory in 1+1 dimensions. The first element of this pipeline is a variational ansatz family based on the stellar hierarchy for bosonic quantum systems. The second element of this pipeline is the classical moment-optimization procedure that augments the standard variational energy minimization by penalizing deviations in selected sets of ground-state correlation functions (i.e., moments). The values of ground-state moments are sourced from classical Euclidean methods. The resulting states yield comparable ground-state energy estimates but exhibit distinct correlations and local non-Gaussianity. The third element of this pipeline is translating the moment-optimized ansatz into an efficient quantum circuit with an asymptotic cost that is polynomial in system size. This work opens the way to systematically applying classically obtained knowledge of states to prepare accurate initial states in quantum field theories of interest in nature.</description>

      <title>Caustic fringes for wave dark matter</title>

Abstract: Wave dark matter is composed of particles sufficiently light that their de Broglie wavelength exceeds the average inter-particle separation. A typical wave dark matter halo exhibits granular substructures due to wave interference. In this paper, we explore the wave interference effects around caustics. These are locations of formally divergent density in cold collisionless systems. Examples include splashback in galaxy clusters, and tidal shells in merging galaxies, where the pile-up of dark matter close to apogee gives rise to caustics. We show that wave interference modifies the density profile in the vicinity of the caustics, giving rise to a fringe pattern well-described by the Airy function. This follows from approximating the gravitational potential as linear close to apogee. This prediction is verified in a series of numerical simulations in which the gravitational potential is computed exactly. We provide a formula expressing the fringe separation in terms of the wave dark matter mass and halo parameters, which is useful for interpreting and stacking data. The fringe separation near caustics can be significantly larger than the naive de Broglie scale (the latter set by the system's velocity dispersion). This opens up the possibility of detecting caustic fringes for a wide range of wave dark matter masses.</description>

      <title>Study of atomic effects on electron spectrum in bound-muon decay process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the bound-muon decay process, the study of atomic effects on the electron spectrum near its endpoint is performed within the framework of the Fermi effective theory. The analysis takes into account for corrections due to finite-nuclear-size, nuclear-deformation, electron-screening, and vacuum-polarization effects, all of which are incorporated self-consistently into the Dirac equation. Furthermore, the nuclear-recoil correction to the muon binding energy is included. Calculations are carried out for the isotopes of C, Al, and Si, which are of a particular importance for forthcoming experiments aimed at search for the charged-lepton flavor-violating process of muon-to-electron conversion in a nuclear field.</description>

      <title>Testing strong-field QED with the avalanche precursor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A two-beam high-power laser facility is essential for the study of one of the most captivating phenomena predicted by strong-field quantum electrodynamics (QED) and yet unobserved experimentally: the avalanche-type cascade. In such a cascade, the energy of intense laser light can be efficiently transformed into high-energy radiation and electron-positron pairs. The future 50-petawatt-scale laser facility NSF OPAL will provide unique opportunities for studying such strong-field QED effects, as it is designed to deliver two ultra-intense, tightly focused laser pulses onto the interaction point. In this work, we investigate the potential of such a facility for studying elementary particle and plasma dynamics deeply in the quantum radiation-dominated regime, and the generation of QED avalanches. With 3D particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that QED avalanche precursors can be reliably triggered under realistic laser parameters and layout (namely, focusing $f/2$, tilted optical axes, and non-ideal co-pointing) with the anticipated capabilities of NSF OPAL. We demonstrate that seed electrons can be efficiently injected into the laser focus by using targets of three types: a gas of heavy atoms, an overcritical plasma, and a thin foil. A strong positron and high-energy photon signal is generated in all cases. The cascade properties can be identified from the final particle distributions, which have a clear directional pattern. At increasing laser field intensity, such distributions provide signatures of the transition, first, to the radiation-dominated interaction regime, and then to a QED avalanche. Our findings can also be used for designing related future experiments.</description>

      <title>Testing Variational Perturbation Theory for Effective Actions Using the Gaudin-Yang Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The background field formalism based on effective actions is a compelling framework for developing an effective field theory for nuclear density functional theory. Among the challenges in carrying out this development is handling both the particle-hole and pairing channels beyond the mean-field level, which includes how to incorporate collective degrees of freedom. Here we use the exactly solvable one-dimensional Gaudin-Yang model as a theoretical laboratory to explore candidate approaches. We compare Variational Perturbation Theory (VPT) to ordinary many-body perturbation theory and the inversion method, all to second order in their respective expansions, and verify issues with Hubbard-Stratonovich auxiliary fields. VPT outperforms the other approaches at this level over a wide range of densities. The next steps to extend this approach toward nuclei are outlined.</description>

      <title>High-order anisotropic flow and nonlinear hydrodynamic responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the charged hadron anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n$ (up to $n = 12$) using high-statistics event-by-event simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ and $5.36$~TeV, employing the IP-Glasma + MUSIC + UrQMD hybrid approach. The power spectra of anisotropic flow coefficients ($v_n\{2\}$ vs. $n$) are compared with the ALICE measurements from central to 50% centrality. To understand the various sources contributing to the high-order $v_n$ coefficients, we analyze the nonlinear mode coefficients for high-order anisotropic flow coefficients using different approximations and make comparisons with available measurements.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter Spike with Gravitational Waves from Early EMRIs in the Milky Way Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold dark matter may form dense structures around supermassive black holes (SMBHs), significantly influencing their local environments. These dense regions are ideal sites for the formation of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which stellar-mass compact objects gradually spiral into SMBH, emitting gravitational waves (GWs). Space-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories such as LISA and Taiji will be sensitive to these signals, including early-stage EMRIs (E-EMRIs) that persist in the low-frequency band for extended periods. In this work, we investigate the impact of dark matter-induced dynamical friction on E-EMRIs in the Milky Way Center, model its effect on the trajectory, and calculate the resulting modifications to the GW spectrum. Our analysis suggests that this influence might be sizable and lead to detectable deviations in the spectrum, namely suppression at low frequencies and enhancement at high frequencies, therefore providing a potential probe for dark matter with future GW detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji.</description>

      <title>Interior of a black hole in the framework of the scalar quasiparticle model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed an effective thermodynamic model for a black hole's interior composed of scalar quasiparticles. The proposed interior consists of a core and a crust; the properties of both depend on the kinetics of the quasiparticles. In the core, the quasiparticles possess zero classical kinetic energy; the total potential energy $U(N)$ of the core depends only on the number $N$ of quasiparticles inside it. The thermodynamic description of this state of matter requires the introduction of an inverse temperature $\beta$ inversely proportional to $U(N)$ that supplants the standard temperature in every thermodynamic relation inside the core, driving both the energy density and the pressure negative. The different states of the core, correspondingly, can be parametrized by an additional parameter, which is a mean occupation number $\eta$ of the quasiparticles in the core. Concerning the crust, there are quasiparticles in it that remain trapped by the gravitational potential at finite temperature. The no-escape condition for the quasiparticles in the crust is imposed through a truncation of the phase-space integrals, yielding a direct and analytical coupling between thermodynamics and gravity. The resulting framework unifies core and crust within a single quasiparticle description, highlights the role of negative energy and pressure in black hole interiors, and provides testable predictions for any semiclassical theory that aims to resolve the singularity problem.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of a Gigahertz Fabry-P\'erot Resonator for Axion Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions are hypothetical pseudo-Nambu Goldstone bosons that could explain the observed cold dark matter density and solve the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Haloscope experiments commonly employ resonant cavities to search for a conversion of axion dark matter into photons in external magnetic fields. As the expected signal power degrades with increasing frequency, this approach becomes challenging at frequencies beyond tens of Gigahertz. Here, we propose a novel haloscope design based on an open Fabry-P\'erot resonator. Operating a small-scale resonator at cryogenic temperatures and at modest magnetic fields should already lead to an unparalleled sensitivity for photon-axion couplings $g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 3\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at 35GHz. We demonstrate how this sensitivity could be further improved using graded-phase mirrors and sketch possibilities to probe benchmark models of the QCD axion.</description>

      <title>Explicit estimate of charm rescattering in $B^0 \to K^0 \bar{\ell} \ell$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze $B^0 \to K^0 \bar{\ell}\ell$ long-distance contributions induced by the rescattering of a pair of charmed and charmed-strange mesons. We present an explicit estimate of these contributions using an effective description in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom, supplemented by data on the $B^0 \to D^*D_s (D^*_sD)$ transition in order to reproduce the corresponding discontinuity in the $B^0 \to K^0 \bar{\ell}\ell$ amplitude. The $D^* D_s (D^*_s D) K$ vertex is estimated using heavy-hadron chiral perturbation theory, obtaining an accurate description of the whole rescattering process in the low-recoil (or high-$q^2$) limit. We also present an extrapolation to the whole kinematical region introducing hadronic form factors. The explicit estimate of the leading $D^*D_s (D^*_sD)$ intermediate state leads to a long-distance amplitude which does not exceed a few percent relative to the short-distance one. The consequences of this result for the extraction of the short-distance coefficient $C_9$ are discussed.</description>

      <title>Multi-component dark matter and Galactic 511 keV $\gamma$-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multi-component dark matter scenarios and the Galactic 511 keV $\gamma$-ray emission line signal in the framework of a local, dark $U(1)_D$ extension of the Standard Model. A light vector dark matter particle associated with the dark $U(1)_D$ may decay and annihilate to electron-positron pairs. The produced positrons may in turn form positroniums that subsequently annihilate to two photons, accounting for the observed line signal of the Galactic 511 keV $\gamma$-ray emission. Three scenarios are investigated. First, we consider the minimal $U(1)_D$ extension where a dark gauge boson and a dark Higgs boson are newly introduced to the particle content. As a second scenario, we consider WIMP-type dark matter with the introduction of an extra dark fermion which, in addition to the dark gauge boson, may contribute to the dark matter relic abundance. It is thus a multi-component dark matter scenario with a UV-complete dark $U(1)_D$ symmetry. In particular, the vector dark matter may account for a small fraction of the total dark matter relic abundance. Finally, we consider the scenario where the dark matter particles are of the FIMP-type. In this case, both the light vector and fermion dark matter particles may be produced via the freeze-in and super-WIMP mechanisms. Considering theoretical and observational constraints, we explore the allowed parameter space where the Galactic 511 keV $\gamma$-ray line signal and the dark matter relic can both be explained. We also discuss possible observational signatures.</description>

Abstract: Interesting data on Gamma Ray Burts (GRBs) and Cosmic Rays (CRs) have recently been made public. GRB221009A has a record ``peak energy". The CR electron spectrum has been measured to unprecedented high energies and exhibits a ``knee" akin to the ones in all-particle or individual-element CR nuclei. IceCube has not seen high-energy neutrinos associated with GRBs. AMS has published a CR positron spectrum conducive to much speculation. We examine these data in the light of the ``CannonBall Model" of GRBs and CRs, in which they are intimately related and which they do strongly validate.</description>

      <title>In-medium electromagnetic form factors of pseudoscalar mesons from the quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the modifications of hadron structure in a nuclear medium, focusing on the spacelike electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) of light and heavy-light pseudoscalar mesons. By combining the light-front quark model (LFQM) with the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model, which reasonably reproduces EMFFs in free space and the saturation properties of nuclear matter, respectively, we systematically analyze the in-medium EMFFs and charge radii of mesons with various quark flavors. Our findings show that the EMFFs of charged (neutral) mesons exhibit a faster fall-off (increase) with increasing four-momentum transfer squared and nuclear density. Consequently, the absolute value of the charge radii of mesons increases with nuclear density, where the rate of increase depends on their quark flavor contents. We observe that the EMFFs of pions and kaons undergo significant modifications in the nuclear medium, while heavy-light mesons are only slightly modified. By decomposing the quark flavor contributions to EMFFs, we show that the medium effects primarily impact the light-quark sector, leaving the heavy-quark sector nearly unaffected. The results of this study further suggest the importance of the medium effects at the quark level.</description>

      <title>Dimension-8 operators in $W^+W^-$ production via gluon fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dimension-8 operators on $W^+W^-$ production at the LHC for the incoming gluon-gluon channel. To this end, we have identified all dimension-8 CP-even operators contributing to the process in question, and computed the corresponding tree-level helicity amplitudes for fully-leptonic decays of the $W$ bosons. These are implemented in the program MCFM-RE, which automatically incorporates the effect of a jet-veto to reduce the otherwise overwhelming $t\bar t$ background. We find that, unless we break the hierarchy of the effective field theory (EFT), the interference of the dimension-8 operators with the Standard Model is negligible across the considered distributions. This justifies including the square of dimension-6 operators when performing EFT fits with this channel. We then present new constraints on CP-even and CP-odd dimension-6 operators within the EFT regime. Lastly, we postulate a scenario in which the hierarchy of the EFT is broken, justified by the strong constraints on dimension-6 operators from existing on-shell Higgs data. In this scenario, we discuss the constraints that can be reasonably set on CP-even dimension-8 operators with current and future data. We remark that the effect of the jet-veto on the ability to constrain new physics in the $W^+W^-$ channel is quite dramatic and must be properly taken into account.</description>

Abstract: Recent anomalies in $B$-meson decays, such as deviations in $R_{D^{(*)}}$ and $B\to K\nu{\bar\nu}$, suggest possible lepton flavor universality violation and new exotic interactions. In this work, we explore these anomalies within a non-minimal SU(5) grand unified theory (GUT) framework, which introduces a 45-dimensional Higgs representation predicting exotic scalar particles, including the leptoquark $R_2$ and diquark $S_6$. The $R_2$ leptoquark addresses charged current anomalies in $b\to c\tau\nu$ transitions, the $S_6$ diquark contributes to nonleptonic neutral current processes, such as $B\to K\pi$, while at the loop level, the exchange of a leptoquark and diquark contributes to $B\to K\nu{\bar\nu}$ offering solutions to longstanding puzzles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the femtoscopic correlation functions of meson-baryon pairs in the strangeness $S=-1$ sector, employing unitarized s-wave scattering amplitudes derived from the chiral Lagrangian up to next-to-leading order. For the first time, we deliver predictions on the $\pi^-\Lambda$ and $K^+\Xi^-$ correlation functions which are feasible to be measured at the Large Hadron Collider. We also demonstrate that the employed model is perfectly capable of reproducing the $K^-p$ correlation function data measured by the same collaboration, without the need to modify the coupling strength to the $\bar{K}^0n$ channel, as has been recently suggested. In all cases, the effects of the source size on the correlation are tested. In addition, we present detailed analysis of the different coupled-channel contributions, together with the quantification of the relative relevance of the different terms in the interaction. These calculations require the knowledge of the so-called production weights, for which we present two novel methods to compute them.</description>

      <title>Analysis of axion-like particles in a top-quark pair production at the CLIC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a contribution of axion-like particles (ALPs) to a top pair production via the collision of Compton backscattered photons at the CLIC operating in a $\gamma\gamma$ mode. The exclusion bounds on the ALP-top quark coupling depending on the ALP mass $m_a$ are given. The mass range 10 GeV -- 10 TeV is considered. We have obtained that for $m_a = 10$ GeV the ALP-top quark couplings as small as $0.17$ TeV$^{-1}$ and $0.11$ TeV$^{-1}$ can be probed at the CLIC with the energy of 1.5 TeV and 3 TeV, respectively. A comparison with other constraints on the ALP-top coupling is given.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent analysis for the $\eta_c\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) pQCD predictions for both the decay width and the transition form factor in the $\eta_c\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ process, based on nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD), deviate from precise experimental measurements. These significant discrepancies have cast doubt on the applicability of NRQCD to charmonium processes. In this paper, we analyze the $\eta_c\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ process by applying the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC), a systematic method for eliminating renormalization scheme and scale ambiguities. The PMC renormalization scales are determined by absorbing the non-conformal $\beta$ terms which govern the behavior of the QCD running coupling via the Renormalization Group Equation. We obtain the PMC scale $Q_\star=4.49\,m_c$ for the $\eta_c\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ decay width. Even after using the PMC method, the convergence of the pQCD series is still poor, which indicates the importance of uncalculated NNNLO and higher-order terms. The resulting value for $\Gamma_{\eta_c\rightarrow \gamma\gamma}$ is in agreement with the Particle Data Group's reported value of $\Gamma_{\eta_c\rightarrow \gamma\gamma}=5.1\pm0.4$ keV within the bounds of uncertainties. Moreover, the transition form factor obtained using the PMC is also in good agreement with precise experimental measurements. The application of the PMC suggests a potential resolution to $\eta_c\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ puzzle and supports the applicability of NRQCD to charmonium processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unified model for the three Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetries and $SU(3)$ family symmetry based on $SO(16)$ grand unified gauge symmetry on six-dimensional (6D) spacetime. In this model, three chiral generations of quarks and leptons are unified into a 6D Weyl fermion in the spinor representation of $SO(16)$. The 6D $SO(16)$ gauge anomaly is canceled by the vectorlike nature of the model, and the 4D gauge anomalies are canceled by introducing suitable 4D localized fermions at the fixed point. The 4D gauge coupling constant of $SO(16)$ has the property of becoming weaker at high energies.</description>

      <title>Investigating non-local contributions in $B_{s} \to \phi \bar{\ell} \ell$ including higher-twist effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the impact of higher-twist three-particle $B_s$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) on the non-local form factors for the $B_s\to \phi \bar{\ell} \ell$ transition focusing on the `charm-loop' contribution within the light-cone sum rule (LCSR) framework. To analytically continue these charm-loop contributions into the kinematically allowed region of the decay, we employ a hadronic dispersion relation that incorporates intermediate resonant states such as the $\phi,\,J/\Psi$ and $\psi(2S)$ mesons. Here, the LCSR predictions serve as inputs, supplemented by experimental data from two-body decays $B_s \to \phi ~+$ resonance states. Our results indicate that the inclusion of twist-5 and twist-6 LCDAs enhances the non-local form factors by approximately an order of magnitude compared to previous estimates, due to partial disruption of cancellation among different twist contributions. This leads to a dilepton invariant mass-squared ($q^2$)-dependent correction to the Wilson coefficient $C_9$, which is higher than, but still consistent with the Standard Model prediction without the non-factorizable charm-loop corrections within uncertainties. Additionally, we update the local form factors to include contributions from higher-twist three-particle $B_s$-meson LCDAs. The phenomenological implications, particularly for the differential branching fraction and angular observables, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Correlation function for the $p ~f_1(1285)$ interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have addressed here the problem of calculating the correlation function of a stable particle with a resonance, in particular one resonance that qualifies as a molecular state of two components. The formalism used requires to evaluate the scattering matrix of the stable particle with the molecule, a nuclear problem which we address by means of the fixed center approximation. We have applied the method to the interaction of a proton with the $f_1(1285)$ resonance, presently under investigation by the ALICE collaboration, where the $f_1(1285)$ is taken as a $K^*\bar{K}-\bar{K}^*K$ molecule. We find that the $p ~ f_1(1285)$ interaction develops a resonance state below the $p ~ f_1(1285)$ threshold, which leads to a depletion in the $p ~ f_1(1285)$ correlation function for small values of the proton momentum. The discussion presented shows that these type of studies can provide much information on the nature of some resonances and the existence of three-body bound states involving mesons and baryons.</description>

      <title>A Classical Interpretation of the Nonrelativistic Quark Potential Model: Color Charge Definition and the Meson Mass-Radius Relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06530v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the fundamental theory describing quark interactions, and various quark models based on QCD have been widely used to study the properties of hadrons, including their structures and mass spectra. However, unlike Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, there is no direct classical analogy for hadronic structures.This paper presents a classical interpretation of the nonrelativistic quark potential model, providing a more intuitive and visualizable description of strong interactions through the quantitative formulation of color charge and color flux.Furthermore, we establish the relationship between meson mass and its structural radius in the nonrelativistic framework and estimate the key parameters of our model using available data from $\eta_b(1S)$ and $\Upsilon(1S)$. We then extend this relationship to a broader range of excited meson states, obtaining structural radii that show good agreement with the root mean square (RMS) radius or charge radius predicted by QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Meson Mixing Bounds on $Z^{\prime}$ Mass in the Alignment Limit: Establishing the Phenomenological Viability of the 331 Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a systematic study of flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) in the 331 model with right-handed neutrinos (331RHNs), analyzing constraints on the $Z^\prime$ boson mass from $K$-, $D$-, $B_d$-, and $B_s$-meson oscillations. By explicitly incorporating scalar sector dynamics and quark rotation ambiguities ($V_L^{u,d}$), we demonstrate that $Z^\prime$ mass limits depend critically on the parametrization of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix factors. Three scenarios are explored: (i) $V_L^u = V_\text{CKM}^\dagger$ (FCNCs restricted to $D$-mesons), (ii) $V_L^d = V_\text{CKM}$ (dominant $B_s$ constraints), and (iii) a hybrid mixing pattern. Strikingly, scenario (i) reduces the $Z^\prime$ mass bound to $M_{Z^\prime} \gtrsim 600\;\text{GeV}$-two orders of magnitude below literature values-by leveraging large experimental uncertainties in $D$-$\bar{D}$ oscillations. Conversely, scenario (ii) requires $M_{Z^\prime} \gtrsim 165\;\text{TeV}$ due to stringent $B_s$ data. We further establish the alignment limit $\cos(\phi+\varphi) = 0$ for the SM-like Higgs, showing its viability depends on $V_L^{u,d}$ configurations, with $B_s$ systems enforcing $|\cos(\phi+\varphi)| &lt; 0.01$ in down-sector FCNC scenarios. Our analysis reveals that strategic choices of quark mixing matrices can suppress FCNC visibility, reconciling the 331 framework with flavor data without ultra-heavy $Z^\prime$ bosons. This work provides the first unified treatment of SM-like Higgs- and $Z^\prime$-mediated FCNCs in 331 models, identifying viable parameter spaces for collider phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Lepton collider imprints of Inelastic dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential for detecting the inelastic dark model (DM) with an additional $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry at various types of lepton colliders. The new gauge boson $Z'$ resulting from the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_D$ can act as a portal connecting the Standard Model fermions and DM fermions $\chi$, thereby facilitating the production of $Z'$ and its decay into DM fermions. The mass difference between the excited DM fermion $\chi_2$ and the ground DM fermion $\chi_1$ induces the subsequent decays $\chi_2\to \chi_1 +\text{vis}$, where $\chi_2$ and $\chi_1$ serve as long lived particles and DM candidate, respectively. For the inelastic DM with a mass $m_{\chi_1}$ in the range of (1-100) GeV, we find that the future lepton colliders can probe many regions not accessible by current experiments and provide greater projected sensitivity than the LHC and Belle in previous studies. This suggests that future colliders can provide complementary exploration of the inelastic dark matter model.</description>

      <title>Colour structure of next-to-eikonal correlator webs at three loops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlators of Wilson-line, which capture eikonal contributions, are known to exponentiate in non-abelian gauge theories, and their logarithms can be organised in terms of collections of Feynman diagrams called webs. In~\cite{Agarwal:2020nyc} the concept of correlator web (Cweb), which is a set of skeleton diagrams built with connected gluon correlators and provides a generalisation of webs was introduced. The part of next-to-eikonal contributions to the scattering amplitude which exponentiates is given in terms of next-to-eikonal Cwebs~\cite{Gardi:2010rn,Laenen:2008gt}. In the present article we study next-to-eikonal Cwebs at three loop order, the order at which non trivial Cweb mixing matrices appear for the first time. The methods developed in~\cite{Agarwal:2022wyk} to construct mixing matrices directly without use of replica trick are used in this article to obtain the mixing matrices for next-to-eikonal Cwebs after we establish a relationship between next-to-eikonal and eikonal Cwebs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03949v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and discuss the release of novel sets of collinear, variable-flavor-number-scheme fragmentation functions for axial-vector, fully heavy $T_{4c}(1^{+-})$ and $T_{4b}(1^{+-})$ tetraquarks. Working within the single-parton approximation at leading power and employing nonrelativistic QCD factorization adapted for tetraquark Fock states, we model the initial-scale fragmentation input using a recent calculation for the constituent heavy-quark channel. Standard DGLAP evolution is then applied, ensuring consistent implementation of evolution thresholds. To support phenomenology, we investigate NLL/NLO$^+$ rates for tetraquark-jet systems at the HL-LHC and FCC from (sym)JETHAD. This study further integrates exotic matter explorations with precision QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Experimental Constraints on Seesaw Parameters in the Wigner-like Parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By introducing three right-handed neutrino singlets, the popular canonical seesaw mechanism is able to simultaneously explain the tiny masses of Majorana neutrinos and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In this paper, we provide an explicit calculation in this model with the help of the Wigner-like parametrization. We work in a special ansatz where both ${\bf m}_{\rm D}^\dagger {\bf m}_{\rm D}^{}$ and ${\bf m}_{\rm R}^\dagger {\bf m}_{\rm R}^{}$ are diagonal, with ${\bf m}_{\rm D}^{}$ and ${\bf m}_{\rm R}^{}$ being accordingly the Dirac and Majorana neutrino mass matrices, and $[{\bf m}_{\rm D}^\dagger {\bf m}_{\rm D}^{}, {\bf m}_{\rm R}^\dagger {\bf m}_{\rm R}^{}] = {\bf 0}$ holds. Physical observables can be exactly calculated without any approximation, where three light Majorana neutrino masses $m_i^{}$, leptonic mixing angles $\theta_{ij}^{}$, CP-violating phases $\{\delta,\rho,\sigma\}$, and three rotation angles $\vartheta_i^{}$ describing the hierarchy between electroweak and seesaw scales are chosen as input parameters. For demonstration, we evaluate the branching fractions of the lepton-flavor-violating decays of charged leptons and the CP-violating asymmetries in the resonant thermal leptogenesis. The model parameters are constrained by the latest experimental limits.</description>

Abstract: The INSPIRE platform -- the most widely-used discovery service specifically tailored to the needs of researchers in High Energy Physics (HEP) -- has become a central component of the information infrastructure for the discipline. Despite this, INSPIRE's continued sustainability is frequently endangered by resource constraints, recently made more acute by the loss of support from historical funders changing their research priorities. If the European particle physics community wishes to ensure INSPIRE's long-term sustainability, the community should secure international support and ensure appropriate funding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for relaxing a gauge theory CP violating phase in discrete steps to very small values. The idea is that the CP violating phase includes the magnetic dual of a $4$-form flux which can discharge by the nucleation of membranes. Inside the bubbles surrounded by the membranes, the total CP violating phase is reduced. When the bubbles are produced rapidly during radiation domination in the early universe, near the chiral symmetry breaking scale, they will collide and percolate, melting away into gauge theory radiation and dramatically relaxing CP violation.</description>

      <title>Classical Analysis of non-coherent Dark Matter to Photon Conversions in a Resonant Cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both axion and dark photon dark matter are among the most promising candidates of dark matter. What we know with some confidence is that they exhibit a small velocity distribution $\delta v\lesssim v\sim 10^{-3}$c. In addition, their mass is small, resulting in a long de Broglie wavelength and a high particle number density. Their phase space distribution has many uncertainties; thus they could give rise to a coherent or noncoherent wave on the laboratory scale. In this paper, we demonstrated that a resonant cavity can enhance the noncoherent axion-to-photon or dark photon-to-photon transitions. The reason in a classical picture is that a cavity can resonantly respond to many different resonant sources at the same time. This is consistent with the quantum perspective. The induced signals, however, are noncoherent and therefore may need a single-photon readout.</description>

Abstract: Developing an understanding of phenomena driven by the emergence of hadron mass (EHM) is one of the most challenging problems in the Standard Model. This discussion focuses on the impact of results on nucleon resonance ($N^\ast$) electroexcitation amplitudes (or $\gamma_vpN^\ast$ electrocouplings) obtained from experiments during the 6-GeV era in Hall~B at Jefferson Lab on understanding EHM. Analyzed using continuum Schwinger function methods (CSMs), these results have revealed new pathways for the elucidation of EHM. A good description of the $\Delta(1232)3/2^+$, $N(1440)1/2^+$, and $\Delta(1600)3/2^+$ electrocouplings, achieved by CSM analyses that express a realistic dressed quark mass function, sheds light on the strong interaction dynamics that underlies EHM. Extensions to nucleon resonance studies for higher-mass states are outlined, as well as experimental results anticipated in the 12-GeV era at Jefferson Lab and those that would be enabled by a further increase of the beam energy to 22~GeV.</description>

      <title>QCD sum rule study on excited light meson operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the QCD sum rule method to systematically study excited light meson operators and calculate their decay constants. These operators are constructed by explicitly adding one covariant derivative to the quark-antiquark pair. In total, twelve such operators are constructed, among which ten are subjected to detailed numerical analyses. The considered quark contents include $\bar{q}q$, $\bar{q}s$, and $\bar{s}s$ ($q = u/d$), allowing the formation of various $SU(3)$ flavor nonets. For instance, our results support the interpretation that the $a_2(1320)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_2^\prime(1525)$, and $K_2^*(1430)$ constitute a flavor nonet with quantum numbers $J^{P(C)} = 2^{+(+)}$. In addition, we predict several excited meson states, whose masses and decay constants are determined using the QCD sum rule method.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Spectral Method: From Atomic Orbitals to Classical Self-Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03798v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can classical systems be described analytically at all orders in their interaction strength? For periodic and approximately periodic systems, the answer is yes, as we show in this work. Our analytical approach, which we call the \textit{Quantum Spectral Method}, is based on a novel application of Bohr's correspondence principle, obtaining non-perturbative classical dynamics as the classical limit of \textit{quantum matrix elements}. A major application of our method is the calculation of self-force as the classical limit of atomic radiative transitions. We demonstrate this by calculating an adiabatic electromagnetic inspiral, along with its associated radiation, at all orders in the multipole expansion. Finally, we propose a future application of the Quantum Spectral Method to compute scalar and gravitational self-force in Schwarzschild, analytically.</description>

      <title>PolyBin3D: A Suite of Optimal and Efficient Power Spectrum and Bispectrum Estimators for Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By measuring, modeling and interpreting cosmological datasets, one can place strong constraints on models of the Universe. Central to this effort are summary statistics such as power spectra and bispectra, which condense the high-dimensional data into low-dimensional representations. In this work, we introduce a modern set of estimators for computing such statistics from three-dimensional clustering data, and provide a flexible Python/Cython implementation; PolyBin3D. Working in a maximum-likelihood formalism, we derive general estimators for the two- and three-point functions, which yield unbiased spectra regardless of the survey mask and weighting scheme. These can be directly compared to theory without the need for mask-convolution. Furthermore, we present a numerical scheme for computing the optimal (minimum-variance) estimators for a given survey, which is shown to reduce error-bars on large-scales. Our Python package includes both general "unwindowed" estimators and their idealized equivalents (appropriate for simulations), each of which are efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transforms and Monte Carlo summation tricks, and additionally supports GPU acceleration using JAX. These are extensively validated in this work, with Monte Carlo convergence (relevant for masked data) achieved using only a small number of iterations (typically $&lt;10$ for bispectra). This will allow for fast and unified measurement of two- and three-point functions from current and upcoming survey data.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Fixed-Angle Meson Scattering and the Constituent Counting Rule in Holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the high-energy fixed-angle scattering of pions and $\rho$-mesons in a bottom-up holographic QCD model. To this end, we generalise the approach of Polchinski and Strassler arXiv:hep-th/0109174 to write an ansatz for meson scattering amplitudes based on superstring scattering amplitudes in asymptotically AdS space. We demonstrate that our generalisation of the Polchinski--Strassler proposal is necessary to describe $\rho$-meson scattering consistently with the Nambu--Goldstone boson equivalence theorem. Our results for pion and $\rho$-meson scattering amplitudes are in agreement with the constituent counting rule found in QCD. Moreover, our proposal for 2-to-2 scattering amplitudes provides a method for computing scattering angle dependence.</description>

      <title>Nuclear matter properties from chiral-scale effective theory including a dilatonic scalar meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral effective theory has become a powerful tool for studying the low-energy properties of QCD. In this work, we apply an extended chiral effective theory -- chiral-scale effective theory -- including a dilatonic scalar meson to study nuclear matter and find that the properties around saturation density can be well reproduced. Compared to the traditionally used Walecka-type models in nuclear matter studies, our approach improves the behavior of symmetry energy and the incompressibility coefficient in describing empirical data without introducing additional freedoms. Moreover, the predicted neutron star structures fall within the constraints of GW170817, PSR J0740+6620, and PSR J0030+0451, while the maximum neutron star mass can reach about $~3M_{\odot}$ with a pure hadronic phase. Additionally, we find that symmetry patterns of the effective theory significantly impact neutron star structures. %In chiral-scale effective theory, effective operators are well organized by chiral-scale orders and freedoms induced by QCD symmetry patterns. We believe that introducing this type of theory into nuclear matter studies can lead to a deeper understanding of QCD, nuclear matter, and compact astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Effects of asymmetric dark matter on a magnetized neutron star: A two-fluid approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction between dark matter (DM) and highly magnetized neutron stars (NSs), focusing on how DM particle mass, mass fraction, and magnetic field (MF) strength affect NS structure and stability. We consider self-interacting, nonannihilating, asymmetric fermionic DM that couples to NSs only through gravitational interaction. Using the Quantum Monte Carlo Relativistic Mean Field (QMC-RMF4) model with density-dependent magnetic fields, we investigate the magnetized equation of state and examine the accumulation of DM under various conditions. Our results show that as the DM fraction increases, the maximum gravitational mass of the NS decreases, especially for heavier DM particles, while lighter DM particles can induce a transition from a dark core to a halo structure, increasing the maximum mass. Strong MFs soften the equation of state and reduce the dark mass a NS core can retain before transitioning to a halo. By comparing our results with observations from Neutro Star Interior Composition Explorer and GW170817, we identify the possible range of DM parameters for these objects. We find that the magnetic field slightly changes these limits, mainly affecting the maximum NS mass and tidal deformability. These findings provide key insights into how DM and MF jointly shape the mass-radius relation and the stability of DM-admixed magnetized NSs.</description>

      <title>Searching for dark matter annihilating into light long-lived mediators from stars inside dwarf spheroidal galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several astrophysical and cosmological observations suggest the existence of dark matter (DM) through its gravitational effects, yet its nature remains elusive. Despite the lack of DM signals from direct detection experiments, efforts continue to focus on the indirect detection of DM from DM-rich astrophysical objects. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are among the most promising targets for such searches. In this work, we aim to investigate the expected DM capture rate from the stellar component of ten nearby DM-rich dSphs, assuming that the accumulated DM eventually annihilates into light, long-lived mediators (LLLMs) which decay into gamma rays outside the dSphs. We analyze nearly 16 years of {\it Fermi}-LAT data to search for DM annihilation through LLLMs, and, from the observed stacked flux upper limits, set limits on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section for the case of a generic DM scenario. Additionally, we incorporate the Sommerfeld enhancement (SE) effect into the DM annihilation process assuming scalar DM model, and obtain bounds on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section of $\sim~10^{-36} {\rm cm}^2$ for DM masses around 100 GeV. This allows us to explore an alternative avenue for exploring DM phenomena from dSphs and compare our results with the bounds reported by direct DM detection experiments and other celestial bodies.</description>

      <title>An Alcock-Paczynski Test on Reionization Bubbles for Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an Alcock-Paczy\'nski (AP) test to constrain cosmology using HII bubbles during the Epoch of Reionization. Similarly to cosmic voids, a stack of HII bubbles is spherically symmetric because ionizing fronts propagate isotropically on average (even if individual bubbles may not be spherical), making them standard spheres to be used in an AP test. Upcoming 21-cm observations, from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) for instance, will contain tomographic information about HII regions during reionization. However, extracting the bubbles from this signal is made difficult because of instrumental noise and foreground systematics. Here, we use a neural network to reconstruct neutral-fraction boxes from the noisy 21-cm signal, from which we extract bubbles using a watershed algorithm. We then run the purely geometrical AP test on these stacks, showing that a SKA-like experiment will be able to constrain the product of the angular-diameter distance $D_{\text{A}}$ and Hubble parameter $H$ at reionization redshifts with $\sim 2\%$ precision, robustly to astrophysical and cosmological uncertainties within the models tested here. This AP test, whether performed on 21-cm observations or other large surveys of ionized bubbles, will allow us to fill the knowledge gap about the expansion rate of our Universe at reionization redshifts.</description>

Abstract: The NA62 experiment at CERN has the capability to collect data in a beam-dump mode, where 400 GeV protons are dumped on an absorber. In this configuration, New Physics particles, including dark photons, dark scalars, and axion-like particles, may be produced in the absorber and decay in the instrumented volume beginning approximately 80 m downstream of the dump. A search for these particles decaying in flight to hadronic final states is reported, based on an analysis of a sample of $1.4 \times 10^{17}$ protons on dump collected in 2021. No evidence of a New Physics signal is observed, excluding new regions of parameter spaces of multiple models.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence of gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum nature of gravity remains an open question in fundamental physics, lacking experimental verification. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a potential avenue for detecting gravitons, the hypothetical quantum carriers of gravity. However, by analogy with quantum optics, distinguishing gravitons from classical GWs requires the preservation of quantum coherence, which may be lost due to interactions with the cosmic environment causing decoherence. We investigate whether GWs retain their quantum state by deriving the reduced density matrix and evaluating decoherence, using an environmental model where a scalar field is conformally coupled to gravity. Our results show that quantum decoherence of GWs is stronger at lower frequencies and higher reheating temperatures. We identify a model-independent amplitude threshold below which decoherence is negligible, providing a fundamental limit for directly probing the quantum nature of gravity. In the standard cosmological scenario, the low energy density of the universe at the end of inflation leads to complete decoherence at the classical amplitude level of inflationary GWs. However, for higher energy densities, decoherence is negligible within a frequency window in the range $100\ {\rm Hz} \text{-} 10^8\ {\rm Hz}$, which depends on the reheating temperature. In a kinetic-dominated scenario, the dependence on reheating temperature weakens, allowing GWs to maintain quantum coherence above $10^7\ {\rm Hz}$.</description>

Abstract: Conditions are found, at which in nuclear matter there may appear a spatially nonuniform $p$ wave $\pi^0$ condensate supplemented by a spatially varying spontaneous magnetization. The pion-nucleon interaction and the anomaly contributions to magnetization are taken into account. Response of the system on external magnetic field is also considered. Then the model of nonoverlapped nucleon Fermi spheres is employed. Arguments are given in favor of possibility of the occurrence of the $\pi^0$-condensation and a spatially varying magnetization as well as effects of pronounced anisotropic pion fluctuations at finite pion momentum in peripheral heavy-ion collisions. Relevant effects such as response on the rotation, charged pion condensation and other are discussed.</description>

      <title>Progenitor Dependence of Neutrino-driven Supernova Explosions with the Aid of Heavy Axion-like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform spherically symmetric simulations of core-collapse supernovae with the aid of heavy axion-like particles (ALPs) which interact with photons and redistribute energy within supernova matter. We explore a wide ALP parameter space that includes MeV-scale ALP mass $m_{\,a}$ and the ALP-photon coupling constant $g_{\,a \gamma} \sim 10^{\,-10} \, \rm{GeV}^{\,-1}$ , employing three progenitor models with zero-age main-sequence mass of $11.2\,M_\odot$, $20.0\,M_\odot$, and $25.0\,M_\odot$. We find a general trend that, given $m_{\,a}\lesssim 300\,$MeV, heavier ALPs are favorable for the shock wave to be successfully revived, aiding the onset of the neutrino-driven explosion. However, if ALPs are heavier than $\sim 400\,$MeV, the explosion is failed or weaker than that for the models with smaller $m_{\,a}$, because of an insufficient temperature inside the supernova core to produce heavy ALPs. The maximum temperature in the core depends on the initial progenitor structure. Our simulations indicate that the high-temperature environment in the collapsing core of massive progenitors leads to a significant impact of ALPs on the explodability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a dark energy model in which a quintessence field $\phi$ rolls near the vicinity of a local maximum of its potential characterized by the simplest $S$ self-dual form $V(\phi) = \Lambda \ {\rm sech}(\sqrt{2} \, \phi/M_p)$, where $M_p$ is the reduced Planck mass and $\Lambda \sim 10^{-120} M_p^4$ is the cosmological constant. We confront the model with Swampland ideas and show that the $S$-dual potential is consistent with the distance conjecture, the de Sitter conjecture, and the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture. We also examine the compatibility of this phenomenological model with the intriguing DESI DR2 results and show that the shape of the $S$-dual potential is almost indistinguishable from the axion-like potential, $V (\phi) = m_a^2 \ f_a^2 \ [ 1 + \cos(\phi/f_a)]$, with $m_a$ and $f_a$ parameters fitted by the DESI Collaboration to accommodate the DR2 data. The self-dual potential has the advantage that one starts at the self-dual point and this is a theoretical motivation, because as the universe cools off the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry gets broken leading to a natural rolling away from the symmetric point.</description>
