      <title>MGNN: Moment Graph Neural Network for Universal Molecular Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for efficient and robust deep learning models for molecular systems representation is increasingly critical in scientific exploration. The advent of message passing neural networks has marked a transformative era in graph-based learning, particularly in the realm of predicting chemical properties and expediting molecular dynamics studies. We present the Moment Graph Neural Network (MGNN), a rotation-invariant message passing neural network architecture that capitalizes on the moment representation learning of 3D molecular graphs, is adept at capturing the nuanced spatial relationships inherent in three-dimensional molecular structures. MGNN demonstrates new state-of-the-art performance over contemporary methods on benchmark datasets such as QM9 and the revised MD17. The prowess of MGNN also extends to dynamic simulations, accurately predicting the structural and kinetic properties of complex systems such as amorphous electrolytes, with results that closely align with those from ab-initio simulations. The application of MGNN to the simulation of molecular spectra exemplifies its potential to significantly enhance the computational workflow, offering a promising alternative to traditional electronic structure methods</description>

      <title>An adaptive Gaussian process method for multi-modal Bayesian inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems are prevalent in both scientific research and engineering applications. In the context of Bayesian inverse problems, sampling from the posterior distribution is particularly challenging when the forward models are computationally expensive. This challenge escalates further when the posterior distribution is multimodal. To address this, we propose a Gaussian process (GP) based method to indirectly build surrogates for the forward model. Specifically, the unnormalized posterior density is expressed as a product of an auxiliary density and an exponential GP surrogate. In an iterative way, the auxiliary density will converge to the posterior distribution starting from an arbitrary initial density. However, the efficiency of the GP regression is highly influenced by the quality of the training data. Therefore, we utilize the iterative local updating ensemble smoother (ILUES) to generate high-quality samples that are concentrated in regions with high posterior probability. Subsequently, based on the surrogate model and the mode information that is extracted by using a clustering method, MCMC with a Gaussian mixed (GM) proposal is used to draw samples from the auxiliary density. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately and efficiently represent the posterior with a limited number of forward simulations.</description>

      <title>Smallest [5,6]fullerene as building blocks for 2D networks with superior stability and enhanced photocatalytic performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The assembly of molecules with covalent networks can form varied lattice structures with distinct physical and chemical properties from conventional atomic lattices. Using the smallest stable [5,6]fullerene units as building blocks, various 2D C$_{24}$ networks can be formed with superior stability and strength compared to the recently synthesised monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. Monolayer C$_{24}$ harnesses the properties of both carbon crystals and fullerene molecules, such as stable chemical bonds, suitable band gaps and large surface area, facilitating photocatalytic water splitting. The electronic band gaps of C$_{24}$ are comparable to TiO$_2$, providing appropriate band edges with sufficient external potential for overall water splitting over the acidic and neutral pH range. Upon photoexcitation, strong solar absorption enabled by strongly bound bright excitons can generate carriers effectively, while the type-II band alignment between C$_{24}$ and other 2D monolayers can separate electrons and holes in individual layers simultaneously. Additionally, the number of surface active sites of C$_{24}$ monolayers are three times more than that of their C$_{60}$ counterparts in a much wider pH range, providing spontaneous reaction pathways for hydrogen evolution reaction. Our work provides insights into materials design using tunable building blocks of fullerene units with tailored functions for energy generation, conversion and storage.</description>

      <title>Northeast Materials Database (NEMAD): Enabling Discovery of High Transition Temperature Magnetic Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of novel magnetic materials with greater operating temperature ranges and optimized performance is essential for advanced applications. Current data-driven approaches are challenging and limited due to the lack of accurate, comprehensive, and feature-rich databases. This study aims to address this challenge by introducing a new approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a comprehensive, experiment-based, magnetic materials database named the Northeast Materials Database (NEMAD), which consists of 26,706 magnetic materials (www.nemad.org). The database incorporates chemical composition, magnetic phase transition temperatures, structural details, and magnetic properties. Enabled by NEMAD, machine learning models were developed to classify materials and predict transition temperatures. Our classification model achieved an accuracy of 90% in categorizing materials as ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM), and non-magnetic (NM). The regression models predict Curie (N\'eel) temperature with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.86 (0.85) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 62K (32K). These models identified 62 (19) FM (AFM) candidates with a predicted Curie (N\'eel) temperature above 500K (100K) from the Materials Project. This work shows the feasibility of combining LLMs for automated data extraction and machine learning models in accelerating the discovery of magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum DeepONet: Neural operators accelerated by quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of computational science and engineering, constructing models that reflect real-world phenomena requires solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with different conditions. Recent advancements in neural operators, such as deep operator network (DeepONet), which learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, promise efficient computation of PDE solutions for a new condition in a single forward pass. However, classical DeepONet entails quadratic complexity concerning input dimensions during evaluation. Given the progress in quantum algorithms and hardware, here we propose to utilize quantum computing to accelerate DeepONet evaluations, yielding complexity that is linear in input dimensions. Our proposed quantum DeepONet integrates unary encoding and orthogonal quantum layers. We benchmark our quantum DeepONet using a variety of PDEs, including the antiderivative operator, advection equation, and Burgers' equation. We demonstrate the method's efficacy in both ideal and noisy conditions. Furthermore, we show that our quantum DeepONet can also be informed by physics, minimizing its reliance on extensive data collection. Quantum DeepONet will be particularly advantageous in applications in outer loop problems which require to explore parameter space and solving the corresponding PDEs, such as uncertainty quantification and optimal experimental design.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot forecasting of chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting is a challenging task that traditionally requires specialized models custom-trained for the specific task at hand. Recently, inspired by the success of large language models, foundation models pre-trained on vast amounts of time-series data from diverse domains have emerged as a promising candidate for general-purpose time-series forecasting. The defining characteristic of these foundation models is their ability to perform zero-shot learning, that is, forecasting a new system from limited context data without explicit re-training or fine-tuning. Here, we evaluate whether the zero-shot learning paradigm extends to the challenging task of forecasting chaotic systems. Across 135 distinct chaotic dynamical systems and $10^8$ timepoints, we find that foundation models produce competitive forecasts compared to custom-trained models (including NBEATS, TiDE, etc.), particularly when training data is limited. Interestingly, even after point forecasts fail, foundation models preserve the geometric and statistical properties of the chaotic attractors, demonstrating a surprisingly strong ability to capture the long-term behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight the promises and pitfalls of foundation models in making zero-shot forecasts of chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>A new interpolated pseudodifferential preconditioner for the Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new pseudodifferential preconditioner for the Helmholtz equation in variable media with absorption. The pseudodifferential operator is associated with the multiplicative inverse to the symbol of the Helmholtz operator. This approach is well-suited for the intermediate and high-frequency regimes. The main novel idea for the fast evaluation of the preconditioner is to interpolate its symbol, not as a function of the (high-dimensional) phase-space variables, but as a function of the wave speed itself. Since the wave speed is a real-valued function, this approach allows us to interpolate in a univariate setting even when the original problem is posed in a multidimensional physical space. As a result, the needed number of interpolation points is small, and the interpolation coefficients can be computed using the fast Fourier transform. The overall computational complexity is log-linear with respect to the degrees of freedom as inherited from the fast Fourier transform. We present some numerical experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of the preconditioner to solve the discrete Helmholtz equation using the GMRES iterative method. The implementation of an absorbing layer for scattering problems using a complex-valued wave speed is also developed. Limitations and possible extensions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Studying ballistic aggregation phenomena through efficient Time Stepping approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the problem of simulating dense dispersed systems composed by large numbers of particles undergoing ballistic aggregation. The most classical approaches for dealing with such problems are represented by the so-called event-driven methods. Despite being more accurate, these methods become computationally very expensive as the number of particles increases. Typically, their computational cost is proportional to the square of the number of particles and thus they become extremely demanding as soon as this number becomes sufficiently large. An alternative approach, called time-stepping, consists in evolving the problem over small time-intervals and to handle all collisions occurring during each time interval simultaneously. In this work, we follow this second direction and we introduce a new time stepping method which recasts the problem of the multiple collisions in a minimization framework. The objective of this work is twofold, first to show that the statistical description of the resulting aggregates obtained with this new time stepping method is sufficiently close to that of the event driven methods. The second goal consists in showing that the computational performance considerably improve when the number of particles becomes sufficiently large. Numerical results obtained in the case of spherical particles moving in a two dimensional box show that these two properties are indeed satisfied by this new method.</description>

      <title>Radiative hydrodynamic equations with nonequilibrium radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a kinetic model for the coupled evolution of radiation, electrons, and ions in a radiation plasma system. The model is solved using two methods. The gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) for electron and ion hydrodynamics and the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for non-equilibrium radiative transfer. The UGKS accurately captures multiscale photon transport from free streaming to diffusion across varying fluid opacities. This approach enables the scheme to model equilibrium plasma with non-equilibrium radiation transport. The model is validated through several test cases, including radiative transfer in kinetic and diffusion regimes, Marshak wave, Radiative shock, 3T(three-temperature) double lax shock tube problem, two-dimensional Sedov blast wave, and two-dimensional tophat based problem. These tests demonstrate the current scheme's capability to handle diverse radiation plasma scenarios.</description>

      <title>Modeling inertial flows with meshless Lattice Boltzmann Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the limitations of the Lattice Boltzmann Method in simulating inertial flows is the coupling of the discretization of space to the velocity discretization. It requires an increase of the size of computational lattices in order to increase the Reynolds number at a fixed velocity and viscosity. In this work, we adopt the recently proposed meshless formulation of Lattice Boltzmann Method to the problem of inertial flows. In contrast to the standard algorithm, it allows to decouple space and velocity discretizations. Thus, one can change the conversion factors from lattice to physical units for length, velocity, and body force by scaling the streaming distance. In turn, one increases the Reynolds number without increasing the size of the discretization. We measure the accuracy and efficiency of this approach in the K\'{a}rm\'{a}n vortex street behind a circular obstacle and the flow through a porous sample in Darcy and inertial regime. Additionally, we apply the meshless streaming step to the recently proposed fixed relaxation time $\tau=1$ LBM to extend its applicability to model inertial flows.</description>

      <title>PICL: Physics Informed Contrastive Learning for Partial Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16327v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators have recently grown in popularity as Partial Differential Equation (PDE) surrogate models. Learning solution functionals, rather than functions, has proven to be a powerful approach to calculate fast, accurate solutions to complex PDEs. While much work has been done evaluating neural operator performance on a wide variety of surrogate modeling tasks, these works normally evaluate performance on a single equation at a time. In this work, we develop a novel contrastive pretraining framework utilizing Generalized Contrastive Loss that improves neural operator generalization across multiple governing equations simultaneously. Governing equation coefficients are used to measure ground-truth similarity between systems. A combination of physics-informed system evolution and latent-space model output are anchored to input data and used in our distance function. We find that physics-informed contrastive pretraining improves accuracy for the Fourier Neural Operator in fixed-future and autoregressive rollout tasks for the 1D and 2D Heat, Burgers', and linear advection equations.</description>

      <title>Strong-field effects in the photo-induced dissociation of the hydrogen molecule on a silver nanoshell</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic catalysis is a rapidly growing field of research, both from experimental and computational perspectives. Experimental observations demonstrate an enhanced dissociation rate for molecules in the presence of plasmonic nanoparticles under low-intensity visible light. The hot-carrier transfer from the nanoparticle to the molecule is often claimed as the mechanism for dissociation. However, the charge transfer time scale is on the order of few femtoseconds and cannot be resolved experimentally. In this situation, ab initio non-adiabatic calculations can provide a solution. Such simulations, however, have their own limitations related to the computational cost. To accelerate plasmonic catalysis simulations, many researchers resort to applying high-intensity external fields to nanoparticle-molecule systems. Here, we show why such an approach can be problematic and emphasize the importance of considering strong-field effects when interpreting the results of time-dependent density functional theory simulations of plasmonic catalysis. By studying the hydrogen molecule dissociation on the surface of a silver nanoshell and analyzing the electron transfer at different field frequencies and high intensities, we demonstrate that the molecule dissociates due to multiphoton absorption and subsequent ionization.</description>

Abstract: It is the theoretical structure of electromagnetism that led Einstein to special relativity. To foster an intuitive understanding of relativity's core idea, it is valuable to create a fully special relativistic computer simulation incorporating electromagnetic dynamics. In this paper, we provide a basic formulation for such an implementation. Specifically, the player observes the world via their past light cone and experiences the Lorentz force generated by the electromagnetic field at their spacetime location. The electromagnetic field at any given spacetime point is determined by the sublight-speed motion of individual point charges on the past light cone of that spacetime point.</description>

      <title>Thermolectricity in irradiated bilayer graphene flakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE) performance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily polarized light, focusing on $AA$- and $AB$-stacked configurations with zigzag edges. Utilizing a combination of tight-binding theory and density functional theory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on electronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the electronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function, which significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the overall {\it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT calculations reveal that $AB$-stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal conductivity compared to $AA$-stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic scattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM exceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the irradiation-induced gap. Additionally, we explore the dependence of FOM on the system dimensions and temperature, demonstrating that light-irradiated BLG holds great promise for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and waste heat recovery. Our results show favorable responses over a wide range of irradiation parameters. These findings provide crucial insights into optimizing BLG for advanced TE applications through light-induced modifications.</description>
