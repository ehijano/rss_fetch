      <title>Progress of the anti-obesity of Berberine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obesity is defined as the excessive accumulation or abnormal distribution of body fat. According to data from World Obesity Atlas 2024, the increase in prevalence of obesity has become a major worldwide health problem in adults as well as among children and adolescents. Although an increasing number of drugs have been approved for the treatment of obesity in recent years, many of these drugs have inevitable side effects which have increased the demand for new safe, accessible and effective drugs for obesity and prompt interest in natural products. Berberine (BBR) and its metabolites, known for their multiple pharmacological effects. Recent studies have emphatically highlighted the anti-obesity benefits of BBR and the underlying mechanisms have been gradually elucidated. However, its clinical application is limited by poor oral absorption and low bioavailability. Based on this, this review summarizes current research on the anti-obesity effects of BBR and its metabolites, including advancements in clinical trail results, understanding potential molecular mechanisms and absorption and bioavailability. As a natural compound derived from plants, BBR holds potential as an alternative approach for managing obesity.</description>

      <title>Unified Guidance for Geometry-Conditioned Molecular Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively designing molecular geometries is essential to advancing pharmaceutical innovations, a domain, which has experienced great attention through the success of generative models and, in particular, diffusion models. However, current molecular diffusion models are tailored towards a specific downstream task and lack adaptability. We introduce UniGuide, a framework for controlled geometric guidance of unconditional diffusion models that allows flexible conditioning during inference without the requirement of extra training or networks. We show how applications such as structure-based, fragment-based, and ligand-based drug design are formulated in the UniGuide framework and demonstrate on-par or superior performance compared to specialised models. Offering a more versatile approach, UniGuide has the potential to streamline the development of molecular generative models, allowing them to be readily used in diverse application scenarios.</description>

      <title>Proteomic Learning of Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) Receptor-Mediated Anesthesia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anesthetics are crucial in surgical procedures and therapeutic interventions, but they come with side effects and varying levels of effectiveness, calling for novel anesthetic agents that offer more precise and controllable effects. Targeting Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, the primary inhibitory receptors in the central nervous system, could enhance their inhibitory action, potentially reducing side effects while improving the potency of anesthetics. In this study, we introduce a proteomic learning of GABA receptor-mediated anesthesia based on 24 GABA receptor subtypes by considering over 4000 proteins in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and over 1.5 millions known binding compounds. We develop a corresponding drug-target interaction network to identify potential lead compounds for novel anesthetic design. To ensure robust proteomic learning predictions, we curated a dataset comprising 136 targets from a pool of 980 targets within the PPI networks. We employed three machine learning algorithms, integrating advanced natural language processing (NLP) models such as pretrained transformer and autoencoder embeddings. Through a comprehensive screening process, we evaluated the side effects and repurposing potential of over 180,000 drug candidates targeting the GABRA5 receptor. Additionally, we assessed the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties of these candidates to identify those with near-optimal characteristics. This approach also involved optimizing the structures of existing anesthetics. Our work presents an innovative strategy for the development of new anesthetic drugs, optimization of anesthetic use, and deeper understanding of potential anesthesia-related side effects.</description>

      <title>The effect of stereochemical constraints on the radius of gyration of folded proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins are composed of linear chains of amino acids that fold into complex three-dimensional structures. A general feature of folded proteins is that they are compact with a radius of gyration $R_g(N) \sim N^{\nu}$ that obeys power-law scaling with the number of amino acids $N$ in each protein and $\nu \sim 1/3$. In this study, we investigate the {\it internal} scaling of the radius of gyration $R_g(n)$ versus the chemical separation $n$ between amino acids for all subchains of length $n$. We show that for globular proteins $R_g(n) \sim n^{\nu_{1,2}}$ with a larger exponent $\nu_1 &gt; 1/3$ for small $n$ and a smaller exponent $\nu_{2} &lt; 1/3$ for large $n$, such that $R_g(N) \propto N^\nu$. To describe this scaling behavior for $R_g(n)$, we carry out folding simulations for a series of coarse-grained models for proteins beginning with the freely-jointed and freely-rotating chain models composed of spherical monomers and varying degrees of stereochemical constraints. We show that a minimal model, which coarse-grains amino acids into a single spherical backbone atom and one variable-sized spherical side-chain atom, and enforces bend- and dihedral-angle constraints, can recapitulate $R_g(n)$ for x-ray crystal structures of globular proteins. In addition, this model predicts the correct average packing fraction and size of the hydrophobic core, which are two key physical features that can be used to distinguish between computational `decoys' and correctly folded proteins in protein design applications.</description>

      <title>Systematic Analysis of Biomolecular Conformational Ensembles with PENSA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02714v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic-level simulations are widely used to study biomolecules and their dynamics. A common goal in such studies is to compare simulations of a molecular system under several conditions -- for example, with various mutations or bound ligands -- in order to identify differences between the molecular conformations adopted under these conditions. However, the large amount of data produced by simulations of ever larger and more complex systems often renders it difficult to identify the structural features that are relevant for a particular biochemical phenomenon. We present a flexible software package named PENSA that enables a comprehensive and thorough investigation into biomolecular conformational ensembles. It provides featurizations and feature transformations that allow for a complete representation of biomolecules like proteins and nucleic acids, including water and ion binding sites, thus avoiding bias that would come with manual feature selection. PENSA implements methods to systematically compare the distributions of molecular features across ensembles to find the significant differences between them and identify regions of interest. It also includes a novel approach to quantify the state-specific information between two regions of a biomolecule, which allows, e.g., tracing information flow to identify allosteric pathways. PENSA also comes with convenient tools for loading data and visualizing results, making them quick to process and easy to interpret. PENSA is an open-source Python library maintained at https://github.com/drorlab/pensa along with an example workflow and a tutorial. We demonstrate its usefulness in real-world examples by showing how it helps to determine molecular mechanisms efficiently.</description>
