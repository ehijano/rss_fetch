      <title>A family of instanton-invariants for four-manifolds and their relation to Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reviews Witten's gauge-theoretic approach to Khovanov homology from the perspective of Haydys-Witten instanton Floer theory. Expanding on Witten's arguments, we introduce a one-parameter family of instanton Floer homology groups $HF_{\theta}(W^4)$, which, based on physical arguments, are expected to be topological invariants of the four-manifold $W^4$. In analogy to the original Yang-Mills instanton Floer theory, these groups are defined by the solutions of the $\theta$-Kapustin-Witten equations on $W^4$ modulo instanton solutions of the Haydys-Witten equations that interpolate between them on the five-dimensional cylinder $\mathbb{R}_s \times W^4$. The relation to knot invariants arises when the four-manifold is the geometric blowup $W^4 = [X^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+, K]$ along a knot $K \subset X^3 \times \{0\}$ embedded in its three-dimensional boundary. The boundaries and corners of this manifold require the specification of boundary conditions that preserve the topological invariance of the construction and are fundamentally linked to various dimensional reductions of the Haydys-Witten equations. We provide a comprehensive discussion of these dimensional reductions and relate them to well-known gauge-theoretic equations in lower dimensions, including the $\theta$-Kapustin-Witten equations, twisted extended Bogomolny equations, and twisted octonionic Nahm equations. Along the way, we record novel results on the elliptic regularity of the Haydys-Witten equations with twisted Nahm pole boundary conditions. The upshot of the article is a tentative definition of Haydys-Witten Floer theory and a precise restatement of Witten's conjecture: an equality between the Haydys-Witten Floer homology $HF^\bullet_{\pi/2}([S^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+, K])$ and Khovanov homology $Kh^\bullet(K)$.</description>

      <title>Higher rank elliptic partition functions and multisymmetric elliptic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate a class of $\mathfrak{gl}_{M+1}$ partition functions which is an extension of the one introduced by Foda-Manabe. We characterize the partition functions by a nested version of Izergin-Korepin analysis, and determine the explicit forms, for each of the rational, trigonometric and elliptic versions. The resulting multisymmetric functions can be regarded as extensions of the rational, trigonometric and elliptic weight functions.</description>

      <title>Spectrum and Lifshitz tails for the Anderson model on the Sierpinski gasket graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Anderson model on the Sierpinski gasket graph. We first identify the almost sure spectrum of the Anderson model when the support of the random potential has no gaps. We then prove the existence of the integrated density states of the Anderson model and show that it has Lifshitz tails with Lifshitz exponent determined by the ratio of the volume growth rate and the random walk dimension of the Sierpinski gasket graph.</description>

      <title>Local enhancement of the mean-field approximation for bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum many-body dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) on the lattice in the mean-field regime. We derive a local enhancement of the mean-field approximation: At positive distance $\rho&gt;0$ from the initial BEC, the mean-field approximation error at time $t\leq \rho/v$ is bounded as $\rho^{-n}$, for arbitrarily large $n\geq 1$. This is a consequence of new ballistic propagation bounds on the fluctuations around the condensate. To prove this, we develop a variant of the ASTLO (adiabatic spacetime localization observable) method for the particle non-conserving generator of the fluctuation dynamics around Hartree states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two topological non-$\Sigma$ operad structures on planar line arrangements subject to a certain geometric order condition, ensuring a well-defined notion of particle ordering on a distinguished line. This is interpreted in terms of scattering diagrams in purely elastic (1+1)-dimensional theories. We discuss a possible approach to factorized scattering in operadic terms.</description>

      <title>Network Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The renormalization group (RG) is a powerful theoretical framework developed to consistently transform the description of configurations of systems with many degrees of freedom, along with the associated model parameters and coupling constants, across different levels of resolution. It also provides a way to identify critical points of phase transitions and study the system's behaviour around them by distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant details, the latter being unnecessary to describe the emergent macroscopic properties. In traditional physical applications, the RG largely builds on the notions of homogeneity, symmetry, geometry and locality to define metric distances, scale transformations and self-similar coarse-graining schemes. More recently, various approaches have tried to extend RG concepts to the ubiquitous realm of complex networks where explicit geometric coordinates do not necessarily exist, nodes and subgraphs can have very different properties, and homogeneous lattice-like symmetries are absent. The strong heterogeneity of real-world networks significantly complicates the definition of consistent renormalization procedures. In this review, we discuss the main attempts, the most important advances, and the remaining open challenges on the road to network renormalization.</description>

      <title>Multi-parametric Nonlinear Generalization of Klein-Gordon: Real and Complex Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a nonlinear multiparametric Klein-Gordon for complex and real fields with mass dimension depending on a real parameter $\alpha$ as $\delta = 2/(1+\alpha)$ where $\delta$ is the mass dimension of the fields. We show that there are three classes of generalized models, one class for complex fields and two different classes for real fields. All models in these three classes have travelling-wave solutions and satisfy the relativistic dispersion relation. Moreover, all models of the complex class and models of only one class of the two real classes recover the standard Klein-Gordon model. We also build the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian for the three classes of models. The fields in the models of these three classes could in principle have the mass dimension varying from zero to one and this can allow us to construct interaction terms, other than $\lambda \Phi^4$, with coupling constants with positive or zero mass dimensions. Furthermore, we also show that there is a subclass of equations in the complex class which has a Lorentzian soliton solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These are notes of my lecture courses given in the summer of 2024 in the School on Number Theory and Physics at ICTP in Trieste and in the 27th Brazilian Algebra Meeting at IME-USP in S\~ao Paulo. We give an elementary account of $p$-adic methods in de Rham cohomology of algebraic hypersurfaces with explicit examples and applications in number theory and combinatorics. These lectures are based on the series of our joint papers with Frits Beukers entitled \emph{Dwork crystals} (\cite{DCI,DCII,DCIII}). These methods also have applications in mathematical physics and arithmetic geometry (\cite{IN,Cartier0}), which we overview here towards the end. I am grateful to the organisers of both schools and to the participants of my courses whose questions stimulated writing these notes.</description>

      <title>Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13360v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</description>

      <title>Gap Labels and Asymptotic Gap Opening for Full Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss gap labelling for operators generated by the full shift over a compact subset of the real line. The set of Johnson--Schwartzman gap labels is the algebra generated by weights of clopen subsets of the support of the single-site distribution. Due to the presence of a dense set of periodic orbits, it is impossible to find a sampling function for which all gaps allowed by the gap labelling theorem open simultaneously. Nevertheless, for a suitable choice of the single-site distribution, we show that for generic sampling functions, every spectral gap opens in the large-coupling limit. Furthermore, we show that for other choices of weights there are gaps that cannot open for purely diagonal operators.</description>

      <title>Strings from Feynman Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For correlators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills preserving half the supersymmetry, we manifestly recast the gauge theory Feynman diagram expansion as a sum over dual closed strings. Each individual Feynman diagram maps on to a Riemann surface with specific moduli. The Feynman diagrams thus correspond to discrete lattice points on string moduli space, rather than discretized worldsheets. This picture is valid to all orders in the $1/N$ expansion. Concretely, the mapping is carried out at the level of a two-matrix integral with its dual string description. It provides a microscopic picture of open/closed string duality for this topological subsector of the full AdS/CFT correspondence. At the same time, the concrete mechanism for how strings emerge from the matrix model Feynman diagrams predicts that multiple open string descriptions can exist for the same dual closed string theory. By considering the insertion of determinant operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, we indeed find six equivalent open-string descriptions. Each of them generates Feynman diagrams related to one another via (partial) graph duality, and hence encodes the same information. The embedding of these Kontsevich-like duals into the 1/2 SUSY sector of AdS/CFT is achieved by open strings on giant graviton branes.</description>

      <title>A simple way to reduce the number of contours in the multi-fold Mellin-Barnes integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mellin-Barnes integral representation of one-loop off-shell box massless diagram is five-fold by construction. On the other hand, it is known from the year 1992 that it may be reduced to certain two-fold MB integral. We propose a way to reduce the number of the MB integration contours from five to two by using the MB integral representation only in combination with basic methods of mathematical analysis such as analytical regularization. We do not use any Barnes lemma to prove the reduction but we use the integral Cauchy formula instead. We recover first the well-known two-fold MB representation for the one-loop triangle massless diagram and then show how the five-fold MB integral representation of one-loop box diagram with all the indices 1 in four spacetime dimensions may be reduced to the two-fold MB representation for one-loop triangle diagram. Singular integrals over Feynman parameters appear in the integrand of the five-fold MB integral representation at the intermediate step. Such integrals should be treated as distributions with respect to certain linear combinations of the initial MB integration variables in the MB integrands. These distributions may be integrated out with a finite number of residues in the limit of removing the analytical regularization. We explain how to apply this strategy to an arbitrary Feynman diagram in order to reduce the number of MB integration contours.</description>

      <title>Effective Medium Theory for Time-modulated Subwavelength Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a general framework for deriving effective material properties of time-modulated systems of subwavelength resonators. It applies to subwavelength resonator systems with a general form of time-dependent parameters. We show that the resonators can be accurately described by a point-scattering formulation when the width of the resonators is small. In contrast to the static setting, where this point interaction approximation yields a Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the effective material properties, the mode coupling in the time-modulated case instead yields an infinite linear system of Lippmann-Schwinger-type equations. The effective equations can equivalently be written as a system of integro-differential equations. Moreover, we introduce a numerical scheme to approximately solve the system of coupled equations and illustrate the validity of the effective equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mean-field limit of the 1D bosonic canonical ensemble in a superharmonic trap. This is the regime with temperature proportional to particle number, both diverging to infinity, and correspondingly scaled interactions. We prove that the limit model is a classical field theory based on a non-linear Schr{\"o}dinger-Gibbs measure conditioned on the L2 mass, thereby obtaining a canonical analogue of previous results for the grand-canonical ensemble. We take advantage of this set-up with fixed mass to include focusing/attractive interactions/non-linearities in our study.</description>

Abstract: We analytically study the exceptional points of a Liouvillian super-operator describing an open quantum system of two interacting qubits with a dissipative bath of polarization applied to one of the qubits. Our focus is the structure of the exceptional point manifolds in the parameter space which we describe in all analytic details. In particular, we characterize the manifold of bifurcation points corresponding to largest dissipation, and describe the relative effective quantum Zeno dynamics in the bifurcation-free regime, which may occur at relatively small dissipation.</description>

      <title>Minimum nonlinearity for pattern-forming Turing instability in a mathematical autocatalytic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pattern formation is ubiquitous in nature and the mechanism widely-accepted to underlay them is based on the Turing instability, predicted by Alan Turing decades ago. This is a non-trivial mechanism that involves nonlinear interaction terms between the different species involved and transport mechanisms. We present here a mathematical analysis aiming to explore the mathematical constraints that a reaction-diffusion dynamical model should comply in order to exhibit a Turing instability. The main conclusion limits the existence of this instability to nonlinearity degrees larger or equal to three.</description>

      <title>Higher-spin symmetry in the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ boundary Toda conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is dedicated to studying the symmetries enjoyed by the probabilistic construction of the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ boundary Toda Conformal Field Theory. Namely we show that this model enjoys higher-spin symmetry in the form of Ward identities, higher equations of motion and under additional assumptions BPZ-type differential equations. To do so we consider the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ Toda theory on the upper-half plane and rigorously define the descendant fields associated to the Vertex Operators. We then show that we can express local as well as global Ward identities based on them, for both the stress-energy tensor and the higher-spin current that encodes the $W$-symmetry. On the other hand, we show that specific Vertex Operators called degenerate fields give rise to singular vectors, which become higher equations of motion at the level of correlation functions. As a corollary we obtain BPZ-type differential equations satisfied by a family of correlation functions, which were unknown in the physics literature.</description>

      <title>A purely geometrical Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply covariant affine integral quantization to study motion in the 2D punctured plane. The associated four-dimensional phase space is identified with the similitude group SIM(2), representing transformations of the plane composed of translations, rotations, and dilations. Near the punctured point, we observe that the topology influencing quantum fluctuations gives rise to an affine vector potential, which can be interpreted as the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) gauge potential generated by an infinite coil. This finding suggests that the AB effect originates from the topology enforced by the impenetrable coil, rather than from a classical gauge potential. Our results offer a novel perspective on the AB effect, emphasizing the fundamental role of topology in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider disordered finite systems of subwavelength resonators where the disorder is in the spatial arrangement of the resonators and their material parameters are perturbed randomly. We elucidate the mechanism of wave localisation in such systems. To do so, we employ the capacitance matrix formalism, make precise the notions of bandgap and localised eigenmodes, study their stabilities with respect to fluctuations in the system, and highlight the importance of defect hybridisation and level repulsion in creating localised eigenmodes for a given arrangement of the resonators by randomly changing their material parameters. We also introduce a method of localised eigenmode prediction based on the discrete Green function of the disordered system of resonators and show the existence of bound eigenmodes in disordered systems where local translation invariance is broken.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion of Superparamagnetic Walkers with Tailored Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From life sciences and ecology to quantum physics and finance, anomalous diffusion appears in countless complex systems as a signature of emergent transport properties beyond Brownian motion. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion remains challenging due to an intrinsically elusive ground truth and the limited information contained in typical single trajectories. Here, unlike previous experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of two-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics spanning the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, and over statistically significant temporal and spatial scales (covering at least two decades). We achieve this feat by simultaneously tuning the step-length distribution and, critically, the velocity autocorrelation function of microscopic superparamagnetic colloidal walkers with magnetic fields during extended acquisitions. Supported by theoretical reasoning, fine control of these two quantities combined allows us to generate trajectories compatible with L\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion with tailored anomalous diffusion exponents. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable experimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models, analysis techniques, and predictive tools to study anomalous diffusion in real-life phenomena. These include transport in physical and biological systems, animal movement, human ecology, and financial markets.</description>

      <title>Turbulent solutions of the binormal flow and the 1D cubic Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last three decades there is an intense activity on the exploration of turbulent phenomena of dispersive equations, as for instance the growth of Sobolev norms since the work of Bourgain in the 90s. In general the 1D cubic Schr\"odinger equation has been left aside because of its complete integrability. In a series of papers of the last six years that we survey here for the special issue of the ICMP 2024 ([12],[13],[14],[15],[16],[7],[8]), we considered, together with the 1D cubic Schr\"odinger equation, the binormal flow, which is a geometric flow explicitly related to it. We displayed rigorously a large range of complex behavior as creation of singularities and unique continuation, Fourier growth, Talbot effects, intermittency and multifractality, justifying in particular some previous numerical observations. To do so we constructed a class of well-posedness for the 1D cubic Schr\"odinger equation included in the critical Fourier-Lebesgue space $\mathcal FL^\infty$ and in supercritical Sobolev spaces with respect to scaling. Last but not least we recall that the binormal flow is a classical model for the dynamics of a vortex filament in a 3D fluid or superfluid, and that vortex motions are a key element of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Orbital instability of periodic waves for generalized Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equations with a source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of generalized Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equations in one space dimension with a nonlinear source is considered. The purpose of this contribution is twofold. On one hand, the local well-posedness of the Cauchy problem on periodic Sobolev spaces and the regularity of the data-solution map are established. On the other hand, it is proved that periodic traveling waves which are spectrally unstable are also orbitally (nonlinearly) unstable under the flow of the evolution equation in periodic Sobolev spaces with same period as the fundamental period of the wave. This orbital instability criterion hinges on the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem, on the smoothness of the data-solution map, as well as on an abstract result which provides sufficient conditions for the instability of equilibria under iterations of a nonlinear map in Banach spaces. Applications of the former criterion include the orbital instability of a family of small-amplitude periodic waves with finite fundamental period for the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers-Fisher equation, which emerge from a local Hopf bifurcation around a critical value of the velocity.</description>

Abstract: We consider a system of interacting fermions on the three-dimensional torus in the mean-field scaling limit. Our objective is computing the occupation number of the Fourier modes in a trial state obtained through the random phase approximation for the ground state. Our result shows that -- in the trial state -- the momentum distribution has a jump discontinuity, i. e., the system has a well-defined Fermi surface. Moreover the Fermi momentum does not depend on the interaction potential (it is universal).</description>

Abstract: We define a quantum (noncommutative) analogue of locally trivial tangent bundle based on two main elements: the definition of local algebras through quotients of ideals of the global algebra as introduced in [21], and the triviality of the local tangent space as being the $\kappa$-Minkowski space inspired from [2]. This tangent bundle is explicitly constructed via local coordinate charts. Every local objects are exported to the global algebra through the notion of quantum (noncommutative) partition of unity introduced in this purpose. This partition is also used to export consistently an integral on $\kappa$-Minkowski to an integral on the global algebra.</description>

Abstract: We study strongly isochronous Hamiltonians that generate periodic time evolution with the same basic period for a dense set of initial values. We explain that all such Hamiltonians are maximally superintegrable, and show that if the system is subjected to Hamiltonian reduction based on a compact symmetry group and certain conditions are met, then the reduced Hamiltonian is strongly isochronous with the original basic period. We utilize these simple observations for demonstrating the maximal superintegrability of rational spin Calogero--Moser type models in confining harmonic potential.</description>

Abstract: We argued in [Proc. Sympos. Pure Math., Vol. 103, American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2021, 1-66, arXiv:1912.06504] that, when a certain sub-exponential growth property holds, the Donaldson-Thomas invariants of a 3-Calabi-Yau triangulated category should give rise to a geometric structure on its space of stability conditions called a Joyce structure. In this paper, we show how to use a Joyce structure to define a generating function which we call the $\tau$-function. When applied to the derived category of the resolved conifold, this reproduces the non-perturbative topological string partition function of [J. Differential Geom. 115 (2020), 395-435, arXiv:1703.02776]. In the case of the derived category of the Ginzburg algebra of the A$_2$ quiver, we obtain the Painlev\'e I $\tau$-function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it has become widely appreciated that defining (higher) gauge theories requires, in addition to ordinary phase space data, also "flux quantization" laws in generalized differential cohomology, there has been little discussion of the general rules, if any, for lifting Poisson-brackets of (flux-)observables and their quantization from traditional phase spaces to the resulting higher moduli stacks of flux-quantized gauge fields.
  In this short note, we present a systematic analysis of (i) the canonical quantization of flux observables in Yang-Mills theory and (ii) of valid flux quantization laws in abelian Yang-Mills, observing (iii) that the resulting topological quantum observables form the homology Pontrjagin algebra of the loop space of the moduli space of flux-quantized gauge fields.
  This is remarkable because the homology Ponrjagin algebra on loops of moduli makes immediate sense in broad generality for higher and non-abelian (non-linearly coupled) gauge fields, such as for the C-field in 11d supergravity, where it recovers the quantum effects previously discussed in the context of "Hypothesis H".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08665v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a C$^*$-algebra $A$ with an almost periodic time evolution $\sigma$, we define a new C$^*$-algebra $A_c$, which we call the crystal of $(A,\sigma)$, that represents the zero temperature limit of $(A, \sigma)$. We prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the ground states of $(A,\sigma)$ and the states on $A_c$, justifying the name. In order to investigate further the relation between low temperature equilibrium states on $A$ and traces on $A_c$, we define a Fock module $\mathcal F$ over the crystal and construct a vacuum representation of $A$ on $\mathcal F$. This allows us to show, under relatively mild assumptions, that for sufficiently large inverse temperatures $\beta$ the $\sigma$-KMS$_\beta$-states on $A$ are induced from traces on $A_c$ by means of the Fock module. In the second part, we compare the K-theoretic structures of $A$ and $A_c$. Previous work by various authors suggests that they have (rationally) isomorphic K-groups. We analyze this phenomenon in detail, confirming it under favorable conditions, but showing that, in general, there is apparently no easy way to relate these groups. As examples, we discuss in particular Exel's results on semi-saturated circle actions, and recent results of Miller on the K-theory of inverse semigroup C$^*$-algebras. In relation to the latter, we introduce the notion of a scale $N$ on an inverse semigroup $I$ and define a new inverse semigroup $I_c$, which we call the crystal of $(I,N)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that three different generalized similarities enclose all unitary and anti-unitary symmetries that induce exceptional points in lower-dimensional non-Hermitian systems. We prove that the generalized similarity conditions result in a larger class of systems than any class defined by a unitary or anti-unitary symmetry. Further we highlight that the similarities enforce spectral symmetry on the Hamiltonian resulting in a reduction of the codimension of exceptional points. As a consequence we show that the similarities drive the emergence of exceptional points in lower dimensions without the more restrictive need for a unitary and/or anti-unitary symmetry.</description>

      <title>Boundary-field formulation for transient electromagnetic scattering by dielectric scatterers and coated conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the transient scattered and transmitted fields generated when an incident electromagnetic wave impinges on a dielectric scatterer or a coated conductor embedded in an infinite space. By applying a boundary-field equation method, we reformulate the problem in the Laplace domain using the electric field equation inside the scatterer and a system of boundary integral equations for the scattered electric field in free space. To analyze this nonlocal boundary problem, we replace it by an equivalent boundary value problem. Existence, uniqueness and stability of the weak solution to the equivalent BVP are established in appropriate function spaces in terms of the Laplace transformed variable. The stability bounds are translated into time-domain estimates which determine the regularity of the solution in terms of the regularity of the problem data. These estimates can be easily converted into error estimates for a numerical discretization on the convolution quadrature for time evolution.</description>

      <title>Local Time Statistics and Permeable Barrier Crossing: from Poisson to Birth-Death Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Barrier crossing is a widespread phenomenon across natural and engineering systems. While an abundant cross-disciplinary literature on the topic has emerged over the years, the stochastic underpinnings of the process are yet to be linked quantitatively to easily measurable observables. We bridge this gap by developing a microscopic representation of Brownian motion in the presence of permeable barriers that allows to treat barriers with constant asymmetric permeabilities. Our approach relies upon reflected Brownian motion and on the crossing events being Poisson processes subordinated by the local time of the underlying motion at the barrier. Within this paradigm we derive the exact expression for the distribution of the number of crossings, and find an experimentally measurable statistical definition of permeability. We employ Feynman-Kac theory to derive and solve a set of governing birth-death diffusion equations and extend them to the case when barrier permeability is constant and asymmetric. As an application we study a system of infinite, identical and periodically placed asymmetric barriers for which we derive analytically effective transport parameters. This periodic arrangement induces an effective drift at long times whose magnitude depends on the difference in the permeability on either side of the barrier as well as on their absolute values. As the asymmetric permeabilities act akin to localised 'ratchet' potentials that break spatial symmetry and detailed balance, the proposed arrangement of asymmetric barriers provides an example of a noise-induced drift without the need to time-modulate any external force or create temporal correlations on the motion of a diffusing particle. By placing only one asymmetric barrier in a periodic domain we also show the emergence of a non-equilibrium steady state.</description>

      <title>New class of non-Einstein pp-wave solutions to quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a new family of exact vacuum solutions to quadratic gravity that describe pp-waves with two-dimensional wave surfaces that can have any prescribed constant curvature. When the wave surfaces are flat we recover the Peres waves obtained by Madsen, a subset of which forms precisely the vacuum pp-waves of general relativity. If, on the other hand, the wave surfaces have non-vanishing constant curvature then all our solutions are non-Einstein (i.e. they do not solve Einstein's equations in vacuum, with or without cosmological constant) and we find that the curvature is linearly related to the value of the cosmological constant. We show that the vacuum field equations reduce to a simple linear biharmonic equation on the curved wave surfaces, and as consequence, the general solution can be written down. We also provide some simple explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Theory of Complex Particle without Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex particle is a kind of bilocal particle having unexpected symmetry, which was proposed by the authour. In the present paper, we show that critical dimension of the complex particle in Minkowski spacetime is $D = 4$, while $D = 2, 4$ or $6$ are permitted in Euclid spacetime. The origin of the restriction to the dimension is the existence of tertiary constraint in the canonical theory, quantization of which leads to an eigenvalue equation having single-valued and bounded solutions only in particular dimension of spacetime. The derivation is based on a detailed analysis of Laplace-Beltrami operator on $S^{1,D-2}$ or $S^{D-1}$.</description>

      <title>The Existence and Distribution of Photon Spheres Near Spherically Symmetric Black Holes -- A Geometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14035v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photon sphere has attracted significant attention since the capture of black hole shadow images by Event Horizon Telescope. Recently, a number of studies have highlighted that the number of photon spheres and their distributions near black holes are strongly constrained by black hole properties. Specifically, for black holes with event horizons and proper asymptotic behaviors, the number of stable and unstable photon spheres satisfies the relation $n_{\text{stable}} - n_{\text{unstable}} = -1$. In this study, we provide a new proof on this relation using a geometric analysis, which is carried out using intrinsic curvatures in the optical geometry of black hole spacetimes. Firstly, we demonstrate the existence of photon spheres near black holes assuming most general asymptotic behaviors (asymptotically flat black holes, asymptotically de-Sitter and anti-de-Sitter black holes). Subsequently, we prove that the stable and unstable photon spheres near black holes must be one-to-one alternatively separated from each other, such that each unstable photon sphere is sandwiched between two stable photon spheres (and each stable photon sphere is sandwiched between two unstable photon spheres). Our analysis is applicable to any spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Bath Dynamical Decoupling with a Quantum Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bang-bang dynamical decoupling protects an open quantum system from decoherence due to its interaction with the surrounding bath/environment. In its standard form, this is achieved by strongly kicking the system with cycles of unitary operations, which average out the interaction Hamiltonian. In this paper, we generalize the notion of dynamical decoupling to repeated kicks with a quantum channel, which is applied to the bath. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the employed quantum channel and find that bath dynamical decoupling works if and only if the kick is ergodic. Furthermore, we study in which circumstances CPTP kicks on a mono-partite quantum system induce quantum Zeno dynamics with its Hamiltonian cancelled out. This does not require the ergodicity of the kicks, and the absence of decoherence-free subsystems is both necessary and sufficient. While the standard unitary dynamical decoupling is essentially the same as the quantum Zeno dynamics, our investigation implies that this is not true any more in the case of CPTP kicks. To derive our results, we prove some spectral properties of ergodic quantum channels, that might be of independent interest. Our approach establishes an enhanced and unified mathematical understanding of several recent experimental demonstrations and might form the basis of new dynamical decoupling schemes that harness environmental noise degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>The M-algebra completes the hierarchy of Super-Exceptional Tangent Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conjectured symmetries of M-theory famously involve (1.) brane-extended super-symmetry (the M-algebra) and (2.) exceptional duality-symmetry (the $\mathfrak{e}_{11}$-algebra); but little attention has been given to their inevitable combination.
  In this little note, we highlight (by combining results available in the literature) that the $local$ exceptional duality-symmetry (the hyperbolic involutory $\mathfrak{k}_{1,10} \subset \mathfrak{e}_{11}$) acts on the M-algebra, through the "brane-rotating symmetry" $\mathfrak{sl}_{32}$, in a way which extends the known hierarchy of finite-dimensional $n$-exceptional tangent spaces compatibly beyond the traditional bound of $n \leq 7$ all the way to $n = 11$.</description>

      <title>Affine relationships between steady currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbing transition rates in a steady nonequilibrium system, e.g. modelled by a Markov jump process, causes a change in the local currents. Their susceptibility is usually expressed via Green-Kubo relations or their nonequilibrium extensions. However, we may also wish to directly express the mutual relation between currents. Such a nonperturbative interrelation was discovered by P.E. Harunari et al. in [1] by applying algebraic graph theory showing the mutual linearity of currents over different edges in a graph. We give a novel and shorter derivation of that current relationship where we express the current-current susceptibility as a difference in mean first-passage times. It allows an extension to multiple currents, which remains affine but the relation is not additive.</description>
