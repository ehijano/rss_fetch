      <title>Predicting the hydrogen bond strength from water reorientation dynamics at short timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path-integral molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure-based energy decomposition analysis (EDA) are employed to connect hydrogen bond (H-bond) strength, its asymmetry, and the total delocalization energy at the water/air interface to experimentally measurable observables, such as the reorientation dynamics and the sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectrum. Using SFG spectra for distinct layers at the water/air interface, we validate the accuracy of our simulations and report a red-shift from the interface to bulk and a strongly bonded water peak at around 3250 cm$^{-1}$ in the layer closest to bulk. The reorientation dynamics of water molecules slow down from the interface to bulk, which correlates with the SFG results. From our EDA based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals, we observe a strong decline in total delocalization energy from bulk to the interface, as well as a decline in the strength of the strongest donor and acceptor interactions. The asymmetry between the two strongest interactions similarly rises towards the interface, while the importance of interactions from the outer solvation shells is greatly diminished and is lower than previously reported. Finally, we find that the strength of the strongest H-bond donor/acceptor is best correlated with the local minimum of the autocorrelation function resembling the L2 band librational motions. Following that, we propose a simple yet quantitative relationship between H-bond strength and the short-time reorientation dynamics at the water/air interface that could potentially be extended to predict H-bond strength in other hydrophobic systems from experimentally obtainable observables.</description>

      <title>The nuclear electric quadrupole moment of $^{87}$Sr from highly accurate molecular relativistic calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear electric quadrupole moment (NQM) of $^{87}$Sr has recently been revisited using high-precision relativistic atomic calculations [B. Lu et al., Phys. Rev. A 100, 012504 (2019)], indicating that the currently accepted value should be revised and that their result may serve as a new reference. In the present work, we determine the NQM of $^{87}$Sr from the molecular method, by combining the experimentally measured nuclear quadrupole coupling constants (NQCCs) of SrO and SrS with highly accurate relativistic calculations of the electric field gradient (EFG) at the Sr nucleus. Electronic correlation is treated at the CCSD(T), CCSD-T and CCSD$\tilde{\text{T}}$ levels. The iterative T contribution of the latter, composite scheme was obtained using a newly implemented parallel scheme where the distributed memory tensor library Cyclops Tensor Framework (CTF) was made available to the DIRAC code for relativistic molecular calculations through TAPP, the new community standard for tensor operations. All correlated calculations are performed using the exact two-component molecular mean-field Hamiltonian (X2C$\mathrm{mmf}$). The Gaunt two-electron interaction is incorporated, an even-tempered optimized quadruple-$\zeta$ quality basis set is employed, and vibrational corrections are accounted for. Our best result is $Q($$^{87}$Sr$) = 0.33666 \pm 0.00258$ b, which is about 10% larger than currently accepted standard value, while it is in excellent agreement with recent determinations [Y.-B. Tang, arXiv:2512.07603 [physics.atom-ph] (2025)].</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Relativistic Two-Component Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster for Open-Shell Systems: TD-EA/IP-EOMCC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined imaginary-time/real-time time-dependent (TD) approach for evaluating linear absorption spectra of open-shell systems at the electron attachment (EA) and ionization potential (IP) equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOMCC) levels of theory and within the exact two-component relativistic framework. The absorption lineshape is given by the Fourier transform of the electric dipole autocorrelation function, which is obtained from a real-time simulation. Approximations of the lowest-energy EA- and IP-EOMCC eigenstates, which are required as initial states for the real-time simulation, are generated by propagating a Koopman EA/IP state in imaginary time. TD-EA/IP-EOMCC linear absorption spectra of open-shell atomic systems (Na, K, Rb, F, Cl, and Br) closely reproduce those obtained from standard TD-EA/IP procedures carried out in the frequency domain. We find that the existence of low-lying states with non-negligible overlap with the Koopman determinant impacts the length of the imaginary-time propagation required to obtain an initial state that produces correct absolute energies and peak height intensities in spectra extracted from the subsequent real-time TD-EA/IP-EOMCC calculations.</description>

      <title>Correlation between 2D Square Ice and 3D Bulk Ice by Critical Crystallization Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional ice trapped in nanocapillaries is a fascinating phenomenon and is ubiquitous in our daily lives. As a decisive factor of the confinement effect, the size of nanocapillary significantly affects the critical crystallization pressure and crystalline structure, especially for multi-layered ices. By choosing square ice as a typical two-dimensional (2D) multi-layered ice pattern and using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we further unveil the variation mechanism of critical crystallization pressure with the nanocapillary size. The results show a strong dependence of the critical crystallization pressure on the size of the graphene sheet for monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer square ice. The quasi-macroscopic crystallization pressure, the actual pressure of water molecules, and the freezable region between them are all strongly dependent on the nanocapillary width. As the size of the capillary becomes larger in all three directions, the critical crystallization pressure converges to the true macroscopic crystallization pressure, which is very close to the value of the crystallization pressure for bulk ice. A direct correlation is established between 2D square ice and three-dimensional (3D) bulk ice by the critical crystallization pressure. There is an unfreezable threshold for crystallizing spontaneously in practice when the quasi-macroscopic crystallization pressure is equal to the actual pressure, which can explain the limit of nanocapillary width for multi-layered ice.</description>

      <title>The Entropic Barrier around the Conical Intersection Seam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conical intersections (CIs) are seen as the main mediators of nonadiabatic transitions; yet, mixed quantum-classical (MQC) simulations rarely, if ever, sample geometries with exactly degenerate electronic energies. Here we show that this behavior arises from a fundamental statistical-mechanical constraint. Using a linear vibronic coupling model, we derive the free energy along the adiabatic energy gap and demonstrate analytically that as the gap approaches zero, an infinite free-energy barrier arises around the CI seam. Molecular dynamics simulations of the methaniminium cation on the S$_1$ surface confirm this prediction: trajectories can approach regions with small adiabatic gaps, but never reach the CI seam, even if the CI corresponds to a region of lowest potential energy. These results clarify why MQC methods successfully capture nonadiabatic behavior without sampling exact degeneracies and agree with recent findings that classical trajectories can sense the presence of CIs without visiting them.</description>

      <title>FragmentFlow: Scalable Transition State Generation for Large Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition states (TSs) are central to understanding and quantitatively predicting chemical reactivity and reaction mechanisms. Although traditional TS generation methods are computationally expensive, recent generative modeling approaches have enabled chemically meaningful TS prediction for relatively small molecules. However, these methods fail to generalize to practically relevant reaction substrates because of distribution shifts induced by increasing molecular sizes. Furthermore, TS geometries for larger molecules are not available at scale, making it infeasible to train generative models from scratch on such molecules. To address these challenges, we introduce FragmentFlow: a divide-and-conquer approach that trains a generative model to predict TS geometries for the reactive core atoms, which define the reaction mechanism. The full TS structure is then reconstructed by re-attaching substituent fragments to the predicted core. By operating on reactive cores, whose size and composition remain relatively invariant across molecular contexts, FragmentFlow mitigates distribution shifts in generative modeling. Evaluated on a new curated dataset of reactions involving reactants with up to 33 heavy atoms, FragmentFlow correctly identifies 90% of TSs while requiring 30% fewer saddle-point optimization steps than classical initialization schemes. These results point toward scalable TS generation for high-throughput reactivity studies.</description>

      <title>Effects of PLGA coating on biological and mechanical behaviors of tissue engineering scaffolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaffolds have a key role in the clinical success of tissue engineering for the regeneration of damaged tissues. Their bio-performance is often described as the extent to which they can provide an extracellular matrix-like environment for cells embedded where their function and growth can effectively continue. For this purpose, tissue engineering scaffolds should exhibit biodegradability, biocompatibility, bioactivity, delivery, and mechanical performance. The use of polymer coatings, especially poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), on tissue engineering scaffolds has been found to be one of the most effective methods to improve the scaffold properties. This paper reviews the techniques used to coat tissue engineering scaffolds with PLGA and its effects on the mechanical characteristics, biodegradability, biocompatibility, Molecular delivery, and osteointegration of the scaffolds. It is concluded that apart from apatite-formation ability, all bio-functionalities can be tuned through PLGA coatings. This reflects the great potential of this modification approach to be used in tissue regeneration and therapeutic delivery applications.</description>

      <title>Defects, Corrugation and Temperature Govern Rarefied-Air Drag on Graphene Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In rarefied atmospheric environments, where continuum fluid dynamics breaks down, aerodynamic drag is governed by gas-surface momentum exchange, making surface structure and chemistry key design knobs. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that coating the $\alpha$-Al2O3(0001) surface with graphene markedly reduces the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient (TMAC) of N2, shifting scattering toward more specular reflection and thereby lowering drag; we further benchmark this response against graphite. The reduction strengthens up to 900 K. While structural defects can increase TMAC via defect-induced corrugation and local atomic and electronic rearrangements, graphene retains its performance at experimentally relevant defect densities.</description>

      <title>Unified origin of negative energetic elasticity in a lattice polymer chain: soft self-repulsion and bending stiffness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a single lattice polymer chain under a fixed end-to-end distance, incorporating both Domb--Joyce (DJ) soft-core self-repulsion between polymer segments and a local bending-energy cost. By decomposing the stiffness into energetic and entropic contributions, we survey the parameter space defined by the self-repulsion strength and bending-energy cost. We find that the energetic contribution to stiffness is negative across the entire explored range, whereas the entropic contribution remains positive. These results unify two previously independent mechanisms of negative energetic elasticity -- solvent-induced self-repulsion and bending stiffness -- and demonstrate that either mechanism alone, as well as their combination, produces the same sign. Beyond this sign-level unification, we analyze the internal-energy scaling and show that, in the absence of the bending-energy term, the DJ (self-repulsion) limit exhibits a robust $(n-r)^{7/4}/n$ scaling collapse. In contrast, the introduction of finite bending stiffness progressively disrupts this scaling, providing an internal-energy-based diagnostic to distinguish between contributions from self-repulsion and bending stiffness.</description>

      <title>Internal Trajectories and Observation Effects in Langevin Splitting Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Langevin integrators based on operator splitting are widely used in molecular dynamics. This work examines Langevin splitting schemes from the perspective of their internal trajectories and observation points, complementing existing generator-based analyses. By exploiting merging, splitting, and cyclic permutation of elementary update operators, formally distinct schemes can be grouped according to identical or closely related trajectories. Accuracy differences arising from momentum updates and observation points are quantified for configurational sampling, free-energy estimates, and transition rates. While modern Langevin integrators are remarkably stable under standard simulation conditions, subtle but systematic biases emerge at large friction coefficients and time steps. These results clarify when accuracy differences between splitting schemes matter in practice and provide an intuitive framework for understanding observation effects.</description>

      <title>Enabling AI Deep Potentials for Ab Initio-quality Molecular Dynamics Simulations in GROMACS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art AI deep potentials provide ab initio-quality results, but at a fraction of the computational cost of first-principles quantum mechanical calculations, such as density functional theory. In this work, we bring AI deep potentials into GROMACS, a production-level Molecular Dynamics (MD) code, by integrating with DeePMD-kit that provides domain-specific deep learning (DL) models of interatomic potential energy and force fields. In particular, we enable AI deep potentials inference across multiple DP model families and DL backends by coupling GROMACS Neural Network Potentials with the C++/CUDA backend in DeePMD-kit. We evaluate two recent large-atom-model architectures, DPA2 that is based on the attention mechanism and DPA3 that is based on GNN, in GROMACS using four ab initio-quality protein-in-water benchmarks (1YRF, 1UBQ, 3LZM, 2PTC) on NVIDIA A100 and GH200 GPUs. Our results show that DPA2 delivers up to 4.23x and 3.18x higher throughput than DPA3 on A100 and GH200 GPUs, respectively. We also provide a characterization study to further contrast DPA2 and DPA3 in throughput, memory usage, and kernel-level execution on GPUs. Our findings identify kernel-launch overhead and domain-decomposed inference as the main optimization priorities for AI deep potentials in production MD simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01282v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This computational study introduces a theoretical framework for practical, electrochemical fuel generation displaying exponential product yields as functions of time. Exponential reaction scaling is simulated through an autocatalytic cycle that emulates the process of DNA replication facilitated by the well-known polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Here, an initial buildup of formate into a two-carbon chain through CO2 carboxylation forms oxalate. A subsequent, two-electron reduction yields glyoxylate, with base-mediated hydrolysis driving C-C bond fission of glyoxylate into two molecules of formate. These products are then recycled to serve as reactants. This recursive process chemistry drives formate evolution that scales as 2^n, where n is the cycle number. Each step of the proposed fuel cycle is analogized to the steps of DNA annealing, nucleotide polymerization and hybridized strand fission that are responsible for the exponential product yields observed in PCR-mediated DNA synthesis. As a consequence of this replication behavior, rapid rates of fuel production become accessible, even when the individual rate constants for the cycle's constituent processes are slow. Practical barriers to realizing this system are discussed, particularly the difficulty of formate carboxylation and the energy demands of chemical amplification.</description>

      <title>How individual vs shared coordination governs the degree of correlation in rotational vs residence times in a high-viscosity lithium electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02457v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex increases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a nonparametric Bayesian framework to infer radial distribution functions from experimental scattering measurements with uncertainty quantification using non-stationary Gaussian processes. The Gaussian process prior mean and kernel functions are designed to mitigate well-known numerical challenges with the Fourier transform, including discrete measurement binning and detector windowing, while encoding fundamental yet minimal physical knowledge of liquid structure. We demonstrate uncertainty propagation of the Gaussian process posterior to unmeasured quantities of interest. Experimental radial distribution functions of liquid argon and water with uncertainty quantification are provided as both a proof of principle for the method and a benchmark for molecular models. The full implementation is available on GitHub at: https://github.com/hoepfnergroup/LiquidStructureGP-Sullivan.</description>

      <title>Deriving effective electrode-ion interactions from free-energy profiles at electrochemical interfaces</title>

Abstract: Understanding ion adsorption at electrified metal-electrolyte interfaces is essential for accurate modeling of electrochemical systems. Here, we systematically investigate the free energy profiles of Na$^+$, Cl$^-$, and F$^-$ ions at the Au(111)-water interface using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics with both classical force fields and machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Our classical metadynamics results reveal a strong dependence of predicted ion adsorption on the Lennard-Jones parameters, highlighting that -- without due care -- standard mixing rules can lead to qualitatively incorrect descriptions of ion-metal interactions. We present a systematic methodology for tuning the cross-term LJ parameters to control adsorption energetics in agreement with more accurate models. As a surrogate for an ab initio model, we employed the recently released Universal Models for Atoms (UMA) MLIP, which validates classical trends and displays strong specific adsorption for chloride, weak adsorption for fluoride, and no specific adsorption for sodium, in agreement with experimental and theoretical expectations. By integrating molecular-level adsorption free energies into continuum models of the electric double layer, we show that specific ion adsorption substantially alters the interfacial ion population, the potential of zero charge, and the differential capacitance of the system. Our results underscore the critical importance of force field parameterization and advanced interatomic potentials for the predictive modeling of ion-specific effects at electrified interfaces and provide a robust framework for bridging molecular simulations and continuum electrochemical models.</description>

      <title>Toward an affordable density-based measure for the quality of a coupled cluster calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two new diagnostics for the degree to which static correlation impacts the quality of a coupled cluster calculation. The first is the change in the Matito static correlation diagnostic $\overline{I_{ND}}$ between CCSD and CCSD(T), $\Delta I_{ND}[\textrm{(T)}]=\overline{I_{ND}}[\textrm{CCSD(T)}]-\overline{I_{ND}}[\textrm{CCSD}]$. The second is the ratio of the same and of the corresponding change in the total correlation diagnostic $\overline{I_{T}}=\overline{I_{ND}}+\overline{I_{D}}$, i.e., $r_I[(T)]=\Delta I_{ND}[\textrm{(T)}]/\Delta I_{T}[\textrm{(T)}]$. The first diagnostic can be extended to higher-order improvements in the wave function, e.g., $\Delta I_{ND}[\textrm{(Q)}]=\overline{I_{ND}}[\textrm{CCSDT(Q)}]-\overline{I_{ND}}[\textrm{CCSDT}]$. In general, a small $\Delta I_{ND}$[\textrm{level$_1$}] value indicates that at this level$_1$ of theory, the density is converged and any further changes to the energy come from dynamical correlation, while larger $\Delta I_{ND}$[\textrm{level$_2$}] indicates that the density is still not converged at level$_2$ and some static correlation remains. $r_I[(T)]$ is found to be a moderately good predictor for the importance of post-CCSD(T) correlation effects.</description>

      <title>QCell: Comprehensive Quantum-Mechanical Dataset Spanning Diverse Biomolecular Fragments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are revolutionizing molecular simulations by bridging the gap between quantum-mechanical (QM) accuracy and the computational efficiency of mechanistic potentials. However, the development of reliable MLFFs for biomolecular systems remains constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, chemically diverse QM datasets that span all of the major classes of biomolecules expressed in living cells. Crucially, such a comprehensive dataset must be computed using non-empirical or minimally empirical approximations to solving the Schr\"odinger equation. To address these limitations, we introduce the QCell dataset -- a curated collection of 525k new QM calculations for biomolecular fragments encompassing carbohydrates, nucleic acids, lipids, dimers, and ion clusters. QCell complements existing datasets, bringing the total number of available data points to 41 million molecular systems, all calculated using hybrid density functional theory with nonlocal many-body dispersion interactions, as captured by the PBE0+MBD(-NL) level of quantum mechanics. The QCell dataset therefore provides a valuable resource for training next-generation MLFFs capable of modeling the intricate interactions that govern biomolecular dynamics beyond small molecules and proteins.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Monte Carlo Method for Polariton Chemistry via Mixed Block Sparsity and Tensor Hypercontraction Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a reduced-scaling auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) framework designed for large molecular systems and ensembles, with or without coupling to optical cavities. Our approach leverages the natural block sparsity of Cholesky decomposition (CD) of electron repulsion integrals in molecular ensembles and employs tensor hypercontraction (THC) to efficiently compress low-rank Cholesky blocks. By representing the Cholesky vectors in a mixed format, keeping high-rank blocks in block-sparse form and compressing low-rank blocks with THC, we reduce the scaling of exchange-energy evaluation from quartic to robust cubic in the number of molecular orbitals, while lowering memory from cubic toward quadratic. Benchmark analyses on one-, two-, and three-dimensional molecular ensembles (up to ~1,200 orbitals) show that: a) the number of nonzeros in Cholesky tensors grows linearly with system size across dimensions; b) the average numerical rank increases sublinearly and does not saturate at these sizes; and (c) rank heterogeneity-some blocks nearly full rank and many low rank, naturally motivating the proposed mixed block sparsity and THC scheme for efficient calculation of exchange energy. We demonstrate that the mixed scheme yields cubic CPU-time scaling with favorable prefactors and preserves AFQMC accuracy.</description>

      <title>Relativistic unitary coupled cluster method for ground-state molecular properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a relativistic unitary coupled cluster (UCC) expectation value approach for computing first-order properties of heavy-element systems. Both perturbative (UCC3) and non-perturbative (qUCC) commutator-based formulations are applied to evaluate ground-state properties, including the permanent dipole moment (PDM), magnetic hyperfine structure (HFS) constant, and electric field gradient (EFG). The results are compared with available experimental data and those from conventional coupled cluster (CC) calculations. The non-perturbative commutator-based approach truncated at the singles and doubles level (qUCCSD) exhibits markedly better agreement with both CCSD and experiment than the perturbative UCC3 method, likely due to its improved treatment of relaxation effects.</description>

      <title>Fast Evaluation of Unbiased Atomic Forces in ab initio Variational Monte Carlo via the Lagrangian Technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations based on highly parallelizable stochastic frameworks for accurate solutions of the many-body Schr{\"o}dinger equation, suitable for modern many-core supercomputer architectures. Despite its potential, one of the major drawbacks that still hinders QMC applications, especially when targeting dynamical properties of large systems or extensive datasets, is the lack of an affordable method to compute atomic forces that are consistent with the corresponding potential energy surfaces (PESs), also known as unbiased atomic forces. Recently, one of the authors in the present paper proposed a way to obtain unbiased forces with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, where the determinant part is frozen to the values obtained by a mean-field method, such as Density Functional Theory. However, the proposed method has a significant drawback for its applications: for a system with $N$ nuclei, one requires 6$N$ additional DFT calculations to get unbiased forces. This paper presents a way to replace the 6$N$ DFT calculations with a single coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham calculation, following the so-called Lagrangian technique established in quantum chemistry. We also demonstrate that the developed unbiased VMC force calculation improves not only the consistency with PESs, but also its accuracy, by investigating three molecules from the rMD17 benchmark set, and comparing the unbiased VMC forces with those obtained by CCSD(T) calculations. We found that the bare VMC forces are biased from the CCSD(T) ones, while the unbiased ones give values closer to those of the CCSD(T) ones. Our benchmark test also reveals that the unbiased VMC forces yield very consistent values with hybrid and meta GGAs, but do not necessarily yield values that are very close to those of CCSD(T).</description>

      <title>Coupling between thermochemical contributions of subvalence correlation and of higher-order post-CCSD(T) correlation effects -- a step toward `W5 theory'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the thermochemical impact of post-CCSD(T) contributions to the total atomization energy (TAE, the sum of all bond energies) of first- and second-row molecules, and specifically their coupling with the subvalence correlation contribution. In particular, we find large contributions from (Q) when there are several neighboring second-row atoms. Otherwise, both higher-order triples $T_3$--(T) and connected quadruples (Q) are important in systems with strong static correlation. Reoptimization of the reference geometry for core-valence correlation increases the calculated TAE across the board, most pronouncedly so for second-row compounds with neighboring second-row atoms. %just slightly increases the calculated TAE for all species, but more pronouncedly so if strong static correlation is present, as well as for second-row compounds, again especially with neighboring second-row atoms. We present a first proposal for a `W5 theory' protocol and compare computed TAEs for the W4-08 benchmark with prior reference values. For some key second-row species, the new values represent nontrivial revisions. Our predicted TAE$_0$ values (TAE at 0 K) agree well with the ATcT (active thermochemical tables) values, including for the very recent expansion of the ATcT network to boron, silicon, and sulfur compounds.</description>

      <title>DDCCNet: Physics-enhanced Multitask Neural Networks for Data-driven Coupled-cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the data-driven coupled-cluster deep network (DDCCNet), a family of multitask, physics-enhanced deep learning architectures designed to predict coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) amplitudes and correlation energies from lower-level electronic structure methods. The three DDCCNet variants (termed as v1, v2, and v3) progressively incorporate architectural refinements ranging from parallel subnetworks for t_1 and t_2 amplitudes to feature-partitioned blocks and physics-enhanced intermediate prediction layers that are structured in accordance with coupled-cluster equations to enhance physical consistency and multitask learning efficiency. These models jointly learn correlated amplitude patterns while embedding symmetry and orbital-level interactions directly into the network structure. Applied to methanol conformers, CO2 clusters, and small organic molecules, DDCCNet_v2 delivered the most accurate and transferable performance, achieving chemically precise correlation energies across diverse molecular systems. Collectively, DDCCNet establishes a scalable, physically grounded framework that unifies machine learning and ab initio theory for efficient, data-driven electronic structure prediction.</description>

      <title>Electron Transfer, Diabatic Couplings and Vibronic Energy Gaps in a Phase Space Electronic Structure Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the well-known Shin-Metiu model for an electronic crossing, using both a standard Born-Huang (BH) framework and a novel phase space (PS) electronic Hamiltonian framework. We show that as long as we are not in the strongly nonadiabatic region, a phase space framework can obtain a relative error in vibrational energy gap which is consistently one order of magnitude smaller than what is found within a BH framework. In line with recent results showing that dynamics on one phase space surface can outperform dynamics on one Born-Oppenheimer surface, our results indicate that the same advantages should largely hold for curve crossings and dynamics on two or a handful of electronic surfaces, from which several implications can be surmised as far as the possibility of spin-dependent electron transfer dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nucleophilic substitution at silicon under vibrational strong coupling: Refined insights from a high-level ab initio perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S$_\mathrm{N}$2) reaction of 1-phenyl-2-trimethylsilylacetylene (PTA) under vibrational strong coupling (VSC) from the perspective of high-level ab initio quantum and polaritonic chemistry. Specifically, we address conflicting mechanistic proposals, cavity-induced electronic corrections under VSC and the relevance of a previously debated Si-C-stretching motion of PTA for vibrational polariton formation. We first provide computational evidence for a two-step mechanism based on density functional theory and high-level coupled cluster results, identify new encounter and products complexes and illustrate the relevance of diffuse basis functions for a qualitatively correct description of anionic reactive systems. We subsequently show that cavity-induced dipole fluctuation corrections of electronic energies can be significant on the level of cavity Born-Oppenheimer coupled cluster theory and discuss their qualitative impact on the proposed two-step mechanism taking into account cavity-induced molecular reorientation. We finally show that the Si-C-stretching contribution to the experimentally relevant double-peak feature of PTA exhibits a dominant dipole character, which renders it central for linear IR response and vibrational polariton formation despite the presence of CH$_3$-rocking contributions. The dipole character along the cleaving Si-C-bond is eventually shown to rationalize Rabi splittings throughout the proposed two-step mechanism. Our work refines the microscopic perspective on the S$_\mathrm{N}$2 reaction of PTA under VSC and highlights recent developments in ab initio polaritonic chemistry for the VSC regime.</description>

      <title>A simple fourth order propagator based on the Magnus expansion in the Liouville space: Application to a $\Lambda$-system and assessment of the rotating wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03576v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple 4th order propagator [Ture and Jang, {\it J. Phys. Chem. A.} {\bf 128}, 2871 (2024)] based on the Magnus expansion (ME) is extended to the Liouville space for both closed-system and Lindbladian open-system quantum dynamics. For both dynamics, commutator free versions of 4th order propagators are provided as well. These propagators are then applied to the dynamics of a driven $\Lambda$-system, where Lindblad terms represent the effect of a photonic bath. For both dynamics, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) for the matter-radiation interaction is assessed. We confirmed reasonable performance of RWA for weak and resonant fields. However, small errors appear for moderate fields and substantial errors can be found for strong fields where coherent population trapping can still be expected. We also found that the presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics consistently reduces the errors of the RWA. These results provide a quantitative information on how the RWA breaks down beyond weak field or for non-resonant cases. Major results are benchmarked against results of our 6th order ME-based propagator. We also provide numerical comparison of our algorithms with other 4th order algorithms for the $\Lambda$-system. These confirm reasonable performance of our simple propagators and the improvement gained through commutator-free expressions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological matter offers opportunities for control of charge and energy flow with implications for chemistry still incompletely understood. In this work, we study an ensemble of adsorbates with an empty frontier level (LUMO) coupled to the edges, domain walls (solitons), and bulk of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger polyacetylene chain across its trivial insulator, metallic, and topological insulator phases. We find that two experimentally relevant observables, charge donation into the LUMO and the magnitude of adsorbate electronic friction, are significantly impacted by the electronic phase of the SSH chain and show clear signatures of the topological phase transition. Localized, symmetry-protected midgap states at edges and solitons strongly enhance electron donation relative to both the metallic and trivial phases, whereas by contrast, the metal's extended states, despite larger total DOS near the Fermi energy, hybridize more weakly with a molecular adsorbate near a particular site. Electronic friction is largest in the metal, strongly suppressed in gapped regions, and intermediate at topological edges where hybridization splits the midgap resonance. These trends persist with disorder highlighting their robustness and suggest engineering domain walls and topological boundaries as pathways for employing topological matter in molecular catalysis and sensing.</description>

      <title>Advancing Universal Deep Learning for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction of Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</description>
