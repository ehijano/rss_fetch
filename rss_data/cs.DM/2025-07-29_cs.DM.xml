      <title>Product-Congruence Games: A Unified Impartial-Game Framework for RSA ($\phi$-MuM) and AES (poly-MuM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RSA exponent reduction and AES S-box inversion share a hidden commonality: both are governed by the same impartial combinatorial principle, which we call a Product-Congruence Game (PCG). A Product-Congruence Game tracks play via the modular or finite-field product of heap values, providing a single invariant that unifies the algebraic cores of these two ubiquitous symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems. We instantiate this framework with two companion games. First, $\phi$-MuM, in which a left-associated "multi-secret" RSA exponent chain compresses into the game of Multiplicative Modular Nim, PCG($k,\{1\}$), where $k = ord_N(g)$. The losing predicate then factorizes via the Chinese remainder theorem, mirroring RSA's structure. Second, poly-MuM, our model for finite-field inversion such as the AES S-box. For poly-MuM we prove the single-hole property inside its threshold region, implying that the Sprague-Grundy values are multiplicative under disjunctive sums in that region. Beyond these instances, we establish four structural theorems for a general Product-Congruence Game PCG($m,R$): (i) single-heap repair above the modulus, (ii) ultimate period $m$ per coordinate, (iii) exact and asymptotic losing densities, and (iv) confinement of optimal play to a finite indeterminacy region. An operation-alignment collapse principle explains why some variants degenerate to a single aggregate while MuM, $\phi$-MuM and poly-MuM retain rich local structure. All ingredients (multiplicative orders, the Chinese remainder theorem, finite fields) are classical; the contribution is the unified aggregation-compression viewpoint that embeds both RSA and AES inside one impartial-game framework, together with the structural and collapse theorems.</description>

      <title>Ternary Binomial and Trinomial Bent Functions in the Completed Maiorana-McFarland Class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two classes of ternary bent functions of degree four with two and three terms in the univariate representation that belong to the completed Maiorana-McFarland class are found. Binomials are mappings $\F_{3^{4k}}\mapsto\fthree$ given by $f(x)=\Tr_{4k}\big(a_1 x^{2(3^k+1)}+a_2 x^{(3^k+1)^2}\big)$, where $a_1$ is a nonsquare in $\F_{3^{4k}}$ and $a_2$ is defined explicitly by $a_1$. Particular subclasses of the binomial bent functions we found can be represented by exceptional polynomials over $\fthreek$. Bent trinomials are mappings $\F_{3^{2k}}\mapsto\fthree$ given by $f(x)=\Tr_n\big(a_1 x^{2\cdot3^k+4} + a_2 x^{3^k+5} + a_3 x^2\big)$ with coefficients explicitly defined by the parity of $k$. The proof is based on a new criterion that allows checking bentness by analyzing first- and second-order derivatives of $f$ in the direction of a chosen $n/2$-dimensional subspace.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a technique, based on Angluin's algorithm, for automatically generating finite automata for various kinds of useful first-order logic formulas in B\"uchi arithmetic. Construction in this way can be faster and use much less space than more direct methods. We discuss the theory and we present some empirical data for the free software Walnut.</description>

      <title>General Strong Bound on the Uncrossed Number which is Tight for the Edge Crossing Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a very recent concept for visualizing various aspects of a graph in the plane using a collection of drawings introduced by Hlin\v{e}n\'y and Masa\v{r}\'ik [GD 2023]. Formally, given a graph $G$, we aim to find an uncrossed collection containing drawings of $G$ in the plane such that each edge of $G$ is not crossed in at least one drawing in the collection. The uncrossed number of $G$ ($unc(G)$) is the smallest integer $k$ such that an uncrossed collection for $G$ of size $k$ exists. The uncrossed number is lower-bounded by the well-known thickness, which is an edge-decomposition of $G$ into planar graphs. This connection gives a trivial lower-bound $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{3|V(G)|-6}\rceil \le unc(G)$. In a recent paper, Balko, Hlin\v{e}n\'y, Masa\v{r}\'ik, Orthaber, Vogtenhuber, and Wagner [GD 2024] presented the first non-trivial and general lower-bound on the uncrossed number. We summarize it in terms of dense graphs (where $|E(G)|=\epsilon(|V(G)|)^2$ for some $\epsilon&gt;0$): $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{c_\epsilon|V(G)|}\rceil \le unc(G)$, where $c_\epsilon\ge 2.82$ is a constant depending on $\epsilon$.
  We improve the lower-bound to state that $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{3|V(G)|-6-\sqrt{2|E(G)|}+\sqrt{6(|V(G)|-2)}}\rceil \le unc(G)$. Translated to dense graphs regime, the bound yields a multiplicative constant $c'_\epsilon=3-\sqrt{(2-\epsilon)}$ in the expression $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{c'_\epsilon|V(G)|+o(|V(G)|)}\rceil \le unc(G)$. Hence, it is tight (up to low-order terms) for $\epsilon \approx \frac{1}{2}$ as warranted by complete graphs.
  In fact, we formulate our result in the language of the maximum uncrossed subgraph number, that is, the maximum number of edges of $G$ that are not crossed in a drawing of $G$ in the plane. In that case, we also provide a construction certifying that our bound is asymptotically tight (up to low-order terms) on dense graphs for all $\epsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Santa Claus, Hypergraphs and Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.07189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A well-known problem in scheduling and approximation algorithms is the Santa Claus problem. Suppose that Santa Claus has a set of gifts, and he wants to distribute them among a set of children so that the least happy child is made as happy as possible. Here, the value that a child $i$ has for a present $j$ is of the form $p_{ij} \in \{ 0,p_j\}$. A polynomial time algorithm by Annamalai et al. gives a $12.33$-approximation and is based on a modification of Haxell's hypergraph matching argument.
  In this paper, we introduce a matroid version of the Santa Claus problem. Our algorithm is also based on Haxell's augmenting tree, but with the introduction of the matroid structure we solve a more general problem with cleaner methods. Our result can then be used as a blackbox to obtain a $(6+\varepsilon)$-approximation for Santa Claus. This factor also compares against a natural, compact LP for Santa Claus.</description>

      <title>Improved Distributed Algorithms for Random Colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study distributed versions of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for generating random $k$-colorings of an input graph with maximum degree $\Delta$. In the sequential setting, the Glauber dynamics is the simple MCMC algorithm which updates the color at a randomly chosen vertex in each step. Fischer and Ghaffari (2018), and independently Feng, Hayes, and Yin (2018), presented a parallel and distributed version of the Glauber dynamics which converges in $O(\log{n})$ rounds for $k&gt;(2+\varepsilon)\Delta$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$. We present the distributed flip dynamics and prove $O(n\log{n})$ mixing for $k&gt;(11/6-\delta)\Delta$ for a fixed $\delta&gt;0$. Our new Markov chain is a generalization of the distributed Glauber dynamics previously analyzed, and is a parallel and distributed version of the more general flip dynamics considered in the sequential setting which recolors local maximal two-colored components in each step. While the distributed Glauber dynamics and the sequential flip dynamics are symmetric Markov chains, and hence their stationary distribution is uniformly distributed over colorings, our distributed flip dynamics is not symmetric and hence the stationary distribution is unclear.</description>

      <title>Quasilinearization with regularizing tensor paraproducts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an extension of the Bony quasilinearization formula as a tensor paraproduct decomposition to obtain an approximation, $\tilde{A}(f)$, to $A(f)$ where $f \in \text{tensor-} \Lambda^{\alpha}([0,1]^2)$ and $A \in C^2$. The rough content of $A(f)$ is encoded in the approximation of $\tilde{A}(f)$ while the residual, $\Delta(A,f) = A(f) - \tilde{A}(f)$, which is of regularity $\text{tensor-} \Lambda^{2 \alpha}([0,1]^2)$, contains the smooth content of $A(f)$.</description>

      <title>Preparing graph states forbidding a vertex-minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement based quantum computing is preformed by adding non-Clifford measurements to a prepared stabilizer states. Entangling gates like CZ are likely to have lower fidelities due to the nature of interacting qubits, so when preparing a stabilizer state, we wish to minimize the number of required entangling states. This naturally introduces the notion of CZ-distance.
  Every stabilizer state is local-Clifford equivalent to a graph state, so we may focus on graph states $\left\vert G \right\rangle$. As a lower bound for general graphs, there exist $n$-vertex graphs $G$ such that the CZ-distance of $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ is $\Omega(n^2 / \log n)$. We obtain significantly improved bounds when $G$ is contained within certain proper classes of graphs. For instance, we prove that if $G$ is a $n$-vertex circle graph with clique number $\omega$, then $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ has CZ-distance at most $4n \log \omega + 7n$. We prove that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph of rank-width at most $k$, then $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ has CZ-distance at most $(2^{2^{k+1}} + 1) n$. More generally, this is obtained via a bound of $(k+2)n$ that we prove for graphs of twin-width at most $k$.
  We also study how bounded-rank perturbations and low-rank cuts affect the CZ-distance. As a consequence, we prove that Geelen's Weak Structural Conjecture for vertex-minors implies that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph contained in some fixed proper vertex-minor-closed class of graphs, then $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ has CZ-distance at most $O(n\log n)$. Since graph states of locally equivalent graphs are local Clifford equivalent, proper vertex-minor-closed classes of graphs are natural and very general in this setting.</description>

      <title>Searching in trees with k-up-modular weight functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the following generalization of the binary search problem: A searcher is required to find a hidden element $x$ in a tree $T$. To do so, they iteratively perform queries to an oracle about a chosen vertex $v$. After each such call, the oracle responds whether the target was found and if not, the searcher receives as a reply the neighbor of $v$ that lays on the shortest path towards $x$. Additionally, each vertex $v$ may have a different query cost $w(v)$. The goal is to find the optimal querying strategy for the searcher which minimizes the worst case query cost required to find $x$. The problem is known to be NP-hard even in restricted classes of trees such as bounded diameter spiders [Cicalese et al. 2016] and no constant factor approximation algorithm is known for the general case. Inspired by recent studies [Dereniowski et al. 2022, Dereniowski et al. 2024], instead of restricted classes of trees, we explore restrictions on the weight function. We introduce the concept of a heavy group set of a vertex $HG(v,w)$. We show that if for every $v\in T$: $|HG\br{v,w}|\leq k$ an $O(\log\log n)$-approximation can be found within $2^{O(\log^2k)}\cdot\text{poly}(n)$ time.</description>

      <title>On multiplicities of interpoint distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a set $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points and a distance $d&gt;0$, the multiplicity of $d$ is the number of times the distance $d$ appears between points in $X$. Let $a_1(X) \geq a_2(X) \geq \cdots \geq a_m(X)$ denote the multiplicities of the $m$ distances determined by $X$ and let $a(X)=\left(a_1(X),\dots,a_m(X)\right)$. In this paper, we study several questions from Erd\H{o}s's time regarding distance multiplicities. Among other results, we show that:
  (1) If $X$ is convex or ``not too convex'', then there exists a distance other than the diameter that has multiplicity at most $n$.
  (2) There exists a set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that many distances occur with high multiplicity. In particular, at least $n^{\Omega(1/\log\log{n})}$ distances have superlinear multiplicity in $n$.
  (3) For any (not necessarily fixed) integer $1\leq k\leq\log{n}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that the difference between the $k^{\text{th}}$ and $(k+1)^{\text{th}}$ largest multiplicities is at least $\Omega(\frac{n\log{n}}{k})$. Moreover, the distances in $X$ with the largest $k$ multiplicities can be prescribed.
  (4) For every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, not all collinear or cocircular, such that $a(X)= (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$. There also exists $Y\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points with pairwise distinct distance multiplicities and $a(Y) \neq (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$.</description>
