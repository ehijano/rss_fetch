      <title>Interpretable Multimodal Learning for Tumor Protein-Metal Binding: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cancer therapeutics, protein-metal binding mechanisms critically govern drug pharmacokinetics and targeting efficacy, thereby fundamentally shaping the rational design of anticancer metallodrugs. While conventional laboratory methods used to study such mechanisms are often costly, low throughput, and limited in capturing dynamic biological processes, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative. Despite increasing efforts to develop protein-metal binding datasets and ML algorithms, the application of ML in tumor protein-metal binding remains limited. Key challenges include a shortage of high-quality, tumor-specific datasets, insufficient consideration of multiple data modalities, and the complexity of interpreting results due to the ''black box'' nature of complex ML models. This paper summarizes recent progress and ongoing challenges in using ML to predict tumor protein-metal binding, focusing on data, modeling, and interpretability. We present multimodal protein-metal binding datasets and outline strategies for acquiring, curating, and preprocessing them for training ML models. Moreover, we explore the complementary value provided by different data modalities and examine methods for their integration. We also review approaches for improving model interpretability to support more trustworthy decisions in cancer research. Finally, we offer our perspective on research opportunities and propose strategies to address the scarcity of tumor protein data and the limited number of predictive models for tumor protein-metal binding. We also highlight two promising directions for effective metal-based drug design: integrating protein-protein interaction data to provide structural insights into metal-binding events and predicting structural changes in tumor proteins after metal binding.</description>

      <title>OLAF: An Open Life Science Analysis Framework for Conversational Bioinformatics Powered by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OLAF (Open Life Science Analysis Framework) is an open-source platform that enables researchers to perform bioinformatics analyses using natural language. By combining large language models (LLMs) with a modular agent-pipe-router architecture, OLAF generates and executes bioinformatics code on real scientific data, including formats like .h5ad. The system includes an Angular front end and a Python/Firebase backend, allowing users to run analyses such as single-cell RNA-seq workflows, gene annotation, and data visualization through a simple web interface. Unlike general-purpose AI tools, OLAF integrates code execution, data handling, and scientific libraries in a reproducible, user-friendly environment. It is designed to lower the barrier to computational biology for non-programmers and support transparent, AI-powered life science research.</description>

      <title>Discriminating BCC Subtypes Using Entropy and Mutual Information from Dermoscopic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To analyze the frequency and co-occurrence of dermoscopic patterns in BCC lesions and their relationship with histopathologic subtypes, using statistical analysis and Information Theory tools such as entropy, conditional entropy, mutual information, and Hamming weight.
  Methods: A total of 223 dermoscopic images (256x256 pixels) of histologically confirmed BCC lesions from Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena (Seville, Spain) were analyzed. Each image was multilabel-annotated for the presence of nine dermoscopic patterns and categorized into one of four BCC subtypes: superficial, nodular, infiltrative, or micronodular. Statistical and information-theoretic methods were applied, including co-occurrence matrices, Bayesian conditional probabilities, and entropy-based metrics. Mutual information quantified the predictive value of individual and paired patterns, and decision trees were built based on diagnostic informativeness.
  Results: Nodular BCC was highly associated with most dermoscopic patterns, particularly arborizing telangiectasia and blue-gray ovoid nests. Superficial BCC showed stronger associations with maple leaf-like structures and shiny white-red areas. Some patterns, like spoke-wheel areas and white streaks, showed low discriminative power. Mutual information and conditional probabilities identified meaningful pattern-pair dependencies for each subtype. Decision trees revealed that subsets of patterns could enhance subtype classification by accumulating diagnostic information.
  Conclusions: Information Theory enables a quantitative understanding of dermoscopic patterns and their relationship with BCC subtypes. This framework highlights key diagnostic features, aids in differentiating complex cases, and supports the development of automated, pattern-based diagnostic tools. Further research with larger, more balanced datasets is encouraged.</description>

      <title>Reinforcing Clinical Decision Support through Multi-Agent Systems and Ethical AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the age of data-driven medicine, it is paramount to include explainable and ethically managed artificial intelligence in explaining clinical decision support systems to achieve trustworthy and effective patient care. The focus of this paper is on a new architecture of a multi-agent system for clinical decision support that uses modular agents to analyze laboratory results, vital signs, and the clinical context and then integrates these results to drive predictions and validate outcomes. We describe our implementation with the eICU database to run lab-analysis-specific agents, vitals-only interpreters, and contextual reasoners and then run the prediction module and a validation agent. Everything is a transparent implementation of business logic, influenced by the principles of ethical AI governance such as Autonomy, Fairness, and Accountability. It provides visible results that this agent-based framework not only improves on interpretability and accuracy but also on reinforcing trust in AI-assisted decisions in an intensive care setting.</description>

      <title>Predicting Soil Macronutrient Levels: A Machine Learning Approach Models Trained on pH, Conductivity, and Average Power of Acid-Base Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soil macronutrients, particularly potassium ions (K$^+$), are indispensable for plant health, underpinning various physiological and biological processes, and facilitating the management of both biotic and abiotic stresses. Deficient macronutrient content results in stunted growth, delayed maturation, and increased vulnerability to environmental stressors, thereby accentuating the imperative for precise soil nutrient monitoring. Traditional techniques such as chemical assays, atomic absorption spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, and electrochemical methods, albeit advanced, are prohibitively expensive and time-intensive, thus unsuitable for real-time macronutrient assessment. In this study, we propose an innovative soil testing protocol utilizing a dataset derived from synthetic solutions to model soil behaviour. The dataset encompasses physical properties including conductivity and pH, with a concentration on three key macronutrients: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Four machine learning algorithms were applied to the dataset, with random forest regressors and neural networks being selected for the prediction of soil nutrient concentrations. Comparative analysis with laboratory soil testing results revealed prediction errors of 23.6% for phosphorus and 16% for potassium using the random forest model, and 26.3% for phosphorus and 21.8% for potassium using the neural network model. This methodology illustrates a cost-effective and efficacious strategy for real-time soil nutrient monitoring, offering substantial advancements over conventional techniques and enhancing the capability to sustain optimal nutrient levels conducive to robust crop growth.</description>

      <title>Bacterial Glass Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacterial assemblies exhibit rich collective behaviors that control their biological functions, making them a relevant object of study from an active matter physics perspective. Dense bacterial suspensions self-organize into distinct physical phases with intriguing dynamical properties. Here, we study dense two-dimensional films of swimming bacteria using advanced imaging techniques and machine learning. By varying density, we uncover a bacterial glass transition, a direct active matter analogue of equilibrium glass transitions in colloidal and molecular fluids. The transition is marked by a dramatic slowdown of dynamics with minimal structural change. Strong dynamic heterogeneity emerges in space and time, leading to an anomalous violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation and a growing dynamic correlation length, universally observed across five bacterial strains. Our results establish that bacterial colonies exhibit glassy dynamics, but their living, active nature gives them unique properties, paving the way for new research regarding how non-equilibrium physics impacts biology.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models for Environmental Science: A Survey of Emerging Frontiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling environmental ecosystems is essential for effective resource management, sustainable development, and understanding complex ecological processes. However, traditional data-driven methods face challenges in capturing inherently complex and interconnected processes and are further constrained by limited observational data in many environmental applications. Foundation models, which leverages large-scale pre-training and universal representations of complex and heterogeneous data, offer transformative opportunities for capturing spatiotemporal dynamics and dependencies in environmental processes, and facilitate adaptation to a broad range of applications. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of foundation model applications in environmental science, highlighting advancements in common environmental use cases including forward prediction, data generation, data assimilation, downscaling, inverse modeling, model ensembling, and decision-making across domains. We also detail the process of developing these models, covering data collection, architecture design, training, tuning, and evaluation. Through discussions on these emerging methods as well as their future opportunities, we aim to promote interdisciplinary collaboration that accelerates advancements in machine learning for driving scientific discovery in addressing critical environmental challenges.</description>

      <title>Sub-Clustering for Class Distance Recalculation in Long-Tailed Drug Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the real world, long-tailed data distributions are prevalent, making it challenging for models to effectively learn and classify tail classes. However, we discover that in the field of drug chemistry, certain tail classes exhibit higher identifiability during training due to their unique molecular structural features, a finding that significantly contrasts with the conventional understanding that tail classes are generally difficult to identify. Existing imbalance learning methods, such as resampling and cost-sensitive reweighting, overly rely on sample quantity priors, causing models to excessively focus on tail classes at the expense of head class performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that breaks away from the traditional static evaluation paradigm based on sample size. Instead, we establish a dynamical inter-class separability metric using feature distances between different classes. Specifically, we employ a sub-clustering contrastive learning approach to thoroughly learn the embedding features of each class, and we dynamically compute the distances between class embeddings to capture the relative positional evolution of samples from different classes in the feature space, thereby rebalancing the weights of the classification loss function. We conducted experiments on multiple existing long-tailed drug datasets and achieved competitive results by improving the accuracy of tail classes without compromising the performance of dominant classes.</description>

      <title>EquiCPI: SE(3)-Equivariant Geometric Deep Learning for Structure-Aware Prediction of Compound-Protein Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of compound-protein interactions (CPI) remains a cornerstone challenge in computational drug discovery. While existing sequence-based approaches leverage molecular fingerprints or graph representations, they critically overlook three-dimensional (3D) structural determinants of binding affinity. To bridge this gap, we present EquiCPI, an end-to-end geometric deep learning framework that synergizes first-principles structural modeling with SE(3)-equivariant neural networks. Our pipeline transforms raw sequences into 3D atomic coordinates via ESMFold for proteins and DiffDock-L for ligands, followed by physics-guided conformer re-ranking and equivariant feature learning. At its core, EquiCPI employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing over atomic point clouds, preserving symmetry under rotations, translations, and reflections, while hierarchically encoding local interaction patterns through tensor products of spherical harmonics. The proposed model is evaluated on BindingDB (affinity prediction) and DUD-E (virtual screening), EquiCPI achieves performance on par with or exceeding the state-of-the-art deep learning competitors.</description>

      <title>Unifying Physics- and Data-Driven Modeling via Novel Causal Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network for Interpretable Epidemic Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate epidemic forecasting is crucial for effective disease control and prevention. Traditional compartmental models often struggle to estimate temporally and spatially varying epidemiological parameters, while deep learning models typically overlook disease transmission dynamics and lack interpretability in the epidemiological context. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Causal Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (CSTGNN), a hybrid framework that integrates a Spatio-Contact SIR model with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of epidemics. Inter-regional human mobility exhibits continuous and smooth spatiotemporal patterns, leading to adjacent graph structures that share underlying mobility dynamics. To model these dynamics, we employ an adaptive static connectivity graph to represent the stable components of human mobility and utilize a temporal dynamics model to capture fluctuations within these patterns. By integrating the adaptive static connectivity graph with the temporal dynamics graph, we construct a dynamic graph that encapsulates the comprehensive properties of human mobility networks. Additionally, to capture temporal trends and variations in infectious disease spread, we introduce a temporal decomposition model to handle temporal dependence. This model is then integrated with a dynamic graph convolutional network for epidemic forecasting. We validate our model using real-world datasets at the provincial level in China and the state level in Germany. Extensive studies demonstrate that our method effectively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious diseases, providing a valuable tool for forecasting and intervention strategies. Furthermore, analysis of the learned parameters offers insights into disease transmission mechanisms, enhancing the interpretability and practical applicability of our model.</description>

      <title>UQSA -- An R-Package for Uncertainty Quantification and Sensitivity Analysis for Biochemical Reaction Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biochemical reaction models describing subcellular processes generally come with a large uncertainty. To be able to account for this during the modeling process, we have developed the R-package UQSA, performing uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis in an integrated fashion. UQSA is designed for fast sampling of complicated multi-dimensional parameter distributions, using efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques and Vine-copulas to model complicated joint distributions. We perform MCMC sampling both from stochastic and deterministic models, in either likelihood-free or likelihood-based settings. In the likelihood-free case, we use Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), while for likelihood-based sampling we provide different algorithms, including the fast geometry-informed algorithm SMMALA (Simplified Manifold Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm). The uncertainty quantification can be followed by a variance decomposition-based global sensitivity analysis. We are aiming for biochemical models, but UQSA can be used for any type of reaction networks. The use of Vine-copulas allows us to describe, evaluate, and sample from complicated parameter distributions, as well as adding new datasets in a sequential manner without redoing the previous parameter fit. The code is written in R, with C as a backend to improve speed. We use the SBtab table format for Systems Biology projects for the model description as well as the experimental data. An event system allows the user to model complicated transient input, common within, e.g., neuroscience. UQSA has an extensive documentation with several examples describing different types of models and data. The code has been tested on up to 2000 cores on several nodes on a computing cluster, but we also include smaller examples that can be run on a laptop.

      <title>Anti-pathogenic property of thermophile-fermented compost as a feed additive and its in vivo external diagnostic imaging in a fish model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22916v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermentative recycling of organic matter is important for a sustainable society, but the functionality of fermented products needs to be adequately evaluated. Here, we clarify the antipathogenic properties for fish of a compost-type feed additive fermented by thermophilic Bacillaceae using non-edible marine resources as raw materials. After prior administration of the compost extract to seabream as a fish model for 70 days, the mortality rate after 28 days of exposure to the fish pathogen Edwardsiella reached a maximum of 20%, although the rate was 60% without prior administration. Under such conditions, the serum complement activity of seabream increased, and the recovery time after anesthesia treatment was also fasten. Furthermore, the differences in the degree of smoothness and glossiness of the fish body surface depending on the administration were statistically shown by imaging techniques to evaluate the texture and color tone of field photographs. These results suggest that thermophile-fermented compost is effective as a functional feed additive against fish disease infection, and that such conditions can be estimated by body surface analysis. This study provides a new perspective for the natural symbiosis industry, as well as for the utilization of non-invasive diagnosis to efficiently estimate the quality of its production activities</description>

Abstract: Deep learning has deeply influenced protein science, enabling breakthroughs in predicting protein properties, higher-order structures, and molecular interactions. This paper introduces DeepProtein, a comprehensive and user-friendly deep learning library tailored for protein-related tasks. It enables researchers to seamlessly address protein data with cutting-edge deep learning models. To assess model performance, we establish a benchmark evaluating different deep learning architectures across multiple protein-related tasks, including protein function prediction, subcellular localization prediction, protein-protein interaction prediction, and protein structure prediction. Furthermore, we introduce DeepProt-T5, a series of fine-tuned Prot-T5-based models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark tasks, while demonstrating competitive results on six of others. Comprehensive documentation and tutorials are available which could ensure accessibility and support reproducibility. Built upon the widely used drug discovery library DeepPurpose, DeepProtein is publicly available at https://github.com/jiaqingxie/DeepProtein.</description>

Abstract: Parameter identifiability is often requisite to the effective application of mathematical models in the interpretation of biological data, however theory applicable to the study of partial differential equations remains limited. We present a new approach to structural identifiability analysis of fully observed parabolic equations that are linear in their parameters. Our approach frames identifiability as an existence and uniqueness problem in a closely related elliptic equation and draws, for homogeneous equations, on the well-known Fredholm alternative to establish unconditional identifiability, and cases where specific choices of initial and boundary conditions lead to non-identifiability. While in some sense pathological, we demonstrate that this loss of structural identifiability has ramifications for practical identifiability; important particularly for spatial problems, where the initial condition is often limited by experimental constraints. For cases with nonlinear reaction terms, uniqueness of solutions to the auxiliary elliptic equation corresponds to identifiability, often leading to unconditional global identifiability under mild assumptions. We present analysis for a suite of simple scalar models with various boundary conditions that include linear (exponential) and nonlinear (logistic) source terms, and a special case of a two-species cell motility model. We conclude by discussing how this new perspective enables well-developed analysis tools to advance the developing theory underlying structural identifiability of partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>TflosYOLO+TFSC: An Accurate and Robust Model for Estimating Flower Count and Flowering Period</title>

Abstract: Tea flowers play a crucial role in taxonomic research and hybrid breeding for the tea plant. As traditional methods of observing tea flower traits are labor-intensive and inaccurate, we propose TflosYOLO and TFSC model for tea flowering quantifying, which enable estimation of flower count and flowering period. In this study, a highly representative and diverse dataset was constructed by collecting flower images from 29 tea accessions in 2 years. Based on this dataset, the TflosYOLO model was built on the YOLOv5 architecture and enhanced with the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) network, which is the first model to offer a viable solution for detecting and counting tea flowers. The TflosYOLO model achieved an mAP50 of 0.874, outperforming YOLOv5, YOLOv7 and YOLOv8. Furthermore, TflosYOLO model was tested on 34 datasets encompassing 26 tea accessions, five flowering stages, various lighting conditions, and pruned / unpruned plants, demonstrating high generalization and robustness. The correlation coefficient (R^2) between the predicted and actual flower counts was 0.974. Additionally, the TFSC (Tea Flowering Stage Classification) model, a 7-layer neural network was designed for automatic classification of the flowering period. TFSC model was evaluated on 2 years and achieved an accuracy of 0.738 and 0.899 respectively. Using the TflosYOLO+TFSC model, we monitored the tea flowering dynamics and tracked the changes in flowering stages across various tea accessions. The framework provides crucial support for tea plant breeding programs and phenotypic analysis of germplasm resources.</description>
