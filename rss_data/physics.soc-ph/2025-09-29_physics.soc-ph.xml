      <title>Assessment of deep learning models integrated with weather and environmental variables for wildfire spread prediction and a case study of the 2023 Maui fires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the spread of wildfires is essential for effective fire management and risk assessment. With the fast advancements of artificial intelligence (AI), various deep learning models have been developed and utilized for wildfire spread prediction. However, there is limited understanding of the advantages and limitations of these models, and it is also unclear how deep learning-based fire spread models can be compared with existing non-AI fire models. In this work, we assess the ability of five typical deep learning models integrated with weather and environmental variables for wildfire spread prediction based on over ten years of wildfire data in the state of Hawaii. We further use the 2023 Maui fires as a case study to compare the best deep learning models with a widely-used fire spread model, FARSITE. The results show that two deep learning models, i.e., ConvLSTM and ConvLSTM with attention, perform the best among the five tested AI models. FARSITE shows higher precision, lower recall, and higher F1-score than the best AI models, while the AI models offer higher flexibility for the input data. By integrating AI models with an explainable AI method, we further identify important weather and environmental factors associated with the 2023 Maui wildfires.</description>

      <title>Engineering the Future of R&amp;D: The Case for AI-Driven, Integrated Biotechnology Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating cost, extended timelines, and low success rates in pharmaceutical research demand a fundamental rethinking of biotechnology R&amp;D infrastructure. This chapter introduces the concept of the AI-Integrated Biotechnology Hub, a purpose-built research ecosystem uniting residential, commercial, clinical, and research facilities under a central, AI-driven operating system. Designed as a multi-sided platform, the hub leverages continuous, multi-modal health data collection, advanced smart living environments, and federated learning models to enable secure, privacy-preserving biomedical research. By integrating real estate, biotechnology facilities, research hospitals, and community services, the model maximizes data utility, accelerates drug discovery, and enhances resident well-being. Transparency, accountability, and ethical stewardship are critical pillars of governance, enacted through dynamic consent, data trusts, and multi-stakeholder oversight. Scalable across urban and vertical architectures, this paradigm offers a viable, sustainable pathway toward improving healthspan, fostering innovation, and reshaping the economics of global drug development.</description>

      <title>Financial viability of social enterprises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study presents a model of factors influencing the financial viability of Hungarian social enterprises, and tests the model on a sample of 220 Hungarian firms involved in social entrepreneurship. In the model we suggest that the most important factors for financial viability are the Regulatory environment (the transparency of regulations); the Entrepreneurial attributes of the entrepreneur (business orientation, business skills and experience, business planning tendencies); the Financial support provided by the environment (the ratio of grants, donations and subsidies within the total revenues of the firm); and the Strategy followed by the firms (the presence of such generic strategies as cost leadership or differentiation). We find that only two of the model's four factors are significantly associated with Financial viability: Entrepreneurial attributes and Financial support. The results suggest that the best way of strengthening the viability of social enterprises is through entrepreneurship training (to enhance the business skills and experience of the entrepreneurs, and to propagate business planning), and to provide grants and subsidies to these firms. As no significant association was found between Financial viability and Strategy, we can conclude that the role of market competition is probably relatively week among Hungarian social enterprises.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Negative Commuting: Integrating Urban Design, Behavior, and Technology for Climate-Positive Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commuting contributes substantially to urban greenhouse gas emissions and represents a critical focus for climate mitigation efforts. This paper explores the multifaceted nature of commuting-related carbon dioxide emissions by analyzing the influence of urban form, socio-economic attributes, and individual behaviors. It reviews analytical approaches including structural equation modeling, multi-objective optimization, and agent-based simulations that have been employed to understand and mitigate emissions. Building on these insights, the paper develops a conceptual framework for carbon-negative commuting that integrates spatial planning, behavioral interventions, technological innovations, and carbon offsetting strategies. Case studies from diverse global contexts illustrate both the feasibility and challenges of implementing these interventions. The discussion highlights key trade-offs, equity considerations, and governance barriers while identifying co-benefits such as improved public health and urban resilience. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary research and adaptive policymaking to operationalize carbon-negative commuting and align urban mobility systems with global decarbonization goals.</description>

      <title>Universal Model of Urban Street Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing 9,000 urban areas' street networks, we identify properties, including extreme betweenness centrality heterogeneity, that typical spatial network models fail to explain. Accordingly we propose a universal, parsimonious, generative model based on a two-step mechanism that begins with a spanning tree as a backbone then iteratively adds edges to match empirical degree distributions. Controlled by a single parameter representing lattice-equivalent node density, it accurately reproduces key universal properties to bridge the gap between empirical observations and generative models.</description>

      <title>GeoEvolve: Automating Geospatial Model Discovery via Multi-Agent Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geospatial modeling provides critical solutions for pressing global challenges such as sustainability and climate change. Existing large language model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks: spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification (geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error (RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\%. Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable, high-quality evolution. These results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.</description>

      <title>Message passing for epidemiological interventions on networks with loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spreading models capture key dynamics on networks, such as cascading failures in economic systems, (mis)information diffusion, and pathogen transmission. Here, we focus on design intervention problems -- for example, designing optimal vaccination rollouts or wastewater surveillance systems -- which can be solved by comparing outcomes under various counterfactuals. A leading approach to computing these outcomes is message passing, which allows for the rapid and direct computation of the marginal probabilities for each node. However, despite its efficiency, classical message passing tends to overestimate outbreak sizes on real-world networks, leading to incorrect predictions and, thus, interventions. Here, we improve these estimates by using the neighborhood message passing (NMP) framework for the epidemiological calculations. We evaluate the quality of the improved algorithm and demonstrate how it can be used to test possible solutions to three intervention design problems: influence maximization, optimal vaccination, and sentinel surveillance.</description>

      <title>Intuition emerges in Maximum Caliber models at criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether large predictive models merely parrot their training data or produce genuine insight lacks a physical explanation. This work reports a primitive form of intuition that emerges as a metastable phase of learning that critically balances next-token prediction against future path-entropy. The intuition mechanism is discovered via mind-tuning, the minimal principle that imposes Maximum Caliber in predictive models with a control temperature-like parameter $\lambda$. Training on random walks in deterministic mazes reveals a rich phase diagram: imitation (low $\lambda$), rule-breaking hallucination (high $\lambda$), and a fragile in-between window exhibiting strong protocol-dependence (hysteresis) and multistability, where models spontaneously discover novel goal-directed strategies. These results are captured by an effective low-dimensional theory and frame intuition as an emergent property at the critical balance between memorizing what is and wondering what could be.</description>

      <title>Multivariable Behavioral Change Modeling of Epidemics in the Presence of Undetected Infections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epidemic models are invaluable tools to understand and implement strategies to control the spread of infectious diseases, as well as to inform public health policies and resource allocation. However, current modeling approaches have limitations that reduce their practical utility, such as the exclusion of human behavioral change in response to the epidemic or ignoring the presence of undetected infectious individuals in the population. These limitations became particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring the need for more accurate and informative models. Motivated by these challenges, we develop a novel Bayesian epidemic modeling framework to better capture the complexities of disease spread by incorporating behavioral responses and undetected infections. In particular, our framework makes three contributions: 1) leveraging additional data on hospitalizations and deaths in modeling the disease dynamics, 2) accounting for data uncertainty arising from the large presence of asymptomatic and undetected infections, and 3) allowing the population behavioral change to be dynamically influenced by multiple data sources (cases and deaths). We thoroughly investigate the properties of the proposed model via simulation, and illustrate its utility on COVID-19 data from Montreal and Miami.</description>

      <title>Dual Reinforcement Learning Synergy in Resource Allocation: Emergence of Self-Organized Momentum Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In natural ecosystems and human societies, self-organized resource allocation and policy synergy are ubiquitous and significant. This work focuses on the synergy between Dual Reinforcement Learning Policies in the Minority Game (DRLP-MG) to optimize resource allocation. Our study examines a mixed-structured population with two sub-populations: a Q-subpopulation using Q-learning policy and a C-subpopulation adopting the classical policy. We first identify a synergy effect between these subpopulations. A first-order phase transition occurs as the mixing ratio of the subpopulations changes. Further analysis reveals that the Q-subpopulation consists of two internal synergy clusters (IS-clusters) and a single external synergy cluster (ES-cluster). The former contribute to the internal synergy within the Q-subpopulation through synchronization and anti-synchronization, whereas the latter engages in the inter-subpopulation synergy. Within the ES-cluster, the classical momentum strategy in the financial market manifests and assumes a crucial role in the inter-subpopulation synergy. This particular strategy serves to prevent long-term under-utilization of resources. However, it also triggers trend reversals and leads to a decrease in rewards for those who adopt it. Our research reveals that the frozen effect, in either the C- or Q-subpopulation, is a crucial prerequisite for synergy, consistent with previous studies. We also conduct mathematical analyses on subpopulation synergy effects and the synchronization and anti-synchronization forms of IS-clusters in the Q-subpopulation. Overall, our work comprehensively explores the complex resource-allocation dynamics in DRLP-MG, uncovers multiple synergy mechanisms and their conditions, enriching the theoretical understanding of reinforcement-learning-based resource allocation and offering valuable practical insights</description>
