      <title>Biharmonic Distance of Graphs and its Higher-Order Variants: Theoretical Properties with Applications to Centrality and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective resistance is a distance between vertices of a graph that is both theoretically interesting and useful in applications. We study a variant of effective resistance called the biharmonic distance. While the effective resistance measures how well-connected two vertices are, we prove several theoretical results supporting the idea that the biharmonic distance measures how important an edge is to the global topology of the graph. Our theoretical results connect the biharmonic distance to well-known measures of connectivity of a graph like its total resistance and sparsity. Based on these results, we introduce two clustering algorithms using the biharmonic distance. Finally, we introduce a further generalization of the biharmonic distance that we call the $k$-harmonic distance. We empirically study the utility of biharmonic and $k$-harmonic distance for edge centrality and graph clustering.</description>

      <title>Wiser than the Wisest of Crowds: The Asch Effect Revisited under Friedkin-Johnsen Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1907, Sir Francis Galton independently asked 787 villagers to estimate the weight of an ox. Although none of them guessed the exact weight, the average estimate was remarkably accurate. This phenomenon is known as wisdom of crowds. In a clever experiment, Asch employed actors to demonstrate the human tendency to conform to others' opinions. The question we ask is: what would Sir Francis Galton have observed if Asch had interfered by employing actors? Would the wisdom of crowds become even wiser or not? The problem becomes intriguing when considering the inter-connectedness of the villagers, which is the central theme of this work. We examine a scenario where $n$ agents are interconnected and influence each other. The average of their opinions provides an estimator of a certain quality for some unknown quantity. How can one improve or reduce the quality of the original estimator in terms of the MSE by utilizing Asch's strategy of hiring a few stooges?
  We present a new formulation of this problem, assuming that nodes adjust their opinions according to the Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics. We demonstrate that selecting $k$ stooges for maximizing and minimizing the MSE is NP-hard. We also demonstrate that our formulation is closely related to maximizing or minimizing polarization and show NP-hardness. We propose an efficient greedy heuristic that scales to large networks and test our algorithm on synthetic and real-world datasets. Although MSE and polarization objectives differ, we find in practice that maximizing polarization often yields solutions that are nearly optimal for minimizing the wisdom of crowds in terms of MSE. Our analysis of real-world data reveals that even a small number of stooges can significantly influence the conversation on the war in Ukraine, resulting in a relative increase of the MSE of 207.80% (maximization) or a decrease of 50.62% (minimization).</description>

      <title>Political Leaning Inference through Plurinational Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media users express their political preferences via interaction with other users, by spontaneous declarations or by participation in communities within the network. This makes a social network such as Twitter a valuable data source to study computational science approaches to political learning inference. In this work we focus on three diverse regions in Spain (Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia) to explore various methods for multi-party categorization, required to analyze evolving and complex political landscapes, and compare it with binary left-right approaches. We use a two-step method involving unsupervised user representations obtained from the retweets and their subsequent use for political leaning detection. Comprehensive experimentation on a newly collected and curated dataset comprising labeled users and their interactions demonstrate the effectiveness of using Relational Embeddings as representation method for political ideology detection in both binary and multi-party frameworks, even with limited training data. Finally, data visualization illustrates the ability of the Relational Embeddings to capture intricate intra-group and inter-group political affinities.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and Detecting Propaganda-Spreading Accounts on Telegram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information-based attacks on social media, such as disinformation campaigns and propaganda, are emerging cybersecurity threats. The security community has focused on countering these threats on social media platforms like X and Reddit. However, they also appear in instant-messaging social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal. In these platforms information-based attacks primarily happen in groups and channels, requiring manual moderation efforts by channel administrators. We collect, label, and analyze a large dataset of more than 17 million Telegram comments and messages. Our analysis uncovers two independent, coordinated networks that spread pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian propaganda, garnering replies from real users. We propose a novel mechanism for detecting propaganda that capitalizes on the relationship between legitimate user messages and propaganda replies and is tailored to the information that Telegram makes available to moderators. Our method is faster, cheaper, and has a detection rate (97.6%) 11.6 percentage points higher than human moderators after seeing only one message from an account. It remains effective despite evolving propaganda.</description>

      <title>HTIM: Hybrid Text-Interaction Modeling for Broadening Political Leaning Inference in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Political leaning can be defined as the inclination of an individual towards certain political orientations that align with their personal beliefs. Political leaning inference has traditionally been framed as a binary classification problem, namely, to distinguish between left vs. right or conservative vs liberal. Furthermore, although some recent work considers political leaning inference in a multi-party multi-region framework, their study is limited to the application of social interaction data. In order to address these shortcomings, in this study we propose Hybrid Text-Interaction Modeling (HTIM), a framework that enables hybrid modeling fusioning text and interactions from Social Media to accurately identify the political leaning of users in a multi-party multi-region framework. Access to textual and interaction-based data not only allows us to compare these data sources but also avoids reliance on specific data types. We show that, while state-of-the-art text-based representations on their own are not able to improve over interaction-based representations, a combination of text-based and interaction-based modeling using HTIM considerably improves the performance across the three regions, an improvement that is more prominent when we focus on the most challenging cases involving users who are less engaged in politics.</description>

      <title>Dynamical evolution of social network polarization and its impact on the propagation of a virus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in 2020 has highlighted the complex interplay between vaccine hesitancy and societal polarization. In this study, we analyse the dynamical polarization within a social network as well as the network properties before and after a vaccine was made available. Our results show that as the network evolves from a less structured state to one with more clustered communities. Then using an agent-based modeling approach, we simulate the propagation of a virus in a polarized society by assigning vaccines to pro-vaccine individuals and none to the anti-vaccine individuals. We compare this propagation to the case where the same number of vaccines is distributed homogeneously across the population. In polarized networks, we observe a significantly more widespread diffusion of the virus, highlighting the importance of considering polarization for epidemic forecasting.</description>

      <title>A Sticker is Worth a Thousand Words: Characterizing the Use of Stickers in WhatsApp Political Groups in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing use of smartphones, instant messaging platforms turned into important communication tools. According to WhatsApp, more than 100 billion messages are sent each day on the app. Communication on these platforms has allowed individuals to express themselves in other types of media, rather than simple text, including audio, videos, images, and stickers. Particularly, stickers are a new multimedia format that emerged with messaging apps, promoting new forms of interactions among users, especially in the Brazilian context, transcending their role as a mere form of humor to become a key element in political strategy. In this regard, we investigate how stickers are being used, unveiling unique characteristics that these media bring to WhatsApp chats and the political use of this new media format. To achieve that, we collected a large sample of messages from WhatsApp public political discussion groups in Brazil and analyzed the sticker messages shared in this context</description>

      <title>Generating Human Understandable Explanations for Node Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Node embedding algorithms produce low-dimensional latent representations of nodes in a graph. These embeddings are often used for downstream tasks, such as node classification and link prediction. In this paper, we investigate the following two questions: (Q1) Can we explain each embedding dimension with human-understandable graph features (e.g. degree, clustering coefficient and PageRank). (Q2) How can we modify existing node embedding algorithms to produce embeddings that can be easily explained by human-understandable graph features? We find that the answer to Q1 is yes and introduce a new framework called XM (short for eXplain eMbedding) to answer Q2. A key aspect of XM involves minimizing the nuclear norm of the generated explanations. We show that by minimizing the nuclear norm, we minimize the lower bound on the entropy of the generated explanations. We test XM on a variety of real-world graphs and show that XM not only preserves the performance of existing node embedding methods, but also enhances their explainability.</description>

      <title>A Labelled Dataset for Sentiment Analysis of Videos on YouTube, TikTok, and Other Sources about the 2024 Outbreak of Measles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work of this paper presents a dataset that contains the data of 4011 videos about the ongoing outbreak of measles published on 264 websites on the internet between January 1, 2024, and May 31, 2024. The dataset is available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/40s8-xf63. These websites primarily include YouTube and TikTok, which account for 48.6% and 15.2% of the videos, respectively. The remainder of the websites include Instagram and Facebook as well as the websites of various global and local news organizations. For each of these videos, the URL of the video, title of the post, description of the post, and the date of publication of the video are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. After developing this dataset, sentiment analysis (using VADER), subjectivity analysis (using TextBlob), and fine-grain sentiment analysis (using DistilRoBERTa-base) of the video titles and video descriptions were performed. This included classifying each video title and video description into (i) one of the sentiment classes i.e. positive, negative, or neutral, (ii) one of the subjectivity classes i.e. highly opinionated, neutral opinionated, or least opinionated, and (iii) one of the fine-grain sentiment classes i.e. fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, or neutral. These results are presented as separate attributes in the dataset for the training and testing of machine learning algorithms for performing sentiment analysis or subjectivity analysis in this field as well as for other applications. Finally, this paper also presents a list of open research questions that may be investigated using this dataset.</description>

      <title>Efficient Neural Common Neighbor for Temporal Graph Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal graphs are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios, such as social network, trade and transportation. Predicting dynamic links between nodes in a temporal graph is of vital importance. Traditional methods usually leverage the temporal neighborhood of interaction history to generate node embeddings first and then aggregate the source and target node embeddings to predict the link. However, such methods focus on learning individual node representations, but overlook the pairwise representation learning nature of link prediction and fail to capture the important pairwise features of links such as common neighbors (CN). Motivated by the success of Neural Common Neighbor (NCN) for static graph link prediction, we propose TNCN, a temporal version of NCN for link prediction in temporal graphs. TNCN dynamically updates a temporal neighbor dictionary for each node, and utilizes multi-hop common neighbors between the source and target node to learn a more effective pairwise representation. We validate our model on five large-scale real-world datasets from the Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB), and find that it achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three of them. Additionally, TNCN demonstrates excellent scalability on large datasets, outperforming popular GNN baselines by up to 6.4 times in speed. Our code is available at https: //github.com/GraphPKU/TNCN.</description>

      <title>Strong and Weak Random Walks on Signed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random walks play an important role in probing the structure of complex networks. On traditional networks, they can be used to extract community structure, understand node centrality, perform link prediction, or capture the similarity between nodes. On signed networks, where the edge weights can be either positive or negative, it is non-trivial to design a random walk which can be used to extract information about the signed structure of the network, in particular the ability to partition the graph into communities with positive edges inside and negative edges in between. Prior works on signed network random walks focus on the case where there are only two such communities (strong balance), which is rarely the case in empirical networks. In this paper, we propose a signed network random walk which can capture the structure of a network with more than two such communities (weak balance). The walk results in a similarity matrix which can be used to cluster the nodes into antagonistic communities. We compare the characteristics of the so-called strong and weak random walks, in terms of walk length and stationarity. We show through a series of experiments on synthetic and empirical networks that the similarity matrix based on weak walks can be used for both unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering, outperforming the same similarity matrix based on strong walks when the graph has more than two communities, or exhibits asymmetry in the density of links. These results suggest that other random-walk based algorithms for signed networks could be improved simply by running them with weak walks instead of strong walks.</description>

      <title>Designing Child-Centered Content Exposure and Moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on children's online experience and computer interaction often overlooks the relationship children have with hidden algorithms that control the content they encounter. Furthermore, it is not only about how children interact with targeted content but also how their development and agency are largely affected by these. By engaging with the body of literature at the intersection of i) human-centered design approaches, ii) exclusion and discrimination in A.I., iii) privacy, transparency, and accountability, and iv) children's online citizenship, this article dives into the question of "How can we approach the design of a child-centered moderation process to (1) include aspects that families value for their children and (2) provide explanations for content appropriateness and removal so that we can scale (according to systems and human needs) the moderation process assisted by A.I.?".
  This article contributes a sociotechnical highlight of core challenges and opportunities of designing child-centered content control tools. The article concludes by grounding and characterizing design considerations for a child-centered, family-guided moderation system. We hope this work serves as a stepping stone for designers and researchers pursuing children's safety online with an eye on hidden agents controlling children's online experiences and, by extension, the values and opportunities children are exposed to.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12186v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional social learning frameworks consider environments with a homogeneous state, where each agent receives observations conditioned on that true state of nature. In this work, we relax this assumption and study the distributed hypothesis testing problem in a heterogeneous environment, where each agent can receive observations conditioned on their own personalized state of nature (or truth). We particularly focus on community structured networks, where each community admits their own true hypothesis. This scenario is common in various contexts, such as when sensors are spatially distributed, or when individuals in a social network have differing views or opinions. We show that the adaptive social learning strategy is a preferred choice for nonstationary environments, and allows each cluster to discover its own truth.</description>

      <title>Who is driving the conversation? Analysing the nodality of British MPs and journalists on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Who sets the policy agenda? In this paper, we explore the roles of policy actors in agenda setting by studying their relative influence in policy-related discussions. Our approach builds on ``nodality'' \textemdash a concept in political science that determines the capacity of an actor to share information and to be at the centre of information networks. We propose a novel methodology that quantifies the nodality of all individual actors in any conversation by analysing a comprehensive set of their centrality measures in the related information network. We combine this with the analysis of the activity time-series, of the related conversation (or topic), to demonstrate how nodality scores relate to the capacity to drive topic-related activity. Here we analyse policy-related discussions on X (previously Twitter) and quantify the nodality of two sets of actors in the UK political system \textemdash Members of Parliament (MPs) and accredited journalists - on four policy topics: The Russia-Ukraine War, the Cost-of-Living Crisis, Brexit and COVID-19. Our results show that the capacity to influence the activity related to a topic is significantly and positively associated with nodality. In particular, we identify two dimensions of nodality that drive the capacity to influence topic-related activity. The first is ``active nodality", which reflects the level of topic-related engagement an individual actor has on the platform. The second dimension is ``inherent nodality" which is entirely independent of the platform and reflects the actor's institutional position (such as an MP in a front-bench role, or a journalist's position at a prominent media outlet).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Bayesian social learning is a framework for distributed hypothesis testing aimed at learning the true state of the environment. Traditionally, the agents are assumed to receive observations conditioned on the same true state, although it is also possible to examine the case of heterogeneous models across the graph. One important special case is when heterogeneity is caused by the presence of malicious agents whose goal is to move the agents toward a wrong hypothesis. In this work, we propose an algorithm that allows to discover the true state of every individual agent based on the sequence of their beliefs. In so doing, the methodology is also able to locate malicious behavior.</description>

      <title>Leveraging advances in machine learning for the robust classification and interpretation of networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to simulate realistic networks based on empirical data is an important task across scientific disciplines, from epidemiology to computer science. Often simulation approaches involve selecting a suitable network generative model such as Erd\"os-R\'enyi or small-world. However, few tools are available to quantify if a particular generative model is suitable for capturing a given network structure or organization. We utilize advances in interpretable machine learning to classify simulated networks by our generative models based on various network attributes, using both primary features and their interactions. Our study underscores the significance of specific network features and their interactions in distinguishing generative models, comprehending complex network structures, and the formation of real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Relationship Between User Specialization and Toxicity on Reddit: A Sentiment Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online platforms host a diverse user base, which can be broadly categorized into "specialist users" with focused interests and "generalist users" who engage in a wide range of topics. This study explores the behavioral differences between these two user types on the popular platform Reddit, focusing on the level of toxicity in their posts and the associated sentiment scores across 24 emotional categories and a neutral state. By employing community embeddings to represent users in a high-dimensional space, we measure activity diversity using the GS score. We analyze a dataset of 16,291,992 posts from 4,926,237 users spanning the period from 2019 to 2021, assessing the degree of toxicity and sentiment scores for each post. Our findings indicate that specialist users exhibit higher levels of toxic behavior compared to generalist users. Furthermore, specialist users demonstrate elevated scores for annoyance, sadness, and fear, while generalist users show higher scores for curiosity, admiration, and love. These insights contribute to a better understanding of user behavior on online platforms and can inform strategies for fostering healthier online communities.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Global Election Landscape on Social Media in 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2024, half of the global population is expected to participate in elections, offering researchers a unique opportunity to study online information diffusion and user behavior. This study investigates the media landscape on social media by analyzing Facebook posts from national political parties and major news agencies across Europe, Mexico, and India. Our methodology identifies key topics and evaluates public interaction, reflecting broader trends in political engagement. Using Principal Component Analysis, we distil these topics to uncover patterns of correlation and differentiation. This approach reveals dominant themes that engage global audiences, providing critical insights into the interplay between public opinion and digital narratives during a major electoral cycle. Our findings highlight how different topics resonate across political spectrums, shaping political debate and offering a comprehensive view of the interaction between media content, political ideology, and audience engagement.</description>

      <title>CDRNP: Cross-Domain Recommendation to Cold-Start Users via Neural Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has been proven as a promising way to tackle the user cold-start problem, which aims to make recommendations for users in the target domain by transferring the user preference derived from the source domain. Traditional CDR studies follow the embedding and mapping (EMCDR) paradigm, which transfers user representations from the source to target domain by learning a user-shared mapping function, neglecting the user-specific preference. Recent CDR studies attempt to learn user-specific mapping functions in meta-learning paradigm, which regards each user's CDR as an individual task, but neglects the preference correlations among users, limiting the beneficial information for user representations. Moreover, both of the paradigms neglect the explicit user-item interactions from both domains during the mapping process. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel CDR framework with neural process (NP), termed as CDRNP. Particularly, it develops the meta-learning paradigm to leverage user-specific preference, and further introduces a stochastic process by NP to capture the preference correlations among the overlapping and cold-start users, thus generating more powerful mapping functions by mapping the user-specific preference and common preference correlations to a predictive probability distribution. In addition, we also introduce a preference remainer to enhance the common preference from the overlapping users, and finally devises an adaptive conditional decoder with preference modulation to make prediction for cold-start users with items in the target domain. Experimental results demonstrate that CDRNP outperforms previous SOTA methods in three real-world CDR scenarios.</description>

      <title>Non-robustness of diffusion estimates on networks with measurement error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05704v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network diffusion models are used to study things like disease transmission, information spread, and technology adoption. However, small amounts of mismeasurement are extremely likely in the networks constructed to operationalize these models. We show that estimates of diffusions are highly non-robust to this measurement error. First, we show that even when measurement error is vanishingly small, such that the share of missed links is close to zero, forecasts about the extent of diffusion will greatly underestimate the truth. Second, a small mismeasurement in the identity of the initial seed generates a large shift in the locations of expected diffusion path. We show that both of these results still hold when the vanishing measurement error is only local in nature. Such non-robustness in forecasting exists even under conditions where the basic reproductive number is consistently estimable. Possible solutions, such as estimating the measurement error or implementing widespread detection efforts, still face difficulties because the number of missed links are so small. Finally, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations on simulated networks, and real networks from three settings: travel data from the COVID-19 pandemic in the western US, a mobile phone marketing campaign in rural India, and in an insurance experiment in China.</description>

      <title>What Drives Online Popularity: Author, Content or Sharers? Estimating Spread Dynamics with Bayesian Mixture Hawkes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spread of content on social media is shaped by intertwining factors on three levels: the source, the content itself, and the pathways of content spread. At the lowest level, the popularity of the sharing user determines its eventual reach. However, higher-level factors such as the nature of the online item and the credibility of its source also play crucial roles in determining how widely and rapidly the online item spreads. In this work, we propose the Bayesian Mixture Hawkes (BMH) model to jointly learn the influence of source, content and spread. We formulate the BMH model as a hierarchical mixture model of separable Hawkes processes, accommodating different classes of Hawkes dynamics and the influence of feature sets on these classes. We test the BMH model on two learning tasks, cold-start popularity prediction and temporal profile generalization performance, applying to two real-world retweet cascade datasets referencing articles from controversial and traditional media publishers. The BMH model outperforms the state-of-the-art models and predictive baselines on both datasets and utilizes cascade- and item-level information better than the alternatives. Lastly, we perform a counter-factual analysis where we apply the trained publisher-level BMH models to a set of article headlines and show that effectiveness of headline writing style (neutral, clickbait, inflammatory) varies across publishers. The BMH model unveils differences in style effectiveness between controversial and reputable publishers, where we find clickbait to be notably more effective for reputable publishers as opposed to controversial ones, which links to the latter's overuse of clickbait.</description>
