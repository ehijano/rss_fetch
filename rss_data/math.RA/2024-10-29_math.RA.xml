      <title>Twisted Rota-Baxter family operators on Hom-associative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first define twisted Rota-Baxter family operators on Hom-associative algebras indexed by a semigroup $\Omega$. Then we introduce and study Hom-NS-family algebras as the underlying structures of twisted Rota-Baxter family operators. Meanwhile, We show that a Hom-NS-family algebra induces an ordinary Hom-NS-algebra on the tensor product with the semigroup algebra. Moreover, we define the cohomology of a twisted Rota-Baxter family operator. This cohomology can also be viewed as the cohomology of a certain Hom-$\Omega$-associative algebra with coefficients in a suitable bimodule. Finally, we examine deformations of twisted Rota-Baxter family operators and demonstrate that they are governed by the aforementioned cohomology. The concept of Nijenhuis elements linked to a twisted Rota-Baxter family operator is introduced to provide a sufficient condition for its rigidity.</description>

      <title>Some Characterizations of Weakly Pseudo Primary 2-Absorbing Submodules in Terms of some Types of Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All rings are commutative, and all modules are unital. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the characterizations of weakly pseudo primary 2-absorbing sub-module in terms of some types of modules. We provide characterizations for the class of multiplication modules with the help of some types of modules such as faithful, non-singular, Z-regular, and projective modules. Furthermore, we add some conditions to prove the residual of a weakly pseudo primary 2-absorbing sub-module is a weakly pseudo primary 2-absorbing ideal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the monoids of all partial endomorphisms, of all partial weak endomorphisms, of all injective partial endomorphisms, of all partial strong endomorphisms and of all partial strong weak endomorphisms of a star graph with a finite number of vertices.

      <title>Towards Cohomology of Real Closed Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was shown by Claus Scheiderer prior to 1994 that real closed spaces have \'{e}tale cohomology. Following Scheiderer, study of real closed spaces fell out of fashion and o-minimal geometry became the focus for those at the intersection of model theory and geometry. I decided to breathe new life into the theory of real closed rings and spaces, as studied by Schwartz in 1989. In Section 1, I build the fundamentals of the theory using as little machinery as possible, and presented them as clearly as I could. Hidden gems include a full proof that real closed rings are closed under limits and colimits. In Section 2, I give an introduction to the category of real closed spaces in the first half. In the second half, I construct an equivalence of topoi between Scheiderer's sheaves on the real \'{e}tale site, and sheaves on a real \'{e}tale site $\rce/X$ of my creation. Since $\text{Sh}(\rce/X)$ can be defined without the use of $G$-topoi, the equivalence of topoi renders Scheiderer's theory computable. I end with a discussion of how one might use motivic cohomology to better understand recent results of Annette Huber in \cite{no_deRham_huber}.</description>

Abstract: We prove that infinite-dimensional highest-weight modules are faithful for Iwasawa algebras corresponding to a simple Lie algebra of type D. We use this to prove that all non-zero two-sided ideals of the Iwasawa algebra have finite codimension in this case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a combinatorial formula for computing the Wedderburn decomposition of the rational group algebra associated with an ordinary metacyclic $p$-group $G$, where $p$ is any prime. We also provide a formula for counting irreducible rational representations of $G$ with distinct degrees and derive a method to explicitly obtain all inequivalent irreducible rational matrix representations of $G$.</description>

      <title>Holonomic $A\mathcal{V}$-modules for the affine space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the growth of representations of the Lie algebra of vector fields on the affine space that admit a compatible action of the polynomial algebra. We establish the Bernstein inequality for these representations, enabling us to focus on modules with minimal growth, known as holonomic modules. We show that simple holonomic modules are isomorphic to the tensor product of a holonomic module over the Weyl algebra and a finite-dimensional $\mathfrak{gl}_n$-module. We also prove that holonomic modules have a finite length and that the representation map associated with a holonomic module is a differential operator. Finally, we present examples illustrating our results.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we give the structure of free n-Lie algebras. Next, we introduce basic commutators in n-Lie algebras and generalize the Witt formula to calculate the number of the basic commutators. Also, we prove that the set of all of the basic commutators of weight w and length n+(w-2)(n-1) is a basis for Fw, where Fw is the wth term of the lower central series in the free n-Lie algebra F.</description>

      <title>The 2-nilpotent multiplier of n-Lie algebras and its applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first recall the concept of c-nilpotent multiplier and c-capability of n-Lie algebras and also, recall the formula for calculating the number of basic commutators in n-Lie algebras. Then we give the structure of 2-nilpotent multiplier of the direct sum of two n-Lie algebras. Next, we calculate the dimension of 2-nilpotent multiplier of every abelian n-Lie algebras and Heisenberg n-Lie algebras H(n,m). Then we give a dimension of 2-nilpotent multiplier of any nilpotent n-Lie algebras of class 2 by using the number of basic commutators.</description>

      <title>On the dimension of c-nilpotent multiplier of n-Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let L be a finite-dimensional n-Lie algebra with free presentation F/R. Then the concept of c-nilpotent multiplier of L, denoted by M(c)(L), is defined as follows: M(c)(L) =(gamma c+1(F) R)/gamma c+1(R, F, . . . , F). In this paper, we obtain some inequalities and certain bounds for the dimension of M(c)(L) by using the basic commutators. Also, we discuss the relationship between the dimension of the c-nilpotent multiplier of L and the c-nilpotent multiplier of some factor of L. We further obtain an inequality between dimensions of c-nilpotent multiplier of n-Lie algebra and non-abelian tensor (exterior) product of a central ideal by its abelianized factor n-Lie algebra. Finally, we also determine the dimension and structure of c-nilpotent multipliers Heisenberg n-Lie algebras, which can be a useful tool for determining the dimension of the multiplier of nilpotent n-Lie algebras of class 2.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, on one hand, based on the classical perm Yang-Baxter equation, we investigate under what conditions a perm algebra must be a Nijenhuis perm algebra. On the other hand, we derive the compatible conditions between classical perm Yang-Baxter equation and Nijenhuis operator by a class of Nijenhuis perm bialgebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The set $S(n)$ of all elementary symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables is a minimal generating set for the algebra of symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables, but over a finite field ${\mathbb F}_q$ the set $S(n)$ is not a minimal separating set for symmetric polynomials in general. We determined when $S(n)$ is a minimal separating set for the algebra of symmetric polynomials having the least possible number of elements.</description>

      <title>Topological closure of formal power series ideals and application to topological rewriting theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate formal power series ideals and their relationship to topological rewriting theory. Since commutative formal power series algebras are Zariski rings, their ideals are closed for the adic topology defined by the maximal ideal generated by the indeterminates. We provide a constructive proof of this result which, given a formal power series in the topological closure of an ideal, consists in computing a cofactor representation of the series with respect to a standard basis of the ideal. We apply this result in the context of topological rewriting theory, where two natural notions of confluence arise: topological confluence and infinitary confluence. We give explicit examples illustrating that in general, infinitary confluence is a strictly stronger notion than topological confluence. Using topological closure of ideals, we finally show that in the context of rewriting theory on commutative formal power series, infinitary and topological confluences are equivalent when the monomial order considered is compatible with the degree.</description>
