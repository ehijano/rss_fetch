      <title>Adaptive boundary element methods for regularized combined field integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the exterior Helmholtz problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions is always well-posed, the associated standard boundary integral equations are not if the squared wavenumber agrees with an eigenvalue of the interior Dirichlet problem. Combined field integral equations are not affected by this spurious resonances but are essentially restricted to sufficiently smooth boundaries. For general Lipschitz domains, the latter integral equations are applicable through suitable regularization. Under fairly general assumptions on the regularizing operator, we propose {\sl a posterirori} computable error estimators for corresponding Galerkin boundary element methods of arbitrary polynomial degree. We show that adaptive mesh-refining algorithms steered by these local estimators converge at optimal algebraic rate with respect to the number of underlying boundary mesh elements. In particular, we consider mixed formulations involving the inverse Laplace--Beltrami as regularizing operator. Numerical examples highlight that in the vicinity of spurious resonances the proposed adaptive algorithm is significantly more performant when applied to the regularized combined field equation rather than the standard one.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation of Caputo-type advection-diffusion equations via Sylvester equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we approximate numerically the solution of Caputo-type advection-diffusion equations of the form $D_t^{\alpha} u(t,x) = a_1(x)u_{xx}(t,x) + a_2(x)u_x(t,x) + a_3u(t,x) + a_4(t,x)$, where $D_t^{\alpha} u$ denotes the Caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha\in(0,1)$ of $u$ with respect to $t$, $t\in[0, t_f]$ and the spatial domain can be the whole real line or a closed interval. First, we propose a method of order $3 - \alpha$ to approximate Caputo fractional derivatives, explain how to implement an FFT-based fast convolution to reduce the computational cost, and express the numerical approximation in terms of an operational matrix. Then, we transform a given Caputo-type advection-diffusion equation into a Sylvester equation of the form $\mathbf A\mathbf U + \mathbf U \mathbf B = \mathbf C$, and special care is given to the treatment of the boundary conditions, when the spatial domain is a closed interval. Finally, we perform several numerical experiments that illustrate the adequacy of our approach. The implementation has been done in Matlab, and we share and explain in detail the majority of the actual codes that we have used.</description>

      <title>A random free-boundary diffusive logistic model: Analysis, computing and simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A free boundary diffusive logistic model finds application in many different fields from biological invasion to wildfire propagation. However, many of these processes show a random nature and contain uncertainties in the parameters. In this paper we extend the diffusive logistic model with unknown moving front to the random scenario by assuming that the involved parameters have a finite degree of randomness. The resulting mathematical model becomes a random free boundary partial differential problem and it is addressed numerically combining the finite difference method with two approaches for the treatment of the moving front. Firstly, we propose a front-fixing transformation, reshaping the original random free boundary domain into a fixed deterministic one. A second approach is using the front-tracking method to capture the evolution of the moving front adapted to the random framework. Statistical moments of the approximating solution stochastic process and the stochastic moving boundary solution are calculated by the Monte Carlo technique. Qualitative numerical analysis establishes the stability and positivity conditions. Numerical examples are provided to compare both approaches, study the spreading-vanishing dichotomy, prove qualitative properties of the schemes and show the numerical convergence.</description>

      <title>Non-linear Partition of Unity method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Non-linear Partition of Unity Method, a novel technique integrating Radial Basis Function interpolation and Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory algorithms. It addresses challenges in high-accuracy approximations, particularly near discontinuities, by adapting weights dynamically. The method is rooted in the Partition of Unity framework, enabling efficient decomposition of large datasets into subproblems while maintaining accuracy. Smoothness indicators and compactly supported functions ensure precision in regions with discontinuities. Error bounds are calculated and validate its effectiveness, showing improved interpolation in discontinuous and smooth regions. Some numerical experiments are performed to check the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Lattice Rules Meet Kernel Cubature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rank-1 lattice rules are a class of equally weighted quasi-Monte Carlo methods that achieve essentially linear convergence rates for functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) characterized by square-integrable first-order mixed partial derivatives. In this work, we explore the impact of replacing the equal weights in lattice rules with optimized cubature weights derived using the reproducing kernel. We establish a theoretical result demonstrating a doubled convergence rate in the one-dimensional case and provide numerical investigations of convergence rates in higher dimensions. We also present numerical results for an uncertainty quantification problem involving an elliptic partial differential equation with a random coefficient.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimates for the Lindblad master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the simulation of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. To simulate the solution of this equation, the standard approach involves two sequential approximations: first, we truncate the Hilbert space to derive a differential equation in a finite-dimensional subspace. Then, we use discrete time-step to obtain a numerical solution to the finite-dimensional evolution.
  In this paper, we establish bounds for these two approximations that can be explicitely computed to guarantee the accuracy of the numerical results. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate the efficiency of our method, empirically highlighting the tightness of the upper bound. While adaptive time-stepping is already a common practice in the time discretization of the Lindblad equation, we extend this approach by showing how to dynamically adjust the truncation of the Hilbert space. This enables fully adaptive simulations of the density matrix. For large-scale simulations, this approach significantly reduces computational time and relieves users of the challenge of selecting an appropriate truncation.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis for Nonlinear GMRES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit nonlinear generalized minimal residual method (NGMRES) applied to nonlinear problems. NGMRES is used to accelerate the convergence of fixed-point iterations, which can substantially improve the performance of the underlying fixed-point iterations. We consider NGMRES with a finite window size $m$, denoted as NGMRES($m$). However, there is no convergence analysis for NGMRES($m$) applied to nonlinear systems. We prove that for general $m&gt;0$, the residuals of NGMRES($m$) converge r-linearly under some conditions. For $m=0$, we prove that the residuals of NGMRES(0) converge q-linearly.</description>

      <title>Infinity norm bounds for the inverse of Nekrasov matrices using scaling matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many applications, it is convenient to have good upper bounds for the norm of the inverse of a given matrix. In this paper, we obtain such bounds when A is a Nekrasov matrix, by means of a scaling matrix transforming A into a strictly diagonally dominant matrix. Numerical examples and comparisons with other bounds are included. The scaling matrices are also used to derive new error bounds for the linear complementarity problems when the involved matrix is a Nekrasov matrix. These error bounds can improve considerably other previous bounds.</description>

      <title>Tensor-based Dinkelbach method for computing generalized tensor eigenvalues and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel tensor-based Dinkelbach--Type method for computing extremal tensor generalized eigenvalues. We show that the extremal tensor generalized eigenvalue can be reformulated as a critical subproblem of the classical Dinkelbach--Type method, which can subsequently be expressed as a multilinear optimization problem (MOP). The MOP is solved under a spherical constraint using an efficient proximal alternative minimization method, in which we rigorously establish the global convergence. Additionally, the equivalent MOP is reformulated as an unconstrained optimization problem, allowing for the analysis of the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) exponent and providing an explicit expression for the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm. Preliminary numerical experiments on solving extremal tensor generalized eigenvalues and minimizing high-order trust-region subproblems are provided, validating the efficacy and practical utility of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A vertical slice frontogenesis test case for compressible nonhydrostatic dynamical cores of atmospheric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new test case is presented for evaluating the compressible dynamical cores of the atmospheric models. The test case is based on a compressible vertical slice model that can be obtained by simple modification of a standard three dimensional compressible dynamical core. On the one hand, an advantage of the test case is that is quasi-2D, so it can be run quickly on a standard workstation, enabling rapid experimentation with numerical schemes and discretisation choices. On the other hand, the test case exhibits frontogenesis, a challenging regime for numerical discretisations which usually only arises in 3D model configurations for the compressible case. Numerical results of the test case using an implicit time-stepping method with a compatible finite element discretisation are presented as a reference solution. An example comparison between advective and vector-invariant forms for the advective nonlinearity in the velocity equation demonstrates one possible use of the scheme. The comparison shows a Hollingsworth-like instability when the vector invariant form is used.</description>

      <title>ELM-DeepONets: Backpropagation-Free Training of Deep Operator Networks via Extreme Learning Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) are among the most prominent frameworks for operator learning, grounded in the universal approximation theorem for operators. However, training DeepONets typically requires significant computational resources. To address this limitation, we propose ELM-DeepONets, an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) framework for DeepONets that leverages the backpropagation-free nature of ELM. By reformulating DeepONet training as a least-squares problem for newly introduced parameters, the ELM-DeepONet approach significantly reduces training complexity. Validation on benchmark problems, including nonlinear ODEs and PDEs, demonstrates that the proposed method not only achieves superior accuracy but also drastically reduces computational costs. This work offers a scalable and efficient alternative for operator learning in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>A multi-class non-local macroscopic model with time delay for mixed autonomous / human-driven traffic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a class of systems of non-local conservation laws in one space-dimension incorporating time delay, which can be used to investigate the interaction between autonomous and human-driven vehicles, each characterized by a different reaction time and interaction range. We construct approximate solutions using a Hilliges-Weidlich scheme and we provide uniform L $\infty$ and BV estimates which ensure the convergence of the scheme, thus obtaining existence of entropy weak solutions of bounded variation. Uniqueness follows from an L 1 stability result derived from the entropy condition. Additionally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate applications to mixed autonomous / human-driven traffic flow modeling. In particular, we show that the presence of autonomous vehicles improves overall traffic flow and stability.</description>

      <title>Random Subspace Cubic-Regularization Methods, with Applications to Low-Rank Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze random subspace variants of the second-order Adaptive Regularization using Cubics (ARC) algorithm. These methods iteratively restrict the search space to some random subspace of the parameters, constructing and minimizing a local model only within this subspace. Thus, our variants only require access to (small-dimensional) projections of first- and second-order problem derivatives and calculate a reduced step inexpensively. Under suitable assumptions, the ensuing methods maintain the optimal first-order, and second-order, global rates of convergence of (full-dimensional) cubic regularization, while showing improved scalability both theoretically and numerically, particularly when applied to low-rank functions. When applied to the latter, our adaptive variant naturally adapts the subspace size to the true rank of the function, without knowing it a priori.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new projection method for a generic two-fluid model is presented in this work. Specifically, we extend the projection method, originally designed for single-phase variable density incompressible and compressible flows, to viscous compressible two-fluid flows. The key idea is that the single pressure $p$ can be uniquely determined by the products of volume fractions and densities $\phi_k \rho_k$, of the two fluids. Additionally, the stability of the method is ensured by appropriately assigning intermediate step variables at the time-discrete level and incorporating a stabilizing term at the fully discrete level. We prove the energy stability of the proposed numerical scheme, and its validity is demonstrated through three numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Automatically well-conditioned collocation boundary element method for transmission problems based on the Burton--Miller formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a collocation boundary element method based on the Burton--Miller method for solving transmission problems, which is rapidly convergent within the Krylov subspace solver framework. Our study enhances Burton--Miller-type boundary integral equations tailored for transmission problems by exploiting the Calderon formula. In cases where a single material exists in an unbounded host medium, we demonstrate the formulation of the boundary integral equation such that the underlying integral operator ${\cal A}$ is spectrally well-conditioned. Specifically, ${\cal A}$ can be designed such that ${\cal A}^2$ has only a single eigenvalue accumulation point. Furthermore, we extend this to the multi-material case, proving that the square of the proposed operator has only a few eigenvalues clustering points. When the collocation method is used to discretise the proposed boundary integral equations, the good spectral properties of the integral operator are naturally inherited to the coefficient matrix $\mathsf{A}$ similarly to the Nyst\"om methods; Almost all eigenvalues of $\mathsf{A}^2$ cluster at a few points in the complex plane ensuring the small condition number for $\mathsf{A}$. Through numerical examples of several benchmark problems, we illustrate that our formulation reduces the iteration number required by iterative linear solvers, even in the presence of material junction points.</description>

      <title>Complex variable solution on asymmetrical sequential shallow tunnelling in gravitational geomaterial considering static equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymmetrical sequential excavation is common in shallow tunnel engineering, especially for large-span tunnels. Owing to the lack of necessary conformal mappings, existing complex variable solutions on shallow tunnelling are only suitable for symmetrical cavities, and can not deal with asymmetrical sequential tunnelling effectively. This paper proposes a new complex variable solution on asymmetrical sequential shallow tunnelling by incorporating a bidirectional conformal mapping scheme consisting of Charge Simulation Method and Complex Dipole Simulation Method. Moreover, to eliminate the far-field displacement singularity of present complex variable method, a rigid static equilibrium mechanical model is established by fixing the far-field ground surface to equilibriate the nonzero resultant along cavity boundary due to gravitational shallow tunnelling. The corresponding mixed boundary conditions along ground surface are transformed into homogenerous Riemann-Hilbert problems with extra constraints of traction along cavity boundaries, which are solved in an iterative manner to obtain reasonable stress and displacement fields of asymmetrical sequential shallow tunnelling. The proposed solution is validated by sufficient comparisons with equivalent finite element solution with good agreements. The comparisons also suggest that the proposed solution should be more accurate than the finite element one. A parametric investigation is finally conducted to illustrate possible practical applications of the proposed solution with several engineering recommendations. Additionally, the theoretical improvements and defects of the proposed solution are discussed for objectivity.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for randomized Schatten norm estimation of numerically low-rank matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the variance of a stochastic estimator for computing Schatten norms of matrices. The estimator extracts information from a single sketch of the matrix, that is, the product of the matrix with a few standard Gaussian random vectors. While this estimator has been proposed and used in the literature before, the existing variance bounds are often pessimistic. Our work provides a new upper bound and estimates of the variance of this estimator. These theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments, demonstrating that the new bounds are significantly tighter than the existing ones in the case of numerically low-rank matrices.</description>

      <title>CWENO Interpolation for Non-Oscillatory Stochastic Collocation in Uncertainty Quantification Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in mathematical models is essential for accurately predicting system behavior under variability. This study provides guidance on method selection for reliable UQ across varied functional behaviors in engineering applications. Specifically, we compare several interpolation and approximation methods within a stochastic collocation (SC) framework, namely: generalized polynomial chaos (gPC), B-splines, shape-preserving (SP) splines, and central weighted essentially nonoscillatory (CWENO) interpolation, to reconstruct probability density functions (PDFs) and estimate statistical moments. These methods are assessed for both smooth and discontinuous functions, as well as for the solution of the 1-D Euler and shallow water equations. While gPC and interpolation B-splines perform well with smooth data, they produce oscillations near discontinuities. Approximation B-splines and SP splines, while avoiding oscillations, converge more slowly. In contrast, CWENO interpolation demonstrates high robustness, effectively capturing sharp gradients without oscillations, making it suitable for complex, discontinuous data. Overall, CWENO interpolation emerges as a versatile and effective approach for SC, particularly in handling discontinuities in UQ.</description>

      <title>Transient Instability and Patterns of Reactivity in Diffusive-Chemotaxis Soil Carbon Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pattern formation in diffusive-chemotaxis models has become increasingly important for understanding spatial structures in biological, ecological, and chemical systems. In soil, certain bacteria involved in the degradation of soil organic carbon (SOC) exhibit both motility and chemotactic behavior, as observed in experiments and field studies. To capture the formation of hot-spot soil aggregations resulting from bacterial and microorganism spatial organization, the spatially explicit MOMOS model incorporates chemotaxis into soil carbon dynamics, effectively describing the emergence of microbial aggregations and their impact on SOC dynamics. While classical studies on pattern formation primarily rely on asymptotic stability analysis, transient instability has emerged as a key mechanism for generating patterns in asymptotically stable systems. In this work, we investigate pattern formation outside the classical diffusive-chemotaxis-driven instability conditions by focusing on regions of parameter space associated with reactive equilibria. The MOMOS model for soil carbon dynamics serves as a case study to illustrate how transient behaviors can influence environmental dynamical systems. Using Klika's indicator, we estimate the maximum amplification and show that it provides a more accurate lower bound compared to the Kreiss constant. Furthermore, we explore the critical role of return time, showing that short return times suppress the emergence of stable reactive patterns. By employing the determinant of the linearized Jacobian as a proxy for return time, we identify a critical region near the instability boundary where multiple stable reactive patterns emerge.</description>

      <title>Second-order methods for quartically-regularised cubic polynomials, with applications to high-order tensor methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been growing interest in high-order tensor methods for nonconvex optimization, with adaptive regularization, as they possess better/optimal worst-case evaluation complexity globally and faster convergence asymptotically. These algorithms crucially rely on repeatedly minimizing nonconvex multivariate Taylor-based polynomial sub-problems, at least locally. Finding efficient techniques for the solution of these sub-problems, beyond the second-order case, has been an open question. This paper proposes a second-order method, Quadratic Quartic Regularisation (QQR), for efficiently minimizing nonconvex quartically-regularized cubic polynomials, such as the AR$p$ sub-problem [3] with $p=3$. Inspired by [35], QQR approximates the third-order tensor term by a linear combination of quadratic and quartic terms, yielding (possibly nonconvex) local models that are solvable to global optimality. In order to achieve accuracy $\epsilon$ in the first-order criticality of the sub-problem in finitely many iterations, we show that the error in the QQR method decreases either linearly or by at least $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{4/3})$ for locally convex iterations, while in the nonconvex case, by at least $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$; thus improving, on these types of iterations, the general cubic-regularization bound. Preliminary numerical experiments indicate that two QQR variants perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches such as ARC (also known as AR$p$ with $p=2$), achieving either a lower objective value or iteration counts.</description>

      <title>ERGNN: Spectral Graph Neural Network With Explicitly-Optimized Rational Graph Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximation-based spectral graph neural networks, which construct graph filters with function approximation, have shown substantial performance in graph learning tasks. Despite their great success, existing works primarily employ polynomial approximation to construct the filters, whereas another superior option, namely ration approximation, remains underexplored. Although a handful of prior works have attempted to deploy the rational approximation, their implementations often involve intensive computational demands or still resort to polynomial approximations, hindering full potential of the rational graph filters. To address the issues, this paper introduces ERGNN, a novel spectral GNN with explicitly-optimized rational filter. ERGNN adopts a unique two-step framework that sequentially applies the numerator filter and the denominator filter to the input signals, thus streamlining the model paradigm while enabling explicit optimization of both numerator and denominator of the rational filter. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of ERGNN over state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a practical solution for deploying rational-based GNNs.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Collocation Point Strategy For Physics Informed Neural Networks via the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for solving forward and inverse problems related to partial differential equations (PDEs). While advancements in loss functions and network architectures have improved PINN accuracy, the impact of collocation point sampling on their performance remains underexplored. Fixed sampling methods, such as uniform random sampling and equispaced grids, can fail to capture critical regions with high solution gradients, limiting their effectiveness for complex PDEs. Adaptive methods, inspired by adaptive mesh refinement from traditional numerical methods, address this by dynamically updating collocation points during training but may overlook residual dynamics between updates, potentially losing valuable information. To overcome this limitation, we propose an adaptive collocation point selection strategy utilizing the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (QR-DEIM), a reduced-order modeling technique for efficiently approximating nonlinear functions. Our results on benchmark PDEs, including the wave, Allen-Cahn, and Burgers' equations, demonstrate that our QR-DEIM-based approach improves PINN accuracy compared to existing methods, offering a promising direction for adaptive collocation point strategies.</description>
