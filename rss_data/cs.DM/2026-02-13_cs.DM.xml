      <title>Markovian protocols and an upper bound on the extension complexity of the matching polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the extension complexity of polytopes by exploiting the correspondence between non-negative factorizations of slack matrices and randomized communication protocols. We introduce a geometric characterization of extension complexity based on the width of Markovian protocols, as a variant of the framework introduced by Faenza et al. This enables us to derive a new upper bound of $\tilde{O}(n^3\cdot 1.5^n)$ for the extension complexity of the matching polytope $P_{\text{match}}(n)$, improving upon the standard $2^n$-bound given by Edmonds' description. Additionally, we recover Goemans' compact formulation for the permutahedron using a one-round protocol based on sorting networks.</description>

      <title>Cycles of Well-Linked Sets II: an Elementary Bound for the Directed Grid Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2015, Kawarabayashi and Kreutzer proved the Directed Grid Theorem - the generalisation of the well-known Excluded Grid Theorem to directed graphs - confirming a conjecture by Reed, Johnson, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas from the mid-nineties. The theorem states that there is a function $f$ such that every digraph of directed treewidth $f(k)$ contains a cylindrical grid of order $k$ as a butterfly minor. However, the given function grows faster than any non-elementary function of the size of the grid minor. More precisely, it is larger than a power tower whose height depends on the size of the grid.
  In this paper, we present an alternative proof of the Directed Grid Theorem which is conceptually much simpler, more modular in composition and improves the upper bound for the function $f$ to a power tower of height $22$.
  A key concept of our proof is a new structure called cycles of well-linked sets (CWS). We show that any digraph of large directed treewidth contains a large CWS, which in turn contains a large cylindrical grid.</description>

      <title>The Balanced Up-Down Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov chains based on spanning trees have been hugely influential in algorithms for assessing fairness in political redistricting. The input graph represents the geographic building blocks of a jurisdiction. The goal is to output a large ensemble of random graph partitions, which is done by drawing and splitting random spanning trees. Crucially, these subtrees must be balanced, since political districts are required to have equal population. The Up-Down walk (on trees or forests) repeatedly adds a random edge then deletes a random edge to produce a new tree or forest; it can be used to efficiently generate a large ensemble, but the rejection rate to maintain balance grows exponentially with the number of parts. ReCom, the most widely-used class of Markov chains, circumvents this complexity barrier by merging and splitting pairs of districts at a time. This runs fast in practice but can have trouble exploring the state space.
  To overcome these efficiency and mixing barriers, we propose a new Markov chain called the Balanced Up-Down (BUD) walk. The main idea is to run the Up-Down walk on the space of trees, but require all steps to preserve the property that the tree is splittable into balanced subtrees. The BUD walk samples from a known invariant measure under exact balance. We prove that the BUD walk is irreducible in several cases, including a regime where ReCom is not irreducible. Running the BUD walk efficiently presents algorithmic challenges, especially when parts are allowed to deviate from their ideal size. A key subroutine is determining whether a tree is splittable into approximately-balanced subtrees. We give an improved analysis of an existing algorithm for this problem and prove that the associated counting problem is #P-complete. We empirically validate the usefulness of the BUD walk by comparing its performance to that of other existing methods for sampling partitions.</description>

      <title>Frankl's diversity theorem for permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1987, Frankl proved an influential stability result for the Erd\H os--Ko--Rado theorem, which bounds the size of an intersecting family in terms of its distance from the nearest (subset of) star or trivial intersecting family. It is a far-reaching extension of the Hilton--Milner theorem. In this paper, we prove its analogue for permutations on $\{1,\ldots, n\}$, provided $n$ is large. This provides a similar extension of a Hilton--Milner type result for permutations proved by Ellis.</description>

      <title>A short proof of the Patak-Tancer theorem on non-embeddability of $k$-complexes in $2k$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.14010v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2019 P. Patak and M. Tancer obtained the following higher-dimensional generalization of the Heawood inequality on embeddings of graphs into surfaces. We present a short well-structured proof accessible to non-specialists in the field. Let $\Delta_n^k$ be the union of $k$-dimensional faces of the $n$-dimensional simplex.
  Theorem. (a) If $\Delta_n^k$ PL embeds into the connected sum of $g$ copies of the Cartesian product $S^k\times S^k$ of two $k$-dimensional spheres, then $g\ge\dfrac{n-2k-1}{k+2}$.
  (b) If $\Delta_n^k$ PL embeds into a closed $(k-1)$-connected PL $2k$-manifold $M$, then $(-1)^k(\chi(M)-2)\ge\dfrac{n-2k-1}{k+1}$.</description>

      <title>A quasi-optimal upper bound for induced paths in sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2012, Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez proved that graphs of bounded degeneracy that have a path of order $n$ also have an induced path of order $\Omega(\log \log n)$. In this paper we give an almost matching upper bound by describing, for arbitrarily large values of $n$, 2-degenerate graphs that have a path of order $n$ and where the longest induced paths have order $O((\log \log n)^{1+o(1)})$.</description>

      <title>Refining the Complexity Landscape of Speed Scaling: Hardness and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of scheduling jobs on a single speed-scalable processor with the objective of capturing the trade-off between the (weighted) flow time and the energy consumption. This trade-off has been extensively explored in the literature through a number of problem formulations that differ in the specific job characteristics and the precise objective function. Nevertheless, the computational complexity of four important problem variants has remained unresolved and was explicitly identified as an open question in prior work. In this paper, we settle the complexity of these variants.
  More specifically, we prove that the problem of minimizing the objective of total (weighted) flow time plus energy is NP-hard for the cases of (i) unit-weight jobs with arbitrary sizes, and (ii)~arbitrary-weight jobs with unit sizes. These results extend to the objective of minimizing the total (weighted) flow time subject to an energy budget and hold even when the schedule is required to adhere to a given priority ordering.
  In contrast, we show that when a completion-time ordering is provided, the same problem variants become polynomial-time solvable. The latter result highlights the subtle differences between priority and completion orderings for the problem.</description>

      <title>Basis Number of Graphs Excluding Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The basis number of a graph $G$ is the minimum $k$ such that the cycle space of $G$ is generated by a family of cycles using each edge at most $k$ times. A classical result of Mac Lane states that planar graphs are exactly graphs with basis number at most 2, and more generally, graphs embedded on a fixed surface of bounded genus are known to have bounded basis number. Generalising this, we prove that graphs excluding a fixed minor $H$ have bounded basis number. Our proof uses the Graph Minor Structure Theorem, which requires us to understand how basis number behaves in tree-decompositions. In particular, we prove that graphs of treewidth $k$ have basis number bounded by some function of $k$. We handle tree-decompositions using the proof framework developed by Boja\'nczyk and Pilipczuk in their proof of Courcelle's conjecture. Combining our approach with independent results of Miraftab, Morin and Yuditsky (2025) on basis number and path-decompositions, one can moreover improve our upper bound to a polynomial one: there exists an absolute constant $c&gt;0$ such that every $H$-minor free graph has basis number $O(|H|^c)$.</description>
