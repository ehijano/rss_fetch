      <title>Exponentially Consistent Nonparametric Clustering of Data Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonparametric clustering of $M$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data streams generated from unknown distributions. The distributions of the $M$ data streams belong to $K$ underlying distribution clusters. Existing results on exponentially consistent nonparametric clustering algorithms, like single linkage-based (SLINK) clustering and $k$-medoids distribution clustering, assume that the maximum intra-cluster distance ($d_L$) is smaller than the minimum inter-cluster distance ($d_H$). First, in the fixed sample size (FSS) setting, we show that exponential consistency can be achieved for SLINK clustering under a less strict assumption, $d_I &lt; d_H$, where $d_I$ is the maximum distance between any two sub-clusters of a cluster that partition the cluster. Note that $d_I &lt; d_L$ in general. Our results show that SLINK is exponentially consistent for a larger class of problems than $k$-medoids distribution clustering. We also identify examples where $k$-medoids clustering is unable to find the true clusters, but SLINK is exponentially consistent. Then, we propose a sequential clustering algorithm, named SLINK-SEQ, based on SLINK and prove that it is also exponentially consistent. Simulation results show that the SLINK-SEQ algorithm requires fewer expected number of samples than the FSS SLINK algorithm for the same probability of error.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Neyman Regret for Adaptive Estimation of the Average Treatment Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimation of the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a core problem in causal inference with strong connections to Off-Policy Evaluation in Reinforcement Learning. This paper considers the problem of adaptively selecting the treatment allocation probability in order to improve estimation of the ATE. The majority of prior work on adaptive ATE estimation focus on asymptotic guarantees, and in turn overlooks important practical considerations such as the difficulty of learning the optimal treatment allocation as well as hyper-parameter selection. Existing non-asymptotic methods are limited by poor empirical performance and exponential scaling of the Neyman regret with respect to problem parameters. In order to address these gaps, we propose and analyze the Clipped Second Moment Tracking (ClipSMT) algorithm, a variant of an existing algorithm with strong asymptotic optimality guarantees, and provide finite sample bounds on its Neyman regret. Our analysis shows that ClipSMT achieves exponential improvements in Neyman regret on two fronts: improving the dependence on $T$ from $O(\sqrt{T})$ to $O(\log T)$, as well as reducing the exponential dependence on problem parameters to a polynomial dependence. Finally, we conclude with simulations which show the marked improvement of ClipSMT over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Indiscriminate Disruption of Conditional Inference on Multivariate Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multivariate Gaussian distribution underpins myriad operations-research, decision-analytic, and machine-learning models (e.g., Bayesian optimization, Gaussian influence diagrams, and variational autoencoders). However, despite recent advances in adversarial machine learning (AML), inference for Gaussian models in the presence of an adversary is notably understudied. Therefore, we consider a self-interested attacker who wishes to disrupt a decisionmaker's conditional inference and subsequent actions by corrupting a set of evidentiary variables. To avoid detection, the attacker also desires the attack to appear plausible wherein plausibility is determined by the density of the corrupted evidence. We consider white- and grey-box settings such that the attacker has complete and incomplete knowledge about the decisionmaker's underlying multivariate Gaussian distribution, respectively. Select instances are shown to reduce to quadratic and stochastic quadratic programs, and structural properties are derived to inform solution methods. We assess the impact and efficacy of these attacks in three examples, including, real estate evaluation, interest rate estimation and signals processing. Each example leverages an alternative underlying model, thereby highlighting the attacks' broad applicability. Through these applications, we also juxtapose the behavior of the white- and grey-box attacks to understand how uncertainty and structure affect attacker behavior.</description>

      <title>No Free Delivery Service: Epistemic limits of passive data collection in complex social systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid model validation via the train-test paradigm has been a key driver for the breathtaking progress in machine learning and AI. However, modern AI systems often depend on a combination of tasks and data collection practices that violate all assumptions ensuring test validity. Yet, without rigorous model validation we cannot ensure the intended outcomes of deployed AI systems, including positive social impact, nor continue to advance AI research in a scientifically sound way. In this paper, I will show that for widely considered inference settings in complex social systems the train-test paradigm does not only lack a justification but is indeed invalid for any risk estimator, including counterfactual and causal estimators, with high probability. These formal impossibility results highlight a fundamental epistemic issue, i.e., that for key tasks in modern AI we cannot know whether models are valid under current data collection practices. Importantly, this includes variants of both recommender systems and reasoning via large language models, and neither na\"ive scaling nor limited benchmarks are suited to address this issue. I am illustrating these results via the widely used MovieLens benchmark and conclude by discussing the implications of these results for AI in social systems, including possible remedies such as participatory data curation and open science.</description>

      <title>Investigating Graph Neural Networks and Classical Feature-Extraction Techniques in Activity-Cliff and Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular featurisation refers to the transformation of molecular data into numerical feature vectors. It is one of the key research areas in molecular machine learning and computational drug discovery. Recently, message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a novel method to learn differentiable features directly from molecular graphs. While such techniques hold great promise, further investigations are needed to clarify if and when they indeed manage to definitively outcompete classical molecular featurisations such as extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) and physicochemical-descriptor vectors (PDVs). We systematically explore and further develop classical and graph-based molecular featurisation methods for two important tasks: molecular property prediction, in particular, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) prediction, and the largely unexplored challenge of activity-cliff (AC) prediction. We first give a technical description and critical analysis of PDVs, ECFPs and message-passing GNNs, with a focus on graph isomorphism networks (GINs). We then conduct a rigorous computational study to compare the performance of PDVs, ECFPs and GINs for QSAR and AC-prediction. Following this, we mathematically describe and computationally evaluate a novel twin neural network model for AC-prediction. We further introduce an operation called substructure pooling for the vectorisation of structural fingerprints as a natural counterpart to graph pooling in GNN architectures. We go on to propose Sort &amp; Slice, a simple substructure-pooling technique for ECFPs that robustly outperforms hash-based folding at molecular property prediction. Finally, we outline two ideas for future research: (i) a graph-based self-supervised learning strategy to make classical molecular featurisations trainable, and (ii) trainable substructure-pooling via differentiable self-attention.</description>

      <title>Almost Sure Convergence Rates and Concentration of Stochastic Approximation and Reinforcement Learning with Markovian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes the first almost sure convergence rate and the first maximal concentration bound with exponential tails for general contractive stochastic approximation algorithms with Markovian noise. As a corollary, we also obtain convergence rates in $L^p$. Key to our successes is a novel discretization of the mean ODE of stochastic approximation algorithms using intervals with diminishing (instead of constant) length. As applications, we provide the first almost sure convergence rate for $Q$-learning with Markovian samples without count-based learning rates. We also provide the first concentration bound for off-policy temporal difference learning with Markovian samples.</description>

      <title>On Generalization Bounds for Neural Networks with Low Rank Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While previous optimization results have suggested that deep neural networks tend to favour low-rank weight matrices, the implications of this inductive bias on generalization bounds remain underexplored. In this paper, we apply Maurer's chain rule for Gaussian complexity to analyze how low-rank layers in deep networks can prevent the accumulation of rank and dimensionality factors that typically multiply across layers. This approach yields generalization bounds for rank and spectral norm constrained networks. We compare our results to prior generalization bounds for deep networks, highlighting how deep networks with low-rank layers can achieve better generalization than those with full-rank layers. Additionally, we discuss how this framework provides new perspectives on the generalization capabilities of deep networks exhibiting neural collapse.</description>

      <title>Active Subsampling for Measurement-Constrained M-Estimation of Individualized Thresholds with High-Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the measurement-constrained problems, despite the availability of large datasets, we may be only affordable to observe the labels on a small portion of the large dataset. This poses a critical question that which data points are most beneficial to label given a budget constraint. In this paper, we focus on the estimation of the optimal individualized threshold in a measurement-constrained M-estimation framework. Our goal is to estimate a high-dimensional parameter $\theta$ in a linear threshold $\theta^T Z$ for a continuous variable $X$ such that the discrepancy between whether $X$ exceeds the threshold $\theta^T Z$ and a binary outcome $Y$ is minimized. We propose a novel $K$-step active subsampling algorithm to estimate $\theta$, which iteratively samples the most informative observations and solves a regularized M-estimator. The theoretical properties of our estimator demonstrate a phase transition phenomenon with respect to $\beta\geq 1$, the smoothness of the conditional density of $X$ given $Y$ and $Z$. For $\beta&gt;(1+\sqrt{3})/2$, we show that the two-step algorithm yields an estimator with the parametric convergence rate $O_p((s \log d /N)^{1/2})$ in $l_2$ norm. The rate of our estimator is strictly faster than the minimax optimal rate with $N$ i.i.d. samples drawn from the population. For the other two scenarios $1&lt;\beta\leq (1+\sqrt{3})/2$ and $\beta=1$, the estimator from the two-step algorithm is sub-optimal. The former requires to run $K&gt;2$ steps to attain the same parametric rate, whereas in the latter case only a near parametric rate can be obtained. Furthermore, we formulate a minimax framework for the measurement-constrained M-estimation problem and prove that our estimator is minimax rate optimal up to a logarithmic factor. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our method in simulation studies and apply the method to analyze a large diabetes dataset.</description>

      <title>Heterophilic Graph Neural Networks Optimization with Causal Message-passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we discover that causal inference provides a promising approach to capture heterophilic message-passing in Graph Neural Network (GNN). By leveraging cause-effect analysis, we can discern heterophilic edges based on asymmetric node dependency. The learned causal structure offers more accurate relationships among nodes. To reduce the computational complexity, we introduce intervention-based causal inference in graph learning. We first simplify causal analysis on graphs by formulating it as a structural learning model and define the optimization problem within the Bayesian scheme. We then present an analysis of decomposing the optimization target into a consistency penalty and a structure modification based on cause-effect relations. We then estimate this target by conditional entropy and present insights into how conditional entropy quantifies the heterophily. Accordingly, we propose CausalMP, a causal message-passing discovery network for heterophilic graph learning, that iteratively learns the explicit causal structure of input graphs. We conduct extensive experiments in both heterophilic and homophilic graph settings. The result demonstrates that the our model achieves superior link prediction performance. Training on causal structure can also enhance node representation in classification task across different base models.</description>

      <title>Robust Detection of Watermarks for Large Language Models Under Human Edits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Watermarking has offered an effective approach to distinguishing text generated by large language models (LLMs) from human-written text. However, the pervasive presence of human edits on LLM-generated text dilutes watermark signals, thereby significantly degrading detection performance of existing methods. In this paper, by modeling human edits through mixture model detection, we introduce a new method in the form of a truncated goodness-of-fit test for detecting watermarked text under human edits, which we refer to as Tr-GoF. We prove that the Tr-GoF test achieves optimality in robust detection of the Gumbel-max watermark in a certain asymptotic regime of substantial text modifications and vanishing watermark signals. Importantly, Tr-GoF achieves this optimality \textit{adaptively} as it does not require precise knowledge of human edit levels or probabilistic specifications of the LLMs, in contrast to the optimal but impractical (Neyman--Pearson) likelihood ratio test. Moreover, we establish that the Tr-GoF test attains the highest detection efficiency rate in a certain regime of moderate text modifications. In stark contrast, we show that sum-based detection rules, as employed by existing methods, fail to achieve optimal robustness in both regimes because the additive nature of their statistics is less resilient to edit-induced noise. Finally, we demonstrate the competitive and sometimes superior empirical performance of the Tr-GoF test on both synthetic data and open-source LLMs in the OPT and LLaMA families.</description>

      <title>A cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff metric approach for quantifying molecular similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce, for the first time, a cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric method to analyze 1-dimensional and higher-dimensional (co)homology groups, focusing on loops, voids, and higher-dimensional cavity structures in simplicial complexes, to address typical clustering questions arising in molecular data analysis. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance quantifies the dissimilarity between two metric spaces. In this framework, molecules are represented as simplicial complexes, and their cohomology vector spaces are computed to capture intrinsic topological invariants encoding loop and cavity structures. These vector spaces are equipped with a suitable distance measure, enabling the computation of the Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric to evaluate structural dissimilarities. We demonstrate the methodology using organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) structures. The results highlight the effectiveness of this approach in clustering various molecular structures. By incorporating geometric information, our method provides deeper insights compared to traditional persistent homology techniques.</description>

      <title>Generative Intervention Models for Causal Perturbation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of predicting perturbation effects via causal models. In many applications, it is a priori unknown which mechanisms of a system are modified by an external perturbation, even though the features of the perturbation are available. For example, in genomics, some properties of a drug may be known, but not their causal effects on the regulatory pathways of cells. We propose a generative intervention model (GIM) that learns to map these perturbation features to distributions over atomic interventions in a jointly-estimated causal model. Contrary to prior approaches, this enables us to predict the distribution shifts of unseen perturbation features while gaining insights about their mechanistic effects in the underlying data-generating process. On synthetic data and scRNA-seq drug perturbation data, GIMs achieve robust out-of-distribution predictions on par with unstructured approaches, while effectively inferring the underlying perturbation mechanisms, often better than other causal inference methods.</description>

      <title>SPARKLE: A Unified Single-Loop Primal-Dual Framework for Decentralized Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies decentralized bilevel optimization, in which multiple agents collaborate to solve problems involving nested optimization structures with neighborhood communications. Most existing literature primarily utilizes gradient tracking to mitigate the influence of data heterogeneity, without exploring other well-known heterogeneity-correction techniques such as EXTRA or Exact Diffusion. Additionally, these studies often employ identical decentralized strategies for both upper- and lower-level problems, neglecting to leverage distinct mechanisms across different levels. To address these limitations, this paper proposes SPARKLE, a unified Single-loop Primal-dual AlgoRithm frameworK for decentraLized bilEvel optimization. SPARKLE offers the flexibility to incorporate various heterogeneitycorrection strategies into the algorithm. Moreover, SPARKLE allows for different strategies to solve upper- and lower-level problems. We present a unified convergence analysis for SPARKLE, applicable to all its variants, with state-of-the-art convergence rates compared to existing decentralized bilevel algorithms. Our results further reveal that EXTRA and Exact Diffusion are more suitable for decentralized bilevel optimization, and using mixed strategies in bilevel algorithms brings more benefits than relying solely on gradient tracking.</description>

Abstract: Weight sharing, equivariance, and local filters, as in convolutional neural networks, are believed to contribute to the sample efficiency of neural networks. However, it is not clear how each one of these design choices contribute to the generalization error. Through the lens of statistical learning theory, we aim to provide an insight into this question by characterizing the relative impact of each choice on the sample complexity. We obtain lower and upper sample complexity bounds for a class of single hidden layer networks. It is shown that the gain of equivariance is directly manifested in the bound, while getting a similar increase for weight sharing depends on the sharing mechanism. Among our results, we obtain a completely dimension-free bound for equivariant networks for a class of pooling operations. We show that the bound depends merely on the norm of filters, which is tighter than using the spectral norm of the respective matrix. We also characterize the trade-off in sample complexity between the parametrization of filters in spatial and frequency domains, particularly when spatial filters are localized as in vanilla convolutional neural networks.</description>

      <title>Outlier-robust Mean Estimation near the Breakdown Point via Sum-of-Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of estimating the mean of a high-dimensional distribution in the presence of an $\varepsilon$-fraction of adversarial outliers.
  When $\varepsilon$ is at most some sufficiently small constant, previous works can achieve optimal error rate efficiently \cite{diakonikolas2018robustly, kothari2018robust}. As $\varepsilon$ approaches the breakdown point $\frac{1}{2}$, all previous algorithms incur either sub-optimal error rates or exponential running time.
  In this paper we give a new analysis of the canonical sum-of-squares program introduced in \cite{kothari2018robust} and show that this program efficiently achieves optimal error rate for all $\varepsilon \in[0,\frac{1}{2})$. The key ingredient for our results is a new identifiability proof for robust mean estimation that focuses on the overlap between the distributions instead of their statistical distance as in previous works. We capture this proof within the sum-of-squares proof system, thus obtaining efficient algorithms using the sum-of-squares proofs to algorithms paradigm \cite{raghavendra2018high}.</description>

      <title>On the Use of Relative Validity Indices for Comparing Clustering Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relative Validity Indices (RVIs) such as the Silhouette Width Criterion and Davies Bouldin indices are the most widely used tools for evaluating and optimising clustering outcomes. Traditionally, their ability to rank collections of candidate dataset partitions has been used to guide the selection of the number of clusters, and to compare partitions from different clustering algorithms. However, there is a growing trend in the literature to use RVIs when selecting a Similarity Paradigm (SP) for clustering - the combination of normalisation procedure, representation method, and distance measure which affects the computation of object dissimilarities used in clustering. Despite the growing prevalence of this practice, there has been no empirical or theoretical investigation into the suitability of RVIs for this purpose. Moreover, since RVIs are computed using object dissimilarities, it remains unclear how they would need to be implemented for fair comparisons of different SPs. This study presents the first comprehensive investigation into the reliability of RVIs for SP selection. We conducted extensive experiments with seven popular RVIs on over 2.7 million clustering partitions of synthetic and real-world datasets, encompassing feature-vector and time-series data. We identified fundamental conceptual limitations undermining the use of RVIs for SP selection, and our empirical findings confirmed this predicted unsuitability. Among our recommendations, we suggest instead that practitioners select SPs by using external validation on high quality labelled datasets or carefully designed outcome-oriented objective criteria, both of which should be informed by careful consideration of dataset characteristics, and domain requirements. Our findings have important implications for clustering methodology and evaluation, suggesting the need for more rigorous approaches to SP selection.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Guided Active Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new framework for active experimentation, the Prediction-Guided Active Experiment (PGAE), which leverages predictions from an existing machine learning model to guide sampling and experimentation. Specifically, at each time step, an experimental unit is sampled according to a designated sampling distribution, and the actual outcome is observed based on an experimental probability. Otherwise, only a prediction for the outcome is available. We begin by analyzing the non-adaptive case, where full information on the joint distribution of the predictor and the actual outcome is assumed. For this scenario, we derive an optimal experimentation strategy by minimizing the semi-parametric efficiency bound for the class of regular estimators. We then introduce an estimator that meets this efficiency bound, achieving asymptotic optimality. Next, we move to the adaptive case, where the predictor is continuously updated with newly sampled data. We show that the adaptive version of the estimator remains efficient and attains the same semi-parametric bound under certain regularity assumptions. Finally, we validate PGAE's performance through simulations and a semi-synthetic experiment using data from the US Census Bureau. The results underscore the PGAE framework's effectiveness and superiority compared to other existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.08591v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in data collecting technologies in genomics have significantly increased the need for tools designed to study the genetic basis of many diseases. Statistical tools used to discover patterns between the expression of certain genes and the presence of diseases should ideally perform well in terms of both prediction accuracy and identification of key biomarkers. We propose a new approach for dealing with high-dimensional binary classification problems that combines ideas from regularization and ensembling. The ensembles are comprised of a relatively small number of highly accurate and interpretable models that are learned directly from the data by minimizing a global objective function. We derive the asymptotic properties of our method and develop an efficient algorithm to compute the ensembles. We demonstrate the good performance of our method in terms of prediction accuracy and identification of key biomarkers using several medical genomics datasets involving common diseases such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. In several applications our method could identify key biomarkers that were absent in state-of-the-art competitor methods. We develop a variable importance ranking tool that may guide the focus of researchers on the most promising genes. Based on numerical experiments we provide guidelines for the choice of the number of models in our ensembles.</description>

      <title>Variational Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.01694v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational approximations to Gaussian processes (GPs) typically use a small set of inducing points to form a low-rank approximation to the covariance matrix. In this work, we instead exploit a sparse approximation of the precision matrix. We propose variational nearest neighbor Gaussian process (VNNGP), which introduces a prior that only retains correlations within $K$ nearest-neighboring observations, thereby inducing sparse precision structure. Using the variational framework, VNNGP's objective can be factorized over both observations and inducing points, enabling stochastic optimization with a time complexity of $O(K^3)$. Hence, we can arbitrarily scale the inducing point size, even to the point of putting inducing points at every observed location. We compare VNNGP to other scalable GPs through various experiments, and demonstrate that VNNGP (1) can dramatically outperform low-rank methods, and (2) is less prone to overfitting than other nearest neighbor methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization (MOO) aims to optimize multiple, possibly conflicting objectives with widespread applications. We introduce a novel interacting particle method for MOO inspired by molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach combines overdamped Langevin and birth-death dynamics, incorporating a "dominance potential" to steer particles toward global Pareto optimality. In contrast to previous methods, our method is able to relocate dominated particles, making it particularly adept at managing Pareto fronts of complicated geometries. Our method is also theoretically grounded as a Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flow with convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

Abstract: We present a new random walk for uniformly sampling high-dimensional convex bodies. It achieves state-of-the-art runtime complexity with stronger guarantees on the output than previously known, namely in R\'enyi divergence (which implies TV, $\mathcal{W}_2$, KL, $\chi^2$). The proof departs from known approaches for polytime algorithms for the problem -- we utilize a stochastic diffusion perspective to show contraction to the target distribution with the rate of convergence determined by functional isoperimetric constants of the stationary density.</description>

      <title>Graph Knowledge Distillation to Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In terms of accuracy, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the best architectural choice for the node classification task. Their drawback in real-world deployment is the latency that emerges from the neighbourhood processing operation. One solution to the latency issue is to perform knowledge distillation from a trained GNN to a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), where the MLP processes only the features of the node being classified (and possibly some pre-computed structural information). However, the performance of such MLPs in both transductive and inductive settings remains inconsistent for existing knowledge distillation techniques. We propose to address the performance concerns by using a specially-designed student model instead of an MLP. Our model, named Routing-by-Memory (RbM), is a form of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), with a design that enforces expert specialization. By encouraging each expert to specialize on a certain region on the hidden representation space, we demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to derive considerably more consistent performance across multiple datasets.

      <title>Truthfulness of Calibration Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the truthfulness of calibration measures in sequential prediction. A calibration measure is said to be truthful if the forecaster (approximately) minimizes the expected penalty by predicting the conditional expectation of the next outcome, given the prior distribution of outcomes. Truthfulness is an important property of calibration measures, ensuring that the forecaster is not incentivized to exploit the system with deliberate poor forecasts. This makes it an essential desideratum for calibration measures, alongside typical requirements, such as soundness and completeness.
  We conduct a taxonomy of existing calibration measures and their truthfulness. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that all of them are far from being truthful. That is, under existing calibration measures, there are simple distributions on which a polylogarithmic (or even zero) penalty is achievable, while truthful prediction leads to a polynomial penalty. Our main contribution is the introduction of a new calibration measure termed the Subsampled Smooth Calibration Error (SSCE) under which truthful prediction is optimal up to a constant multiplicative factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise asymptotics have revealed many surprises in high-dimensional regression. These advances, however, have not extended to perhaps the simplest estimator: direct Nadaraya-Watson (NW) kernel smoothing. Here, we describe how one can use ideas from the analysis of the random energy model (REM) in statistical physics to compute sharp asymptotics for the NW estimator when the sample size is exponential in the dimension. As a simple starting point for investigation, we focus on the case in which one aims to estimate a single-index target function using a radial basis function kernel on the sphere. Our main result is a pointwise asymptotic for the NW predictor, showing that it re-scales the argument of the true link function. Our work provides a first step towards a detailed understanding of kernel smoothing in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multitask Learning Using Gradient-based Estimation of Task Affinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multitask learning is a widely used paradigm for training models on diverse tasks, with applications ranging from graph neural networks to language model fine-tuning. Since tasks may interfere with each other, a key notion for modeling their relationships is task affinity. This includes pairwise task affinity, computed among pairs of tasks, and higher-order affinity, computed among subsets of tasks. Naively computing either of them requires repeatedly training on data from various task combinations, which is computationally intensive. We present a new algorithm Grad-TAG that can estimate task affinities without this repeated training.
  The key idea of Grad-TAG is to train a "base" model for all tasks and then use a linearization technique to estimate the loss of the model for a specific task combination. The linearization works by computing a gradient-based approximation of the loss, using low-dimensional projections of gradients as features in a logistic regression to predict labels for the task combination. We show that the linearized model can provably approximate the loss when the gradient-based approximation is accurate, and also empirically verify that on several large models. Then, given the estimated task affinity, we design a semi-definite program for clustering similar tasks by maximizing the average density of clusters.
  We evaluate Grad-TAG's performance across seven datasets, including multi-label classification on graphs, and instruction fine-tuning of language models. Our task affinity estimates are within 2.7% distance to the true affinities while needing only 3% of FLOPs in full training. On our largest graph with 21M edges and 500 labeling tasks, our algorithm delivers estimates within 5% distance to the true affinities, using only 112 GPU hours. Our results show that Grad-TAG achieves excellent performance and runtime tradeoffs compared to existing approaches.</description>

Abstract: We study how representation learning can improve the learning efficiency of contextual bandit problems. We study the setting where we play T contextual linear bandits with dimension d simultaneously, and these T bandit tasks collectively share a common linear representation with a dimensionality of r much smaller than d. We present a new algorithm based on alternating projected gradient descent (GD) and minimization estimator to recover a low-rank feature matrix. Using the proposed estimator, we present a multi-task learning algorithm for linear contextual bandits and prove the regret bound of our algorithm. We presented experiments and compared the performance of our algorithm against benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13714v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study generation through the lens of statistical learning theory. First, we abstract and formalize the results of Gold [1967], Angluin [1979], Angluin [1980] and Kleinberg and Mullainathan [2024] in terms of a binary hypothesis class defined over an abstract example space. Then, we extend the notion of "generation" from Kleinberg and Mullainathan [2024] to two new settings, we call "uniform" and "non-uniform" generation, and provide a characterization of which hypothesis classes are uniformly and non-uniformly generatable. As is standard in learning theory, our characterizations are in terms of the finiteness of a new combinatorial dimension termed the Closure dimension. By doing so, we are able to compare generatability with predictability (captured via PAC and online learnability) and show that these two properties of hypothesis classes are incompatible -- there are classes that are generatable but not predictable and vice versa. Finally, we extend our results to capture prompted generation and give a complete characterization of which classes are prompt generatable, generalizing some of the work by Kleinberg and Mullainathan [2024].</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Inference of Marginalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian reasoning in linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) is challenging and often requires advanced sampling techniques like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). A common approach is to write the model in a probabilistic programming language and then sample via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). However, there are many ways a user can transform a model that make inference more or less efficient. In particular, marginalizing some variables can greatly improve inference but is difficult for users to do manually. We develop an algorithm to easily marginalize random effects in LMMs. A naive approach introduces cubic time operations within an inference algorithm like HMC, but we reduce the running time to linear using fast linear algebra techniques. We show that marginalization is always beneficial when applicable and highlight improvements in various models, especially ones from cognitive sciences.</description>

Abstract: Adam is one of the most popular optimization algorithms in deep learning. However, it is known that Adam does not converge in theory unless choosing a hyperparameter, i.e., $\beta_2$, in a problem-dependent manner. There have been many attempts to fix the non-convergence (e.g., AMSGrad), but they require an impractical assumption that the gradient noise is uniformly bounded. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive gradient method named ADOPT, which achieves the optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O} ( 1 / \sqrt{T} )$ with any choice of $\beta_2$ without depending on the bounded noise assumption. ADOPT addresses the non-convergence issue of Adam by removing the current gradient from the second moment estimate and changing the order of the momentum update and the normalization by the second moment estimate. We also conduct intensive numerical experiments, and verify that our ADOPT achieves superior results compared to Adam and its variants across a wide range of tasks, including image classification, generative modeling, natural language processing, and deep reinforcement learning.

      <title>Learning multivariate Gaussians with imperfect advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of distribution learning within the framework of learning-augmented algorithms. In this setting, we explore the scenario where a probability distribution is provided as potentially inaccurate advice on the true, unknown distribution. Our objective is to develop learning algorithms whose sample complexity decreases as the quality of the advice improves, thereby surpassing standard learning lower bounds when the advice is sufficiently accurate.
  Specifically, we demonstrate that this outcome is achievable for the problem of learning a multivariate Gaussian distribution $N(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})$ in the PAC learning setting. Classically, in the advice-free setting, $\tilde{\Theta}(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$ samples are sufficient and worst case necessary to learn $d$-dimensional Gaussians up to TV distance $\varepsilon$ with constant probability. When we are additionally given a parameter $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}$ as advice, we show that $\tilde{O}(d^{2-\beta}/\varepsilon^2)$ samples suffices whenever $\| \tilde{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}^{-1/2} \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \tilde{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}^{-1/2} - \boldsymbol{I_d} \|_1 \leq \varepsilon d^{1-\beta}$ (where $\|\cdot\|_1$ denotes the entrywise $\ell_1$ norm) for any $\beta &gt; 0$, yielding a polynomial improvement over the advice-free setting.</description>

      <title>Integration of Active Learning and MCMC Sampling for Efficient Bayesian Calibration of Mechanical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and surrogate modelling have significantly enhanced the feasibility of Bayesian analysis across engineering fields. However, the selection and integration of surrogate models and cutting-edge MCMC algorithms, often depend on ad-hoc decisions. A systematic assessment of their combined influence on analytical accuracy and efficiency is notably lacking. The present work offers a comprehensive comparative study, employing a scalable case study in computational mechanics focused on the inference of spatially varying material parameters, that sheds light on the impact of methodological choices for surrogate modelling and sampling. We show that a priori training of the surrogate model introduces large errors in the posterior estimation even in low to moderate dimensions. We introduce a simple active learning strategy based on the path of the MCMC algorithm that is superior to all a priori trained models, and determine its training data requirements. We demonstrate that the choice of the MCMC algorithm has only a small influence on the amount of training data but no significant influence on the accuracy of the resulting surrogate model. Further, we show that the accuracy of the posterior estimation largely depends on the surrogate model, but not even a tailored surrogate guarantees convergence of the MCMC.Finally, we identify the forward model as the bottleneck in the inference process, not the MCMC algorithm. While related works focus on employing advanced MCMC algorithms, we demonstrate that the training data requirements render the surrogate modelling approach infeasible before the benefits of these gradient-based MCMC algorithms on cheap models can be reaped.</description>
