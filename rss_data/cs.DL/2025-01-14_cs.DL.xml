      <title>OpenAlex2Pajek -- an R Package for converting OpenAlex bibliographic data into Pajek networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For analysis of bibliographic data, we can obtain from bibliographic databases the corresponding collection of bibliographic networks. Recently OpenAlex, a new open-access bibliographic database, became available. We present OpenAlex2Pajek, an R package for converting OpenAlex data into a collection of Pajek's networks. For an illustration, we created a temporal weighted network describing the co-authorship between world countries for years from 1990 to 2023. We present some analyses of this network.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Temporal Trends in 19th Century Literature: An Information Retrieval Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In English literature, the 19th century witnessed a significant transition in styles, themes, and genres. Consequently, the novels from this period display remarkable diversity. This paper explores these variations by examining the evolution of term usage in 19th century English novels through the lens of information retrieval. By applying a query expansion-based approach to a decade-segmented collection of fiction from the British Library, we examine how related terms vary over time. Our analysis employs multiple standard metrics including Kendall's tau, Jaccard similarity, and Jensen-Shannon divergence to assess overlaps and shifts in expanded query term sets. Our results indicate a significant degree of divergence in the related terms across decades as selected by the query expansion technique, suggesting substantial linguistic and conceptual changes throughout the 19th century novels.</description>

      <title>Leveraging the Global Research Infrastructure to Characterize the Impact of National Science Foundation Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Global Research infrastructure (GRI) is made up of the repositories and organizations that provide persistent identifiers (PIDs) and metadata for many kinds of research objects and connect these objects to funders, research institutions, researchers, and one another using PIDs. The INFORMATE Project has combined three data sources to focus on understanding how the global research infrastructure might help the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and other federal agencies identify and characterize the impact of their support. In this paper we present INFORMATE observations of three data systems. The NSF Award database represents NSF funding while the NSF Public Access Repository (PAR) and CHORUS, as a proxy for the GRI, represent two different view of results of that funding. We compare the first at the level of awards and the second two at the level of published research articles. Our findings demonstrate that CHORUS datasets include significantly more NSF awards and more related papers than does PAR. Our findings also suggest that time plays a significant role in the inclusion of award metadata across the sources analyzed. Data in those sources travel very different journeys, each presenting different obstacles to metadata completeness and suggesting necessary actions on the parts of authors and publishers to ensure that publication and funding metadata are captured. We discuss these actions, as well as implications our findings have for emergent technologies such as artificial intelligence and natural language processing.</description>

      <title>Transforming Role Classification in Scientific Teams Using LLMs and Advanced Predictive Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific team dynamics are critical in determining the nature and impact of research outputs. However, existing methods for classifying author roles based on self-reports and clustering lack comprehensive contextual analysis of contributions. Thus, we present a transformative approach to classifying author roles in scientific teams using advanced large language models (LLMs), which offers a more refined analysis compared to traditional clustering methods. Specifically, we seek to complement and enhance these traditional methods by utilizing open source and proprietary LLMs, such as GPT-4, Llama3 70B, Llama2 70B, and Mistral 7x8B, for role classification. Utilizing few-shot prompting, we categorize author roles and demonstrate that GPT-4 outperforms other models across multiple categories, surpassing traditional approaches such as XGBoost and BERT. Our methodology also includes building a predictive deep learning model using 10 features. By training this model on a dataset derived from the OpenAlex database, which provides detailed metadata on academic publications -- such as author-publication history, author affiliation, research topics, and citation counts -- we achieve an F1 score of 0.76, demonstrating robust classification of author roles.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Spoken Italian Datasets and Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spoken language datasets are vital for advancing linguistic research, Natural Language Processing, and speech technology. However, resources dedicated to Italian, a linguistically rich and diverse Romance language, remain underexplored compared to major languages like English or Mandarin. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of 66 spoken Italian datasets, highlighting their characteristics, methodologies, and applications. The datasets are categorized by speech type, source and context, and demographic and linguistic features, with a focus on their utility in fields such as Automatic Speech Recognition, emotion detection, and education. Challenges related to dataset scarcity, representativeness, and accessibility are discussed alongside recommendations for enhancing dataset creation and utilization. The full dataset inventory is publicly accessible via GitHub and archived on Zenodo, serving as a valuable resource for researchers and developers. By addressing current gaps and proposing future directions, this work aims to support the advancement of Italian speech technologies and linguistic research.</description>

      <title>Sanidha: A Studio Quality Multi-Modal Dataset for Carnatic Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music source separation demixes a piece of music into its individual sound sources (vocals, percussion, melodic instruments, etc.), a task with no simple mathematical solution. It requires deep learning methods involving training on large datasets of isolated music stems. The most commonly available datasets are made from commercial Western music, limiting the models' applications to non-Western genres like Carnatic music. Carnatic music is a live tradition, with the available multi-track recordings containing overlapping sounds and bleeds between the sources. This poses a challenge to commercially available source separation models like Spleeter and Hybrid Demucs. In this work, we introduce 'Sanidha', the first open-source novel dataset for Carnatic music, offering studio-quality, multi-track recordings with minimal to no overlap or bleed. Along with the audio files, we provide high-definition videos of the artists' performances. Additionally, we fine-tuned Spleeter, one of the most commonly used source separation models, on our dataset and observed improved SDR performance compared to fine-tuning on a pre-existing Carnatic multi-track dataset. The outputs of the fine-tuned model with 'Sanidha' are evaluated through a listening study.</description>

      <title>Semantic Information Management in Low-Temperature Plasma Science and Technology with VIVO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital research data management is increasingly integrated across universities and research institutions, addressing the handling of research data throughout its lifecycle according to the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). Recent emphasis on the semantic and interlinking aspects of research data, e.g., by using ontologies and knowledge graphs further enhances findability and reusability. This work presents a framework for creating and maintaining a knowledge graph specifically for low-temperature plasma (LTP) science and technology. The framework leverages a domain-specific ontology called Plasma-O, along with the VIVO software as a platform for semantic information management in LTP research. While some research fields are already prepared to use ontologies and knowledge graphs for information management, their application in LTP research is nascent. This work aims to bridge this gap by providing a framework that not only improves research data management but also fosters community participation in building the domain-specific ontology and knowledge graph based on the published materials. The results may also support other research fields in the practical use of knowledge graphs for semantic information management.</description>
