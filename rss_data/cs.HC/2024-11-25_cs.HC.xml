      <title>Brain-Computer Interfaces for Emotional Regulation in Patients with Various Disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurological and Physiological Disorders that impact emotional regulation each have their own unique characteristics which are important to understand in order to create a generalized solution to all of them. The purpose of this experiment is to explore the potential applications of EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in enhancing emotional regulation for individuals with neurological and physiological disorders. The research focuses on the development of a novel neural network algorithm for understanding EEG data, with a particular emphasis on recognizing and regulating emotional states. The procedure involves the collection of EEG-based emotion data from open-Neuro. Using novel data modification techniques, information from the dataset can be altered to create a dataset that has neural patterns of patients with disorders whilst showing emotional change. The data analysis reveals promising results, as the algorithm is able to successfully classify emotional states with a high degree of accuracy. This suggests that EEG-based BCIs have the potential to be a valuable tool in aiding individuals with a range of neurological and physiological disorders in recognizing and regulating their emotions. To improve upon this work, data collection on patients with neurological disorders should be done to improve overall sample diversity.</description>

      <title>Purrfessor: A Fine-tuned Multimodal LLaVA Diet Health Chatbot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces Purrfessor, an innovative AI chatbot designed to provide personalized dietary guidance through interactive, multimodal engagement. Leveraging the Large Language-and-Vision Assistant (LLaVA) model fine-tuned with food and nutrition data and a human-in-the-loop approach, Purrfessor integrates visual meal analysis with contextual advice to enhance user experience and engagement. We conducted two studies to evaluate the chatbot's performance and user experience: (a) simulation assessments and human validation were conducted to examine the performance of the fine-tuned model; (b) a 2 (Profile: Bot vs. Pet) by 3 (Model: GPT-4 vs. LLaVA vs. Fine-tuned LLaVA) experiment revealed that Purrfessor significantly enhanced users' perceptions of care ($\beta = 1.59$, $p = 0.04$) and interest ($\beta = 2.26$, $p = 0.01$) compared to the GPT-4 bot. Additionally, user interviews highlighted the importance of interaction design details, emphasizing the need for responsiveness, personalization, and guidance to improve user engagement.</description>

      <title>The CTSkills App -- Measuring Problem Decomposition Skills of Students in Computational Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the incorporation of problem decomposition skills as an important component of computational thinking (CT) in K-12 computer science (CS) education. Despite the growing integration of CS in schools, there is a lack of consensus on the precise definition of CT in general and decomposition in particular. While decomposition is commonly referred to as the starting point of (computational) problem-solving, algorithmic solution formulation often receives more attention in the classroom, while decomposition remains rather unexplored. This study presents "CTSKills", a web-based skill assessment tool developed to measure students' problem decomposition skills. With the data collected from 75 students in grades 4-9, this research aims to contribute to a baseline of students' decomposition proficiency in compulsory education. Furthermore, a thorough understanding of a given problem is becoming increasingly important with the advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools that can effectively support the process of formulating algorithms. This study highlights the importance of problem decomposition as a key skill in K-12 CS education to foster more adept problem solvers.</description>

      <title>Somesite I Used To Crawl: Awareness, Agency and Efficacy in Protecting Content Creators From AI Crawlers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of generative AI relies heavily on training on data scraped through extensive crawling of the Internet, a practice that has raised significant copyright, privacy, and ethical concerns. While few measures are designed to resist a resource-rich adversary determined to scrape a site, crawlers can be impacted by a range of existing tools such as robots.txt, NoAI meta tags, and active crawler blocking by reverse proxies.
  In this work, we seek to understand the ability and efficacy of today's networking tools to protect content creators against AI-related crawling. For targeted populations like human artists, do they have the technical knowledge and agency to utilize crawler-blocking tools such as robots.txt, and can such tools be effective? Using large scale measurements and a targeted user study of 182 professional artists, we find strong demand for tools like robots.txt, but significantly constrained by significant hurdles in technical awareness, agency in deploying them, and limited efficacy against unresponsive crawlers. We further test and evaluate network level crawler blockers by reverse-proxies, and find that despite very limited deployment today, their reliable and comprehensive blocking of AI-crawlers make them the strongest protection for artists moving forward.</description>

      <title>Transforming Engineering Education Using Generative AI and Digital Twin Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twin technology, traditionally used in industry, is increasingly recognized for its potential to enhance educational experiences. This study investigates the application of industrial digital twins (DTs) in education, focusing on how DT models of varying fidelity can support different stages of Bloom's taxonomy in the cognitive domain. We align Bloom's six cognitive stages with educational levels: undergraduate studies for "Remember" and "Understand," master's level for "Apply" and "Analyze," and doctoral level for "Evaluate" and "Create." Low-fidelity DTs aid essential knowledge acquisition and skill training, providing a low-risk environment for grasping fundamental concepts. Medium-fidelity DTs offer more detailed and dynamic simulations, enhancing application skills and problem-solving. High-fidelity DTs support advanced learners by replicating physical phenomena, allowing for innovative design and complex experiments. Within this framework, large language models (LLMs) serve as mentors, assessing progress, filling knowledge gaps, and assisting with DT interactions, parameter setting, and debugging. We evaluate the educational impact using the Kirkpatrick Model, examining how each DT model's fidelity influences learning outcomes. This framework helps educators make informed decisions on integrating DTs and LLMs to meet specific learning objectives.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Policy and Governance Considerations for Health Security in Southeast Asia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Southeast Asia is a geopolitically and socio-economically significant region with unique challenges and opportunities. Intensifying progress in generative AI against a backdrop of existing health security threats makes applications of AI to mitigate such threats attractive but also risky if done without due caution. This paper provides a brief sketch of some of the applications of AI for health security and the regional policy and governance landscape. I focus on policy and governance activities of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), an international body whose member states represent 691 million people. I conclude by identifying sustainability as an area of opportunity for policymakers and recommend priority areas for generative AI researchers to make the most impact with their work.</description>

      <title>Mediating Modes of Thought: LLM's for design scripting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here is an updated version of your abstract, cleaned for submission to arXiv with potential "bad characters" corrected to conform to ASCII standards:
  Architects adopt visual scripting and parametric design tools to explore more expansive design spaces (Coates, 2010), refine their thinking about the geometric logic of their design (Woodbury, 2010), and overcome conventional software limitations (Burry, 2011). Despite two decades of effort to make design scripting more accessible, a disconnect between a designer's free ways of thinking and the rigidity of algorithms remains (Burry, 2011). Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest this might soon change, as LLMs encode a general understanding of human context and exhibit the capacity to produce geometric logic. This project speculates that if LLMs can effectively mediate between user intent and algorithms, they become a powerful tool to make scripting in design more widespread and fun. We explore if such systems can interpret natural language prompts to assemble geometric operations relevant to computational design scripting. In the system, multiple layers of LLM agents are configured with specific context to infer the user intent and construct a sequential logic. Given a user's high-level text prompt, a geometric description is created, distilled into a sequence of logic operations, and mapped to software-specific commands. The completed script is constructed in the user's visual programming interface. The system succeeds in generating complete visual scripts up to a certain complexity but fails beyond this complexity threshold. It shows how LLMs can make design scripting much more aligned with human creativity and thought. Future research should explore conversational interactions, expand to multimodal inputs and outputs, and assess the performance of these tools.</description>

      <title>Assessment of LLM Responses to End-user Security Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Answering end user security questions is challenging. While large language models (LLMs) like GPT, LLAMA, and Gemini are far from error-free, they have shown promise in answering a variety of questions outside of security. We studied LLM performance in the area of end user security by qualitatively evaluating 3 popular LLMs on 900 systematically collected end user security questions.
  While LLMs demonstrate broad generalist ``knowledge'' of end user security information, there are patterns of errors and limitations across LLMs consisting of stale and inaccurate answers, and indirect or unresponsive communication styles, all of which impacts the quality of information received. Based on these patterns, we suggest directions for model improvement and recommend user strategies for interacting with LLMs when seeking assistance with security.</description>

      <title>Social Media Algorithms Can Shape Affective Polarization via Exposure to Antidemocratic Attitudes and Partisan Animosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is widespread concern about the negative impacts of social media feed ranking algorithms on political polarization. Leveraging advancements in large language models (LLMs), we develop an approach to re-rank feeds in real-time to test the effects of content that is likely to polarize: expressions of antidemocratic attitudes and partisan animosity (AAPA). In a preregistered 10-day field experiment on X/Twitter with 1,256 consented participants, we increase or decrease participants' exposure to AAPA in their algorithmically curated feeds. We observe more positive outparty feelings when AAPA exposure is decreased and more negative outparty feelings when AAPA exposure is increased. Exposure to AAPA content also results in an immediate increase in negative emotions, such as sadness and anger. The interventions do not significantly impact traditional engagement metrics such as re-post and favorite rates. These findings highlight a potential pathway for developing feed algorithms that mitigate affective polarization by addressing content that undermines the shared values required for a healthy democracy.</description>

      <title>Jovis: A Visualization Tool for PostgreSQL Query Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the world of relational database management, the query optimizer is a critical component that significantly impacts query performance. To address the challenge of optimizing query performance due to the complexity of optimizers -- especially with join operations -- we introduce Jovis. This novel visualization tool provides a window into the often intricate process of query optimization in PostgreSQL, making it more accessible and understandable. PostgreSQL employs two different query optimization strategies: the Dynamic Programming (DP) Optimizer for most scenarios and the Genetic Query Optimizer (GEQO) for more complex queries with numerous joins, both of which are supported in Jovis. Our tool visualizes the optimizer's decision-making process, from evaluating access paths for each relation to determining join orderings, all using data derived from the optimizer's logs. Jovis not only clarifies the query optimization process through visualizations but also serves as an invaluable learning tool for learners and a practical resource for experienced database professionals looking to optimize their query performance or even the query optimizer itself. The source code has been made available at https://github.com/snu-jovis.</description>

      <title>Design-o-meter: Towards Evaluating and Refining Graphic Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphic designs are an effective medium for visual communication. They range from greeting cards to corporate flyers and beyond. Off-late, machine learning techniques are able to generate such designs, which accelerates the rate of content production. An automated way of evaluating their quality becomes critical. Towards this end, we introduce Design-o-meter, a data-driven methodology to quantify the goodness of graphic designs. Further, our approach can suggest modifications to these designs to improve its visual appeal. To the best of our knowledge, Design-o-meter is the first approach that scores and refines designs in a unified framework despite the inherent subjectivity and ambiguity of the setting. Our exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of our approach against baselines adapted for the task (including recent Multimodal LLM-based approaches) brings out the efficacy of our methodology. We hope our work will usher more interest in this important and pragmatic problem setting.</description>

      <title>SwissADT: An Audio Description Translation System for Swiss Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio description (AD) is a crucial accessibility service provided to blind persons and persons with visual impairment, designed to convey visual information in acoustic form. Despite recent advancements in multilingual machine translation research, the lack of well-crafted and time-synchronized AD data impedes the development of audio description translation (ADT) systems that address the needs of multilingual countries such as Switzerland. Furthermore, since the majority of ADT systems rely solely on text, uncertainty exists as to whether incorporating visual information from the corresponding video clips can enhance the quality of ADT outputs. In this work, we present SwissADT, the first ADT system implemented for three main Swiss languages and English. By collecting well-crafted AD data augmented with video clips in German, French, Italian, and English, and leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we aim to enhance information accessibility for diverse language populations in Switzerland by automatically translating AD scripts to the desired Swiss language. Our extensive experimental ADT results, composed of both automatic and human evaluations of ADT quality, demonstrate the promising capability of SwissADT for the ADT task. We believe that combining human expertise with the generation power of LLMs can further enhance the performance of ADT systems, ultimately benefiting a larger multilingual target population.</description>

      <title>Time is on my sight: scene graph filtering for dynamic environment perception in an LLM-driven robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots are increasingly being used in dynamic environments like workplaces, hospitals, and homes. As a result, interactions with robots must be simple and intuitive, with robots perception adapting efficiently to human-induced changes. This paper presents a robot control architecture that addresses key challenges in human-robot interaction, with a particular focus on the dynamic creation and continuous update of the robot state representation. The architecture uses Large Language Models to integrate diverse information sources, including natural language commands, robotic skills representation, real-time dynamic semantic mapping of the perceived scene. This enables flexible and adaptive robotic behavior in complex, dynamic environments. Traditional robotic systems often rely on static, pre-programmed instructions and settings, limiting their adaptability to dynamic environments and real-time collaboration. In contrast, this architecture uses LLMs to interpret complex, high-level instructions and generate actionable plans that enhance human-robot collaboration. At its core, the system Perception Module generates and continuously updates a semantic scene graph using RGB-D sensor data, providing a detailed and structured representation of the environment. A particle filter is employed to ensure accurate object localization in dynamic, real-world settings. The Planner Module leverages this up-to-date semantic map to break down high-level tasks into sub-tasks and link them to robotic skills such as navigation, object manipulation (e.g., PICK and PLACE), and movement (e.g., GOTO). By combining real-time perception, state tracking, and LLM-driven communication and task planning, the architecture enhances adaptability, task efficiency, and human-robot collaboration in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>One to rule them all: natural language to bind communication, perception and action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, research in the area of human-robot interaction has focused on developing robots capable of understanding complex human instructions and performing tasks in dynamic and diverse environments. These systems have a wide range of applications, from personal assistance to industrial robotics, emphasizing the importance of robots interacting flexibly, naturally and safely with humans. This paper presents an advanced architecture for robotic action planning that integrates communication, perception, and planning with Large Language Models (LLMs). Our system is designed to translate commands expressed in natural language into executable robot actions, incorporating environmental information and dynamically updating plans based on real-time feedback. The Planner Module is the core of the system where LLMs embedded in a modified ReAct framework are employed to interpret and carry out user commands. By leveraging their extensive pre-trained knowledge, LLMs can effectively process user requests without the need to introduce new knowledge on the changing environment. The modified ReAct framework further enhances the execution space by providing real-time environmental perception and the outcomes of physical actions. By combining robust and dynamic semantic map representations as graphs with control components and failure explanations, this architecture enhances a robot adaptability, task execution, and seamless collaboration with human users in shared and dynamic environments. Through the integration of continuous feedback loops with the environment the system can dynamically adjusts the plan to accommodate unexpected changes, optimizing the robot ability to perform tasks.

      <title>Measuring Bullshit in the Language Games played by ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs), which create text without direct correspondence to truth value, are widely understood to resemble the uses of language described in Frankfurt's popular monograph On Bullshit. In this paper, we offer a rigorous investigation of this topic, identifying how the phenomenon has arisen, and how it might be analysed. In this paper, we elaborate on this argument to propose that LLM-based chatbots play the 'language game of bullshit'. We use statistical text analysis to investigate the features of this Wittgensteinian language game, based on a dataset constructed to contrast the language of 1,000 scientific publications with typical pseudo-scientific text generated by ChatGPT. We then explore whether the same language features can be detected in two well-known contexts of social dysfunction: George Orwell's critique of politics and language, and David Graeber's characterisation of bullshit jobs. Using simple hypothesis-testing methods, we demonstrate that a statistical model of the language of bullshit can reliably relate the Frankfurtian artificial bullshit of ChatGPT to the political and workplace functions of bullshit as observed in natural human language.</description>

      <title>How Voice and Helpfulness Shape Perceptions in Human-Agent Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voice assistants are increasingly prevalent, from personal devices to team environments. This study explores how voice type and contribution quality influence human-agent team performance and perceptions of anthropomorphism, animacy, intelligence, and trustworthiness. By manipulating both, we reveal mechanisms of perception and clarify ambiguity in previous work. Our results show that the human resemblance of a voice assistant's voice negatively interacts with the helpfulness of an agent's contribution to flip its effect on perceived anthropomorphism and perceived animacy. This means human teammates interpret the agent's contributions differently depending on its voice. Our study found no significant effect of voice on perceived intelligence, trustworthiness, or team performance. We find differences in these measures are caused by manipulating the helpfulness of an agent. These findings suggest that function matters more than form when designing agents for high-performing human-agent teams, but controlling perceptions of anthropomorphism and animacy can be unpredictable even with high human resemblance.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Show Human-like Social Desirability Biases in Survey Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely used to model and simulate human behavior, understanding their biases becomes critical. We developed an experimental framework using Big Five personality surveys and uncovered a previously undetected social desirability bias in a wide range of LLMs. By systematically varying the number of questions LLMs were exposed to, we demonstrate their ability to infer when they are being evaluated. When personality evaluation is inferred, LLMs skew their scores towards the desirable ends of trait dimensions (i.e., increased extraversion, decreased neuroticism, etc). This bias exists in all tested models, including GPT-4/3.5, Claude 3, Llama 3, and PaLM-2. Bias levels appear to increase in more recent models, with GPT-4's survey responses changing by 1.20 (human) standard deviations and Llama 3's by 0.98 standard deviations-very large effects. This bias is robust to randomization of question order and paraphrasing. Reverse-coding all the questions decreases bias levels but does not eliminate them, suggesting that this effect cannot be attributed to acquiescence bias. Our findings reveal an emergent social desirability bias and suggest constraints on profiling LLMs with psychometric tests and on using LLMs as proxies for human participants.</description>

      <title>The Art of Saying No: Contextual Noncompliance in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chat-based language models are designed to be helpful, yet they should not comply with every user request. While most existing work primarily focuses on refusal of "unsafe" queries, we posit that the scope of noncompliance should be broadened. We introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of contextual noncompliance describing when and how models should not comply with user requests. Our taxonomy spans a wide range of categories including incomplete, unsupported, indeterminate, and humanizing requests (in addition to unsafe requests). To test noncompliance capabilities of language models, we use this taxonomy to develop a new evaluation suite of 1000 noncompliance prompts. We find that most existing models show significantly high compliance rates in certain previously understudied categories with models like GPT-4 incorrectly complying with as many as 30% of requests. To address these gaps, we explore different training strategies using a synthetically-generated training set of requests and expected noncompliant responses. Our experiments demonstrate that while direct finetuning of instruction-tuned models can lead to both over-refusal and a decline in general capabilities, using parameter efficient methods like low rank adapters helps to strike a good balance between appropriate noncompliance and other capabilities.</description>

      <title>GIS Copilot: Towards an Autonomous GIS Agent for Spatial Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03205v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Generative AI offer promising capabilities for spatial analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of generative AI with established GIS platforms remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a framework for integrating LLMs directly into existing GIS platforms, using QGIS as an example. Our approach leverages the reasoning and programming capabilities of LLMs to autonomously generate spatial analysis workflows and code through an informed agent that has comprehensive documentation of key GIS tools and parameters. The implementation of this framework resulted in the development of a "GIS Copilot" that allows GIS users to interact with QGIS using natural language commands for spatial analysis. The GIS Copilot was evaluated with over 100 spatial analysis tasks with three complexity levels: basic tasks that require one GIS tool and typically involve one data layer to perform simple operations; intermediate tasks involving multi-step processes with multiple tools, guided by user instructions; and advanced tasks which involve multi-step processes that require multiple tools but not guided by user instructions, necessitating the agent to independently decide on and executes the necessary steps. The evaluation reveals that the GIS Copilot demonstrates strong potential in automating foundational GIS operations, with a high success rate in tool selection and code generation for basic and intermediate tasks, while challenges remain in achieving full autonomy for more complex tasks. This study contributes to the emerging vision of Autonomous GIS, providing a pathway for non-experts to engage with geospatial analysis with minimal prior expertise. While full autonomy is yet to be achieved, the GIS Copilot demonstrates significant potential for simplifying GIS workflows and enhancing decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>From Novice to Expert: LLM Agent Policy Optimization via Step-wise Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The outstanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) render them a crucial component in various autonomous agent systems. While traditional methods depend on the inherent knowledge of LLMs without fine-tuning, more recent approaches have shifted toward the reinforcement learning strategy to further enhance agents' ability to solve complex interactive tasks with environments and tools. However, previous approaches are constrained by the sparse reward issue, where existing datasets solely provide a final scalar reward for each multi-step reasoning chain, potentially leading to ineffectiveness and inefficiency in policy learning. In this paper, we introduce StepAgent, which utilizes step-wise reward to optimize the agent's reinforcement learning process. Inheriting the spirit of novice-to-expert theory, we first compare the actions of the expert and the agent to automatically generate intermediate rewards for fine-grained optimization. Additionally, we propose implicit-reward and inverse reinforcement learning techniques to facilitate agent reflection and policy adjustment. Further theoretical analysis demonstrates that the action distribution of the agent can converge toward the expert action distribution over multiple training cycles. Experimental results across various datasets indicate that StepAgent outperforms existing baseline methods.</description>
