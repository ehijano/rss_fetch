      <title>Kleene Algebrae, Kleene Modules, and Morita Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modules and the notion of Morita equivalence are foundational to the classical study of rings. These concepts extend naturally to semirings and then specialize to Kleene algebrae, and my goal is to investigate Kleene modules and Morita equivalence of Kleene algebrae in the hope that some of the power seen in the context of rings may be found in this new context as well.</description>

      <title>Countable dense homogeneity in large products of Polish spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a unified treatment of the countable dense homogeneity of products of Polish spaces, with a focus on uncountable products. Our main result states that a product of fewer than $\mathfrak{p}$ Polish spaces is countable dense homogeneous if the following conditions hold: (1) Each factor is strongly locally homogeneous, (2) Each factor is strongly $n$-homogeneous for every $n\in\omega$, (3) Every countable subset of the product can be brought in general position. For example, using the above theorem, one can show that $2^\kappa$, $\omega^\kappa$, $\mathbb{R}^\kappa$ and $[0,1]^\kappa$ are countable dense homogeneous for every infinite $\kappa &lt;\mathfrak{p}$ (these results are due to Stepr\={a}ns and Zhou, except for the one concerning $\omega^\kappa$). In fact, as a new application, we will show that every product of fewer than $\mathfrak{p}$ connected manifolds with boundary is countable dense homogeneous, provided that none or infinitely many of the boundaries are non-empty. This generalizes a result of Yang. Along the way, we will discuss and employ several results concerning the general position of countable sets. Finally, we will show that our main result and its corollaries are optimal.</description>

      <title>Have a thing? Reasoning around recursion with dynamic typing in grounded arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neither the classical nor intuitionistic logic traditions are perfectly-aligned with the purpose of reasoning about computation, in that neither logical tradition can normally permit the direct expression of arbitrary general-recursive functions without inconsistency. We introduce grounded arithmetic or GA, a minimalistic but nonetheless powerful foundation for formal reasoning that allows the direct expression of arbitrary recursive definitions. GA adjusts the traditional inference rules such that terms that express nonterminating computations harmlessly denote no semantic value (i.e., "bottom") instead of leading into logical paradox or inconsistency. Recursive functions may be proven terminating in GA essentially by "dynamically typing" terms, or equivalently, symbolically reverse-executing the computations they denote via GA's inference rules. Once recursive functions have been proven terminating, logical reasoning about their results reduce to the familiar classical rules. A mechanically-checked consistency proof in Isabelle/HOL exists for the basic quantifier-free fragment of GA. Quantifiers may be added atop this foundation as ordinary computations, whose inference rules are thus admissible and do not introduce new inconsistency risks. While GA is only a first step towards richly-typed grounded deduction practical for everyday use in manual or automated computational reasoning, it shows the promise that the expressive freedom of arbitrary recursive definition can in principle be incorporated into formal systems.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of Inaccessible Sets in Martin-L\"of Type Theory with One Mahlo Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15074v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rathjen proved that Aczel's constructive set theory $\mathbf{CZF}$ extended with inaccessible sets of all transfinite orders can be interpreted in Martin-L\"{o}f type theory $\mathbf{MLTT}$ extended with Setzer's Mahlo universe and another universe above it. In this paper we show that this interpretation can be carried out bottom-up without the universe above the Mahlo universe, provided we add an accessibility predicate instead. If we work in Martin-L\"{o}f type theory with extensional identity types the accessibility predicate can be defined in terms of $\mathrm{W}$-types. The main part of our interpretation has been formalised in the proof assistant Agda.</description>
