      <title>Constant Approximation of Fr\'echet Distance in Strongly Subquadratic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\tau$ and $\sigma$ be two polygonal curves in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for any fixed $d$. Suppose that $\tau$ and $\sigma$ have $n$ and $m$ vertices, respectively, and $m\le n$. While conditional lower bounds prevent approximating the Fr\'echet distance between $\tau$ and $\sigma$ within a factor of 3 in strongly subquadratic time, the current best approximation algorithm attains a ratio of $n^c$ in strongly subquadratic time, for some constant $c\in(0,1)$. We present a randomized algorithm with running time $O(nm^{0.99}\log(n/\varepsilon))$ that approximates the Fr\'echet distance within a factor of $7+\varepsilon$, with a success probability at least $1-1/n^6$. We also adapt our techniques to develop a randomized algorithm that approximates the \emph{discrete} Fr\'echet distance within a factor of $7+\varepsilon$ in strongly subquadratic time. They are the first algorithms to approximate the Fr\'echet distance and the discrete Fr\'echet distance within constant factors in strongly subquadratic time.</description>

      <title>Deciding Connectivity in Symmetric Semi-Algebraic Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A semi-algebraic set is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ defined by a finite collection of polynomial equations and inequalities. In this paper, we investigate the problem of determining whether two points in such a set belong to the same connected component. We focus on the case where the defining equations and inequalities are invariant under the natural action of the symmetric group and where each polynomial has degree at most \( d \), with \( d &lt; n \) (where \( n \) denotes the number of variables). Exploiting this symmetry, we develop and analyze algorithms for two key tasks. First, we present an algorithm that determines whether the orbits of two given points are connected. Second, we provide an algorithm that decides connectivity between arbitrary points in the set. Both algorithms run in polynomial time with respect to \( n \).</description>

      <title>Intersection Queries for Flat Semi-Algebraic Objects in Three Dimensions and Related Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10241v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a set of $n$ flat (planar) semi-algebraic regions in $\mathbb{R}^3$ of constant complexity (e.g., triangles, disks), which we call plates. We wish to preprocess $\mathcal{T}$ into a data structure so that for a query object $\gamma$, which is also a plate, we can quickly answer various intersection queries, such as detecting whether $\gamma$ intersects any plate of $\mathcal{T}$, reporting all the plates intersected by $\gamma$, or counting them. We also consider two simpler cases of this general setting: (i) the input objects are plates and the query objects are constant-degree parametrized algebraic arcs in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (arcs, for short), or (ii) the input objects are arcs and the query objects are plates in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Besides being interesting in their own right, the data structures for these two special cases form the building blocks for handling the general case.
  By combining the polynomial-partitioning technique with additional tools from real algebraic geometry, we present many different data structures for intersection queries, which also provide trade-offs between their size and query time. For example, if $\mathcal{T}$ is a set of plates and the query objects are algebraic arcs, we obtain a data structure that uses $O^*(n^{4/3})$ storage (where the $O^*(\cdot)$ notation hides factors of the form $n^\epsilon$, for an arbitrarily small $\epsilon&gt;0$) and answers an arc-intersection query in $O^*(n^{2/3})$ time. This result is significant since the exponents do not depend on the specific shape of the input and query objects. We generalize and slightly improve this result: for a parameter $s\in [n^{4/3}, n^{t_q}]$, where ${t_q}\ge 3$ is the number of real parameters needed to specify a query arc, the query time can be decreased to $O^*((n/s^{1/{t_q}})^{\tfrac{2/3}{1-1/{t_q}}})$ by increasing the storage to $O^*(s)$.</description>

      <title>Space Complexity of Euclidean Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $(k, z)$-Clustering problem in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ has been extensively studied. Given the scale of data involved, compression methods for the Euclidean $(k, z)$-Clustering problem, such as data compression and dimension reduction, have received significant attention in the literature. However, the space complexity of the clustering problem, specifically, the number of bits required to compress the cost function within a multiplicative error $\varepsilon$, remains unclear in existing literature. This paper initiates the study of space complexity for Euclidean $(k, z)$-Clustering and offers both upper and lower bounds. Our space bounds are nearly tight when $k$ is constant, indicating that storing a coreset, a well-known data compression approach, serves as the optimal compression scheme. Furthermore, our lower bound result for $(k, z)$-Clustering establishes a tight space bound of $\Theta( n d )$ for terminal embedding, where $n$ represents the dataset size. Our technical approach leverages new geometric insights for principal angles and discrepancy methods, which may hold independent interest.</description>

      <title>Steinhaus Filtration and Stable Paths in the Mapper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.08256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a new filtration called the Steinhaus filtration built from a single cover based on a generalized Steinhaus distance, a generalization of Jaccard distance. The homology persistence module of a Steinhaus filtration with infinitely many cover elements may not be $q$-tame, even when the covers are in a totally bounded space. While this may pose a challenge to derive stability results, we show that the Steinhaus filtration is stable when the cover is finite. We show that while the \v{C}ech and Steinhaus filtrations are not isomorphic in general, they are isomorphic for a finite point set in dimension one. Furthermore, the VR filtration completely determines the $1$-skeleton of the Steinhaus filtration in arbitrary dimension.
  We then develop a language and theory for stable paths within the Steinhaus filtration. We demonstrate how the framework can be applied to several applications where a standard metric may not be defined but a cover is readily available. We introduce a new perspective for modeling recommendation system datasets. As an example, we look at a movies dataset and we find the stable paths identified in our framework represent a sequence of movies constituting a gentle transition and ordering from one genre to another.
  For explainable machine learning, we apply the Mapper algorithm for model induction by building a filtration from a single Mapper complex, and provide explanations in the form of stable paths between subpopulations. For illustration, we build a Mapper complex from a supervised machine learning model trained on the FashionMNIST dataset. Stable paths in the Steinhaus filtration provide improved explanations of relationships between subpopulations of images.</description>

      <title>Navigable Graphs for High-Dimensional Nearest Neighbor Search: Constructions and Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18680v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been significant recent interest in graph-based nearest neighbor search methods, many of which are centered on the construction of navigable graphs over high-dimensional point sets. A graph is navigable if we can successfully move from any starting node to any target node using a greedy routing strategy where we always move to the neighbor that is closest to the destination according to a given distance function. The complete graph is navigable for any point set, but the important question for applications is if sparser graphs can be constructed. While this question is fairly well understood in low-dimensions, we establish some of the first upper and lower bounds for high-dimensional point sets. First, we give a simple and efficient way to construct a navigable graph with average degree $O(\sqrt{n \log n })$ for any set of $n$ points, in any dimension, for any distance function. We compliment this result with a nearly matching lower bound: even under the Euclidean metric in $O(\log n)$ dimensions, a random point set has no navigable graph with average degree $O(n^{\alpha})$ for any $\alpha &lt; 1/2$. Our lower bound relies on sharp anti-concentration bounds for binomial random variables, which we use to show that the near-neighborhoods of a set of random points do not overlap significantly, forcing any navigable graph to have many edges.</description>

      <title>A survey of Zarankiewicz problems in geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the central topics in extremal graph theory is the study of the function $ex(n,H)$, which represents the maximum number of edges a graph with $n$ vertices can have while avoiding a fixed graph $H$ as a subgraph. Tur{\'a}n provided a complete characterization for the case when $H$ is a complete graph on $r$ vertices. Erd{\H o}s, Stone, and Simonovits extended Tur{\'a}n's result to arbitrary graphs $H$ with $\chi(H) &gt; 2$ (chromatic number greater than 2). However, determining the asymptotics of $ex(n, H)$ for bipartite graphs $H$ remains a widely open problem. A classical example of this is Zarankiewicz's problem, which asks for the asymptotics of $ex(n, K_{t,t})$.
  In this paper, we survey Zarankiewicz's problem, with a focus on graphs that arise from geometry. Incidence geometry, in particular, can be viewed as a manifestation of Zarankiewicz's problem in geometrically defined graphs.</description>
