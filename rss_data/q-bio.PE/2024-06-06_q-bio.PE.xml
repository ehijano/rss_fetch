      <title>Diversity in Evolutionary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics imposed by natural selection on the populations of two competing, sexually reproducing, haploid species. In this setting, the fitness of any genome varies over time due to the changing population mix of the competing species; crucially, this fitness variation arises naturally from the model itself, without the need for imposing it exogenously as is typically the case. Previous work on this model [14] showed that, in the special case where each of the two species exhibits just two phenotypes, genetic diversity is maintained at all times. This finding supported the tenet that sexual reproduction is advantageous because it promotes diversity, which increases the survivability of a species.
  In the present paper we consider the more realistic case where there are more than two phenotypes available to each species. The conclusions about diversity in general turn out to be very different from the two-phenotype case.
  Our first result is negative: namely, we show that sexual reproduction does not guarantee the maintenance of diversity at all times, i.e., the result of [14] does not generalize. Our counterexample consists of two competing species with just three phenotypes each. We show that, for any time~$t_0$ and any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there is a time $t\ge t_0$ at which the combined diversity of both species is smaller than~$\varepsilon$. Our main result is a complementary positive statement, which says that in any non-degenerate example, diversity is maintained in a weaker, ``infinitely often'' sense.
  Thus, our results refute the supposition that sexual reproduction ensures diversity at all times, but affirm a weaker assertion that extended periods of high diversity are necessarily a recurrent event.</description>

      <title>From operculum and body tail movements to different coupling of physical activity and respiratory frequency in farmed gilthead sea bream and European sea bass. Insights on aquaculture biosensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AEFishBIT tri-axial accelerometer was externally attached to the operculum to assess the divergent activity and respiratory patterns of two marine farmed fish, the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) and European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Analysis of raw data from exercised fish highlighted the large amplitude of operculum aperture and body tail movements in European sea bass, which were overall more stable at low-medium exercise intensity levels. Cosinor analysis in free-swimming fish (on-board data processing) highlighted a pronounced daily rhythmicity of locomotor activity and respiratory frequency in both gilthead sea bream and European sea bass. Acrophases of activity and respiration were coupled in gilthead sea bream, acting feeding time (once daily at 11:00 h) as a main synchronizing factor. By contrast, locomotor activity and respiratory frequency were out of phase in European sea bass with activity acrophase on early morning and respiration acrophase on the afternoon. The daily range of activity and respiration variation was also higher in European sea bass, probably as part of the adaptation of this fish species to act as a fast swimming predator. In any case, lower locomotor activity and enhanced respiration were associated with larger body weight in both fish species. This agrees with the notion that selection for fast growth in farming conditions is accompanied by a lower activity profile, which may favor an efficient feed conversion for growth purposes. Therefore, the use of behavioral monitoring is becoming a reliable and large-scale promising tool for selecting more efficient farmed fish, allowing researchers and farmers to establish stricter criteria of welfare for more sustainable and ethical fish production.</description>
