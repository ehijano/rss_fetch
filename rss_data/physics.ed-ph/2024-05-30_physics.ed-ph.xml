      <title>Evaluating the efectiveness of sonifcation in science education using Edukoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics classes are mainly taught using visual supports. However, the advancement of technology and the increasing eforts to equip schools with digital instrumentation have opened up the possibility of exploring new teaching avenues, such as sonifcation. We explored the efcacy of sonifcation in education using a novel interactive tool, Edukoi, in the context of astronomy, which is predominantly disseminated through spectacular images, animations, and visuals. Edukoi is a motion-sensing sonifcation tool that converts images to sound in real-time for educational applications. Our study, conducted with nearly 150 middle-school students, included a preliminary questionnaire investigating the perception, engagement, and motivation of students towards science; two sessions dedicated to testing Edukoi and assessing the potentiality of the software for the recognition of the colour and the shape of real and sketchy images; and a fnal second administration of the questionnaire to capture a possible benefcial efect of the use of the tool in the engagement towards science. Results showed the efectiveness of Edukoi in colour recognition and reasonable efcacy in shape identifcation. Although the questionnaire did not reveal an increment in science engagement over the time of the study, oral feedback from the students was positive. Edukoi presents a possible alternative teaching aid, potentially benefting diverse learners, including the visually impaired. Further developments of the software are needed to enhance its efectiveness in conveying more complex features such as composite colours or shapes.</description>

      <title>Challenge-Device-Synthesis: A multi-disciplinary approach for the development of social innovation competences for students of Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Artificial Intelligence is expected to imply profound changes in the short-term. It is therefore imperative for Academia, and particularly for the Computer Science scope, to develop cross-disciplinary tools that bond AI developments to their social dimension. To this aim, we introduce the Challenge-Device-Synthesis methodology (CDS), in which a specific challenge is presented to the students of AI, who are required to develop a device as a solution for the challenge. The device becomes the object of study for the different dimensions of social transformation, and the conclusions addressed by the students during the discussion around the device are presented in a synthesis piece in the shape of a 10-page scientific paper. The latter is evaluated taking into account both the depth of analysis and the level to which it genuinely reflects the social transformations associated with the proposed AI-based device. We provide data obtained during the pilot for the implementation phase of CDS within the subject of Social Innovation, a 6-ECTS subject from the 6th semester of the Degree of Artificial Intelligence, UAB-Barcelona. We provide details on temporalisation, task distribution, methodological tools used and assessment delivery procedure, as well as qualitative analysis of the results obtained.</description>

      <title>Challenges in addressing student difficulties with quantum measurement of two-state quantum systems using a multiple-choice question sequence in online and in-person classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research-validated multiple-choice questions comprise an easy-to-implement instructional tool that serves to scaffold student learning and formatively assess students' knowledge. We present findings from the implementation, in consecutive years, of a research-validated multiple-choice question sequence [referred to in this study as a Clicker Question Sequence (CQS)] on quantum measurement as it applies to two-state quantum systems. This study was conducted in an advanced undergraduate quantum mechanics course, in both online and in-person learning environments across three years. Student learning was assessed after traditional lecture-based instruction in relevant concepts, and their performance was compared with that on a similar assessment given after engaging with the CQS. We analyze, compare, and discuss the trends observed in the three implementations.</description>
