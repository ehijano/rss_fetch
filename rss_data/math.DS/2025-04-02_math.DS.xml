      <title>Relativistic one-dimensional billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the dynamics of one-dimensional relativistic billiards containing particles with positive and negative energy. We study configurations with two identical positive masses and symmetric positions with two massless particles between them of negative energy and symmetric positions. We show that such systems have finitely many collisions in any finite time interval. This is due to a phenomenon we call \textit{tachyonic collision}, which occur at small scales and produce changes in the sign of the energy of individual particles. We also show that depending on the initial parameters the solutions can be bounded with certain periodicity or unbounded while obeying an inverse square law at large distances.</description>

      <title>Generic surface homeomorphisms are almost continuum-wise expansive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for a compact surface without boundary $M$ the set of cw-expansive homeomorphisms is dense in the set of all the homeomorphisms of $M$ with respect to the $C^0$ topology. After this we show that for a generic homeomorphism $f$ of $M$ it holds that: for all $\epsilon&gt;0$ there is a cw-expansive homeomorphism $g$ of $M$ which is $\epsilon$-close to $f$ and is semiconjugate to $f$; moreover, if $\pi\colon M\to M$ is this semiconjugacy then $\pi^{-1}(x)$ is connected, does not separate $M$ and has diameter less than $\epsilon$ for all $x\in M$.</description>

      <title>Shadowing maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is about the shadowing property of homeomorphisms on compact metric spaces and the map associating a point of the space to each pseudo-orbit, called 'shadowing map'. Based on some particular dynamical properties, as expansivity, we develop a brief theory and a hierarchy
  of such maps. We consider examples as odometers, shifts on infinite spaces, topologically hyperbolic homeomorphisms and north-shouth dynamics.
  We revisit a well-known technique for proving shadowing of expansive homeomorphisms with canonical coordinates due to R. Bowen, to obtain a shadowing map with the property we call 'self-tuning' from a hyperbolic bracket. This notion is introduced as part of the hierarchy of shadowing maps studied in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinite sequences are of tremendous theoretical and practical importance, and in the Information Age sequences of 0s and 1s are of particular interest. Over the past century, the field of symbolic dynamics has developed to study sequences with entries from a finite set. In this paper we will show you an interesting method for constructing sequences, and then we'll show you a fun variant of the method. The we'll discuss what theoretical computer scientists and mathematicians call the "complexity" of a sequence. We conclude by showing a technique you can use to compute the complexity of a sequence, illustrating it on our concrete examples.</description>

Abstract: We describe the transformation of a polynomial planar dynamical system into a second order differential equation by means of a polynomial change of variables. We then, by means of the Krylov-Bogoliubov-Mitropolsky averaging method, identify sufficient conditions involving said change of variables so that a limit cycle exists.</description>

      <title>Constructive QP-Time-dependent KAM Algorithm for Lagrangian Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an algorithm to computea fiberwise Lagrangian torus in quasi-periodic (QP) Hamiltonian systems, whose convergence is proved in the [CHP25]. We exhibit the algorithm with two models. The first is a Tokamak model [CVC+05, VL21], which proposes a control method to create barriers to the diffusion of magnetic field lines through a small modification in the magnetic perturbation. The second model [dCN00], known as the vorticity defect model, describes the nonlinear evolution of localized vorticity perturbations in a constant vorticity flow. This model was originally derived in the context of plasma physics and fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Complex dynamics of a predator-prey model with constant-yield prey harvesting and Allee effect in predator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical behaviors of a Holling type I Leslie-Gower predator-prey model where the predator exhibits an Allee effect and is subjected to constant harvesting. The model demonstrates three types of equilibrium points under different parameter conditions, which could be either stable or unstable nodes (foci), saddle nodes, weak centers, or cusps. The system exhibits a saddle-node bifurcation near the saddle-node point and a Hopf bifurcation near the weak center. By calculating the first Lyapunov coefficient, the conditions for the occurrence of both supercritical and subcritical Hopf bifurcations are derived. Finally, it is proven that when the predator growth rate and the prey capture coefficient vary within a specific small neighborhood, the system undergoes a codimension-2 Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation near the cusp point.</description>

      <title>Coupling Induced Stabilization of Network Dynamical Systems and Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stability and stabilization of diffusively coupled network dynamical systems. We leverage Lyapunov methods to analyze the role of coupling in stabilizing or destabilizing network systems. We derive critical coupling parameter values for stability and provide sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability under arbitrary switching scenarios, thus highlighting the impact of both coupling strength and network topology on the stability analysis of such systems. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>The Aubry set for the XY model and typicality of periodic optimization for 2-locally constant potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Aubry set for the XY model, symbolic dynamics $([0,1]^{\mathbb{N}_0},\sigma)$ with the uncountable symbol $[0,1]$, and study its action-optimizing properties. Moreover, for a potential function that depends on the first two coordinates we obtain an explicit expression of the set of optimal periodic measures and a detailed description of the Aubry set. We also show the typicality of periodic optimization for 2-locally constant potentials with the twist condition. Our approach combines the weak KAM method for symbolic dynamics and variational techniques for twist maps.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing for Gibbs measures on self-conformal sets and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that Gibbs measures on self-conformal sets generated by a $C^{1+\alpha}$ conformal IFS on $\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfying the OSC are exponentially mixing. We exploit this to obtain essentially sharp asymptotic counting statements for the recurrent and the shrinking target subsets associated with any such set. In particular, we provide explicit examples of dynamical systems for which the recurrent sets exhibit (unexpected) behaviour that is not present in the shrinking target setup. In the process of establishing our exponential mixing result we extend Mattila's rigidity theorem for self-similar sets to self-conformal sets without any separation condition and for arbitrary Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>Introduction to weak Pinsker filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the so-called weak Pinsker dynamical filtrations, whose existence in any ergodic system follows from the universality of the weak Pinsker property, recently proved by Austin. These dynamical filtrations appear as a potential tool to describe and classify positive entropy systems. We explore the links between the asymptotic structure of weak Pinsker filtrations and the properties of the underlying dynamical system. A central question is whether, on a given system, the structure of weak Pinsker filtrations is unique up to isomorphism. We give a partial answer, in the case where the underlying system is Bernoulli. We conclude our work by giving two explicit examples of weak Pinsker filtrations.</description>

      <title>Sequence entropy and independence in free and minimal actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every countable infinite group that admits $\mathbb{Z}$ as a homomorphic image, we show that for each $m\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists a minimal action whose topological sequence entropy is $\log(m)$. Furthermore, for every countable infinite group $G$ that contains a finite index normal subgroup $G'$ isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^r$, and for every $m\in \mathbb{N}$, we found a free minimal action with topological sequence entropy $\log(n)$, where $m\leq n\leq m^{2^r[G:G']}$. In both cases, we also show that the aforementioned minimal actions admit non-trivial independence tuples of size $n$ but do not admit non-trivial independence tuples of size $n+1$ for some $n\geq m$.</description>

      <title>ParallelFlow: Parallelizing Linear Transformers via Flow Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for analyzing linear attention models through matrix-valued state space models (SSMs). Our approach, Parallel Flows, provides a perspective that systematically decouples temporal dynamics from implementation constraints, enabling independent analysis of critical algorithmic components: chunking, parallelization, and information aggregation. Central to this framework is the reinterpretation of chunking procedures as computations of the flows governing system dynamics. This connection establishes a bridge to mathematical tools from rough path theory, opening the door to new insights into sequence modeling architectures. As a concrete application, we analyze DeltaNet in a generalized low-rank setting motivated by recent theoretical advances. Our methods allow us to design simple, streamlined generalizations of hardware-efficient algorithms present in the literature, and to provide completely different ones, inspired by rough paths techniques, with provably lower complexity. This dual contribution demonstrates how principled theoretical analysis can both explain existing practical methods and inspire fundamentally new computational approaches.</description>

      <title>Bounding Escape Rates and Approximating Quasi-Stationary Distributions of Brownian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Throughout physics Brownian dynamics are used to describe the behaviour of molecular systems. When the Brownian particle is confined to a bounded domain, a particularly important question arises around determining how long it takes the particle to encounter certain regions of the boundary from which it can escape. Termed the first passage time, it sets the natural timescale of the chemical, biological, and physical processes that are described by the stochastic differential equation. Probabilistic information about the first passage time can be studied using spectral properties of the deterministic generator of the stochastic process. In this work we introduce a framework for bounding the leading eigenvalue of the generator which determines the exponential rate of escape of the particle from the domain. The method employs sum-of-squares programming to produce nearly sharp numerical upper and lower bounds on the leading eigenvalue, while also giving good numerical approximations of the associated leading eigenfunction, the quasi-stationary distribution of the process. To demonstrate utility, the method is applied to prototypical low-dimensional problems from the literature.</description>

      <title>The prime number theorem over integers of power-free polynomial values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2022, Bergelson and Richter established a new dynamical generalization of the prime number theorem (PNT). Let $f(x)\in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial of degree $d\ge 1$. Let $k\ge2$ be an integer. The number of integers $n$ such that $f(n)$ is $k$-free is widely studied in the literature. In principle, one expects that $f(n)$ is $k$-free infinitely often, if $f$ has no fixed $k$-th power divisor. Inspired by the work of Bergelson and Richter, we expect that their generalization of the PNT also holds over such integers of power-free polynomial values. In this note, we establish such variant of Bergelson and Richter's theorem for several polynomials studied by Estermann, Hooley, Heath-Brown, Booker and Browning.</description>

      <title>Recurrence in collective dynamics: From the hyperspace to fuzzy dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study for a dynamical system $f:X\longrightarrow X$ some of the principal topological recurrence-kind properties with respect to the induced maps $\overline{f}:\mathcal{K}(X)\longrightarrow\mathcal{K}(X)$, on the hyperspace of non-empty compact subsets of $X$, and $\hat{f}:\mathcal{F}(X)\longrightarrow\mathcal{F}(X)$, on the space of normal fuzzy sets consisting of the upper-semicontinuous functions $u:X\longrightarrow [0,1]$ with compact support and such that $u^{-1}(\{1\})\neq\varnothing$. In particular, we characterize the properties of topological and multiple recurrence for the extended systems $(\mathcal{K}(X),\overline{f})$ and $(\mathcal{F}(X),\hat{f})$, which cover the cases of the so-called nonwandering and Van der Waerden systems. Special attention is given to the case where the underlying space is completely metrizable, for which we obtain some stronger point-recurrence equivalences.</description>

      <title>Regularity of non-autonomous self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-autonomous self-similar sets are a family of compact sets which are, in some sense, highly homogeneous in space but highly inhomogeneous in scale. The main purpose of this note is to clarify various regularity properties and separation conditions relevant for the fine local scaling properties of these sets. A simple application of our results is a precise formula for the Assouad dimension of non-autonomous self-similar sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfying a certain ``bounded neighbourhood'' condition, which generalizes earlier work of Li--Li--Miao--Xi and Olson--Robinson--Sharples. We also see that the bounded neighbourhood assumption is, in few different senses, as general as possible.</description>

      <title>A shadowable chain recurrent set with an attached hyperbolic singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every factor map between topological flows preserves the standard shadowing property if it is injective except for a closed orbit that shrinks to a singularity. As an application, we construct a $C^\infty$-flow on a four-dimensional sphere whose nonwandering set contains an attached hyperbolic singularity yet possesses the standard shadowing property. This gives a counterexample to a conjecture given by Arbieto, L\'{o}pez, Rego and S\'{a}nchez (Math. Annalen 390:417-437).</description>

      <title>Mixing Time of Open Quantum Systems via Hypocoercivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mixing of open quantum systems is a fundamental problem in physics and quantum information science. Existing approaches for estimating the mixing time often rely on the spectral gap estimation of the Lindbladian generator, which can be challenging to obtain in practice. We propose a novel theoretical framework to estimate the mixing time of open quantum systems that treats the Hamiltonian and dissipative part separately, thus circumventing the need for a priori estimation of the spectral gap of the full Lindbladian generator. This framework yields mixing time estimates for a class of quantum systems that are otherwise hard to analyze, even though it does not apply to arbitrary Lindbladians. The technique is based on the construction of an energy functional inspired by the hypocoercivity of (classical) kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Modelling Population-Level Hes1 Dynamics: Insights from a Multi-Framework Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical models of living cells have been successively refined with advancements in experimental techniques. A main concern is striking a balance between modelling power and the tractability of the associated mathematical analysis.
  In this work we model the dynamics for the transcription factor Hairy and enhancer of split-1 (Hes1), whose expression oscillates during neural development, and which critically enables stable fate decision in the embryonic brain. We design, parametrise, and analyse a detailed spatial model using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) over a grid capturing both transient oscillatory behaviour and fate decision on a population-level. We also investigate the relationship between this ODE model and a more realistic grid-based model involving intrinsic noise using mostly directly biologically motivated parameters.
  While we focus specifically on Hes1 in neural development, the approach of linking deterministic and stochastic grid-based models shows promise in modelling various biological processes taking place in a cell population. In this context, our work stresses the importance of the interpretability of complex computational models into a framework which is amenable to mathematical analysis.</description>

      <title>Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics and Koopman operators with Shallow Recurrent Decoder Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling real-world spatio-temporal data is exceptionally difficult due to inherent high dimensionality, measurement noise, partial observations, and often expensive data collection procedures. In this paper, we present Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics with SHallow REcurrent Decoder networks (SINDy-SHRED), a method to jointly solve the sensing and model identification problems with simple implementation, efficient computation, and robust performance. SINDy-SHRED uses Gated Recurrent Units to model the temporal sequence of sparse sensor measurements along with a shallow decoder network to reconstruct the full spatio-temporal field from the latent state space. Our algorithm introduces a SINDy-based regularization for which the latent space progressively converges to a SINDy-class functional, provided the projection remains within the set. In restricting SINDy to a linear model, a Koopman-SHRED model is generated. SINDy-SHRED (i) learns a symbolic and interpretable generative model of a parsimonious and low-dimensional latent space for the complex spatio-temporal dynamics, (ii) discovers new physics models even for well-known physical systems, (iii) achieves provably robust convergence with an observed globally convex loss landscape, and (iv) achieves superior accuracy, data efficiency, and training time, all with fewer model parameters. We conduct systematic experimental studies on PDE data such as turbulent flows, real-world sensor measurements for sea surface temperature, and direct video data. The interpretable SINDy and Koopman models of latent state dynamics enable stable and accurate long-term video predictions, outperforming all current baseline deep learning models in accuracy, training time, and data requirements, including Convolutional LSTM, PredRNN, ResNet, and SimVP.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on end-periodic stretch factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17389v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an end-periodic homeomorphism $f: S \to S$ we give a lower bound on the Handel--Miller stretch factor of $f$ in terms of the core characteristic of $f$, which is a measure of topological complexity for an end-periodic homeomorphism. We also show that the growth rate of this bound is sharp.</description>
