      <title>The role of Solar Activity in shaping Precipitation Extremes: A Regional Exploration in Kerala, India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been global attention focused on extreme climatic changes. The purpose of this paper is to explore the response of extreme precipitation events to solar activity, over Kerala, India. The three solar indices - sunspot number, F10.7 index, and cosmic ray intensity - are examined, and their relationship to rainfall is examined during a 57-year period (1965 - 2021), starting with Solar Cycle 20. Both solar and rainfall data are considered on an annual scale as well as on a seasonal scale by dividing them into winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons. The solar indices are used to calculate correlation coefficients with seasonal rainfall. Through correlation analysis, it is found that the precipitation in Kerala is correlated with the sunspot activity, but with different significance. When solar activity is high, the winter and monsoon seasons exhibit strong correlations with high significance. The solar influence at the regional level is also studied. The central and southern parts of Kerala appear to be influenced by the Sun during periods of high activity. The years with excess and deficiency of rainfall are calculated and compared with the solar indices. It was observed that the years with excessive and insufficient rainfall coincide with the years when the solar activity is at its highest or minimum. It is suggested that there is a physical link and a way to predict extreme rainfall events in Kerala based on the association between solar activity and those events.</description>

      <title>Radiation Exposure from the Dark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that exotic forms of dark matter could expose humans on Earth or on prolonged space travel to a significant radiation dose. The radiation exposure from dark matter interacting with nuclei in the human body is generally assumed to be negligible compared to other sources of background radiation. However, as we discuss here, current data allow for dark matter models where this is not necessarily true. In particular, if dark matter is heavier and more strongly interacting than weakly interacting massive particle dark matter, it could act as ionizing radiation and deposit a significant amount of radiation energy in all or part of the human population, similar to or even exceeding the known radiation exposure from other background sources. Conversely, the non-observation of such an exposure can be used to constrain this type of heavier and more strongly interacting dark matter. We first consider the case where dark matter scatters elastically and identify the relevant parameter space in a model-independent way. We also discuss how previous bounds from cosmological probes, as well as atmospheric and space-based detectors, might be avoided, and how a re-analysis of existing radiation data, along with a simple experiment monitoring ionizing radiation in space with a lower detection threshold, could help constrain part of this parameter space. We finally propose a hypothetical dark matter candidate that scatters inelastically and argue that, in principle, one per mille of the Earth's population could attain a significant radiation dose from such a dark matter exposure in their lifetime.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of electron velocity distribution function and Gibbs entropy from electron cyclotron emission in magnetized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for reconstructing the fluctuation components of the electron velocity distribution function f(v_perp), and the electron entropy, which is a functional of f(v_perp) expressed as -f(v_perp)lnf(v_perp)dv_perp, using the harmonic spectrum from pure X-mode electron cyclotron emission (ECE) in optically thin plasmas. Here, v_perp represents the electron velocity perpendicular to the background magnetic field. This formulation employs the maximum entropy method in velocity space using the Hankel transform, which converts from v_perp space to p space (where p is the index of the wavenumber in velocity space). Numerical tests validated the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is applicable across a wide range of magnetized plasma conditions, including conditions with both non-relativistic and relativistic electrons, except in cases of harmonic overlap or under optically thick conditions. Notably, this method does not require radiometer calibration for ECE measurements. This method fascilitates the experimental evaluation of electron entropy transport in fusion plasma experiments. Moreover, when combined with measurements in k-space (spatial distribution), this approach enables entropy distribution acquisition in phase space (k-p space).</description>

      <title>A Wave Scattering Approach to Modelling Surface Roughness in Orbital Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing density of space objects in low-Earth orbit highlights the critical need for accurate orbit predictions to minimise operational disruptions. One significant challenge lies in accurately modelling the interaction of gas particles with the surfaces of these objects, as errors in aerodynamic coefficient modelling directly impact orbit prediction accuracy. Current approaches rely on empirical models, such as those by Sentman and Cercignani-Lampis-Lord, incorporating one or two adjustable parameters typically calibrated with orbital acceleration data. However, these models fall short in capturing essential gas-solid interaction processes, including multiple reflections, shadowing, and backscattering caused by surface roughness. We present a novel, physics-based gas-surface interaction model that utilises electromagnetic wave theory to account for macroscopic effects of surface roughness on gas particle scattering distributions. This approach not only offers a more accurate representation of gas-surface interactions but also allows parameter determination through a combination of ground-based surface roughness measurements and molecular dynamics simulations at the atomic scale. The model validity is tested across the entire parameter space using a test-particle Monte Carlo method on a simulated rough surface. Furthermore, it successfully reproduces experimental results from the literature on the scattering of Argon and Helium from smooth and rough Kapton and Aluminium surfaces. Finally, we demonstrate the model's impact on aerodynamic coefficients for simple geometric shapes, comparing the results with those from the Sentman and Cercignani-Lampis-Lord models. This comparison reveals that inconsistencies previously observed between these models and tracking data for spherical satellites can be attributed to surface roughness effects, which our model effectively accounts for.</description>

      <title>The no-hair theorems at work in M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a perturbative calculation to the first post-Newtonian order has shown that the analytically worked out Lense-Thirring precession of the orbital angular momentum of a test particle following a circular path around a massive spinning primary is able to explain the measured features of the jet precession of the supermassive black hole at the centre of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. It is shown that also the hole's mass quadrupole moment $Q_2$, as given by the no-hair theorems, has a dynamical effect which cannot be neglected, as, instead, done so far in the literature. New allowed regions for the hole's dimensionless spin parameter $a^\ast$ and the effective radius $r_0$ of the accretion disk, assumed tightly coupled with the jet, are obtained by including both the Lense-Thirring and the quadrupole effects in the dynamics of the effective test particle modeling the accretion disk. One obtains that, by numerically integrating the resulting averaged equations for the rates of change of the angles $\eta$ and $\phi$ characterizing the orientation of the orbital angular momentum with $a^\ast = +0.98$ and $r_0=14.1$ gravitational radii, it is possible to reproduce, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the time series for them recently measured with the Very Long Baseline Interferometry technique. Instead, the resulting time series produced with $a^\ast = -0.95$ and $r_0=16$ gravitational radii turn out to be out of phase with respect to the observationally determined ones, while maintaining the same amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Generalized Treatment of Energy Accommodation in Gas-Surface Interactions for Satellite Aerodynamics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of satellite aerodynamics in the Very-Low-Earth-Orbit (VLEO) regime, accurate modeling of gas-surface interactions (GSI) is crucial for determining aerodynamic forces and torques. Common models such as Sentman's assume that gas particles are reflected diffusely from a surface, which leads to the incorporation of energy accommodation into the model. This technical note discusses the limitations of existing approaches for handling energy accommodation and provides a generalized treatment thereof that is valid for any molecular speed ratio. A new general expression for the temperature ratio of reflected to impinging particles is derived, which, when used in a GSI model, retains its validity even in hypothermal flows. Additionally, a simplified hyperthermal approximation is presented, proven to be an asymptote of the general expression, and shown to be an improvement upon existing approximations by comparison for a realistic VLEO scenario. The results contribute to a better understanding and modeling of GSI, potentially benefiting scientific investigations and operational applications in satellite aerodynamics.</description>

      <title>A Localized Burst of Relativistic Electrons in Earth's Plasma Sheet: Low- and High-Altitude Signatures During a Substorm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth's magnetotail, and the plasma sheet embedded in it, is a highly dynamic region that is coupled to both the solar wind and to the inner magnetosphere. As a consequence of this coupling, the plasma sheet undergoes explosive energy releases in the form of substorms. One consequence of this energy release is heating of thermal electrons and acceleration of energetic (non-thermal) electrons. The upper-energy limit as well as the spatial scale size of the electron acceleration regions remain mysteries in magnetotail physics because current missions can effectively only offer us a single-point glimpse into the numerous magnetotail phenomena ranging from electron- to global-scales. These energetic electrons can provide a significant source of seed electrons for the Van Allen Radiation belts. Here we use a unique approach to study relativistic plasma sheet electron acceleration. We combine high-altitude Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission observations with low-altitude Electron Losses and Fields Investigation (ELFIN) observations, to quantify the upper-energy extent and radial scale of a burst of plasma sheet electrons that mapped to 33 Earth radii. The plasma sheet locally accelerated an intense mesoscale burst of 3 MeV electrons -- far higher and more intense than the outer Van Allen radiation belt -- and scattered them into the atmospheric loss cone. High-altitude observations Earthward of the burst at 17 Earth radii showed only the usual substorm activity signatures -- demonstrating that this burst was 1) intense, 2) localized to the far magnetotail, and 3) likely accelerated by a very efficient and rapid mechanism.</description>

      <title>The Solar and Geomagnetic Storms in May 2024: A Flash Data Report</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In May 2024, the scientific community observed intense solar eruptions that resulted in a great geomagnetic storm and auroral extension, highlighting the need to document and quantify these events. This study mainly focuses on their quantification. The source active region (AR 13664) evolved from 113 to 2761 millionths of the solar hemisphere between 4 May and 14 May. AR 13664's magnetic free energy surpassed 10^33 erg on 7 May, triggering 12 X-class flares on 8 -- 15 May. Multiple interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) were produced from this AR, accelerating solar energetic particles toward Earth. According to satellite and interplanetary scintillation data, at least 4 ICMEs erupted from 13664 eventually overcoming each other and combining. The shock arrival at 17:05 UT on 10 May significantly compressed the magnetosphere down to ~ 5.04 RE, and triggered a deep Forbush Decrease. GOES satellite data and ground-based neutron monitors confirmed a ground-level enhancement from 2 UT to 10 UT on 11 May 2024. The ICMEs induced exceptional geomagnetic storms, peaking at a Dst index of -412 nT at 2 UT on 11 May, marking the sixth-largest storm since 1957. The AE and AL indices showed great auroral extensions that located the AE/AL stations into the polar cap. We gathered auroral records at that time and reconstructed the equatorward boundary of the visual auroral oval to 29.8{\deg} invariant latitude. We compared naked-eye and camera auroral visibility, providing critical caveats on their difference. We also confirmed global enhancements of storm-enhanced density of the ionosphere.</description>

      <title>Limb Observations of Global Solar Coronal Extreme-ultraviolet Wavefronts: The Inclination, Kinematics, Coupling with the Expanding Coronal Mass Ejections, and Connection with the Coronal Mass Ejection Driven Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We select and investigate six global solar extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave events using data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. These eruptions are all on the limb but recorded as halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs) because the CME-driven shocks have expanded laterally to the opposite side. With the limb observations avoiding the projection effect, we have measured the inclination and speed of the EUV wavefront from 1.05 to 1.25 $R_\odot$. We also investigate the coupling and connection of the EUV wavefront with the CME boundary and the CME-driven shock, respectively. The major findings in the six events are: (1) the forward inclination of the primary and coronal-hole-transmitted EUV wavefronts is estimated, respectively, and the origins of these inclinations and their effects on the estimate of actual wavefronts speed are investigated; (2) the wavefront speed can be elevated by loop systems near the coronal base, and the average speed in the low corona has no clear correlation with the lateral expansion of the CME-driven shock in the high corona; (3) the fast magnetosonic Mach number of the wavefront is larger than unity from the coronal base; (4) the EUV wavefront is coupled with the CME driver throughout the propagation in two events; (5) after the EUV wavefront vanishes, the CME-driven shock continues traveling on the opposite side and disconnects from the EUV wavefront in four events. These results and their implications are discussed, which provide insight into the properties of global EUV waves.</description>

      <title>The Lense-Thirring effect at work in M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the temporal evolution of the angles characterizing the spatial configuration of the jet in the supermassive black hole M87$^\ast$ was measured exhibiting a precessional pattern around the hole's spin axis. It would be due to the dragging induced by the fact that the hole's external spacetime is described by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense-Thirring orbital precessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object, calculated perturbatively to the first post-Newtonian order, are able to fully reproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87$^\ast$. In particular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of the accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular orbit, the condition that the absolute value of the predicted Lense-Thirring precessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of $0.56\pm 0.02$ radians per year of the jet's one is satisfied for a range of physically meaningful values of the hole's spin parameter, close to unity, and of the effective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii. Relying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the angle between the hole's spin axis and the jet's one stays constant over the years amounting to $1.16^\circ$, in agreement with its measured value of $1.25^\circ\pm 0.18^\circ$. Furthermore, also the temporal pattern and the amplitudes of the time series of the jet's angles are reproduced by the aforementioned Lense-Thirring precessional model.</description>
