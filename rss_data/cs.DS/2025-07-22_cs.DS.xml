      <title>FAMST: Fast Approximate Minimum Spanning Tree Construction for Large-Scale and High-Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Fast Approximate Minimum Spanning Tree (FAMST), a novel algorithm that addresses the computational challenges of constructing Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs) for large-scale and high-dimensional datasets. FAMST utilizes a three-phase approach: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) graph construction, ANN inter-component connection, and iterative edge refinement. For a dataset of $n$ points in a $d$-dimensional space, FAMST achieves $\mathcal{O}(dn \log n)$ time complexity and $\mathcal{O}(dn + kn)$ space complexity when $k$ nearest neighbors are considered, which is a significant improvement over the $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time and space complexity of traditional methods.
  Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that FAMST achieves remarkably low approximation errors while providing speedups of up to 1000$\times$ compared to exact MST algorithms. We analyze how the key hyperparameters, $k$ (neighborhood size) and $\lambda$ (inter-component edges), affect performance, providing practical guidelines for hyperparameter selection. FAMST enables MST-based analysis on datasets with millions of points and thousands of dimensions, extending the applicability of MST techniques to problem scales previously considered infeasible.</description>

      <title>Tighter Lower Bounds for Single Source Personalized PageRank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study lower bounds for approximating the Single Source Personalized PageRank (SSPPR) query, which measures the probability distribution of an $\alpha$-decay random walk starting from a source node $s$. Existing lower bounds remain loose-$\Omega\left(\min(m, 1/\delta)\right)$ for relative error (SSPPR-R) and $\Omega\left(\min(n, 1/\epsilon)\right)$ for additive error (SSPPR-A). To close this gap, we establish tighter bounds for both settings. For SSPPR-R, we show a lower bound of $\Omega\left(\min\left(m, \frac{\log(1/\delta)}{\delta}\right)\right)$ for any $\delta \in (0,1)$. For SSPPR-A, we prove a lower bound of $\Omega\left(\min\left(m, \frac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$ for any $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, assuming the graph has $m \in \mathcal{O}(n^{2-\beta})$ edges for any arbitrarily small constant $\beta \in (0,1)$.</description>

      <title>New Algorithms for #2-SAT and #3-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The #2-SAT and #3-SAT problems involve counting the number of satisfying assignments (also called models) for instances of 2-SAT and 3-SAT, respectively. In 2010, Zhou et al. proposed an $\mathcal{O}^*(1.1892^m)$-time algorithm for #2-SAT and an efficient approach for #3-SAT, where $m$ denotes the number of clauses. In this paper, we show that the weighted versions of #2-SAT and #3-SAT can be solved in $\mathcal{O}^*(1.1082^m)$ and $\mathcal{O}^*(1.4423^m)$ time, respectively. These results directly apply to the unweighted cases and achieve substantial improvements over the previous results. These advancements are enabled by the introduction of novel reduction rules, a refined analysis of branching operations, and the application of path decompositions on the primal and dual graphs of the formula.</description>

      <title>Addressing Bias in Algorithmic Solutions: Exploring Vertex Cover and Feedback Vertex Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A typical goal of research in combinatorial optimization is to come up with fast algorithms that find optimal solutions to a computational problem. The process that takes a real-world problem and extracts a clean mathematical abstraction of it often throws out a lot of "side information" which is deemed irrelevant. However, the discarded information could be of real significance to the end-user of the algorithm's output. All solutions of the same cost are not necessarily of equal impact in the real-world; some solutions may be much more desirable than others, even at the expense of additional increase in cost. If the impact, positive or negative, is mostly felt by some specific (minority) subgroups of the population, the population at large will be largely unaware of it. In this work we ask the question of finding solutions to combinatorial optimization problems that are "unbiased" with respect to a collection of specified subgroups of the total population.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and Testing Configuration Stability in Two-Dimensional Threshold Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problems of characterizing and testing the stability of cellular automata configurations that evolve on a two-dimensional torus according to threshold rules with respect to the von-Neumann neighborhood. While stable configurations for Threshold-1 (OR) and Threshold-5 (AND) are trivial (and hence easily testable), the other threshold rules exhibit much more diverse behaviors. We first characterize the structure of stable configurations with respect to the Threshold-2 (similarly, Threshold-4) and Threshold-3 (Majority) rules. We then design and analyze a testing algorithm that distinguishes between configurations that are stable with respect to the Threshold-2 rule, and those that are $\epsilon$-far from any stable configuration, where the query complexity of the algorithm is independent of the size of the configuration and depends quadratically on $1/\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>A Black-Box Approach for Exogenous Replenishment in Online Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a typical online resource allocation problem, we start with a fixed inventory of resources and make online allocation decisions in response to resource requests that arrive sequentially over a finite horizon. We consider settings where the inventory is replenished over time according to an unknown exogenous process. We introduce black-box methods that extend any existing algorithm, originally designed without considering replenishment, into one that works with an arbitrary (adversarial or stochastic) replenishment process. Our approach preserves the original algorithm's competitive ratio in regimes with large initial inventory, thereby enabling the seamless integration of exogenous replenishment into a large body of existing algorithmic results for both adversarial and stochastic arrival models.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Synthetic Graphs Preserving Triangle-Motif Cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of releasing a differentially private (DP) synthetic graph $G'$ that well approximates the triangle-motif sizes of all cuts of any given graph $G$, where a motif in general refers to a frequently occurring subgraph within complex networks. Non-private versions of such graphs have found applications in diverse fields such as graph clustering, graph sparsification, and social network analysis. Specifically, we present the first $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP mechanism that, given an input graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges and local sensitivity of triangles $\ell_{3}(G)$, generates a synthetic graph $G'$ in polynomial time, approximating the triangle-motif sizes of all cuts $(S,V\setminus S)$ of the input graph $G$ up to an additive error of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{m\ell_{3}(G)}n/\varepsilon^{3/2})$. Additionally, we provide a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{mn}\ell_{3}(G)/\varepsilon)$ on the additive error for any DP algorithm that answers the triangle-motif size queries of all $(S,T)$-cut of $G$. Finally, our algorithm generalizes to weighted graphs, and our lower bound extends to any $K_h$-motif cut for any constant $h\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Predict, Reposition, and Allocate: A Greedy and Flow-Based Architecture for Sustainable Urban Food Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of food delivery platforms has reshaped urban mobility but has also contributed significantly to environmental degradation through increased greenhouse gas emissions. Existing optimization mechanisms produce sub-optimal outcomes as they do not consider environmental sustainability their optimization objective. This study proposes a novel eco-friendly food delivery optimization framework that integrates demand prediction, delivery person routing, and order allocation to minimize environmental impact while maintaining service efficiency. Since recommending routes is NP-Hard, the proposed approach utilizes the submodular and monotone properties of the objective function and designs an efficient greedy optimization algorithm. Thereafter, it formulates order allocation problem as a network flow optimization model, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explored in the context of food delivery. A three-layered network architecture is designed to match orders with delivery personnel based on capacity constraints and spatial demand. Through this framework, the proposed approach reduces the vehicle count, and creates a sustainable food delivery ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Language Generation in the Limit: Noise, Loss, and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kleinberg and Mullainathan (2024) recently proposed a formal framework called language generation in the limit and showed that given a sequence of example strings from an unknown target language drawn from any countable collection, an algorithm can correctly generate unseen strings from the target language within finite time. This notion was further refined by Li, Raman, and Tewari (2024), who defined stricter categories of non-uniform and uniform generation. They showed that a finite union of uniformly generatable collections is generatable in the limit, and asked if the same is true for non-uniform generation.
  We begin by resolving the question in the negative: we give a uniformly generatable collection and a non-uniformly generatable collection whose union is not generatable in the limit. We then use facets of this construction to further our understanding of several variants of language generation. The first two, generation with noise and without samples, were introduced by Raman and Raman (2025) and Li, Raman, and Tewari (2024) respectively. We show the equivalence of these models for uniform and non-uniform generation, and provide a characterization of non-uniform noisy generation. The former paper asked if there is any separation between noisy and non-noisy generation in the limit -- we show that such a separation exists even with a single noisy string. Finally, we study the framework of generation with feedback, introduced by Charikar and Pabbaraju (2025), where the algorithm is strengthened by allowing it to ask membership queries. We show finite queries add no power, but infinite queries yield a strictly more powerful model.
  In summary, the results in this paper resolve the union-closedness of language generation in the limit, and leverage those techniques (and others) to give precise characterizations for natural variants that incorporate noise, loss, and feedback.</description>

      <title>1.64-Approximation for Chromatic Correlation Clustering via Chromatic Cluster LP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromatic Correlation Clustering (CCC) generalizes Correlation Clustering by assigning multiple categorical relationships (colors) to edges and imposing chromatic constraints on the clusters. Unlike traditional Correlation Clustering, which only deals with binary $(+/-)$ relationships, CCC captures richer relational structures. Despite its importance, improving the approximation for CCC has been difficult due to the limitations of standard LP relaxations. We present a randomized $1.64$-approximation algorithm to the CCC problem, significantly improving the previous factor of $2.15$. Our approach extends the cluster LP framework to the chromatic setting by introducing a chromatic cluster LP relaxation and an rounding algorithm that utilizes both a cluster-based and a greedy pivot-based strategy. The analysis bypasses the integrality gap of $2$ for the CCC version of standard LP and highlights the potential of the cluster LP framework to address other variants of clustering problems.</description>

      <title>Job Scheduling under Base and Additional Fees, with Applications to Mixed-Criticality Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the problem of scheduling $n$ jobs onto $m$ identical machines. Each machine has to be in operation for a prescribed time, and the objective is to minimize the total machine working time. Precisely, let $c_i$ be the prescribed time for machine $i$, where $i\in[m]$, and $p_j$ be the processing time for job $j$, where $j\in[n]$. The problem asks for a schedule $\sigma\colon\, J\to M$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^m\max\{c_i, \sum_{j\in\sigma^{-1}(i)}p_j\}$ is minimized, where $J$ and $M$ denote the sets of jobs and machines, respectively. We show that First Fit Decreasing (FFD) leads to a $1.5$-approximation, and this problem admits a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS). The idea is further applied to mixed-criticality system scheduling to yield improved approximation results.</description>

      <title>An $n^{O(\log\log n)}$ time approximation scheme for capacitated VRP in the Euclidean plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quasi polynomial time approximation scheme (Q-PTAS) for the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) on $n$ points in the Euclidean plane for arbitrary capacity $c$. The running time is $n^{f(\epsilon)\cdot\log\log n}$ for any $c$, and where $f$ is a function of $\epsilon$ only. This is a major improvement over the so far best known running time of $n^{\log^{O(1/\epsilon)}n}$ time and a big step towards a PTAS for Euclidean CVRP.
  In our algorithm, we first give a polynomial time reduction of the CVRP in $\mathbb{R}^d$ (for any fixed $d$) to an uncapacitated routing problem in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that we call the $m$-paths problem. Here, one needs to find exactly $m$ paths between two points $a$ and $b$, covering all the given points in the Euclidean space. We then give a Q-PTAS for the $m$-paths problem in the pane. Any PTAS for the (arguably easier to handle) Euclidean $m$-paths problem is most likely to imply a PTAS for the Euclidean CVRP.</description>

      <title>Fast Algorithms for Graph Arboricity and Related Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an algorithm for finding the arboricity of a weighted, undirected graph, defined as the minimum number of spanning forests that cover all edges of the graph, in $\sqrt{n} m^{1+o(1)}$ time. This improves on the previous best bound of $\tilde{O}(nm)$ for weighted graphs and $\tilde{O}(m^{3/2}) $ for unweighted graphs (Gabow 1995) for this problem. The running time of our algorithm is dominated by a logarithmic number of calls to a directed global minimum cut subroutine -- if the running time of the latter problem improves to $m^{1+o(1)}$ (thereby matching the running time of maximum flow), the running time of our arboricity algorithm would improve further to $m^{1+o(1)}$.
  We also give a new algorithm for computing the entire cut hierarchy -- laminar multiway cuts with minimum cut ratio in recursively defined induced subgraphs -- in $m n^{1+o(1)}$ time. The cut hierarchy yields the ideal edge loads (Thorup 2001) in a fractional spanning tree packing of the graph which, we show, also corresponds to a max-entropy solution in the spanning tree polytope. For the cut hierarchy problem, the previous best bound was $\tilde{O}(n^2 m)$ for weighted graphs and $\tilde{O}(n m^{3/2})$ for unweighted graphs.</description>

      <title>On zeros and algorithms for disordered systems: mean-field spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin glasses are fundamental probability distributions at the core of statistical physics, the theory of average-case computational complexity, and modern high-dimensional statistical inference. In the mean-field setting, we design deterministic quasipolynomial-time algorithms for estimating the partition function to arbitrarily high accuracy for nearly all inverse temperatures in the second moment regime. In particular, for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model, our algorithms succeed for almost the entire replica-symmetric phase. To achieve this, we study the locations of the zeros of the partition function. Notably, our methods are conceptually simple, and apply equally well to the spherical case and the case of Ising spins.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Collective Tree Exploration: a Distributed Algorithm, and a new Lower Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of collective tree exploration in which a team of $k$ mobile agents must collectively visit all nodes of an unknown tree in as few moves as possible. The agents all start from the root and discover adjacent edges as they progress in the tree. Communication is distributed in the sense that agents share information by reading and writing on whiteboards located at all nodes. Movements are asynchronous, in the sense that the speeds of all agents are controlled by an adversary at all times. All previous competitive guarantees for collective tree exploration are either distributed but synchronous, or asynchronous but centralized. In contrast, we present a distributed asynchronous algorithm that explores any tree of $n$ nodes and depth $D$ in at most $2n+O(k^2 2^kD)$ moves, i.e., with a regret that is linear in $D$, and a variant algorithm with a guarantee in $O(k/\log k)(n+kD)$, i.e., with a competitive ratio in $O(k/\log k)$. We note that our regret guarantee is asymptotically optimal (i.e., $1$-competitive) from the perspective of average-case complexity. We then present a new general lower bound on the competitive ratio of asynchronous collective tree exploration, in $\Omega(\log^2 k)$. This lower bound applies to both the distributed and centralized settings, and improves upon the previous lower bound in $\Omega(\log k)$.</description>

      <title>Topological Social Choice: Designing a Noise-Robust Polar Distance for Persistence Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has emerged as a powerful framework for extracting robust and interpretable features from noisy high-dimensional data. In the context of Social Choice Theory, where preference profiles and collective decisions are geometrically rich yet sensitive to perturbations, TDA remains largely unexplored. This work introduces a novel conceptual bridge between these domains by proposing a new metric framework for persistence diagrams tailored to noisy preference data.We define a polar coordinate-based distance that captures both the magnitude and orientation of topological features in a smooth and differentiable manner. Our metric addresses key limitations of classical distances, such as bottleneck and Wasserstein, including instability under perturbation, lack of continuity, and incompatibility with gradient-based learning. The resulting formulation offers improved behavior in both theoretical and applied settings.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically apply persistent homology to social choice systems, providing a mathematically grounded method for comparing topological summaries of voting structures and preference dynamics. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach through extensive experiments, including robustness tests and supervised learning tasks, and we propose a modular pipeline for building predictive models from online preference data. This work contributes a conceptually novel and computationally effective tool to the emerging interface of topology and decision theory, opening new directions in interpretable machine learning for political and economic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation Based on LimTDD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation is a fundamental task in quantum computing and quantum information processing. With the rapid advancement of quantum technologies, efficient quantum state preparation has become increasingly important. This paper proposes a novel approach for quantum state preparation based on the Local Invertible Map Tensor Decision Diagram (LimTDD). LimTDD combines the advantages of tensor networks and decision diagrams, enabling efficient representation and manipulation of quantum states. Compared with the state-of-the-art quantum state preparation method, LimTDD demonstrates substantial improvements in efficiency when dealing with complex quantum states, while also reducing the complexity of quantum circuits. Examples indicate that, in the best-case scenario, our method can achieve exponential efficiency gains over existing methods. This study not only highlights the potential of LimTDD in quantum state preparation but also provides a robust theoretical and practical foundation for the future development of quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <title>$k$-PCA for (non-squared) Euclidean Distances: Polynomial Time Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an integer $k\geq1$ and a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\REAL^d$, the classic $k$-PCA (Principle Component Analysis) approximates the affine \emph{$k$-subspace mean} of $P$, which is the $k$-dimensional affine linear subspace that minimizes its sum of squared Euclidean distances ($\ell_{2,2}$-norm) over the points of $P$, i.e., the mean of these distances. The \emph{$k$-subspace median} is the subspace that minimizes its sum of (non-squared) Euclidean distances ($\ell_{2,1}$-mixed norm), i.e., their median. The median subspace is usually more sparse and robust to noise/outliers than the mean, but also much harder to approximate since, unlike the $\ell_{z,z}$ (non-mixed) norms, it is non-convex for $k&lt;d-1$.
  We provide the first polynomial-time deterministic algorithm whose both running time and approximation factor are not exponential in $k$. More precisely, the multiplicative approximation factor is $\sqrt{d}$, and the running time is polynomial in the size of the input. We expect that our technique would be useful for many other related problems, such as $\ell_{2,z}$ norm of distances for $z\not \in \br{1,2}$, e.g., $z=\infty$, and handling outliers/sparsity.
  Open code and experimental results on real-world datasets are also provided.</description>

Abstract: Two graphs $G_1,G_2$ are distinguished by the Weisfeiler--Leman isomorphism test if and only if there is a tree $T$ that has a different number of homomorphisms to $G_1$ and to $G_2$. There are two known proofs of this fact -- a logical proof by Dvorak and a linear-algebraic proof by Dell, Grohe, and Rattan. We give another simple proof, based on ordering WL-labels and asymptotic arguments.</description>

      <title>Probing EFX via PMMS: (Non-)Existence Results in Discrete Fair Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fair division of indivisible items and provide new insights into the EFX problem, which is widely regarded as the central open question in fair division, and the PMMS problem, a strictly stronger variant of EFX. Our first result constructs a three-agent instance with two monotone valuations and one additive valuation in which no PMMS allocation exists. Since EFX allocations are known to exist under these assumptions, this establishes a formal separation between EFX and PMMS.
  We prove existence of fair allocations for three important special cases. We show that EFX allocations exist for personalized bivalued valuations, where for each agent $i$ there exist values $a_i &gt; b_i$ such that agent $i$ assigns value $v_i(\{g\}) \in \{a_i, b_i\}$ to each good $g$. We establish an analogous existence result for PMMS allocations when $a_i$ is divisible by $b_i$. We also prove that PMMS allocations exist for binary-valued MMS-feasible valuations, where each bundle $S$ has value $v_i(S) \in \{0, 1\}$. Notably, this result holds even without assuming monotonicity of valuations and thus applies to the fair division of chores and mixed manna. Finally, we study a class of valuations called pair-demand valuations, which extend the well-studied unit-demand valuations to the case where each agent derives value from at most two items, and we show that PMMS allocations exist in this setting. Our proofs are constructive, and we provide polynomial-time algorithms for all three existence results.</description>

      <title>Better Models and Algorithms for Learning Ising Models from Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning the structure and parameters of the Ising model, a fundamental model of high-dimensional data, when observing the evolution of an associated Markov chain. A recent line of work has studied the natural problem of learning when observing an evolution of the well-known Glauber dynamics [Bresler, Gamarnik, Shah, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2018, Gaitonde, Mossel STOC 2024], which provides an arguably more realistic generative model than the classical i.i.d. setting. However, this prior work crucially assumes that all site update attempts are observed, \emph{even when this attempt does not change the configuration}: this strong observation model is seemingly essential for these approaches. While perhaps possible in restrictive contexts, this precludes applicability to most realistic settings where we can observe \emph{only} the stochastic evolution itself, a minimal and natural assumption for any process we might hope to learn from. However, designing algorithms that succeed in this more realistic setting has remained an open problem [Bresler, Gamarnik, Shah, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2018, Gaitonde, Moitra, Mossel, STOC 2025].
  In this work, we give the first algorithms that efficiently learn the Ising model in this much more natural observation model that only observes when the configuration changes. For Ising models with maximum degree $d$, our algorithm recovers the underlying dependency graph in time $\mathsf{poly}(d)\cdot n^2\log n$ and then the actual parameters in additional $\widetilde{O}(2^d n)$ time, which qualitatively matches the state-of-the-art even in the i.i.d. setting in a much weaker observation model. Our analysis holds more generally for a broader class of reversible, single-site Markov chains that also includes the popular Metropolis chain by leveraging more robust properties of reversible Markov chains.</description>

      <title>On Algorithmic Robustness of Corrupted Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic robustness of general finite Markov chains in terms of their stationary distributions to general, adversarial corruptions of the transition matrix. We show that for Markov chains admitting a spectral gap, variants of the \emph{PageRank} chain are robust in the sense that, given an \emph{arbitrary} corruption of the edges emanating from an $\epsilon$-measure of the nodes, the PageRank distribution of the corrupted chain will be $\mathsf{poly}(\varepsilon)$ close in total variation to the original distribution under mild conditions on the restart distribution. Our work thus shows that PageRank serves as a simple regularizer against broad, realistic corruptions with algorithmic guarantees that are dimension-free and scale gracefully in terms of necessary and natural parameters.</description>

      <title>A Myhill-Nerode Type Characterization of 2detLIN Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear automata are automata with two reading heads starting from the two extremes of the input, are equivalent to 5' -&gt; 3' Watson-Crick (WK) finite automata. The heads read the input in opposite directions and the computation finishes when the heads meet. These automata accept the class LIN of linear languages. The deterministic counterpart of these models, on the one hand, is less expressive, as only a proper subset of LIN, the class 2detLIN is accepted; and on the other hand, they are also equivalent in the sense of the class of the accepted languages. Now, based on these automata models, we characterize the class of 2detLIN languages with a Myhill-Nerode type of equivalence classes. However, as these automata may do the computation of both the prefix and the suffix of the input, we use prefix-suffix pairs in our classes. Additionally, it is proven that finitely many classes in the characterization match with the 2detLIN languages, but we have some constraints on the used prefix-suffix pairs, i.e., the characterization should have the property to be complete and it must not have any crossing pairs.</description>

      <title>Certificate-Sensitive Subset Sum: Realizing Instance Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present, to our knowledge, the first deterministic, certificate-sensitive algorithm for a canonical NP-complete problem whose runtime provably adapts to the structure of each input. For a Subset-Sum instance $(S, t)$, let $\Sigma(S)$ denote the set of distinct subset sums and define $U = |\Sigma(S)|$. This set serves as an information-theoretically minimal witness, the instance-complexity (IC) certificate.
  Our solver, IC-SubsetSum, enumerates every element of $\Sigma(S)$ in deterministic time $O(U \cdot n^2)$ and space $O(U \cdot n)$. A randomized variant achieves expected runtime $O(U \cdot n)$. The algorithm's complexity is thus directly governed by the certificate size, and this structure-sensitive performance is paired with a guaranteed worst-case runtime of $O^*(2^{n/2 - \varepsilon})$ for some constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the first such result to strictly outperform classical methods on every instance.
  We revisit fine-grained reductions that rely on the classical $2^{n/2}$ hardness of SubsetSum and show that these arguments hold only for collision-free instances where $U$ is maximal. IC-SubsetSum reframes this barrier structurally and introduces a new paradigm for certificate-sensitive algorithms across NP-complete problems.</description>

      <title>Monotone Submodular Multiway Partition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In submodular multiway partition (SUB-MP), the input is a non-negative submodular function $f:2^V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ given by an evaluation oracle along with $k$ terminals $t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k\in V$. The goal is to find a partition $V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k$ of $V$ with $t_i\in V_i$ for every $i\in [k]$ in order to minimize $\sum_{i=1}^k f(V_i)$. In this work, we focus on SUB-MP when the input function is monotone (termed MONO-SUB-MP). MONO-SUB-MP formulates partitioning problems over several interesting structures -- e.g., matrices, matroids, graphs, and hypergraphs. MONO-SUB-MP is NP-hard since the graph multiway cut problem can be cast as a special case. We investigate the approximability of MONO-SUB-MP: we show that it admits a $4/3$-approximation and does not admit a $(10/9-\epsilon)$-approximation for every constant $\epsilon&gt;0$. Next, we study a special case of MONO-SUB-MP where the monotone submodular function of interest is the coverage function of an input graph, termed GRAPH-COVERAGE-MP. GRAPH-COVERAGE-MP is equivalent to the classic multiway cut problem for the purposes of exact optimization. We show that GRAPH-COVERAGE-MP admits a $1.125$-approximation and does not admit a $(1.00074-\epsilon)$-approximation for every constant $\epsilon&gt;0$ assuming the Unique Games Conjecture. These results separate GRAPH-COVERAGE-MP from graph multiway cut in terms of approximability.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing matchings in general graphs plays a central role in graph algorithms. However, despite the recent interest in differentially private graph algorithms, there has been limited work on private matchings. Moreover, almost all existing work focuses on estimating the size of the maximum matching, whereas in many applications, the matching itself is the object of interest. There is currently only a single work on private algorithms for computing matching solutions by [HHRRW STOC'14]. Moreover, their work focuses on allocation problems and hence is limited to bipartite graphs.
  Motivated by the importance of computing matchings in sensitive graph data, we initiate the study of differentially private algorithms for computing maximal and maximum matchings in general graphs. We provide a number of algorithms and lower bounds for this problem in different models and settings. We first prove a lower bound showing that computing explicit solutions necessarily incurs large error, even if we try to obtain privacy by allowing ourselves to output non-edges. We then consider implicit solutions, where at the end of the computation there is an ($\varepsilon$-differentially private) billboard and each node can determine its matched edge(s) based on what is written on this publicly visible billboard. For this solution concept, we provide tight upper and lower (bicriteria) bounds, where the degree bound is violated by a logarithmic factor (which we show is necessary). We further show that our algorithm can be made distributed in the local edge DP (LEDP) model, and can even be done in a logarithmic number of rounds if we further relax the degree bounds by logarithmic factors. Our edge-DP matching algorithms give rise to new matching algorithms in the node-DP setting by combining our edge-DP algorithms with a novel use of arboricity sparsifiers. [...]</description>

      <title>An Efficient Frequency-Based Approach for Maximal Square Detection in Binary Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting maximal square submatrices of ones in binary matrices is a fundamental problem with applications in computer vision and pattern recognition. While the standard dynamic programming (DP) solution achieves optimal asymptotic complexity, its practical performance suffers from repeated minimum operations and inefficient memory access patterns that degrade cache utilization. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel frequency-based algorithm that employs a greedy approach to track the columnar continuity of ones through an adaptive frequency array and a dynamic thresholding mechanism. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates that the frequency-based algorithm achieves faster performance than the standard DP in 100% of test cases with an average speedup of 3.32x, a maximum speedup of 4.60x, and a minimum speedup of 2.31x across matrices up to 5000x5000 with densities from 0.1 to 0.9. The algorithm's average speedup exceeds 2.5x for all densities and rises to over 3.5x for densities of 0.7 and higher across all matrix sizes. These results demonstrate that the frequency-based approach is a superior alternative to standard DP and opens new possibilities for efficient matrix analysis in performance-critical applications.</description>

      <title>Faster Low-Rank Approximation and Kernel Ridge Regression via the Block-Nystr\"om Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nystr\"om method is a popular low-rank approximation technique for large matrices that arise in kernel methods and convex optimization. Yet, when the data exhibits heavy-tailed spectral decay, the effective dimension of the problem often becomes so large that even the Nystr\"om method may be outside of our computational budget. To address this, we propose Block-Nystr\"om, an algorithm that injects a block-diagonal structure into the Nystr\"om method, thereby significantly reducing its computational cost while recovering strong approximation guarantees. We show that Block-Nystr\"om can be used to construct improved preconditioners for second-order optimization, as well as to efficiently solve kernel ridge regression for statistical learning over Hilbert spaces. Our key technical insight is that, within the same computational budget, combining several smaller Nystr\"om approximations leads to stronger tail estimates of the input spectrum than using one larger approximation. Along the way, we provide a novel recursive preconditioning scheme for efficiently inverting the Block-Nystr\"om matrix, and provide new statistical learning bounds for a broad class of approximate kernel ridge regression solvers.</description>

Abstract: The original description of the k-d tree recognized that rebalancing techniques, such as used to build an AVL tree or a red-black tree, are not applicable to a k-d tree. Hence, in order to build a balanced k-d tree, it is necessary to find the median of a set of data for each recursive subdivision of that set. The sort or selection used to find the median, and the technique used to partition the set about that median, strongly influence the computational complexity of building a k-d tree. This article describes and contrasts three k-d tree-building algorithms that differ in their technique used to partition the set, and compares the performance of the algorithms. In addition, dual-threaded execution is proposed for one of the three algorithms.</description>

      <title>25 Additional Problems -- Extension to the Book "125 Problems in Text Algorithms"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This very preliminary text is related to ``Algorithms on Texts'', also called ``Algorithmic Stringology''. It is an extension of the book ``125 Problems in Text Algorithms'' providing, in the same compact style, more problems with solutions. We refer also to the companions to ``Text algorithms'' available at http://monge.univ-mlv.fr/~mac/CLR/clr1-20.pdf and at the web page http://125-problems.univ-mlv.fr, where all 150 problems (including the ones presented here) are briefly announced. The selected problems satisfy three criteria: challenging, having short tricky solutions and solvable with only very basic background in stringology. For the basics in stringology we refer to http://monge.univ-mlv.fr/~mac/CLR/clr1-20.pdf.</description>

      <title>Improved bicriteria approximation for $k$-edge-connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the $k$-Edge Connected Spanning Subgraph ($k$-ECSS) problem we are given a (multi-)graph $G=(V,E)$ with edge costs and an integer $k$, and seek a min-cost $k$-edge-connected spanning subgraph of $G$. The problem admits a $2$-approximation algorithm and no better approximation ratio is known. Hershkowitz, Klein, and Zenklusen [STOC 24] gave a bicriteria $(1,k-10)$-approximation algorithm that computes a $(k-10)$-edge-connected spanning subgraph of cost at most the optimal value of a standard Cut-LP for $k$-ECSS. This LP bicriteria approximation was recently improved by Cohen and Nutov [ESA 25] to $(1,k-4)$, where also was given a bicriteria approximation $(3/2,k-2)$. In this paper we improve the bicriteria approximation to $(1,k-2)$ for $k$ even and to $\left(1-\frac{1}{k},k-3\right)$ for $k$ is odd, and also give another bicriteria approximation $(3/2,k-1)$. After this paper was written, we became aware that the same result was achieved earlier by Kumar and Swamy.
  The $k$-Edge-Connected Spanning Multi-subgraph ($k$-ECSM) problem is almost the same as $k$-ECSS, except that any edge can be selected multiple times at the same cost. The previous best approximation ratio for $k$-ECSM was $1+4/k$. Our result improves this to $1+\frac{2}{k}$ for $k$ even and to $1+\frac{3}{k}$ for $k$ odd, where for $k$ odd the computed subgraph is in fact $(k+1)$-edge-connected.</description>

      <title>Recognizing and Eliciting Weakly Single Crossing Profiles on Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:1611.04175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the weakly single-crossing domain on trees which is a generalization of the well-studied single-crossing domain in social choice theory. We design a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing preference profiles which belong to this domain. We then develop an efficient elicitation algorithm for this domain which works even if the preferences can be accessed only sequentially and the underlying single-crossing tree structure is not known beforehand. We also prove matching lower bound on the query complexity of our elicitation algorithm when the number of voters is large compared to the number of candidates. We also prove a lower bound of $\Omega(m^2\log n)$ on the number of queries that any algorithm needs to ask to elicit single crossing profile when random queries are allowed. This resolves an open question in an earlier paper and proves optimality of their preference elicitation algorithm when random queries are allowed.</description>

      <title>Comparison Theorems for the Mixing Times of Systematic and Random Scan Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A popular method for sampling from high-dimensional distributions is the \emph{Gibbs sampler}, which iteratively resamples sites from the conditional distribution of the desired measure given the values of the other coordinates. It is natural to ask to what extent does the order of site updates matter in the mixing time? Two natural choices are (i) standard, or \emph{random scan}, Glauber dynamics where the updated variable is chosen uniformly at random, and (ii) the \emph{systematic scan} dynamics where variables are updated in a fixed, cyclic order. We first show that for systems of dimension $n$, one round of the systematic scan dynamics has spectral gap at most a factor of order $n$ worse than the corresponding spectral gap of a single step of Glauber dynamics, tightening existing bounds in the literature by He, et al. [NeurIPS '16] and Chlebicka, {\L}atuszy\'nski, and Miasodejow [Ann. Appl. Probab. '25]. The corresponding bound on mixing times is sharp even for simple spin systems by an explicit example of Roberts and Rosenthal [Int. J. Statist. Prob. '15]. We complement this with a converse statement: if all, or even just one scan order rapidly mixes, the Glauber dynamics has a polynomially related mixing time, resolving a question of Chlebicka, {\L}atuszy\'nski, and Miasodejow.</description>

      <title>Interactive proofs for verifying (quantum) learning and testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of testing and learning from data in the presence of resource constraints, such as limited memory or weak data access, which place limitations on the efficiency and feasibility of testing or learning. In particular, we ask the following question: Could a resource-constrained learner/tester use interaction with a resource-unconstrained but untrusted party to solve a learning or testing problem more efficiently than they could without such an interaction? In this work, we answer this question both abstractly and for concrete problems, in two complementary ways: For a wide variety of scenarios, we prove that a resource-constrained learner cannot gain any advantage through classical interaction with an untrusted prover. As a special case, we show that for the vast majority of testing and learning problems in which quantum memory is a meaningful resource, a memory-constrained quantum algorithm cannot overcome its limitations via classical communication with a memory-unconstrained quantum prover. In contrast, when quantum communication is allowed, we construct a variety of interactive proof protocols, for specific learning and testing problems, which allow memory-constrained quantum verifiers to gain significant advantages through delegation to untrusted provers. These results highlight both the limitations and potential of delegating learning and testing problems to resource-rich but untrusted third parties.</description>

      <title>Integer and Unsplittable Multiflows in Series-Parallel Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An unsplittable multiflow routes the demand of each commodity along a single path from its source to its sink node. As our main result, we prove that in series-parallel digraphs, any given multiflow can be expressed as a convex combination of unsplittable multiflows, where the total flow on any arc deviates from the given flow by less than the maximum demand of any commodity. This result confirms a 25-year-old conjecture by Goemans for single-source unsplittable flows, as well as a stronger recent conjecture by Morell and Skutella, for series-parallel digraphs - even for general multiflow instances where commodities have distinct source and sink nodes. Previously, no non-trivial class of digraphs was known for which either conjecture holds. En route to proving this result, we also establish strong integrality results for multiflows on series-parallel digraphs, showing that their computation can be reduced to a simple single-commodity network flow problem.</description>

      <title>Weighted Pseudorandom Generators for Read-Once Branching Programs via Weighted Pseudorandom Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08272v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study weighted pseudorandom generators (WPRGs) and derandomizations for read-once branching programs (ROBPs). Denote $n$ and $w$ as the length and the width of a ROBP. We have the following results.
  For standard ROBPs, we give an explicit $\varepsilon$-WPRG with seed length
  $$O\left(\frac{\log n\log (nw)}{\max\left\{1,\log\log w-\log\log n\right\}}+\log w \left(\log\log\log w-\log\log\max\left\{2,\frac{\log w}{\log \frac{n}{\varepsilon}}\right\}\right)+\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right).$$
  For permutation ROBPs with unbounded widths and single accept nodes, we give an explicit $\varepsilon$-WPRG with seed length
  $$O\left( \log n\left( \log\log n + \sqrt{\log(1/\varepsilon)} \right)+\log(1/\varepsilon)\right). $$
  We also give a new Nisan-Zuckerman style derandomization for regular ROBPs with width $w$, length $n = 2^{O(\sqrt{\log w})}$, and multiple accept nodes. We attain optimal space complexity $O(\log w)$ for arbitrary approximation error $\varepsilon = 1/\text{poly} (w)$.
  All our results are based on iterative weighted pseudorandom reductions, which can iteratively reduce fooling long ROBPs to fooling short ones.</description>

      <title>On optimal distinguishers for Planted Clique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a distinguishing problem, the input is a sample drawn from one of two distributions and the algorithm is tasked with identifying the source distribution. The performance of a distinguishing algorithm is measured by its advantage, i.e., its incremental probability of success over a random guess. A classic example of a distinguishing problem is the Planted Clique problem, where the input is a graph sampled from either $G(n,1/2)$ -- the standard Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model, or $G(n,1/2,k)$ -- the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model with a clique planted on a random subset of $k$ vertices. The Planted Clique Hypothesis asserts that efficient algorithms cannot achieve advantage better than some absolute constant, say $1/4$, whenever $k=n^{1/2-\Omega(1)}$. In this work, we aim to precisely understand the optimal distinguishing advantage achievable by efficient algorithms on Planted Clique. We show the following results under the Planted Clique hypothesis:
  1. Optimality of low-degree polynomials: No efficient algorithm can beat the advantage the optimal low-degree polynomial. Concretely, this means that the advantage of any efficient algorithm is at most $(1+o(1))\cdot k^2/(\sqrt{\pi}n)$, which is optimal in light of a simple edge-counting algorithm achieving this bound.
  2. Harder planted distributions: There is an efficiently sampleable distribution $\mathcal{P}^*$ supported on graphs containing $k$-cliques such that no efficient algorithm can distinguish $\mathcal{P}^*$ from $G(n,1/2)$ with advantage $n^{-d}$ for an arbitrarily large constant $d$. In other words, there exist alternate planted distributions that are much harder than $G(n,1/2,k)$. Along the way, we prove a constructive hard-core lemma for a broad class of distributions with respect to low-degree polynomials. This result is applicable much more widely beyond Planted Clique and might be of independent interest.</description>
