      <title>Revisiting the accretion disc spectra of Dwarf Novae and Novalike variables: implications for the standard disc model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion discs are fundamental to much of astronomy. They can occur around stars both young and old, around compact objects they provide a window into the extremes of physics, and around supermassive black holes in galaxy centres they generate spectacular luminosities that can outshine the entire galaxy. However, our understanding of the inner workings of accretion discs remains far from complete. Here we revisit a conundrum in the observations of some of the simplest accreting systems; the Cataclysmic Variables (CVs). The high-accretion-rate states of (non-magnetic) CVs can be divided into the short-lived outbursts ($\sim$ a week) typical of dwarf novae (DNe) and the long-lived (and sometimes perpetual) high states of nova-like (NL) CVs. Since both sorts of high-state occur in approximately steady-state accretion discs with similar properties and accretors, we would expect them to display similar spectral energy distributions. However, previous analyses based on UV spectra from the {\it International Ultraviolet Explorer} have shown that their spectral energy distributions are different. We perform a re-analysis of the data using up to date calibrations and distance (and thus dereddening) estimates to test whether this difference persists and whether it is statistically significant over the sample. We find that it does persist and it is statistically significant. We propose routes to investigating this discrepancy further and discuss the implications this has for other accreting systems, such as X-ray binaries, Active Galactic Nuclei and protoplanetary discs.</description>

      <title>UOCS. XIV. Uncovering extremely low mass white dwarfs and blue lurkers in NGC 752</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary pathways of binary systems are vastly different from single stellar evolution, and thus, there is a need to quantify their frequency and diversity. Open clusters are the best test-bed to unveil the secrets of binary populations due to their coeval nature. And the availability of multi-wavelength data in recent years has been critical in characterising the binary population. NGC 752 is a solar metallicity, intermediate-age open cluster located at 460 pc. In this work, we aim to identify the optically subluminous white dwarfs in NGC 752 and identify the illusive blue lurkers by association. We used multiwavelength photometry from Astrosat/UVIT, swift/UVOT, Gaia DR3 and other archival surveys to analyse the colour-magnitude diagrams and spectral energy distributions of 37 cluster members. We detected eight white dwarfs as companions to cluster members. Four of the systems are main sequence stars with extremely low mass white dwarfs as their companions. Two are these main sequence stars are also fast rotators. The presence of low mass white dwarfs and high rotation signals a past mass transfer, and we classified the four main sequence stars as blue lurkers. The binary fraction in NGC 752 was estimated to be 50--70%, and it shows that the contribution of optically undetected stars is crucial in quantifying the present-day binary fraction.</description>

      <title>The Vela Pulsar Progenitor Was Most Likely a Binary Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar evolution theory restricted to single stars predicts a minimum mass for core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) of around eight solar masses; this minimum mass corresponds to a maximum age of around 45 million years for the progenitor and the coeval population of stars. Binary evolution complicates this prediction. For example, an older stellar population around 100 million years could contain stellar mergers that reach the minimum mass for core collapse. Despite this clear prediction by binary evolution, there are few, if any CCSNe associated with a distinctly older stellar population...until now. The stellar population within 150 pc of the Vela Pulsar is inconsistent with single-star evolution only; instead, the most likely solution is that the stellar population is $\ge$80 Myr old, and the brightest stars are mass gainers and/or mergers, the result of binary evolution. The evidence is as follows. Even though the main sequence is clearly dominated by a $\ge$80-Myr-old population, a large fraction of the corresponding red giants is missing. The best-fitting single-star model expects 51.5 red giants, yet there are only 22; the Poisson probability of this is $1.7 \times 10^{-6}$. In addition, there is an overabundance of bright, young-looking stars (25-30 Myrs old), yet there is not a corresponding young main sequence (MS). Upon closer inspection, the vast majority of the young-looking stars show either past or current signs of binary evolution. These new results are possible due to exquisite Gaia parallaxes and a new age-dating software called {\it Stellar Ages}.</description>

      <title>Light Curve Models of Convective Common Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common envelopes are thought to be the main method for producing tight binaries in the universe as the orbital period shrinks by several orders of magnitude during this phase. Despite their importance for various evolutionary channels, direct detections are rare, and thus observational constraints on common envelope physics are often inferred from post-CE populations. Population constraints suggest that the CE phase must be highly inefficient at using orbital energy to drive envelope ejection for low-mass systems and highly efficient for high-mass systems. Such a dichotomy has been explained by an interplay between convection, radiation and orbital decay. If convective transport to the surface occurs faster than the orbit decays, the CE self-regulates and radiatively cools. Once the orbit shrinks such that convective transport is slow compared to orbital decay, a burst occurs as the release of orbital energy can be far in excess of that required to unbind the envelope. With the anticipation of first light for the Rubin Observatory, we calculate light curve models for convective common envelopes and provide the time evolution of apparent magnitudes for the Rubin filters. Convection imparts a distinct signature in the light curves and lengthens the timescales during which they are observable. Given Rubin limiting magnitudes, convective CEs should be detectable out to distances of ~8 Mpc at a rate of ~0.3 per day and provide an intriguing observational test of common envelope physics.</description>

      <title>KIC 4150611: A quadruply eclipsing heptuple star system with a g-mode period-spacing pattern Eclipse modelling of the triple and spectroscopic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KIC 4150611 is a high-order multiple composed of a triple system composed of the F1V primary (Aa), which is eclipsed on a 94.2d period by a tight 1.52d binary composed of two dim K/M dwarfs (Ab1, Ab2), which also eclipse each other; an 8.65d eccentric, eclipsing binary composed of two G stars (Ba, Bb); and another faint eclipsing binary composed of two stars of unknown spectral type (Ca and Cb). In addition to its many eclipses, the system is an SB3 spectroscopic multiple (Aa, Ba, and Bb) and the primary (Aa) is a hybrid pulsator. We employ a novel photometric analysis of the complicated eclipse geometry of Aa to obtain orbital and stellar properties of the triple. We acquired 51 TRES spectra at the Fred L. Whipple Observatory, calculating radial velocities and orbital elements of Aa (SB1) and the B binary (SB2). These spectra and radial velocities are used to perform spectral disentangling for Aa, Ba, and Bb. Spectral modelling is applied to the disentangled spectrum of Aa to obtain atmospheric properties. We obtain precise stellar properties of the triple, including the mass ratios (MAa/(MAb1 + MAb2) = 3.61 +/- 0.01, MAb1/MAb2 = 1.113 +/- 0.001), separation ratio (aAab/aAb1Ab2 = 21.81 +/- 0.01), orbital periods (PAab = 94.29486 +/- 0.00008d, PAb1Ab2 = 1.522248 +/- 0.000001d), and stellar radii (RAa = 1.64 +/- 0.06 Rsun, RAb1 = 0.42 +/- 0.01 Rsun, RAb2 = 0.38 +/- 0.01 Rsun). Radial velocity fitting and spectral disentangling arrive at orbital elements for Aa, Ba, and Bb in excellent agreement with each other and with previous results in the literature. Spectral modelling on the disentangled spectrum of Aa provides constraints on the effective temperature (Teff = 7280 +/- 70 K), surface gravity (log(g) = 4.14 +/- 0.18 dex), micro-turbulent velocity (vmicro = 3.61 +/- 0.19 km s-1), rotation velocity (v sin i = 127 +/- 4 km s-1), and metallicity ([M/H] = -0.23 +/- 0.06).</description>

      <title>Unified Rapid Mass Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to obtain rapid mass loss rates in binary systems, specifically at the onset of MT episodes. The method unifies atmospheric (underflow) and $L_1$ stream (overflow) mass rates in a single continuous procedure. The method uses averaged 3D properties of the binaries, such as effective binary potential and effective binary acceleration, to both evolve the donor and obtain properties of the matter at the $L_1$ plane. In the case of underflow, we obtain atmospheric stratification. Our method can be used for binaries with an extensive range of mass ratios, $0.01 \le q \le 100$, and can also be applied to hot donors. The considered examples show that the MT rates obtained with this revised formalism always differ from the optically thin and optically thick MT rates widely used during the computations of binary evolution.</description>

      <title>Fundamental effective temperature measurements for eclipsing binary stars -- V. The circumbinary planet system EBLM J0608-59</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EBLM J0608-59 / TOI-1338 / BEBOP-1 is a 12th-magnitude, F9V star in an eclipsing binary with a much fainter M-dwarf companion on a wide, eccentric orbit (P=14.6 d). The binary is orbited by two circumbinary planets: one transiting on a 95-day orbit and one non-transiting on a 215-day orbit. We have used high-precision photometry from the TESS mission combined with direct mass measurements for the two stars published recently to measure the following model-independent radii: $R_1 = 1.32 \pm 0.02 R_{\odot}$, $R_2 = 0.309 \pm 0.004 R_{\odot}$. Using $R_1$ and the parallax from Gaia EDR3 we find that this star's angular diameter is $\theta = 0.0309 \pm 0.0005$ mas. The apparent bolometric flux of the primary star corrected for both extinction and the contribution from the M-dwarf ($&lt;0.4$%) is ${\mathcal F}_{\oplus,0} = (0.417\pm 0.005)\times10^{-9} {\rm \,erg\,cm}^{-2} {\rm \,s}^{-1}$. Hence, this F9V star has an effective temperature $T_{\rm eff,1} = 6031{\rm\,K} \pm 46{\rm \,K\,(rnd.)} \pm 10 {\rm \,K\,(sys.)}$. EBLM J0608-59 is an ideal benchmark star that can be added to the sample of such systems we are establishing for "end-to-end" tests of the stellar parameters measured by large-scale spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>An adaptive parameter estimator for poor-quality spectral data of white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs represent the end stage for 97% of stars, making precise parameter measurement crucial for understanding stellar evolution. Traditional estimation methods involve fitting spectra or photometry, which require high-quality data. In recent years, machine learning has played a crucial role in processing spectral data due to its speed, automation, and accuracy. However, two common issues have been identified. First, most studies rely on data with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR &gt; 10), leaving many poor-quality datasets underutilized. Second, existing machine learning models, primarily based on convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and their variants, cannot simultaneously capture both the spatial and sequential information of spectra. To address these challenges, we designed the Estimator Network (EstNet), an advanced algorithm integrating multiple techniques, including Residual Networks, Squeeze and Excitation Attention, Gated Recurrent Units, Adaptive Loss, and Monte-Carlo Dropout Layers. We conducted parameter estimation on 5,965 poor-quality white dwarf spectra (R~1800, SNR~1.17), achieving average percentage errors of 14.86% for effective temperature and 3.97% for surface gravity. These results are significantly superior to other mainstream algorithms and consistent with the outcomes of traditional theoretical spectrum fitting methods. In the future, our algorithms will be applied for large-scale parameter estimation on the Chinese Space Station Telescope and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the emission of gravitational waves produced by the magnetosphere of magnetars. We argue that several features in the spectrum could facilitate the identification of that source. In addition, in cases of extremely large magnetic fields we demonstrate that this emission can make the braking index of such stars to be well over 3, which is the standard prediction of the magnetic dipole radiation and aligned rotator mechanisms. A similar picture arises if one focuses on the second braking index. Moreover the braking index depends on both the rotational frequency and the strength of the magnetic field in striking difference from the other mechanisms. We also show that gravitational waves can be produced by polar gap regions due to their rapid charge-discharge process that takes place in timescales from nanosec to microsec. This can provide an alternative way to probe magnetars and test the polar gap model.</description>

      <title>Shockingly Bright Warm Carbon Monoxide Molecular Features in the Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia A Revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present JWST NIRCam (F356W and F444W filters) and MIRI (F770W) images and NIRSpec- IFU spectroscopy of the young supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A). We obtained the data as part of a JWST survey of Cas A. The NIRCam and MIRI images map the spatial distributions of synchrotron radiation, Ar-rich ejecta, and CO on both large and small scales, revealing remarkably complex structures. The CO emission is stronger at the outer layers than the Ar ejecta, which indicates the reformation of CO molecules behind the reverse shock. NIRSpec-IFU spectra (3 - 5.5 microns) were obtained toward two representative knots in the NE and S fields. Both regions are dominated by the bright fundamental rovibrational band of CO in the two R and P branches, with strong [Ar VI] and relatively weaker, variable strength ejecta lines of [Si IX], [Ca IV], [Ca V] and [Mg IV]. The NIRSpec-IFU data resolve individual ejecta knots and filaments spatially and in velocity space. The fundamental CO band in the JWST spectra reveals unique shapes of CO, showing a few tens of sinusoidal patterns of rovibrational lines with pseudo-continuum underneath, which is attributed to the high-velocity widths of CO lines. The CO also shows high J lines at different vibrational transitions. Our results with LTE modeling of CO emission indicate a temperature of 1080 K and provide unique insight into the correlations between dust, molecules, and highly ionized ejecta in supernovae, and have strong ramifications for modeling dust formation that is led by CO cooling in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>High contrast at short separation with VLTI/GRAVITY: Bringing Gaia companions to light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since 2019, GRAVITY has provided direct observations of giant planets and brown dwarfs at separations of down to 95 mas from the host star. Some of these observations have provided the first direct confirmation of companions previously detected by indirect techniques (astrometry and radial velocities). We want to improve the observing strategy and data reduction in order to lower the inner working angle of GRAVITY in dual-field on-axis mode. We also want to determine the current limitations of the instrument when observing faint companions with separations in the 30-150 mas range. To improve the inner working angle, we propose a fiber off-pointing strategy during the observations to maximize the ratio of companion-light-to-star-light coupling in the science fiber. We also tested a lower-order model for speckles to decouple the companion light from the star light. We then evaluated the detection limits of GRAVITY using planet injection and retrieval in representative archival data. We compare our results to theoretical expectations. We validate our observing and data-reduction strategy with on-sky observations; first in the context of brown dwarf follow-up on the auxiliary telescopes with HD 984 B, and second with the first confirmation of a substellar candidate around the star Gaia DR3 2728129004119806464. With synthetic companion injection, we demonstrate that the instrument can detect companions down to a contrast of $8\times 10^{-4}$ ($\Delta \mathrm{K}= 7.7$ mag) at a separation of 35 mas, and a contrast of $3\times 10^{-5}$ ($\Delta \mathrm{K}= 11$ mag) at 100 mas from a bright primary (K&lt;6.5), for 30 min exposure time. With its inner working angle and astrometric precision, GRAVITY has a unique reach in direct observation parameter space. This study demonstrates the promising synergies between GRAVITY and Gaia for the confirmation and characterization of substellar companions.</description>

      <title>Disk Evolution Study Through Imaging of Nearby Young Stars (DESTINYS): PDS 111, an old T Tauri star with a young-looking disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between T Tauri stars and their circumstellar disks, and how this impacts the onset of planet formation has yet to be established. We studied a seemingly old T Tauri star, PDS 111, and its disk. We analyzed optical, infrared, and sub-millimeter observations obtained with VLT/X-shooter, Mercator/HERMES, TESS, VLT/SPHERE, and ALMA, providing a new view on PDS 111 and its protoplanetary disk. The multi-epoch spectroscopy yields photospheric lines to classify the star, and emission lines to study variability in the hot inner disk and to determine the mass-accretion rate. The SPHERE and ALMA observations are used to characterize the dust distribution of the small and large grains, respectively. PDS 111 is a weak-line T Tauri star with spectral type G2, exhibits strong H$\alpha$ variability and with a low mass-accretion rate of $1-5\times10^{-10}$\,M$_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$. We measured an age of the system of 15.9$^{+1.7}_{-3.7}$ Myr using pre-main sequence tracks. The SPHERE observations show a strongly flaring disk with an asymmetric substructure. The ALMA observations reveal a 30 au cavity in the dust continuum emission with a low contrast asymmetry in the South-West of the disk and a dust disk mass of 45.8\,$M_\oplus$. The $^{12}$CO radial extension is at least three times larger than that of the dust emission. Although the measured age is younger than suggested in literature, PDS 111 still seems relatively old; this provides insight into disk properties at an advanced stage of pre-main sequence evolution. The characteristics of this disk are very similar to its younger counterparts: strongly flaring, an average disk mass, a typical radial extent of the disk gas and dust, and the presence of common substructures. This suggests that disk evolution has not significantly changed the disk properties. These results show similarities with the "Peter Pan disks" around M-dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Trials and Tribulations in the Reanalysis of KELT-24 b: a Case Study for the Importance of Stellar Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new analysis of the KELT-24 system, comprising a well-aligned hot Jupiter, KELT-24~b, and a bright ($V=8.3$), nearby ($d=96.9~\mathrm{pc}$) F-type host star. KELT-24~b was independently discovered by two groups in 2019, with each reporting best-fit stellar parameters that were notably inconsistent. Here, we present three independent analyses of the KELT-24 system, each incorporating a broad range of photometric and spectroscopic data, including eight sectors of TESS photometry and more than 200 new radial velocities (RVs) from MINERVA. Two of these analyses use KELT-24's observed spectral energy distribution (SED) through a direct comparison to stellar evolutionary models, while our third analysis assumes an unknown additional body contributing to the observed broadband photometry and excludes the SED. Ultimately, we find that the models that include the SED are a poor fit to the available data, so we adopt the system parameters derived without it. We also highlight a single transit-like event observed by TESS, deemed likely to be an eclipsing binary bound to KELT-24, that will require follow-up observations to confirm. We discuss the potential of these additional bodies in the KELT-24 system as a possible explanation for the discrepancies between the results of the different modeling approaches, and explore the system for longer-period planets that may be weakly evident in the RV observations. The comprehensive investigations that we present not only increase the fidelity of our understanding of the KELT-24 system, but also serve as a blueprint for future stellar modeling in global analyses of exoplanet systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the directly imaged HD 1160 system through spectroscopic characterization and high-cadence variability monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time variability and spectra of directly imaged companions provide insight into their physical properties and atmospheric dynamics. We present follow-up R~40 spectrophotometric monitoring of red companion HD 1160 B at 2.8-4.2 $\mu$m using the double-grating 360{\deg} vector Apodizing Phase Plate (dgvAPP360) coronagraph and ALES integral field spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer. We use the recently developed technique of gvAPP-enabled differential spectrophotometry to produce differential light curves for HD 1160 B. We reproduce the previously reported ~3.2 h periodic variability in archival data, but detect no periodic variability in new observations taken the following night with a similar 3.5% level precision, suggesting rapid evolution in the variability of HD 1160 B. We also extract complementary spectra of HD 1160 B for each night. The two are mostly consistent, but the companion appears fainter on the second night between 3.0-3.2 $\mu$m. Fitting models to these spectra produces different values for physical properties depending on the night considered. We find an effective temperature T$_{\text{eff}}$ = 2794$^{+115}_{-133}$ K on the first night, consistent with the literature, but a cooler T$_{\text{eff}}$ = 2279$^{+79}_{-157}$ K on the next. We estimate the mass of HD 1160 B to be 16-81 M$_{\text{Jup}}$, depending on its age. We also present R = 50,000 high-resolution optical spectroscopy of host star HD 1160 A obtained simultaneously with the PEPSI spectrograph. We reclassify its spectral type to A1 IV-V and measure its projected rotational velocity v sin i = 96$^{+6}_{-4}$ km s$^{-1}$. We thus highlight that gvAPP-enabled differential spectrophotometry can achieve repeatable few percent level precision and does not yet reach a systematic noise floor, suggesting greater precision is achievable with additional data or advanced detrending techniques.</description>

      <title>BEBOP V. Homogeneous Stellar Analysis of Potential Circumbinary Planet Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planets orbiting binary systems are relatively unexplored compared to those around single stars. Detections of circumbinary planets and planetary systems offer a first detailed view into our understanding of circumbinary planet formation and dynamical evolution. The BEBOP (Binaries Escorted by Orbiting Planets) radial velocity survey plays a special role in this adventure as it focuses on eclipsing single-lined binaries with an FGK dwarf primary and M dwarf secondary allowing for the highest-radial velocity precision using the HARPS and SOPHIE spectrographs. We obtained 4512 high-resolution spectra for the 179 targets in the BEBOP survey which we used to derive the stellar atmospheric parameters using both equivalent widths and spectral synthesis. We furthermore derive stellar masses, radii, and ages for all targets. With this work, we present the first homogeneous catalogue of precise stellar parameters for these eclipsing single-lined binaries.</description>

      <title>Photometric segregation of dwarf and giant FGK stars using the SVO Filter Profile Service and photometric tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is focused on the segregation of FGK dwarf and giant stars through narrow-band photometric data using the Spanish Virtual Observatory (SVO) Filter Profile Service and associated photometric tools. We selected spectra from the MILES, STELIB, and ELODIE stellar libraries, and used SVO photometric tools to derive the synthetic photometry in 15 J-PAS narrow filters, which were especially selected to cover spectral features sensitive to gravity changes. Using machine-learning techniques as the Gaussian mixture model and the support vector machine, we defined several criteria based on J-PAS colours to discriminate between dwarf and giant stars. We selected five colour-colour diagrams that presented the most promising separation between both samples. Our results show an overall accuracy in the studied sample of $\sim$0.97 for FGK stars, although a dependence on the luminosity type and the stellar effective temperature was found. We also defined a colour-temperature relation for dwarf stars with effective temperatures between 4\,000 and 7\,000\,K, which allows one to estimate the stellar effective temperature from four J-PAS filters ($J0450$, $J0510$, $J0550$, and $J0620$). Additionally, we extended the study to M-type giant and dwarf stars, achieving a similar accuracy to that for FGK stars.</description>
