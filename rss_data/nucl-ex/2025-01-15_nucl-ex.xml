      <title>Photoneutron reactions on gold in the giant dipole resonance region: reaction cross sections and average kinetic energies of $(\gamma,\,xn)$ photoneutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present new data on the $^{197}$Au photoneutron reactions in and above the giant dipole resonance region, obtained by using 8 to 39~MeV quasi-monochromatic $\gamma$-ray beams produced at the NewSUBARU facility in Japan and a high-and-flat efficiency neutron detection system. We report absolute cross sections and mean photoneutron energies for the $^{197}$Au$(\gamma,\,inX)$ reactions with $i$~=~1 to 4. The photoabsorption cross section was obtained as the sum of the $(\gamma,\,inX)$ reaction cross sections. The giant dipole resonance parameter values were obtained by fitting the experimental photoabsorption cross sections. The present photoabsorption cross sections are in good agreement with the Saclay results of Veyssiere~\emph{et al.}. Thus, our study does not support the recommendation of Berman~\emph{et al.} of lowering the Saclay photoabsorption cross sections by 8$\%$. We observed a non-statistical high-energy neutron emission in the $(\gamma,\,n)$ reaction in the low-energy region between $S_n$ and 10~MeV. The present results are compared with data from the literature and statistical model calculations performed with the TALYS and EMPIRE codes.</description>

      <title>Diffractive Physics Program at the Electron-Ion Collider's (EIC) 2nd Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will be a novel experimental facility to explore the properties of gluons in nucleons and nuclei, shedding light on their structure and dynamics. The EIC community outlined the physics program of the EIC in a White Paper, and the demanding detector requirements and potential technologies to deploy at an EIC detector were published in a comprehensive Yellow Report. The general-purpose detector resulting from this efforts, ePIC, is designed to perform a broad physics program. At the same time, the wider EIC community is strongly in favor of a second detector at the EIC. Having two general-purpose collider detectors to support the EIC science program, allows us to have cross-checks and control of systematic uncertainties for potential scientific discoveries. The second detector should feature complementary technologies where possible. It can also focus on specific measurements that are less well addressed by ePIC. The second interaction region provides potentially improved forward detector acceptance at low $p_{T}$ and a secondary beam focus that enables to enhance the exclusive, tagging, and diffractive physics program. Hereby, I will present potential capabilities of the second detector and discuss studies related to its diffractive physics program.</description>

      <title>Quarkonia and Deconfined Quark-Gluon Matter in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this report, we present an experimental overview of quarkonium results obtained in nucleus-nucleus heavy-ion collisions, with a focus on the data collected at the LHC. We discuss the current understanding of charmonium and bottomonium behavior in the deconfined medium produced in such collisions, comparing the various observables now accessible to state-of-the-art theoretical models. We also discuss the open points and how future heavy-ion experiments aim to clarify these aspects.</description>

      <title>Proton halo structures and 22Al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent debate as to whether the proton drip-line nucleus 22Al demonstrates a halo structure in its ground state and in order to assess such a possibility, we have analyzed theoretical results obtained within the relativistic density functional theory in 22Al and in a number of neighboring nuclei especially along isotopic, isotonic, and isobaric chains. The theory includes self-consistently the effects of pairing, deformation and the continuum. We employ two different functional parameterizations, PC-F1 and PC-PK1. Although the valence proton of the 22Al nucleus is found very loosely bound, in concordance with experimental data, its spatial distribution is found to hardly penetrate the potential barrier. Its wave function is found to consist predominately of l=2 components, for which halo formation is disfavored. Comparisons with results for isobars reveal a somewhat more extended density distribution than that of the stable or neutron-rich counterparts, but comparisons along isotopic, isotonic, and isobaric chains reveal no discontinuities in size evolution, which, if present, might have signaled exotic structures.</description>

      <title>Compact pulsed laser deposition system for in-situ polarized neutron reflectometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of ferromagnet/heavy metal thin-film structures, such as CoFeB/Mo, with spin-orbit interaction requires advanced methods for their production and study. Polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) provides unique insights into the evolution of magnetic properties, especially when applied in-situ during the growth process. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a versatile method for producing magnetic thin films, and combining PLD with in-situ PNR measurements offers new possibilities for their investigation. In this work, we developed a compact vacuum chamber integrated into the neutron instrument, enabling step-by-step deposition and in-situ PNR measurements. A multilayer Mo/[CoFeB/Mo]12 structure was grown, and neutron reflectivity curves measured after each cycle revealed the gradual evolution of sample properties. A weak magnetic field response suggested the potential formation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) at CoFeB/Mo interfaces. Additionally, a single CoFeB film was annealed up to 450{\deg}C, followed by the deposition of a ~5 {\AA} Mo layer. PNR measurements in magnetic fields of 0.01 T and 0.75 T showed a significant increase in in-plane magnetization, confirming PMA formation. Thus, we demonstrate the first successful operation of a combined PLD and in-situ PNR system, showcasing its capabilities for characterizing single-layer CoFeB and multilayer CoFeB/Mo thin-film structures.</description>

      <title>Origin of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in ultra-thin metal films studied by in-situ neutron reflectometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) plays an important role in different spintronic devices. The rapid development of spintronics requires a better understanding of the nature and mechanisms of the PMA formation. In our article, we demonstrate the potential of studying PMA by in-situ polarized neutron reflectometry combined with pulsed laser deposition. Using these techniques, we show the formation of out-of-plane anisotropy in thin CoFeB films (1.8 nm) with a capping Mo layer. Investigating thick (5.3 nm}) and thin (0.5 nm) molybdenum films, we demonstrate that in both cases, PMA was established in bilayer structures without any thermal annealing. Also, we demonstrate how an additional silicon layer grown over the CoFeB/Mo bilayer can critically alter the magnetic properties of the sample. Such studies are possible only through the unique combination of the growth method with the in-situ polarized neutron reflectometry measurement technique. We believe that this approach will open up broad opportunities for the development and investigation of new spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Energy dependence of transverse momentum fluctuations in Au+Au collisions from a multiphase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event-by-event mean transverse momentum fluctuations ($\langle p_\mathrm{T}\rangle$) serve as a sensitive probe of initial state overlap geometry and energy density fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We present a systematic investigation of $\langle p_\mathrm{T}\rangle$ fluctuations in \auau collisions at $\mathrm{\sqrt{s_{NN}}} =$3.0-19.6 GeV, examining their centrality and energy dependence with the framework of an improved multiphase transport (AMPT) model. The centrality dependence of the $p_\mathrm{T}$ cumulants up to fourth order deviates significantly from simple powering-law scaling. Scaled cumulants are performed, with variances aligning well with the trends observed in the experimental data. Employing a two-subevent method, short-range correlations are slightly suppressed compared to the standard approach. Furthermore, baryons exhibit more pronounced $\langle p_\mathrm{T}\rangle$ fluctuations than mesons, potentially attributable to the effect of radial flow. These results provide referenced insights into the role of initial state fluctuations across different energies in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Two- versus three-body approach to femtoscopic hadron-deuteron correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The three-body approach to hadron-deuteron correlations is shown to turn into a two-body approach if the three-particle hadron-deuteron wave function factorizes into the deuteron wave-function and the wave function of a hadron motion relative to the deuteron. Then, the hadron-deuteron correlation function is as in the two-body approach only the source radius somewhat changes. For this reason, as we argue, the two-body approach works well for kaon-deuteron correlations but it fails for proton-deuteron ones in case of small sources. Applying the three-body approach generalized to the case where the radius of the hadron source is different from the nucleon source radius, we derive the source radius formula which used in the two-body approach gives the correlation function as in the `factorized' three-body one. The formula is discussed in the context of existing and future experimental data.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of $\Upsilon$ production at forward rapidity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement of $\Upsilon$(1S), $\Upsilon$(2S), and $\Upsilon$(3S) yields as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity density, $\textrm{d}N_{\textrm{ch}}/\textrm{d}\eta$, using the ALICE experiment at the LHC, is reported in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV. The $\Upsilon$ meson yields are measured at forward rapidity ($2.5 &lt; y &lt; 4$) in the dimuon decay channel, whereas the charged-particle multiplicity is defined at central rapidity ($|\eta| &lt; 1$). Both quantities are divided by their average value in minimum bias events to compute the self-normalized quantities. The increase of the self-normalized $\Upsilon$(1S), $\Upsilon$(2S), and $\Upsilon$(3S) yields is found to be compatible with a linear scaling with the self-normalized $\textrm{d}N_{\textrm{ch}}/\textrm{d}\eta$, within the uncertainties. The self-normalized yield ratios of excited-to-ground $\Upsilon$ states are compatible with unity within uncertainties. Similarly, the measured double ratio of the self-normalized $\Upsilon$(1S) to the self-normalized J/$\psi$ yields, both measured at forward rapidity, is compatible with unity for self-normalized charged-particle multiplicities beyond one. The measurements are compared with theoretical predictions incorporating initial or final state effects.</description>

      <title>Investigating strangeness enhancement in jet and medium via $\phi$(1020) production in p$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims to differentiate strangeness produced from hard processes (jet-like) and softer processes (underlying event) by measuring the angular correlation between a high-momentum trigger hadron (h) acting as a jet-proxy and a produced strange hadron ($\phi(1020)$ meson). Measuring h$-\phi$ correlations at midrapidity in p$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV as a function of event multiplicity provides insight into the microscopic origin of strangeness enhancement in small collision systems. The jet-like and the underlying-event-like strangeness production are investigated as a function of event multiplicity. They are also compared between a lower and higher momentum region. The evolutions of the per-trigger yields within the near-side (aligned with the trigger hadron) and away-side (in the opposite direction of the trigger hadron) jets are studied separately, allowing for the characterization of two distinct jet-like production regimes. Furthermore, the h$-\phi$ correlations within the underlying event give access to a production regime dominated by soft production processes, which can be compared directly to the in-jet production. Comparisons between h$-\phi$ and dihadron correlations show that the observed strangeness enhancement is largely driven by the underlying event, where the $\phi/\mathrm{h}$ ratio is significantly larger than within the jet regions. As multiplicity increases, the fraction of the total $\phi(1020)$ yield coming from jets decreases compared to the underlying event production, leading to high-multiplicity events being dominated by the increased strangeness production from the underlying event.</description>

      <title>Charm fragmentation fractions and ${\rm c\overline{c}}$ cross section in p$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The total charm-quark production cross section per unit of rapidity $\mathrm{d}\sigma({\rm c\overline{c}})/\mathrm{d}y$, and the fragmentation fractions of charm quarks to different charm-hadron species $f(\mathrm{c}\rightarrow {\rm h_{c}})$, are measured for the first time in p$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV at midrapidity ($-0.96&lt;y&lt;0.04$ in the centre-of-mass frame) using data collected by ALICE at the CERN LHC. The results are obtained based on all the available measurements of prompt production of ground-state charm-hadron species: $\mathrm{D}^{0}$, $\mathrm{D}^{+}$, $\mathrm{D}_\mathrm{s}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{J/\psi}$ mesons, and $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}^{+}$ and $\Xi_{\rm c}^{0}$ baryons. The resulting cross section is $\mathrm{d}\sigma({\rm c\overline{c}})/\mathrm{d}y =219.6 \pm 6.3\;(\mathrm{stat.}) {\;}_{-11.8}^{+10.5}\;(\mathrm{syst.}) {\;}_{-2.9}^{+8.3}\;(\mathrm{extr.})\pm 5.4\;(\mathrm{BR})\pm 4.6\;(\mathrm{lumi.}) \pm 19.5\;(\text{rapidity shape})+15.0\;(\Omega_{\rm c}^{0})$ mb, which is consistent with a binary scaling of pQCD calculations from pp collisions. The measured fragmentation fractions are compatible with those measured in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ and $13$ TeV, showing an increase in the relative production rates of charm baryons with respect to charm mesons in pp and p$-$Pb collisions compared with $\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}}$ and $\mathrm{e^{-}p}$ collisions. The $p_\mathrm{T}$-integrated nuclear modification factor of charm quarks, $R_\mathrm{pPb}({\rm c\overline{c}})= 0.91 \pm 0.04\;{\rm (stat.)}{}^{+0.08}_{-0.09}\;{\rm (syst.)}{}^{+0.05}_{-0.03}\;{\rm (extr.)}{}\pm 0.03\;{\rm (lumi.)}$, is found to be consistent with unity and with theoretical predictions including nuclear modifications of the parton distribution functions.</description>

Abstract: The first measurement of $_{\Lambda}^{3}\mathrm{H}$ and $^3_ {\overline{\Lambda}}\overline{\mathrm{H}}$ differential production with respect to transverse momentum and centrality in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$~TeV is presented. The $_{\Lambda}^{3}\mathrm{H}$ has been reconstructed via its two-charged-body decay channel, i.e., $_{\Lambda}^{3}\mathrm{H} \rightarrow {}^{3}\mathrm{He} + \pi^{-}$. A Blast-Wave model fit of the $p_{\rm T}$-differential spectra of all nuclear species measured by the ALICE collaboration suggests that the $_{\Lambda}^{3}\mathrm{H}$ kinetic freeze-out surface is consistent with that of other nuclei. The ratio between the integrated yields of $_{\Lambda}^{3}\mathrm{H}$ and $^3\mathrm{He}$ is compared to predictions from the statistical hadronisation model and the coalescence model, with the latter being favoured by the presented measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production yields of antideuterons and antiprotons are measured in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, as a function of transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) and rapidity ($y$), for the first time rapidity-differentially up to $|y|= 0.7$. The measured spectra are used to study the $p_{\rm T}$ and rapidity dependence of the coalescence parameter $B_2$, which quantifies the coalescence probability of antideuterons. The $p_{\rm T}$ and rapidity dependence of the obtained $B_2$ is extrapolated for $p_{\rm T}&gt; 1.7$ GeV/$c$ and $|y|&gt;0.7$ using the phenomenological antideuteron production model implemented in PYTHIA 8.3 as well as a baryon coalescence afterburner model based on EPOS 3. Such measurements are of interest to the astrophysics community, since they can be used for the calculation of the flux of antinuclei from cosmic rays, in combination with coalescence models.</description>

      <title>Strange Hadron Production at High Baryon Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strange hadrons have been suggested as sensitive probes of the properties of the nuclear matter created in heavy-ion collisions. At few-GeV collision energies, the formed medium is baryon-rich due to baryon stopping effect. In these proceedings, the recent results on strange hadron production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 3.2, 3.5, 3.9 and 4.5 GeV with the fixed-target mode from the STAR Beam Energy Scan phase-II program are presented. The transverse momentum spectra, rapidity density distributions, excitation function and centrality dependence of strange hadrons ($\rm{K}^0_S,~\Lambda, ~\Xi^-$) are shown. These results are compared with those from higher collision energies and physics implications are discussed by comparing to the transport model calculations.</description>

      <title>Probing new bosons and nuclear structure with ytterbium isotope shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we present mass-ratio measurements on highly charged Yb$^{42+}$ ions with a precision of $4\times 10^{-12}$ and isotope-shift measurements on Yb$^{+}$ on the $^{2}$S$_{1/2}$ $\to$ $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ and $^{2}$S$_{1/2}$ $\to$ $^{2}$F$_{7/2}$ transitions with a precision of $4\times 10^{-9}$ for the isotopes $^{168,170,172,174,176}$Yb. We present a new method that allows us to extract higher-order changes in the nuclear charge distribution along the Yb isotope chain, benchmarking ab-initio nuclear structure calculations. Additionally, we perform a King plot analysis to set bounds on a fifth force in the keV$/c^2$ to MeV$/c^2$ range coupling to electrons and neutrons.</description>

      <title>$ {}^{164} \mathrm{Pb} $: A possible heaviest $ N = Z $ doubly magic nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We confirm by using the Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculation that $ {}^{164} \mathrm{Pb} $ is a possible heaviest $ N = Z $ doubly magic nucleus whose lifetime is long enough to be measured on accelerator experiments. We estimate the proton-emission and alpha-decay half-lives of $ {}^{164} \mathrm{Pb} $. The estimated proton-emission half-life ranges from $ 0.1 \, \mathrm{ps} $ to $ 10 \, \mathrm{ns} $, while the alpha decay can be safely neglected.</description>

      <title>Experimental Method to Constrain Preferential Emission and Spectator Dynamics in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel experimental method to quantify contribution of preferential emission to the pseudorapidity distribution of produced particles in heavy-ion collisions using correlations between spectator asymmetry and final-state multiplicity. Within a transport model, the magnitude of this correlator increases from mid to forward rapidities, reflecting the impact of preferential emission and capturing fluctuations in sources of particle production. The correlator demonstrates sensitivity to spectator number fluctuations arising from evaporation or fragmentation, providing a handle to constrain such dynamics. This method serves as a powerful tool to probe particle production mechanisms and the space-time evolution of spectator matter in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Mirror and triplet energy differences in $sd$-shell nuclei using microscopic interactions with isospin-symmetry breaking effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we developed and tested two different isospin symmetry-breaking (ISB) versions of the microscopic DJ16A interaction. Starting with the isospin symmetric DJ16A interaction, we introduced two different Coulomb interactions- Coulomb-CD and Coulomb-w/SRC- along with phenomenological charge symmetry breaking (CSB) and charge independence breaking (CIB) effects. Then, we employed these interactions to calculate $b$- and $c$-parameters of the isobaric multiplet mass equation for $|T_z| = 1/2$ and $|T_z| = 1$ nuclei across the $sd$-shell. Our results indicate that the DJ16A$^\dagger$ interaction provides the most accurate $b$-parameter predictions between the two DJ16A-based interactions. Additionally, we explored mirror energy differences (MEDs) in low-energy spectra around $A = 20$ and demonstrated that large MEDs are primarily associated with high occupancies of the $1s_{1/2}$ orbital. Furthermore, $E2$ transition strengths were calculated using both DJ16A-based ISB interactions agreed with the experimental data, with minimal ISB effects observed on these transitions. Overall, the DJ16A$^\dagger$ interaction serves as a complementary set to the newly developed USD-family interactions, USDC, and USDCm and can be further tested for other mirror nuclei across the $sd$-shell to study nuclear structure properties and ISB effects in nuclear $\beta$-decay.</description>

      <title>Neural network biased corrections: Cautionary study in background corrections for quenched jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jets clustered from heavy ion collision measurements combine a dense background of particles with those actually resulting from a hard partonic scattering. The background contribution to jet transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) may be corrected by subtracting the collision average background; however, the background inhomogeneity limits the resolution of this correction. Many recent studies have embedded jets into heavy ion backgrounds and demonstrated a markedly improved background correction is achievable by using neural networks (NNs) trained with aspects of jet substructure which are used to map measured jet $p_\mathrm{T}$ to the embedded truth jet $p_\mathrm{T}$. However, jet quenching in heavy ion collisions modifies jet substructure, and correspondingly biases the NNs' background corrections. This study investigates those biases by using simulations of jet quenching in central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200\;\mathrm{GeV}/c$ with hydrodynamically modeled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) evolution. To demonstrate the magnitude of the effect of such biases in measurement, a leading jet nuclear modification factor ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) is calculated and reported using the NN background correction on jets quenched utilizing a brick of QGP.</description>
