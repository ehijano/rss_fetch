      <title>Magnetically generated spin-orbit coupling for ultracold atoms with slowly varying periodic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) affecting the center of mass of ultracold atoms can be simulated using a properly chosen periodic sequence of magnetic pulses. Yet such a method is generally accompanied by micro-motion which hinders a precise control of atomic dynamics and thus complicating practical applications. Here we show how to by-pass the micro-motion emerging in the magnetically induced SOC by switching on and off properly the oscillating magnetic fields at the initial and final times. We consider the exact dynamics of the system and demonstrate that the overall dynamics can be immune to the micro-motion. The exact dynamics is shown to agree well with the evolution of the system described by slowly changing effective Floquet Hamiltonian including the SOC term. The agreement is shown to be the best when the phase of the periodic driving takes a specific value for which the effect of the spin-orbit coupling is maximum.</description>

      <title>Spin Orbit and Hyperfine Simulations with Two-Species Ultracold Atoms in a Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A collective spin model is used to describe two species of mutually interacting ultracold bosonic atoms confined to a toroidal trap. The system is modeled by a Hamiltonian that can be split into two components, a linear part and a quadratic part, which may be controlled independently. We show the linear component is an analog of a Zeeman Hamiltonian, and the quadratic component presents a macroscopic simulator for spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions. We determine a complete set of commuting observables for both the linear and quadratic Hamiltonians, and derive analytical expressions for their respective spectra and density of states. We determine the conditions for generating maximal entanglement between the two species of atoms with a view to applications involving quantum correlations among spin degrees of freedom, such as in the area of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Rabi Oscillation of High Partial Wave Interacting Atoms in Deep Optical Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experiment of p-wave interacting $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ atom gases in a deep optical lattice, we investigated the Rabi oscillation for any partial wave interacting quantum gases in a deep optical lattice. We first review the solution for two particles interacting by any partial wave in a harmonic trap by using pseudopotential. We generalize the model used in recent work to any partial wave cases, repeated some of the theoretic and experiment results for p-wave interacting $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ atoms in a deep optical lattice and show the results for the d-wave case. Our results may be useful for future experiments and may stimulate further theoretic investigation.</description>

      <title>Local control and mixed dimensions: Exploring high-temperature superconductivity in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of high-temperature superconducting materials by implementing strongly correlated fermionic models in optical lattices is one of the major objectives in the field of analog quantum simulation. Here we show that local control and optical bilayer capabilities create a versatile toolbox to study both nickelate and cuprate high-temperature superconductors. On the one hand, we present a scheme to implement a mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer model that has been proposed to capture the essential pairing physics of pressurized bilayer nickelates. This allows for the long-sought realization of a state with long-range superconducting order in current lattice quantum simulation machines. In particular, we show how coherent pairing correlations can be accessed in a partially particle-hole transformed and rotated basis. On the other hand, we demonstrate that control of local gates enables the observation of $d$-wave pairing order in the two-dimensional (single-layer) repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model through the simulation of a system with attractive interactions. Lastly, we introduce a scheme to measure momentum-resolved dopant densities, providing access to observables complementary to solid-state experiments -- which is of particular interest for future studies of the enigmatic pseudogap phase appearing in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Gifts from long-range interaction: Emergent gapless topological behaviors in quantum spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology in condensed matter physics is typically associated with a bulk energy gap. However, recent research has shifted focus to topological phases without a bulk energy gap, exhibiting nontrivial gapless topological behaviors. In this letter, we explore a cluster Ising chain with long-range antiferromagnetic interactions that decay as a power law with the distance. Using complementary numerical and analytical techniques, we demonstrate that long-range interactions can unambiguously induce an algebraic topological phase and a topological Gaussian universality, both of which exhibit nontrivial gapless topological behaviors. Our study not only provides a platform to investigate the fundamental physics of quantum many-body systems but also offers a novel route toward searching for gapless topological phases in realistic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Erasure Conversion in a Molecular Tweezer Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmable optical tweezer arrays of molecules are an emerging platform for quantum simulation and quantum information science. For these applications, reducing and mitigating errors that arise during initial state preparation and subsequent evolution remain major challenges. In this paper, we present work on site-resolved detection of internal state errors and quantum erasures, which are qubit errors with known locations. First, using a new site-resolved detection scheme, we demonstrate robust and enhanced tweezer array preparation fidelities. This enables creating molecular arrays with low defect rates, opening the door to high-fidelity simulation of quantum many-body systems. Second, for the first time in molecules, we demonstrate mid-circuit detection of erasures using a composite detection scheme that minimally affects error-free qubits. We also demonstrate mid-circuit conversion of blackbody-induced errors into detectable erasures. Our demonstration of erasure conversion, which has been shown to significantly reduce overheads for fault-tolerant quantum error correction, could be useful for quantum information processing in molecular tweezer arrays.</description>

      <title>Velocity Scanning Tomography for Room-Temperature Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation offers an analog approach for exploring exotic quantum phenomena using controllable platforms, typically necessitating ultracold temperatures to maintain the quantum coherence. Superradiance lattices (SLs) have been harnessed to simulate coherent topological physics at room temperature, but the thermal motion of atoms remains a notable challenge in accurately measuring the physical quantities. To overcome this obstacle, we invent and validate a velocity scanning tomography technique to discern the responses of atoms with different velocities, allowing cold-atom spectroscopic resolution within room-temperature SLs. By comparing absorption spectra with and without atoms moving at specific velocities, we can derive the Wannier-Stark ladders of the SL across various effective static electric fields, their strengths being proportional to the atomic velocities. We extract the Zak phase of the SL by monitoring the ladder frequency shift as a function of the atomic velocity, effectively demonstrating the topological winding of the energy bands. Our research signifies the feasibility of room-temperature quantum simulation and facilitates their applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Rapidly Rotating Bose-Einstein Quantum Droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07481v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work theoretically investigates \textcolor{black}{the stationary properties} and the dynamics of the rotating quantum liquid droplets confined in a two-dimensional symmetric anharmonic trap. Mimicking the quantum Hall systems, the modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation with the inclusion of the Lee-Huang-Yang nonlinear interaction is analytically solved, and the role of the Landau-level mixing effect is addressed. \textcolor{black}{Via controlling the nonlinear interaction and the rotation speed, the rotating quantum droplet with multiply quantized vortex can be created, and the preference of the energetically favored quantum states can be distinguished in the phase diagram. To better interpret the underlying physics of the phase singularities, a brief comparison of the rotating quantum droplet and the optical vortex is made. The investigation of the long-term evolution of the rotating quantum droplets confirms the stability of the quantum states. At certain rotation speeds, the multi-periodic trajectories and breathings provide evidence of the emergence of the collective excitation of the surface mode in the vortex state. For quantum droplets carrying multiply quantized vortex, the microscopic snapshots of the rotation field adjusted current density distribution show that the combined nonlinear interaction and the anharmonic trapping potential can provide the restoring force to lead the quantum droplet to a regular and stable revolution and reach the dynamic equilibrium, revealing the signature of the generation of superfluids in the new kind of low-dimensional quantum liquids.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Casimir effect of magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics. The key concepts of quantum mechanics are quantum fluctuations. Quantum fluctuations of quantum fields confined in a finite-size system induce the zero-point energy shift. This quantum phenomenon, the Casimir effect, is one of the most striking phenomena of quantum mechanics in the sense that there are no classical analogs and has been attracting much attention beyond the hierarchy of energy scales, ranging from elementary particle physics to condensed matter physics, together with photonics. However, the non-Hermitian extension of the Casimir effect and the application to spintronics have not yet been investigated enough, although exploring energy sources and developing energy-efficient nanodevices are its central issues. Here we fill this gap. By developing a magnonic analog of the Casimir effect into non-Hermitian systems, we show that this non-Hermitian Casimir effect of magnons is enhanced as the Gilbert damping constant (i.e., the energy dissipation rate) increases. When the damping constant exceeds a critical value, the non-Hermitian Casimir effect of magnons exhibits an oscillating behavior, including a beating one, as a function of the film thickness and is characterized by the exceptional point. Our result suggests that energy dissipation serves as a key ingredient of Casimir engineering.</description>

      <title>Stability of fractional Chern insulators with a non-Landau level continuum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05758v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of fractional Chern insulators is widely believed to be predicted by the resemblance of their single-particle spectra to Landau levels. We investigate the scope of this geometric stability hypothesis by analyzing the stability of a set of fractional Chern insulators that explicitly do not have a Landau level continuum limit. By computing the many-body spectra of Laughlin states in a generalized Hofstadter model, we analyze the relationship between single-particle metrics, such as trace inequality saturation, and many-body metrics, such as the magnitude of the many-body and entanglement gaps. We show numerically that the geometric stability hypothesis holds for Chern bands that are not continuously connected to Landau levels, as well as conventional Chern bands, albeit often requiring larger system sizes to converge for these configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard way to generate many-body quantum correlations is via a dynamical protocol: an initial product state is transformed by interactions that generate non-classical correlations at later times. Here, we show that many-body Bell correlations are inherently present in the eigenstates of a variety of spin-1/2 chains. In particular, we show that the eigenstates and thermal states of the collective Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model possess many-body Bell correlations. We demonstrate that the Bell correlations can take on quantized values that change discontinuously with variations in the total magnetization. Finally, we show that these many-body Bell correlations persist even in the presence of both diagonal and off-diagonal disorder.</description>
