      <title>3D Reconstruction of Coronary Vessel Trees from Biplanar X-Ray Images Using a Geometric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray angiography is widely used in cardiac interventions to visualize coronary vessels, assess integrity, detect stenoses and guide treatment. We propose a framework for reconstructing 3D vessel trees from biplanar X-ray images which are extracted from two X-ray videos captured at different C-arm angles. The proposed framework consists of three main components: image segmentation, motion phase matching, and 3D reconstruction. An automatic video segmentation method for X-ray angiography to enable semantic segmentation for image segmentation and motion phase matching. The goal of the motion phase matching is to identify a pair of X-ray images that correspond to a similar respiratory and cardiac motion phase to reduce errors in 3D reconstruction. This is achieved by tracking a stationary object such as a catheter or lead within the X-ray video. The semantic segmentation approach assigns different labels to different object classes enabling accurate differentiation between blood vessels, balloons, and catheters. Once a suitable image pair is selected, key anatomical landmarks (vessel branching points and endpoints) are matched between the two views using a heuristic method that minimizes reconstruction errors. This is followed by a novel geometric reconstruction algorithm to generate the 3D vessel tree. The algorithm computes the 3D vessel centrelines by determining the intersection of two 3D surfaces. Compared to traditional methods based on epipolar constraints, the proposed approach simplifies there construction workflow and improves overall accuracy. We trained and validated our segmentation method on 62 X-ray angiography video sequences. On the test set, our method achieved a segmentation accuracy of 0.703. The 3D reconstruction framework was validated by measuring the reconstruction error of key anatomical landmarks, achieving a reprojection errors of 0.62mm +/- 0.38mm.</description>

      <title>PREDICT-GBM: Platform for Robust Evaluation and Development of Individualized Computational Tumor Models in Glioblastoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glioblastoma is the most prevalent primary brain malignancy, distinguished by its highly invasive behavior and exceptionally high rates of recurrence. Conventional radiation therapy, which employs uniform treatment margins, fails to account for patient-specific anatomical and biological factors that critically influence tumor cell migration. To address this limitation, numerous computational models of glioblastoma growth have been developed, enabling generation of tumor cell distribution maps extending beyond radiographically visible regions and thus informing more precise treatment strategies. However, despite encouraging preliminary findings, the clinical adoption of these growth models remains limited. To bridge this translational gap and accelerate both model development and clinical validation, we introduce PREDICT-GBM, a comprehensive integrated pipeline and dataset for modeling and evaluation. This platform enables systematic benchmarking of state-of-the-art tumor growth models using an expert-curated clinical dataset comprising 255 subjects with complete tumor segmentations and tissue characterization maps. Our analysis demonstrates that personalized radiation treatment plans derived from tumor growth predictions achieved superior recurrence coverage compared to conventional uniform margin approaches for two of the evaluated models. This work establishes a robust platform for advancing and systematically evaluating cutting-edge tumor growth modeling approaches, with the ultimate goal of facilitating clinical translation and improving patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Pipeline for Interactive Prompt-driven 2D-to-3D Vascular Reconstruction for Fontan Geometries from Contrast-Enhanced X-Ray Fluoroscopy Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fontan palliation for univentricular congenital heart disease progresses to hemodynamic failure with complex flow patterns poorly characterized by conventional 2D imaging. Current assessment relies on fluoroscopic angiography, providing limited 3D geometric information essential for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and surgical planning.
  A multi-step AI pipeline was developed utilizing Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash (2.5B parameters) for systematic, iterative processing of fluoroscopic angiograms through transformer-based neural architecture. The pipeline encompasses medical image preprocessing, vascular segmentation, contrast enhancement, artifact removal, and virtual hemodynamic flow visualization within 2D projections. Final views were processed through Tencent's Hunyuan3D-2mini (384M parameters) for stereolithography file generation.
  The pipeline successfully generated geometrically optimized 2D projections from single-view angiograms after 16 processing steps using a custom web interface. Initial iterations contained hallucinated vascular features requiring iterative refinement to achieve anatomically faithful representations. Final projections demonstrated accurate preservation of complex Fontan geometry with enhanced contrast suitable for 3D conversion. AI-generated virtual flow visualization identified stagnation zones in central connections and flow patterns in branch arteries. Complete processing required under 15 minutes with second-level API response times.
  This approach demonstrates clinical feasibility of generating CFD-suitable geometries from routine angiographic data, enabling 3D generation and rapid virtual flow visualization for cursory insights prior to full CFD simulation. While requiring refinement cycles for accuracy, this establishes foundation for democratizing advanced geometric and hemodynamic analysis using readily available imaging data.</description>

      <title>Cross-Distribution Diffusion Priors-Driven Iterative Reconstruction for Sparse-View CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse-View CT (SVCT) reconstruction enhances temporal resolution and reduces radiation dose, yet its clinical use is hindered by artifacts due to view reduction and domain shifts from scanner, protocol, or anatomical variations, leading to performance degradation in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this work, we propose a Cross-Distribution Diffusion Priors-Driven Iterative Reconstruction (CDPIR) framework to tackle the OOD problem in SVCT. CDPIR integrates cross-distribution diffusion priors, derived from a Scalable Interpolant Transformer (SiT), with model-based iterative reconstruction methods. Specifically, we train a SiT backbone, an extension of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, to establish a unified stochastic interpolant framework, leveraging Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) across multiple datasets. By randomly dropping the conditioning with a null embedding during training, the model learns both domain-specific and domain-invariant priors, enhancing generalizability. During sampling, the globally sensitive transformer-based diffusion model exploits the cross-distribution prior within the unified stochastic interpolant framework, enabling flexible and stable control over multi-distribution-to-noise interpolation paths and decoupled sampling strategies, thereby improving adaptation to OOD reconstruction. By alternating between data fidelity and sampling updates, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior detail preservation in SVCT reconstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDPIR significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly under OOD conditions, highlighting its robustness and potential clinical value in challenging imaging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Integrated diffractive full-Stokes spectro-polarimetric imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectro-polarimetric imaging provides multidimensional optical information acquisition capabilities, offering significant potential for diverse applications. Current spectro-polarimetric imaging systems typically suffer from large physical footprints, high design complexity, elevated costs, or the drawback of requiring replacement of standard components with polarization optics. To address these issues, we propose an integrated diffractive full-Stokes spectro-polarimetric imaging framework that synergistically combines end-to-end designed diffractive polarization spectral element (DPSE) with SPMSA-Net to demonstrate high-performance spectro-polarimetric imaging. The DPSE modulates scene and generates modulated images carrying phase-encoding and polarization information. The modulated images are the input of the SPMSA-NET for the reconstruction of the spectro-polarimetric data cube. The framework achieves an average improvement of 0.78 dB in PSNR and 0.012 in SSIM over existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Based on this framework, our prototype system can simultaneously capture spectral information (400-700 nm) with 10 nm spectral resolution and full-Stokes parameters (S0,S1,S2,S3). Meanwhile, the system provides high spatial resolution of 2252*2252 pixels. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves high-fidelity spectral imaging (over 98.9% fidelity) and precise polarization characterization, with a compact architecture (modulation component of merely 2-mm thickness).</description>

      <title>Validation of Dry Bulk Pile Volume Estimation Algorithm based on Angle of Repose using Experimental Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimation of volume of piles in shipping ports plays a pivotal role for logistics management, facilitates better ship rescheduling and rerouting for economic benefits and contributes to overall efficient shipping management. This paper presents validation results for a volume estimation algorithm for dry bulk cargo piles stored in open ports. Using remote sensing images obtained in a laboratory setting, the method first detects the contour of the pile and then reconstructs its 3D model based on the material's angle of repose, and estimates the volume accordingly. We validated the algorithm on full conical piles and single-ridge elongated piles, and further tested it on reclaimed conical and elongated piles. The results demonstrated the algorithm's strong potential for accurately estimating pile volume from experimental images and a reference satellite image, achieving high accuracy in our validation.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Deep Learning Methods for Irradiance Estimation from Sky Images with Applications to Video Prediction-Based Irradiance Nowcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the high levels of uncertainty associated with photovoltaic energy, an increasing number of studies focusing on short-term solar forecasting (i.e. nowcasting) have been published. Most of these studies use deep-learning-based models to directly forecast a solar irradiance or photovoltaic power value given an input sequence of sky images. Recently, however, advances in generative modeling have led to approaches that divide the nowcasting problem into two sub-problems: 1) future event prediction, i.e. generating future sky images; and 2) solar irradiance or photovoltaic power estimation, i.e. predicting the concurrent value from a single image. One such approach is the SkyGPT model, whose potential for improvement is shown to be much larger in the estimation component than in the generative component. Thus, in this paper, we focus on the solar irradiance estimation problem and conduct an extensive benchmark of deep learning architectures across the widely-used Folsom, SIRTA and NREL datasets. Moreover, we perform ablation experiments on different training configurations and data processing techniques, including the choice of the target variable used for training and adjustments of the timestamp alignment between images and irradiance measurements. In particular, we draw attention to a potential error associated with the sky image timestamps in the Folsom dataset and suggest a possible fix. By leveraging the three datasets, we demonstrate that our findings are consistent across different solar stations. Finally, we combine our best irradiance estimation model with a video prediction model and obtain state-of-the-art results on the SIRTA dataset.</description>

      <title>Attention-ResUNet and EfficientSASM-UNet: UNet based frameworks for Lung and Nodule segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lung cancer has been one of the major threats across the world with the highest mortalities. Computer-aided detection (CAD) can help in early detection and thus can help increase the survival rate. Accurate lung parenchyma segmentation (to include the juxta-pleural nodules) and lung nodule segmentation, the primary symptom of lung cancer, play a crucial role in the overall accuracy of the Lung CAD pipeline. Lung nodule segmentation is quite challenging because of the diverse nodule types and other inhibit structures present within the lung lobes. Traditional machine/deep learning methods suffer from generalization and robustness. Recent Vision Language Models/Foundation Models perform well on the anatomical level, but they suffer on fine-grained segmentation tasks, and their semi-automatic nature limits their effectiveness in real-time clinical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel method for accurate 3D segmentation of lung parenchyma and lung nodules. The proposed architecture is an attention-based network with residual blocks at each encoder-decoder state. Max pooling is replaced by strided convolutions at the encoder, and trilinear interpolation is replaced by transposed convolutions at the decoder to maximize the number of learnable parameters. Dilated convolutions at each encoder-decoder stage allow the model to capture the larger context without increasing computational costs. The proposed method has been evaluated extensively on one of the largest publicly available datasets, namely LUNA16, and is compared with recent notable work in the domain using standard performance metrics like Dice score, IOU, etc. It can be seen from the results that the proposed method achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>MEGANet-W: A Wavelet-Driven Edge-Guided Attention Framework for Weak Boundary Polyp Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02668v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colorectal polyp segmentation is critical for early detection of colorectal cancer, yet weak and low contrast boundaries significantly limit automated accuracy. Existing deep models either blur fine edge details or rely on handcrafted filters that perform poorly under variable imaging conditions. We propose MEGANet-W, a Wavelet Driven Edge Guided Attention Network that injects directional, parameter free Haar wavelet edge maps into each decoder stage to recalibrate semantic features. The key novelties of MEGANet-W include a two-level Haar wavelet head for multi-orientation edge extraction; and Wavelet Edge Guided Attention (W-EGA) modules that fuse wavelet cues with boundary and input branches. On five public polyp datasets, MEGANet-W consistently outperforms existing methods, improving mIoU by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%, while introducing no additional learnable parameters. This approach improves reliability in difficult cases and offers a robust solution for medical image segmentation tasks requiring precise boundary detection.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Gradient-Aware Upscaling of 3D Gaussian Splatting Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an image upscaling technique tailored for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) on lightweight GPUs. Compared to 3DGS, it achieves significantly higher rendering speeds and reduces artifacts commonly observed in 3DGS reconstructions. Our technique upscales low-resolution 3DGS renderings with a marginal increase in cost by directly leveraging the analytical image gradients of Gaussians for gradient-based bicubic spline interpolation. The technique is agnostic to the specific 3DGS implementation, achieving novel view synthesis at rates 3x-4x higher than the baseline implementation. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we showcase the performance improvements and high reconstruction fidelity attainable with gradient-aware upscaling of 3DGS images. We further demonstrate the integration of gradient-aware upscaling into the gradient-based optimization of a 3DGS model and analyze its effects on reconstruction quality and performance.</description>

      <title>Direct Video-Based Spatiotemporal Deep Learning for Cattle Lameness Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cattle lameness is a prevalent health problem in livestock farming, often resulting from hoof injuries or infections, and severely impacts animal welfare and productivity. Early and accurate detection is critical for minimizing economic losses and ensuring proper treatment. This study proposes a spatiotemporal deep learning framework for automated cattle lameness detection using publicly available video data. We curate and publicly release a balanced set of 50 online video clips featuring 42 individual cattle, recorded from multiple viewpoints in both indoor and outdoor environments. The videos were categorized into lame and non-lame classes based on visual gait characteristics and metadata descriptions. After applying data augmentation techniques to enhance generalization, two deep learning architectures were trained and evaluated: 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNN) and Convolutional Long-Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM2D). The 3D CNN achieved a video-level classification accuracy of 90%, with a precision, recall, and F1 score of 90.9% each, outperforming the ConvLSTM2D model, which achieved 85% accuracy. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on multistage pipelines involving object detection and pose estimation, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of a direct end-to-end video classification approach. Compared with the best end-to-end prior method (C3D-ConvLSTM, 90.3%), our model achieves comparable accuracy while eliminating pose estimation pre-processing.The results indicate that deep learning models can successfully extract and learn spatio-temporal features from various video sources, enabling scalable and efficient cattle lameness detection in real-world farm settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) offer universal function approximation using univariate spline compositions without nonlinear activations. In this work, we integrate Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) into the KAN framework to transform multi-class classification into multiple binary tasks, improving robustness via Hamming distance decoding. Our proposed KAN with ECOC framework outperforms vanilla KAN on a challenging blood cell classification dataset, achieving higher accuracy across diverse hyperparameter settings. Ablation studies further confirm that ECOC consistently enhances performance across FastKAN and FasterKAN variants. These results demonstrate that ECOC integration significantly boosts KAN generalizability in critical healthcare AI applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of ECOC with KAN for enhancing multi-class medical image classification performance.</description>
