      <title>Hugoniot equation of state and sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass under shock compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Davemaoite, as the third most abundant mineral in the lower mantle, constitutes significant amounts in pyrolite and mid-ocean ridge basalts. Due to its unquenchable nature, measurements by static compression techniques on physical properties of davemaoite at lower mantle conditions are rare and technically challenging, and those are essential to constrain compositions and properties of mineralogical models in the lower mantle. Here, we present Hugoniot equation of state and sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass under shock compression. The CaSiO3 glass transforms into the crystalline phase above 34 GPa and completely transforms into davemaoite above 120 GPa. Thermal equation of state and Hugoniot temperature of davemaoite have been derived from the shock wave data. The CaSiO3 glass under shcok compression has very high shock temperature. Shock wave experiments for sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass indicate that no melting is observed at Hugoniot pressure up to 117.6 GPa. We propose that the melting temperature of davemaoite should be higher than those reported theoretically by now.</description>

      <title>Multiple reflections on Huygens' principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to Huygens' principle, all points on a wave front act as secondary sources emitting spherical waves, and the superposition of these spherical waves forms a new wave front. In the mathematical formulation of Huygens' principle, the waves emitted by the secondary sources are represented by Green's functions. In many present-day applications of Huygens' principle, these Green's functions are replaced by their time-reversed versions, thus forming a basis for backpropagation, imaging, inversion, seismic interferometry, etc. However, when the input wave field is available only on a single open boundary, this approach has its limitations. In particular, it does not properly account for multiple reflections. This is remedied by a modified form of Huygens' principle, in which the Green's functions are replaced by focusing functions. The modified Huygens' principle forms a basis for imaging, inverse scattering, monitoring of induced sources, etc., thereby properly taking multiple reflections into account.</description>

      <title>Generating Unseen Nonlinear Evolution in Sea Surface Temperature Using a Deep Learning-Based Latent Space Data Assimilation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in data assimilation (DA) methods have greatly improved the accuracy of Earth system predictions. To fuse multi-source data and reconstruct the nonlinear evolution missing from observations, geoscientists are developing future-oriented DA methods. In this paper, we redesign a purely data-driven latent space DA framework (DeepDA) that employs a generative artificial intelligence model to capture the nonlinear evolution in sea surface temperature. Under variational constraints, DeepDA embedded with nonlinear features can effectively fuse heterogeneous data. The results show that DeepDA remains highly stable in capturing and generating nonlinear evolutions even when a large amount of observational information is missing. It can be found that when only 10% of the observation information is available, the error increase of DeepDA does not exceed 40%. Furthermore, DeepDA has been shown to be robust in the fusion of real observations and ensemble simulations. In particular, this paper provides a mechanism analysis of the nonlinear evolution generated by DeepDA from the perspective of physical patterns, which reveals the inherent explainability of our DL model in capturing multi-scale ocean signals.</description>

      <title>Surface Wave-Aerodynamic Roughness Length Model for Air-Sea Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recently introduced model to evaluate the equivalent hydrodynamic length scale $z_0$ for turbulent flow over static rough surfaces is reformulated and extended to enable evaluation of $z_0$ for moving surface waves. The proposed Surface Wave-Aerodynamic Roughness Length model is based on maps of the surface height and its vertical speed as function of position, and Reynolds number. Pressure drag is estimated by approximating the local flow as ideal inviscid ramp flow (Ayala et al., 2024). Wave history effects are included through dependence on the local velocity difference between the air and wave speed. The model is applied to monochromatic and multiscale surfaces, and the predicted surface roughness length scales are compared to measured values and to commonly used wave parametrization methods found in the literature. The proposed model shows significantly improved agreement with data compared to other models.</description>
