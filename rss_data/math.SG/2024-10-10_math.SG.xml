      <title>Barcode entropy and wrapped Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the interplay between barcode and topological entropies. Wrapped Floer homology barcode entropy is the exponential growth of not-to-short bars in the persistence module associated with the filtered wrapped Floer homology. We prove that the barcode entropy is an invariant of the contact boundary of a Liouville domain, i.e., does not depend on the filling, and it bounds from below the topological entropy of the Reeb flow. We make no assumptions on the first Chern class of the Liouville domain or the contact form.</description>

      <title>Background Cohomology and Symplectic Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Hamiltonian action of a compact Lie group $G$ on a complete \ka manifold $M$ with a proper moment map. In a previous paper, we defined a regularized version of the Dolbeault cohomology of a $G$-equivariant holomorphic vector bundle, called the background cohomology. In this paper, we show that the background cohomology of a prequantum line bundle over $M$ `commutes with reduction', i.e. the invariant part of the background cohomology is isomorphic to the usual Dolbeault cohomology of the symplectic reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mikami-Weinstein theorem is a generalization of the classical Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer symplectic reduction theorem to the case of symplectic groupoid actions. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a cosymplectic groupoid action on a cosymplectic manifold and prove a theorem which is a natural analogue of the Mikami-Weinstein theorem.</description>

      <title>Integral Kirwan Surjectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a refinement of Kirwan surjectivity for Hamiltonian G-actions. Namely, given a regular value of the moment map, we show that the Kirwan map becomes surjective (and, in fact, additively split) after inverting the orders of the stabilizer groups. In particular, in the case of a free quotient, the Kirwan map is surjective integrally. The novel idea is to first prove Kirwan surjectivity in Morava K-theories and then use this to deduce surjectivity in cohomology.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Braids via Generating Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphism of the plane, one can define a generating function for it. In this paper, we show how generating functions retain information about the braid type of collections of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. One the one hand, we show that it is possible to define a filtration keeping track of linking numbers of pairs of fixed points on the Morse complex of the generating function. On the other, we provide a finite-dimensional proof of a Theorem by Alves and Meiwes about the lower-semicontinuity of the topological entropy with respect to the Hofer norm. The technical tools come from work by Le Calvez which was developed in the 90s. In particular, we apply a version of positivity of intersections for generating functions.</description>

      <title>Fillability obstructions for high-dimensional confoliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study confoliations in dimensions higher than three mostly from the perspective of symplectic fillability. Our main result is that Massot-Niederkr\"uger-Wendl's bordered Legendrian open book, an object that obstructs the weak symplectic fillability of contact manifolds, admits a generalization for confoliations equipped with symplectic data. Applications include the non-fillability of the product of an overtwisted contact manifold and a class of symplectic manifolds, and the fact that Bourgeois contact structures associated with overtwisted contact manifolds admit no weak symplectic fillings for which the symplectic structure restricts at the boundary to a positive generator of the second cohomology of the torus factor. In addition, along the lines of the original $3$-dimensional work of Eliashberg and Thurston, we give a new definition of approximation and deformation of confoliations by contact structures and describe some natural examples.</description>

      <title>Vanishing cycles of symplectic foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have shown that the usual generalizations of taut foliations to higher dimensions, based only on topological concepts, do not yield a theory comparable in richness to the $3$-dimensional one. The aim of this article is to prove that strong symplectic foliations are, however, a natural candidate for such a generalization that does lead to some interesting rigidity results, such as potentially topological obstructions on the underlying ambient manifold. We introduce a high-dimensional generalization of $3$-dimensional vanishing cycles for symplectic foliations, which we call Lagrangian vanishing cycles, and prove that they prevent a symplectic foliation from being strong, just as vanishing cycles prevent tautness in dimension $3$ due to a classical result by Novikov from 1964. We then describe, in every codimension, examples of symplectically foliated manifolds which admit Lagrangian vanishing cycles, but for which more classical arguments do not obstruct the foliation from being strong. In codimension $1$, this is achieved by a rather explicit modification of the symplectic foliation, which allows us to open up closed leaves having non-trivial holonomy on both sides, and is thus of independent interest. Since there is no comprehensive source on holomorphic curves with boundary in symplectic foliations, we also give a detailed introduction to much of the analytic theory, hoping that it might serve as a reference for future work in this direction.</description>

      <title>On contact invariants in bordered Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define contact invariants in bordered sutured Floer homology. Given a contact 3-manifold with convex boundary, we apply a result of Zarev (arxiv:1010.3496) to derive contact invariants in the bordered sutured modules $\widehat{\mathit{BSA}}$ and $\widehat{\mathit{BSD}}$, as well as in bimodules $\widehat{\mathit{BSAA}},$ $\widehat{\mathit{BSDD}},$ $\widehat{\mathit{BSDA}}$ in the case of two boundary components. In the connected boundary case, our invariants appear to agree with bordered contact invariants defined by Alishahi-F\"oldv\'ari-Hendricks-Licata-Petkova-V\'ertesi (arxiv:2011.08672) whenever the latter are defined, although ours can be defined in broader contexts. We prove that these invariants satisfy a pairing theorem, which is a bordered extension of the Honda-Kazez-Mati\'c gluing map (arxiv:0705.2828) for sutured Floer homology. We also show that there is a correspondence between certain $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$ operations in bordered type-$A$ modules and bypass attachment maps in sutured Floer homology. As an application, we characterize the Stipsicz-V\'ertesi map from $\mathit{SFH}$ to $\widehat{\mathit{HFK}}$ as an $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$ action on $\widehat{\mathit{CFA}}$. We also apply the immersed curve interpretation of Hanselman-Rasmussen-Watson (arxiv:1604.03466) to prove results involving contact surgery.</description>

      <title>Graded Poisson and Graded Dirac structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have been several attempts in recent years to extend the notions of symplectic and Poisson structures in order to create a suitable geometrical framework for classical field theories, trying to achieve a success similar to the use of these concepts in Hamiltonian mechanics. These notions always have a graded character, since the multisymplectic forms are of a higher degree than two. Another line of work has been to extend the concept of Dirac structures to these new scenarios. In the present paper we review all these notions, relate them and propose and study a generalization that (under some mild regularity conditions) includes them and is of graded nature. We expect this generalization to allow us to advance in the study of classical field theories, their integrability, reduction, numerical approximations and even their quantization.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture of Donaldson and Segal on the counts of monopoles and special Lagrangians in Calabi-Yau 3-folds, we prove a compactness theorem for Fueter sections of charge 2 monopole bundles over 3-manifolds: Let $u_k$ be a sequence of Fueter sections of the charge 2 monopole bundle over a closed oriented Riemannian 3-manifold $(M,g)$, with $L^\infty$-norm diverging to infinity. Then a renormalized sequence derived from $u_k$ subsequentially converges to a non-zero $\mathbb{Z}_2$-harmonic 1-form $\mathcal{V}$ on $M$ in the $W^{1,2}$-topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral invariants are quantitative measurements in symplectic topology coming from Floer homology theory. We study their dependence on the choice of coefficients in the context of Hamiltonian Floer homology. We discover phenomena in this setting which hold for $\mathbb{Z}$-coefficients and fail for all field coefficients. For example, we prove that the spectral norm, an important metric derived from spectral invariants, is unbounded over $\mathbb{Z}$ for complex projective spaces, while it is uniformly bounded over all fields. This allows us to answer a symplectic version of a question of Hingston, originally asked in the setting of the energy functional on the loop space. We also provide applications to Hamiltonian dynamics and Hofer's geometry.</description>

      <title>Semi-Local Exotic Lagrangian Tori in Dimension Four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study exotic Lagrangian tori in dimension four. In certain Stein domains $B_{dpq}$ (which naturally appear in almost toric fibrations) we find $d+1$ families of monotone Lagrangian tori which are mutually distinct, up to symplectomorphisms. We prove that these remain distinct under embeddings of $B_{dpq}$ into geometrically bounded symplectic four-manifolds. We show that there are infinitely many different such embeddings when $X$ is compact and (almost) toric and hence conclude that $X$ contains arbitrarily many Lagrangian tori which are distinct up to symplectomorphisms of $X$. In dimension four arbitrarily many different Lagrangian tori were previously known only in del Pezzo surfaces.
  Neither the embedded tori, nor the ambient space $X$ needs to be monotone for our methods to work.</description>

Abstract: The notions of coK\"{a}hler manifolds and 3-cosymplectic manifolds are odd-dimensional analogues of the ones of K\"{a}hler manifolds and hyperK\"{a}hler manifolds, respectively. In this paper, we obtain reduction theorems of coK\"{a}hler manifolds and 3-cosymplectic manifolds. We show that K\"{a}hler and coK\"{a}hler (hyperK\"{a}hler and 3-cosymplectic) reductions admit a natural compatibility with respect to ``cylinder constructions". We further prove the compatibility of K\"{a}hler and coK\"{a}hler reductions with respect to the "mapping torus construction".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the following problem: given a Lagrangian $L$ and a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism $\varphi$ such that $\varphi(L)$ is in a small neighbourhood $U$ of $L$, does there exist another Hamiltonian isotopy from $L$ to $\varphi(L)$ supported in $U$? On one side, we construct an irrational counterexample in any symplectic manifold of dimension at least six. On the other side, we answer an a priori weaker form of the question by the positive in many cases when $L$ satisfies some rationality condition. The techniques that we develop also have applications for the Lagrangian counterpart of the $C^0$ flux conjecture. In turn, these results have many applications, in particular, to understand $C^0$-rigidity phenomena of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms and the space of Lagrangians with a given rationality constant.</description>

      <title>Surfaces of section for geodesic flows of closed surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove several results concerning the existence of surfaces of section for the geodesic flows of closed orientable Riemannian surfaces. The surfaces of section $\Sigma$ that we construct are either Birkhoff sections, meaning that they intersect every sufficiently long orbit segment of the geodesic flow, or at least they have some hyperbolic components in $\partial\Sigma$ as limit sets of the orbits of the geodesic flow that do not return to $\Sigma$. In order to prove these theorems, we provide a study of configurations of simple closed geodesics of closed orientable Riemannian surfaces, which may have independent interest. Our arguments are based on the curve shortening flow.</description>

      <title>The $\mathbb Z/p$-equivariant cohomology of genus zero Deligne-Mumford space with $1+p$ marked points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Serre spectral sequence of the fibration $\overline{\mathcal M}_{0, 1+p} \to E\mathbb Z/p \times_{\mathbb Z/p} \overline{\mathcal M}_{0, 1+p} \to B \mathbb Z/p$ collapses at the $E_2$ page. We use this to prove that: for any element of the $\mathbb Z/p$-equivariant cohomology with $\mathbb F_p$-coefficients of genus zero Deligne-Mumford space with $1+p$ marked points, if this element is torsion then it is non-equivariant. This concludes that the only "interesting" $\mathbb Z/p$-equivariant operations are quantum Steenrod power operations.</description>

      <title>From curve shortening to flat link stability and Birkhoff sections of geodesic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the curve shortening flow to establish three new results on the dynamics of geodesic flows of closed Riemannian surfaces. The first one is the stability, under $C^0$-small perturbations of the Riemannian metric, of certain flat links of closed geodesics. The second one is a forced existence theorem for orientable closed Riemannian surfaces: for surfaces of positive genus, the existence of a contractible simple closed geodesic $\gamma$ forces the existence of infinitely many closed geodesics intersecting $\gamma$ in every primitive free homotopy class of loops; for the 2-sphere, the existence of two disjoint simple closed geodesics forces the existence of a third one intersecting both. The final result asserts the existence of Birkhoff sections for the geodesic flow of any closed orientable Riemannian surface.</description>

      <title>Turk's head knots and links: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We collect and discuss various results on an important family of knots and links called Turk's head knots and links $Th (p,q)$. In the mathematical literature, they also appear under different names such as rosette knots and links or weaving knots and links. Unless being the unknot or the alternating torus links $T(2,q)$, the Turk's head links $Th (p,q)$ are all known to be alternating, fibered, hyperbolic, invertible, non-split, periodic, and prime. The Turk's head links $Th (p,q)$ are also both positive and negative amphichiral if $p$ is chosen to be odd. Moreover, we highlight and present several more results, focusing on Turk's head knots $Th (3,q)$. We finally list several open problems and conjectures for Turk's head knots and links. We conclude with a short appendix on torus knots and links, which might be of independent interest.</description>
