      <title>Wireless Electronic-free Mechanical Metamaterial Implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in wireless smart implants over the last two decades, current implantable devices still operate passively and require additional electronic modules for wireless transmission of the stored biological data. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative wireless force sensing paradigm for implantable systems through the integration of mechanical metamaterials and nano energy harvesting technologies. We demonstrate composite mechanical metamaterial implants capable of serving as all-in-one wireless force sensing units, incorporating functions for power generation, sensing and transmission with ultra-low power requirements. In this alternative communication approach, the electrical signals harvested by the implants from mechanical stimuli are utilized directly for the wireless transmission of the sensed data. We conduct experimental and theoretical studies to demonstrate the wireless detection of the generated strain-induced polarization electric field using electrodes. The feasibility of the proposed wireless force sensing approach is evaluated through a proof-of-concept orthopedic implant in the form of a total knee replacement. The findings indicate that the created wireless, electronic-free metamaterial implants with a power output as low as 0.1 picowatts enable direct, self-powered wireless communication during force sensing across air, simulated body fluid and animal tissue. We validate the functionality of the proposed implants through a series of experiments conducted on an ex vivo human cadaver knee specimen. Furthermore, the effect of electrode size and placement on the strength of the received signals is examined. Finally, we highlight the potential of our approach to create a diverse array of mechanically-tunable wireless force sensing implants without relying on any external power sources.</description>

      <title>On a revised concept of an event that allows linking microdosimetry in nanometric sites and nanodosimetry with macroscopic dosimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microdosimetry and nanodosimetry study the track structure of charged particles, i.e., the stochastics of radiation interaction on the microscopic scale. The (different) concepts developed in micro- and nanodosimetry are matched to the experimental approaches in the two fields. This work reviews the concepts of an event used in the two fields and explores a common denominator between the two methodologies to characterize particle track structure at the nanometric level. An approach to harmonize the concepts of microdosimetry and nanodosimetry for nanometric sites and linking them to macroscopic fluence is theoretically formulated and tested on proton tracks with energies between 1 MeV and 100 MeV. Unification of microdosimetry and nanodosimetry for the same target seems to require three elements: (1) the definition of an event as relating to a beam volume within which interactions of the primary particle can result in energy deposits or ionizations in the site, (2) the definition of a nanodosimetric analogue to a microdosimetric event, and (3) the redefinition of the microdosimetric concept of an event to include only events in which an ionization occurs in the site. The range of impact parameters of particle tracks that contributes to energy imparted in a site appears not to depend on whether any energy deposits or only energy deposits by ionizations are considered. Since there is no longer a one-to-one correspondence between tracks passing a site and the occurrence of an event, it is proposed to use the fluence for which on average one event occurs as a substitute for single events.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Longitudinal Gross Tumor Volume Segmentation in MRI-Guided Adaptive Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of gross tumor volume (GTV) is essential for effective MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy (MRgART) in head and neck cancer. However, manual segmentation of the GTV over the course of therapy is time-consuming and prone to interobserver variability. Deep learning (DL) has the potential to overcome these challenges by automatically delineating GTVs. In this study, our team, $\textit{UW LAIR}$, tackled the challenges of both pre-radiotherapy (pre-RT) (Task 1) and mid-radiotherapy (mid-RT) (Task 2) tumor volume segmentation. To this end, we developed a series of DL models for longitudinal GTV segmentation. The backbone of our models for both tasks was SegResNet with deep supervision. For Task 1, we trained the model using a combined dataset of pre-RT and mid-RT MRI data, which resulted in the improved aggregated Dice similarity coefficient (DSCagg) on an internal testing set compared to models trained solely on pre-RT MRI data. In Task 2, we introduced mask-aware attention modules, enabling pre-RT GTV masks to influence intermediate features learned from mid-RT data. This attention-based approach yielded slight improvements over the baseline method, which concatenated mid-RT MRI with pre-RT GTV masks as input. In the final testing phase, the ensemble of 10 pre-RT segmentation models achieved an average DSCagg of 0.794, with 0.745 for primary GTV (GTVp) and 0.844 for metastatic lymph nodes (GTVn) in Task 1. For Task 2, the ensemble of 10 mid-RT segmentation models attained an average DSCagg of 0.733, with 0.607 for GTVp and 0.859 for GTVn, leading us to $\textbf{achieve 1st place}$. In summary, we presented a collection of DL models that could facilitate GTV segmentation in MRgART, offering the potential to streamline radiation oncology workflows.

      <title>Multi-TE Single-Quantum Sodium (23Na) MRI: A Clinically Translatable Technique for Separation of Mono- and Bi-T2 Sodium Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sodium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive and specific to ionic balance of cells owing to 10 fold difference in sodium concentration across membrane actively maintained by sodium potassium (Na+ K+) pump. Disruption of the pump and membrane integrity, as seen in neurological disorders such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, bipolar disease, and mild traumatic brain injury, leads to a large increase in intracellular sodium. Such a cellular level alteration is however overshadowed by large signal from extracellular sodium, leaving behind a long standing pursuit to separate signals from sodium exhibiting mono vs biexponential transverse (T2) decay under the inherent constraint of low signal to noise ratio even at advanced clinical field of 3 Tesla. Here we propose a novel technique that exploits intrinsic difference in their T2 decays by simply acquiring single quantum images at multiple echo times (TEs) and performing accurate matrix inversion at voxel. This approach was then investigated using numerical models, agar phantoms and human subjects, showing high accuracy of the separation in phantoms (95.8 percent for monoT2 and 72.5 to 80.4 percent for biT2) and clinical feasibility in humans. Thus, sodium MRI at 3T can now facilitate detection of neurological disorders early at cellular level and response to treatment as well.
