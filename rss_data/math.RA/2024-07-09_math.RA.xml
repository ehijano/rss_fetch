      <title>An Anick type wild automorphism of free Poisson algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an Anick type wild automorphism $\delta$ in a 3-generated free Poisson algebra which induces a tame automorphism in a 3-generated polynomial algebra. We also show that $\delta$ is stably tame.

      <title>Symmetric Linear Arc Monadic Datalog and Gadget Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Datalog program solves a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) if and only if it derives the goal predicate precisely on the unsatisfiable instances of the CSP.
  There are three Datalog fragments that are particularly important for finite-domain constraint satisfaction: arc monadic Datalog, linear Datalog, and symmetric linear Datalog, each having good computational properties. We consider the fragment of Datalog where we impose all of these restrictions simultaneously, i.e., we study \emph{symmetric linear arc monadic (slam) Datalog}. We characterise the CSPs that can be solved by a slam Datalog program as those that have a gadget reduction to a particular Boolean constraint satisfaction problem. We also present exact characterisations in terms of a homomorphism duality (which we call \emph{unfolded caterpillar duality}), and in universal-algebraic terms (using known minor conditions, namely the existence of quasi Maltsev operations and $k$-absorptive operations of arity $nk$}, for all $n,k \geq 1$). Our characterisations also imply that the question whether a given finite-domain CSP can be expressed by a slam Datalog program is decidable.</description>

      <title>On the monoid of order-preserving transformations of a finite chain whose ranges are intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we give a presentation for the monoid $IO_n$ of all order-preserving transformations of a $n$-chain whose ranges are intervals. We also consider the submonoid $IO_n^-$ of $IO_n$ consisting of order-decreasing transformations, for which we determine the cardinality, the rank and a presentation.</description>

      <title>The algebraic and geometric classification of noncommutative Jordan algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a method to obtain the algebraic classification of noncommutative Jordan algebras from the classification of Jordan algebras of the same dimension. We use this method to obtain the algebraic classification of complex $3$-dimensional noncommutative Jordan algebras. As a byproduct, we obtain the classification of complex $3$-dimensional Kokoris, standard, generic Poisson, and generic Poisson--Jordan algebras; and also complex $4$-dimensional nilpotent Kokoris and standard algebras. In addition, we consider the geometric classification of varieties of cited algebras, that is the description of its irreducible components.</description>

      <title>A Complete classification of two-dimensional endo-commutative algebras over an arbitrary field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper, we consider the class of so-called endo-commutative algebras. From the identity imposed to specify this class, one can easily see that the product in this class preserves the square of elements. We give a complete classification of this class, up to isomorphism, over any basic field in dimension two. This elementary and self-contained exposition uses the recent result of one of the authors on description of the category of all $2$-dimensional algebras over any basic field.</description>

      <title>Spectrum in alternative topological algebras and a new look at old theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00985v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider real and complex algebras as well as algebras over general fields. In Section 2, we revisit and prove several results on (quadratic) algebras over general fields. In Section 3, we show how to develop the spectral theory in the context of complex (resp. real) one-sided alternative topological algebras. As an application of the existence of spectrum, we prove the existence of nontrivial hyperinvariant linear manifolds for nonscalar (resp. nonquadratic) continuous linear operators acting on complex (resp. real) Fr\'echet spaces. Along the way, spectral theory is used to prove several topological counterparts of the well-known theorems of Frobenius, Hurwitz, Gelfand-Mazur, and Zorn. This is done, for example, in the context of left (resp. right) alternative topological algebras whose duals separate their elements. In Section 4, we consider real and complex algebras in various topological settings and reconsider and prove several results. For instance, it is shown that given a $ 1 &lt; k \in \mathbb{N}$, on any locally complex algebra, there exists a unique nonzero vector space norm, say, $\|.\|$, satisfying the identity $\|a^k\| = \|a\|^k$ on the algebra. In Section 5, among other things, we revisit and slightly strengthen the celebrated theorems of Frobenius, Zorn, Gelfand-Mazur, and Hurwitz, and also give slight extensions of their topological counterparts, e.g., theorems of Albert, Kaplansky, and Urbanik-Wright to name a few, in several settings.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Fourier-Deligne transforms on G/U and the algebra of braids and ties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly identify the algebra generated by symplectic Fourier-Deligne transforms (i.e. convolution with Kazhdan-Laumon sheaves) acting on the Grothendieck group of perverse sheaves on the basic affine space $G/U$, answering a question originally raised by A. Polishchuk. We show it is isomorphic to a distinguished subalgebra, studied by I. Marin, of the generalized algebra of braids and ties (defined in Type $A$ by F. Aicardi and J. Juyumaya and generalized to all types by Marin), providing a connection between geometric representation theory and an algebra defined in the context of knot theory. Our geometric interpretation of this algebra entails some algebraic consequences: we obtain a short and type-independent geometric proof of the braid relations for Juyumaya's generators of the Yokonuma-Hecke algebra (previously proved case-by-case in types $A, D, E$ by Juyumaya and separately for types $B, C, F_4, G_2$ by Juyumaya and S. S. Kannan), a natural candidate for an analogue of a Kazhdan-Lusztig basis, and finally an explicit formula for the dimension of Marin's algebra in Type $A_n$ (previously only known for $n \leq 4$).</description>

      <title>Relative weak global Gorenstein dimension, AB-contexts and model structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the weak Gorenstein global dimension of a ring $R$ with respect to a left $R$-module $C$. We provide several characterizations of when this homological invariant is bounded. Two main applications are given: first, we prove that the weak Gorenstein global dimension of $R$ relative to a semidualizing $(R,S)$-bimodule $C$ can be computed either by the ${\rm G_C}$-flat dimension of the left $R$-modules or right $S$-modules, just like the (absolute) weak global dimension. As a consequence, a new argument for solving Bennis' conjecture is obtained. As a second application, we give a concrete description of the weak equivalences in the ${\rm G_C}$-flat model structure recently found by the authors. In order to prove this result, an interesting connection between abelian model structures and AB-weak contexts is proved. This connection leads to a result that can be applied to obtain abelian model structures with a simpler description of trivial objects.</description>
