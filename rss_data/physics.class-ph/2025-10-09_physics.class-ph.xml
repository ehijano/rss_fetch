      <title>A Steady Loop Current Does Not Radiate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13221v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to classical electrodynamics, a steady loop current does not radiate. Edward, Kenyon, and Lemon show that the present-time approximation of the retarded electric field (the approximation of the magnetic one is trivial) of a steady loop current can be partitioned into a loop integral of a static field expression and a loop integral of an exact (also called total, full, or perfect) differential. Because the latter is zero, no radiation is emitted. Inspired by their work, we do the same for the retarded electric and magnetic fields without approximation, and show that for a steady loop current, the loop integrals of the static field expressions with and without approximation are exactly equal, recovering Coulomb's law and the Biot-Savart law for a steady loop current.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear transmission line: shock waves and the simple wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transmission lines we consider are constructed from the nonlinear inductors and the nonlinear capacitors. In the first part of the paper we additionally include linear ohmic resistors. Thus, the dissipation being taken into account leads to the existence of \mbox{shocks -- the} travelling waves with different asymptotically constant values of the voltage (the capacitor charge) and the current before and after the front of the wave. For the particular values of ohmic resistances (corresponding to strong dissipation) we obtain the analytic solution for the profile of a shock wave. Both the charge on a capacitor and current through the inductor are obtained as the functions of the time and space coordinate. In the case of weak dissipation, we obtain the stationary dispersive shock waves. In the second part of the paper we consider the nonlinear lossless transmission line. We formulate a simple wave approximation for such transmission line, which decouples left/right-going waves. The approximation can also be used for the lossy transmission line, which is considered in the first part of the paper, to describe the formation of the shock wave (but, of course, not the shock wave itself).</description>

      <title>On material-uniform elastic bodies with disclinations and their homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we define material-uniform hyperelastic bodies (in the sense of Noll) containing discrete disclinations and dislocations, and study their properties. We show in a rigorous way that the size of a disclination is limited by the symmetries of the constitutive relation; in particular, if the symmetry group of the body is discrete, it cannot admit arbitrarily small, yet non-zero, disclinations. We then discuss the application of these observations to the derivations of models of bodies with continuously-distributed defects.</description>
