      <title>Abundance and SYZ conjecture in families of hyperkahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a holomorphic line bundle on a hyperkahler manifold $M$, with $c_1(L)$ nef and not big. SYZ conjecture predicts that $L$ is semiample. We prove that this is true, assuming that $(M,L)$ has a deformation $(M',L')$ with $L'$ semiample. We introduce a version of the Teichmuller space that parametrizes pairs $(M,L)$ up to isotopy. We prove a version of the global Torelli theorem for such Teichmuller spaces and use it to deduce the deformation invariance of semiampleness.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce logarithmic Enriques varieties as a singular analogue of Enriques manifolds, generalizing the notion of log-Enriques surfaces introduced by Zhang. We focus then on the properties of the subfamily of log-Enriques varieties that admit a quasi-\'etale cover by a singular symplectic variety and we give many examples.</description>

      <title>On the $k$-th Tjurina number of weighted homogeneous singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ (X,0) $ denote an isolated singularity defined by a weighted homogeneous polynomial $ f $. Let $ \mathcal{O}$ be the local algebra of all holomorphic function germs at the origin with the maximal ideal $m $. We study the $k$-th Tjurina algebra, defined by $ A_k(f): = \mathcal{O} / \left( f , m^k J(f) \right) $, where $J(f)$ denotes the Jacobi ideal of $ \mathcal{O}$. The zeroth Tjurina algebra is well known to represent the tangent space of the base space of the semi-universal deformation of $(X, 0)$. Motivated by this observation, we explore the deformation of $(X,0)$ with respect to a fixed $k$-residue point. We show that the tangent space of the corresponding deformation functor is a subspace of the $k$-th Tjurina algebra. Explicitly calculating the $k$-th Tjurina numbers, which correspond to the dimensions of the Tjurina algebra, plays a crucial role in understanding these deformations. According to the results of Milnor and Orlik, the zeroth Tjurina number can be expressed explicitly in terms of the weights of the variables in $f$. However, we observe that for values of $k$ exceeding the multiplicity of $X$, the $k$-th Tjurina number becomes more intricate and is not solely determined by the weights of variables. In this paper, we introduce a novel complex derived from the classical Koszul complex and obtain a computable formula for the $k$-th Tjurina numbers for all $ k \geqslant 0 $. As applications, we calculate the $k$-th Tjurina numbers for all weighted homogeneous singularities in three variables.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of irreducible desingularization of singularities associated to negative vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the irreducible desingularization of a singularity given by the Grauert blow down of a negative holomorphic vector bundle over a compact complex manifold is unique up to isomorphism, and as an application, we show that two negative line bundles over compact complex manifolds are isomorphic if and only if their Grauert blow downs have isomorphic germs near the singularities. We also show that there is a unique way to modify a submanifold of a complex manifold to a hypersurface, namely, the blow up of the ambient manifold along the submanifold.</description>

      <title>Correlated Gromov-Witten invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric refinement of Gromov-Witten invariants for $\mathbb P^1$-bundles relative to the natural fiberwise boundary structure. We call these refined invariant correlated Gromov-Witten invariants. Furthermore we prove a refinement of the degeneration formula keeping track of the correlation. Finally, combining certain invariance properties of the correlated invariant, a local computation and the refined degeneration formula we follow floor diagrams techniques to prove regularity results for the generating series of the invariants in the case of $\mathbb P^1$-bundles over elliptic curves. Such invariants are expected to play a role in the degeneration formula for reduced Gromov-Witten invariants for abelian and K3 surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We settle the problem of K-stability of quasi-smooth Fano 3-fold hypersurfaces with Fano index 1 by providing lower bounds for their delta invariants. We use the method introduced by Abban and Zhuang for computing lower bounds of delta invariants on flags of hypersurfaces in the Fano 3-fold.</description>

      <title>Stable pairs on local curves and Bethe roots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an explicit formula for the descendent stable pair invariants of all (absolute) local curves in terms of certain power series called Bethe roots, which also appear in the physics/representation theory literature. We derive new explicit descriptions for the Bethe roots which are of independent interest. From this we derive rationality, functional equation and a characterization of poles for the full descendent stable pair theory of local curves as conjectured by Pandharipande and Pixton. We also sketch how our methods give a new approach to the spectrum of quantum multiplication on $\mathsf{Hilb}^n(\mathbf{C}^2)$.</description>

      <title>K-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants of line degrees on flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A homology class $d \in H_2(X)$ of a complex flag variety $X = G/P$ is called a line degree if the moduli space $\overline{M}_{0,0}(X,d)$ of 0-pointed stable maps to $X$ of degree $d$ is also a flag variety $G/P'$. We prove a quantum equals classical formula stating that any $n$-pointed (equivariant, K-theoretic, genus zero) Gromov-Witten invariant of line degree on $X$ is equal to a classical intersection number computed on the flag variety $G/P'$. We also prove an $n$-pointed analogue of the Peterson comparison formula stating that these invariants coincide with Gromov-Witten invariants of the variety of complete flags $G/B$. Our formulas make it straightforward to compute the big quantum K-theory ring of $X$ modulo degrees larger than line degrees.</description>

      <title>On the Satake correspondence for the equivariant quantum differential equations and qKZ difference equations of Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the joint system of equivariant quantum differential equations (qDE) and qKZ difference equations for the Grassmannian $G(k,n)$, which parametrizes $k$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^n$. First, we establish a connection between this joint system for $G(k,n)$ and the corresponding system for the projective space $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$. Specifically, we show that, under suitable \textit{Satake identifications} of the equivariant cohomologies of $G(k,n)$ and $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$, the joint system for $G(k,n)$ is gauge equivalent to a differential-difference system on the $k$-th exterior power of the cohomology of $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$.
  Secondly, we demonstrate that the \textcyr{B}-theorem for Grassmannians, as stated in arXiv:1909.06582, arXiv:2203.03039, is compatible with the Satake identification. This implies that the \textcyr{B}-theorem for $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ extends to $G(k,n)$ through the Satake identification. As a consequence, we derive determinantal formulas and new integral representations for multi-dimensional hypergeometric solutions of the joint qDE and qKZ system for $G(k,n)$.
  Finally, we analyze the Stokes phenomenon for the joint system of qDE and qKZ equations associated with $G(k,n)$. We prove that the Stokes bases of solutions correspond to explicit $K$-theoretical classes of full exceptional collections in the derived category of equivariant coherent sheaves on $G(k,n)$. Furthermore, we show that the Stokes matrices equal the Gram matrices of the equivariant Euler-Poincar\'e-Grothendieck pairing with respect to these exceptional $K$-theoretical bases.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Schemes and Seshadri Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we will propose a new method to investigate Seshadri constants, namely by means of (nested) Hilbert schemes. This will allow us to use the geometry of the latter spaces, for example the computations of the nef cone via Bridgeland stability conditions to gain new insights and bounds on Seshadri constants. Moreover, it turns out that many known Seshadri constants turn up in the wall and chamber decomposition of the movable cone of Hilbert schemes.</description>

      <title>Deforming the weighted-homogeneous foliation, and trivializing families of semi-weighted homogeneous ICIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let X_o be a weighted-homogeneous complete intersection germ in (R^N,o) or (C^N,o), with arbitrary singularities, possibly non-reduced. Take the foliation of the ambient space by weighted-homogeneous real arcs, \ga_s.
  Take a deformation of X_o by higher order terms, X_t. Does the foliation \ga_s deform compatibly with X_t? We identify the ``obstruction locus", \Sigma in X_o, outside of which such a deformation does exist, and possesses exceptionally nice properties.
  Using this deformed foliation we construct a contact trivialization of the family of defining equations by a homeomorphism that is real analytic (resp. Nash) off the origin, differentiable at the origin, whose presentation in weighted-polar coordinates is globally real-analytic (resp. globally Nash), and with controlled Lipschitz/C^1-properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the final paper in the series of five, in which we prove the geometric Langlands conjecture (GLC). We conclude the proof of GLC by showing that there exists a unique (up to tensoring up by a vector space) Hecke eigensheaf corresponding to an irreducible local system (hence, the title of the paper). We achieve this by analyzing the geometry of the stack of local systems.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Rational Cuspidal Curves via the WDVV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a conjectural formula for the characteristic number of rational cuspidal curves in the projective plane by extending the idea of Kontsevich's recursion formula (namely, pulling back the equality of two divisors in the four pointed moduli space). The key geometric input that is needed here is that in the closure of rational cuspidal curves, there are two component rational curves which are tangent to each other at the nodal point. While this fact is geometrically quite believable, we haven't as yet proved it; hence our formula is for the moment conjectural. The answers that we obtain agree with what has been computed earlier Ran, Pandharipande, Zinger and Ernstrom and Kennedy. We extend this technique (modulo another conjecture) to obtain the characteristic number of rational quartics with an E6 singularity.</description>

Abstract: We show that the continuous \'etale cohomology groups $H^n_{\mathrm{cont}}(X,\mathbf{Q}_l(n))$ of smooth varieties $X$ over a finite field $k$ are spanned as $\mathbf{Q}_l$-vector spaces by the $n$-th Milnor $K$-sheaf locally for the Zariski topology, for all $n\ge 0$. Here $l$ is a prime invertible in $k$. This is the first general unconditional result towards the conjectures of arXiv:math/9801017 (math.AG) which put together the Tate and the Beilinson conjectures relative to algebraic cycles on smooth projective $k$-varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study moduli spaces of Higgs sheaves valued in line bundles and the associated Hitchin maps on surfaces. We first work out Picard groups of generic (very general) spectral varieties which holds for dimension of at least 2, i.e., a Noether--Lefschetz type theorem for spectral varieties. We then apply this to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the non-emptyness of generic Hitchin fibers for surfaces cases. Then we move on to detect the geometry of the moduli spaces of Higgs sheaves as the second Chern class varies.</description>

      <title>Numerical characterizations for integral dependence of graded ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R=\oplus_{m\geq 0}R_m$ be a standard graded Noetherian domain over a field $R_0$ and $I\subseteq J$ be two graded ideals in $R$ such that $0&lt;\mbox{height}\;I\leq \mbox{height}\;J &lt;d$. Then we give a set of numerical characterizations of the integral dependence of $I$ and ${J}$ in terms of certain multiplicities. A novelty of the approach is that it does not involve localization and only requires checking computable and well-studied invariants.
  In particular, we show the following: let $S=R[Y]$, $\mathsf{I} = IS$ and $\mathsf{J} = JS$ and $\bf d$ be the maximum generating degree of both $I$ and $J$. Then the following statements are equivalent.
  (1) $\overline{I} = \overline{J}$.
  (2) $\varepsilon(I)=\varepsilon(J)$ and $e_i(R[It]) = e_i(R[Jt])$ for all $0\leq i &lt;\dim(R/I)$.
  (3) $e\big(R[It]_{\Delta_{(c,1)}}\big) = e\big(R[Jt]_{\Delta_{(c,1)}}\big)$ and $e\big(S[\mathsf{I}t]_{\Delta_{(c,1)}}\big) = e\big(S[\mathsf{J}t]_{\Delta_{(c,1)}}\big)$ for some integer $c&gt;{\bf d}$.
  The statement $(2)$ generalizes the classical result of Rees. The statement $(3)$ gives the integral dependence criteria in terms of the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicities of certain standard graded domains over $R_0$. As a consequence of $(3)$, we also get an equivalent statement in terms of (Teissier) mixed multiplicities.
  Apart from several well-established results, the proofs of these results use the theory of density functions which was developed recently by the authors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth complex manifold. Assume that $Y\subset X$ is a K\"{a}hler submanifold such that $X\setminus Y$ is biholomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^n$. We prove that $(X, Y)$ is biholomorphic to the standard example $(\mathbb{P}^n, \mathbb{P}^{n-1})$. We then study certain K\"{a}hler orbifold compactifications of $\mathbb{C}^n$ and prove that on $\mathbb{C}^3$ the flat metric is the only asymptotically conical Ricci-flat K\"{a}hler metric whose metric cone at infinity has a smooth link. As a key technical ingredient, a new formula for minimal discrepancy of isolated Fano cone singularities in terms of generalized Conley-Zehnder indices in symplectic geometry is derived.</description>

      <title>Mixed $\ell$-adic complexes for schemes over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:1806.03096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $X$ is a variety over a number field, Annette Huber has defined a category of "horizontal" (or "almost everywhere unramified") $\ell$-adic complexes and $\ell$-adic perverse sheaves on $X$. For such objects, the notion of weights makes sense (in the sense of Deligne), just as in the case of varieties over finite fields. However, contrary to what happens in that last case, mixed perverse sheaves (or mixed locally constant sheaves) on $X$ do not have a weight filtration in general, even when $X$ is a point. The goal of this paper is to show how to avoid this problem by working directly in the derived category of the abelian category of perverse sheaves that do admit a weight filtration. As an application, the methods of a previous paper of the author to calculate the intermediate extension of a pure perverse sheaf apply over any finitely generated field, and not just over a finite field.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a very general hypersurface of degree $d$ in the projective $(n+1)$-space with $n \ge 3$, and $f: X \to Y$ a non-birational surjective morphism to a normal projective variety $Y$. We first prove that $Y$ is a klt Fano variety if ${\rm deg} \, f \ge C$ for some constant $C = C(n, d)$ depending only on $n$ and $d$. Next we prove an optimal upper bound ${\rm deg} \, f \le {\rm deg} \, X$ provided that $Y$ is factorial, ${\rm deg} \, f$ is prime and ${\rm deg} \, f \ge E(n)$ for some constant $E(n)$ (with $E(n) = n(n+1)$ when $Y$ is smooth). As a corollary, we show that $Y \cong {\mathbb P}^n$ under some conditions on $Y$ and ${\rm deg} \, f$.</description>

      <title>Cup products on curves over finite fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.00329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $k$ is a finite field, that $C$ is a smooth projective geometrically irreducible curve over $k$, and that $n$ is a positive integer not divisible by the characteristic of $k$. In this paper we compute cup products of elements of the \'etale cohomology groups $\mathrm{H}^1(C,\mathbb{Z}/n)$ and $\mathrm{H}^1(C,\mu_n)$. Over the algebraic closure $\overline{k}$ of $k$, such cup products are connected to values of the Weil pairing on the $n$-torsion of the Jacobian of $\overline{C} = \overline{k} \otimes_k C$ by using a fixed isomorphism between $\mathbb{Z}/n$ and $\mu_n$ over $\overline{C}$. Over $k$, such cup products are more subtle due to the fact that they take values in the group $\mathrm{H}^2(C,\mu_n)=\mathrm{Pic}(C)/n\cdot \mathrm{Pic}(C)$ rather than in the group $\mathrm{H}^2(\overline{C},\mu_n) = \mathbb{Z}/n$.</description>

      <title>An inclusion-exclusion principle for tautological sheaves on Hilbert schemes of points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.05179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show an equation of Euler characteristics of tautological sheaves on Hilbert schemes of points on the fibers of a double point degeneration. This equation resembles a computation of such Euler characteristics via a combinatorial inclusion-exclusion principle. As a consequence, we show the existence of universal polynomials for the Euler characteristics of tautological sheaves on the Hilbert scheme of points on smooth proper algebraic spaces. We apply this result to a conjecture of Zhou on tautological sheaves on Hilbert schemes of points, and reduce the conjecture to the cases of products of projective spaces. Our main tools are good degenerations and algebraic cobordism.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this work is to study geometric properties of geometrically irreducible subschemes on degenerations of Fano varieties (more generally, of separably rationally connected varieties). It is known that these geometrically irreducible subschemes exist when the ground field has characteristic zero or contains an algebraically closed subfield. We show that the dimension of this geometrically irreducible subscheme has a lower bound by the Fano index of the generic fibre.</description>

      <title>Integrability of pushforward measures by analytic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.12446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a map $\phi:X\rightarrow Y$ between $F$-analytic manifolds over a local field $F$ of characteristic $0$, we introduce an invariant $\epsilon_{\star}(\phi)$ which quantifies the integrability of pushforwards of smooth compactly supported measures by $\phi$. We further define a local version $\epsilon_{\star}(\phi,x)$ near $x\in X$. These invariants have a strong connection to the singularities of $\phi$.
  When $Y$ is one-dimensional, we give an explicit formula for $\epsilon_{\star}(\phi,x)$, and show it is asymptotically equivalent to other known singularity invariants such as the $F$-log-canonical threshold $\operatorname{lct}_{F}(\phi-\phi(x);x)$ at $x$.
  In the general case, we show that $\epsilon_{\star}(\phi,x)$ is bounded from below by the $F$-log-canonical threshold $\lambda=\operatorname{lct}_{F}(\mathcal{J}_{\phi};x)$ of the Jacobian ideal $\mathcal{J}_{\phi}$ near $x$. If $\dim Y=\dim X$, equality is attained. If $\dim Y&lt;\dim X$, the inequality can be strict; however, for $F=\mathbb{C}$, we establish the upper bound $\epsilon_{\star}(\phi,x)\leq\lambda/(1-\lambda)$, whenever $\lambda&lt;1$.
  Finally, we specialize to polynomial maps $\varphi:X\rightarrow Y$ between smooth algebraic $\mathbb{Q}$-varieties $X$ and $Y$. We geometrically characterize the condition that $\epsilon_{\star}(\varphi_{F})=\infty$ over a large family of local fields, by showing it is equivalent to $\varphi$ being flat with fibers of semi-log-canonical singularities.</description>

      <title>Fourier transforms of irregular holonomic D-modules, singularities at infinity of meromorphic functions and irregular characteristic cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04113v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the recent developments in the irregular Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for holonomic D-modules and the Fourier-Sato transforms for enhanced ind-sheaves, we study the Fourier transforms of some irregular holonomic D-modules. For this purpose, the singularities of rational and meromorphic functions on complex affine varieties will be studied precisely, with the help of some new methods and tools such as meromorphic vanishing cycle functors. As a consequence, we show that the exponential factors and the irregularities of the Fourier transform of a holonomic D-module are described geometrically by the stationary phase method, as in the classical case of dimension one. A new feature in the higher-dimensional case is that we have some extra rank jump of the Fourier transform produced by the singularities of the linear perturbations of the exponential factors at their points of indeterminacy. In the course of our study, not necessarily homogeneous Lagrangian cycles that we call irregular characteristic cycles will play a crucial role.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every toric monoid appears in a space of maps from tropical curves to an orthant. It follows that spaces of logarithmic maps to Artin fans exhibit arbitrary toric singularities: a virtual universality theorem for logarithmic maps to pairs. The target rank depends on the chosen singularity: we show that the cone over the 7-gon never appears in a space of maps to a rank 1 target. We obtain similar results for tropical maps to affine space.</description>

Abstract: A fake projective plane is a complex surface with the same Betti numbers as $\mathbb{C} P^2$ but not biholomorphic to it. We study the fake projective plane $\mathbb{P}_{\operatorname{fake}}^2 = (a = 7, p = 2, \emptyset, D_3 2_7)$ in the Cartwright-Steger classification. In this paper, we exploit the large symmetries given by $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{P}_{\operatorname{fake}}^2) = C_7 \rtimes C_3$ to construct an embedding of this surface into $\mathbb{C} P^5$ as a system of $56$ sextics with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-7})$. For each torsion line bundle $T \in \operatorname{Pic}(\mathbb{P}_{\operatorname{fake}}^2)$, we also compute and study the linear systems $|nH + T|$ with small $n$, where $H$ is an ample generator of the N\'eron-Severi group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to investigate the only two families $\mathcal{F}^A_{G}$ of Calabi-Yau $3$-folds $A/G$ with $A$ an abelian $3$-fold and $G\le \text{Aut}(A)$ a finite group acting freely: one in constructed by Catanese and Demleitner and the other is presented here. We provide a complete classification of the automorphism group of $X\in \mathcal{F}^A_{G}$. Additionally, we construct and classify the quotients $X/\Upsilon$ for any $\Upsilon\le \text{Aut}(X)$. Specifically, for those groups $\Upsilon$ that preserve the volume form of $X$ then $X/\Upsilon$ admits a desingularization $Y$ which is a Calabi-Yau $3$-fold: we compute the Hodge numbers and the fundamental group of these $Y$, thereby determining all topological in-equivalent Calabi-Yau $3$-folds obtained in this way.</description>

We show that the top homology group of this complex is an equivariant birational invariant of $G$-varieties. As an application, we demonstrate the non-linearizability of certain large abelian group actions on smooth hypersurfaces in projective space of any dimension and degree at least $3$.</description>

Abstract: For connected reductive groups together with a Frobenius root $F$ that preserves the set of simple reflections, we show that for every tuple $(w_1,\ldots, w_r)$ of Weyl group elements there exists a minimal length element in an $F$-conjugacy class in $W$ such that the cohomology of the structure sheaf and the canonical sheaf for the associated compactified Deligne--Lusztig varieties are isomorphic respectively.</description>

      <title>Tjurina spectrum and Hertling conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06242v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a hypersurface isolated singularity, we verify that the Tjurina spectrum depends only on the complex analytic hypersurface germ. This is reduced to the analytic version of a theorem of Mustata and Popa on the coincidence of the Hodge ideals with the microlocal $V$-filtration modulo the ideal of the hypersurface (using the Deligne extension). We then give a proof of a conjecture of Q. Shi, Y. Wang and H. Zuo claiming that the maximal spectral number of a complex hypersurface isolated singularity is not a member of the Tjurina spectrum. This follows from the self-duality of the Jacobian ring, since the latter is compatible with the action of $f$ as well as the $V$-filtration. We also provide a sufficient condition for the generalized Hertling conjecture on the variance of Tjurina spectrum to fail, and calculate certain examples using some codes in Singular.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective integral variety over a finitely generated field $k$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$. We show that the finiteness of the exponent of the $p$-primary part of $\mathrm{Br}(X_{k^s})^{G_k}$ is equivalent to the Tate conjecture for divisors, generalizing D'Addezio's theorem for abelian varieties to arbitrary smooth projective varieties. In combination with the Leray spectral sequence for rigid cohomology derived from the Berthelot conjecture recently proved by Ertl-Vezzani, we show that the cokernel of $\mathrm{Br}_{\mathrm{nr}}(K(X)) \rightarrow \mathrm{Br}(X_{k^s})^{G_k}$ is of finite exponent. This completes the $p$-primary part of the generalization of Artin-Grothendieck's theorem on relations between Brauer groups and Tate-Shafarevich groups to higher relative dimensions.</description>

      <title>Toric degenerations and Newton-Okounkov bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent times, a wide variety of combinatorics has been introduced in order to solve problems from algebraic geometry. Newton-Okounkov bodies and tropical geometry are two such combinatorial theories. As shown by Kaveh and Manon, there is a certain correspondence between these two. Building on this correspondence, and exploiting the link of both theories to toric degenerations, Harada and Escobar obtained their wall-crossing result for prime cones. This result states that moving between two adjacent prime maximal cones in a tropical variety corresponds to a mutation between the associated Newton-Okounkov bodies of these cones. In this thesis, we provide a method for applying the wall-crossing result to non-prime cones. Our approach uses a procedure developed by Bossinger, Lamboglia, Mincheva and Mohammadi in order to compute an embedding which changes a tropical variety in such a way that a non-prime cone becomes prime. Assuming that adjacent cones stay adjacent, the wall-crossing result can then be applied in this new embedding. Building on computations by Clarke, Mohammadi and Zaffalon, we show that for Gr(3,6), this approach works. We compute the new embedding and its tropicalization in this case, and study the relation between cones in the new embedding and the original embedding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the behaviour of a free conic-line arrangement with respect to the deletion, respectively addition, of a smooth conic. Along the way we derive some restrictions on the geometry of the conic-line arrangement, induced by the freeness property. We show the same behaviour with respect to the deletion-addition of a smooth conic extends to general free reduced curves in the complex projective plane.</description>

      <title>On L-equivalence for K3 surfaces and hyperk\"ahler manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between L-equivalence and D-equivalence for K3 surfaces and hyperk\"ahler manifolds. Building on Efimov's approach using Hodge theory, we prove that very general L-equivalent K3 surfaces are D-equivalent, leveraging the Derived Torelli Theorem for K3 surfaces. Our main technical contribution is that two distinct lattice structures on an integral, irreducible Hodge structure are related by a rational endomorphism of the Hodge structure. We partially extend our results to hyperk\"ahler fourfolds and moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces.</description>

      <title>Eisenstein-Kronecker classes, integrality of critical values of Hecke $L$-functions and $p$-adic interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.03657v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for an arbitrary totally complex number field $L$ the (regularized) critical $L$-values of algebraic Hecke characters of $L$ divided by certain periods are algebraic integers. This relies on a new construction of an equivariant coherent cohomology class with values in the completion of the Poincar\'e bundle on an abelian scheme $\cal{A}$. From this we obtain a cohomology class for the automorphism group of a CM abelian scheme $\cal{A}$ with values in some canonical bundles, which can be explicitly calculated in terms of Eisenstein-Kronecker series. As a further consequence, using an infinitesimal trivialization of the Poincar\'e bundle, we construct a $p$-adic measure interpolating the critical $L$-values in the ordinary case. This generalizes previous results for CM fields by Damerell, Shimura and Katz and settles the algebraicity and $p$-adic interpolation in the remaining open cases of critical values of Hecke $L$-functions.</description>

      <title>Distinguished varieties in a family of domains associated with spectral interpolation and operator theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.16077v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find characterization for the distinguished varieties in the symmetrized polydisc $\mathbb G_n \; (n\geq 2)$ and thus generalize the work [\textit{J. Funct. Anal.}, 266 (2014), 5779 -- 5800] on $\mathbb G_2$ by the author and Shalit. We show that a distinguished variety $\Lambda$ in $\mathbb G_n$ is a part of an algebraic curve, which is a set-theoretic complete intersection, and that $\Lambda$ can be represented by the Taylor joint spectrum of $n-1$ commuting scalar matrices satisfying certain conditions. An $n$-tuple of commuting Hilbert space operators $(S_1, \dots ,S_{n-1},P)$ for which $\Gamma_n=\overline{\mathbb G_n}$ is a spectral set is called a $\Gamma_n$-contraction. To every $\Gamma_n$-contraction $(S_1, \dots ,S_{n-1},P)$ there is a unique operator tuple $(F_1, \dots , F_{n-1})$, called the $\mathcal F_O$-tuple of $(S_1, \dots ,S_{n-1},P)$, satisfying \[ S_i-S_{n-i}^*P=D_PF_iD_P \,,\quad i=1, \dots ,n-1. \] We produce concrete functional model for the pure isometric-operator tuples associated with $\Gamma_n$ and by an application of that model we establish that the $\Gamma_n$-contractions $(S_1, \dots ,S_{n-1},P)$ and $(S_1^*, \dots , S_{n-1}^*,P^*)$ admit normal $\partial \overline{ \Lambda}_{\Sigma}-$dilations for a unique distinguished variety $\Lambda_{\Sigma}$ in $\mathbb G_n$, when $\Lambda_{\Sigma}$ is determined by the $\mathcal F_O$-tuple of $(S_1, \dots ,S_{n-1}, P)$. Further, we show that the dilation of $(S_1^*, \dots ,S_{n-1}^*,P^*)$ is minimal and acts on the minimal unitary dilation space of $P^*$. Also, we show interplay between the distinguished varieties in $\mathbb G_2$ and $\mathbb G_{3}$.</description>

      <title>K-differentials with prescribed singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local invariants that a meromorphic $k$-differential on a Riemann surface of genus $g \geq 0$ can have for $k \geq 3$. These local invariants include the orders of zeros and poles, as well as the $k$-residues at the poles. We show that for a given pattern of orders of zeros, there exists, with a few exceptions, a primitive holomorphic $k$-differential having zeros of these orders. In the meromorphic case, for genus $g \geq 1$, every expected tuple appears as a configuration of $k$-residues. On the other hand, for certain strata in genus zero, finitely many tuples (up to simultaneous scaling) do not occur as configurations of $k$-residues for a $k$-differential.</description>

      <title>Motivic coaction and single-valued map of polylogarithms from zeta generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new Lie-algebraic approach to explicitly construct the motivic coaction and single-valued map of multiple polylogarithms in any number of variables. In both cases, the appearance of multiple zeta values is controlled by conjugating generating series of polylogarithms with Lie-algebra generators associated with odd zeta values. Our reformulation of earlier constructions of coactions and single-valued polylogarithms preserves choices of fibration bases, exposes the correlation between multiple zeta values of different depths and paves the way for generalizations beyond genus zero.</description>

      <title>Further results on orbits and incidence matrices for the class $\mathcal{O}_6$ of lines external to the twisted cubic in $\mathrm{PG}(3,q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00333v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the literature, lines of the projective space $\mathrm{PG}(3,q)$ are partitioned into classes, each of which is a union of line orbits under the stabilizer group of the twisted cubic. The least studied class is named $\mathcal{O}_6$. This class contains lines external to the twisted cubic which are not its chords or axes and do not lie in any of its osculating planes. For even and odd $q$, we propose a new family of orbits of $\mathcal{O}_6$ and investigate in detail their stabilizer groups and the corresponding submatrices of the point-line and plane-line incidence matrices. To obtain these submatrices, we explored the number of solutions of cubic and quartic equations connected with intersections of lines (including the tangents to the twisted cubic), points, and planes in $\mathrm{PG}(3,q)$.</description>
