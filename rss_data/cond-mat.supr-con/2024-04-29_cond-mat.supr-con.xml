      <title>Discovery of Giant Unit-Cell Super-Structure in the Infinite-Layer Nickelate PrNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectacular quantum phenomena such as superconductivity often emerge in flat-band systems where Coulomb interactions overpower electron kinetics. Engineering strategies for flat-band physics is therefore of great importance. Here, using high-energy grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction, we demonstrate how in-situ temperature annealing of the infinite-layer nickelate PrNiO$_2$ induces a giant superlattice structure. The annealing effect has a maximum well above room temperature. By covering a large scattering volume, we show a rare period-six in-plane (bi-axial) symmetry and a period-four symmetry in the out-of-plane direction. This giant unit-cell superstructure likely stems from ordering of diffusive oxygen. The stability of this superlattice structure suggests a connection to an energetically favorable electronic state of matter. As such, our study provides a new pathway - different from Moir\'e structures - to ultra-small Brillouin zone electronics.</description>

      <title>Influence ScN protective thin layer on the superconducting properties of ultrathin NbN films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study delves into exploring the impact of a thin protective layer of scandium nitride (ScN) on the superconductive properties of thin films of niobium nitride (NbN) generated through reactive magnetron deposition. This is the first time such an investigation has been carried out. The article offers a comprehensive investigation of the morphological, microstructural, and electrophysical features of thin films that have undergone high-temperature annealing in an oxygen-rich environment. The dependence of the critical transition temperature of the NbN thin film on the annealing temperature of the samples in an oxygen medium, with and without ScN coating, was determined. According to X-ray reflectometry studies, it has been observed that the ScN film serves as a protective layer, even when exposed to annealing temperatures of approximately 450{\deg}C, without significantly affecting the NbN layer density or thickness. It has been shown that adding a ScN coating to a thin NbN film increases its resistance to corrosive media compared to a film without the coating.</description>

      <title>Constrained Hamiltonian dynamics for electrons in magnetic field and additional forces besides the Lorentz force acting on electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the forces acting on electrons in magnetic field including the constraints and a condition arising from quantum mechanics. The force is calculated as the electron mass, $m_e$, multiplied by the total time-derivative of the velocity field evaluated using the quantum mechanical many-electron wave function. The velocity field includes a term of the Berry connection from the many-body wave function; thereby, quantum mechanical effects are included. It is shown that additional important forces besides the Lorentz force exist; they include the gradient of the electron velocity field kinetic energy, the gradient of the chemical potential, and the `force' for producing topologically protected loop currents. These additional forces are shown to be important in superconductivity, electric current in metallic wires, and charging of capacitors.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of anisotropic Cooper pairing in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recently discovered kagome superconductor AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs), the superconductivity is intertwined with an unconventional charge density wave order. Its pairing symmetry remains elusive owing to the lack of direct measurement of the superconducting gap in the momentum space. In this letter, utilizing laser-based ultra-high-resolution and low-temperature angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe anisotropic Cooper pairing in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. We detect a highly anisotropic superconducting gap structure with an anisotropy over 80% and the gap maximum along the V-V bond direction on a Fermi surface originated from the 3d-orbital electrons of the V kagome lattice. It is in stark contrast to the isotropic superconducting gap structure on the other Fermi surface that is occupied by Sb 5p-orbital electrons. Our observation of the anisotropic Cooper pairing in pristine CsV3Sb5 is fundamental for understanding intertwined orders in the ground state of kagome superconductors.</description>

      <title>Origin of Ferroelectricity and Superconductivity with Nontrivial Electronic Topology in Fluorinated Nb2N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) intrinsic superconductors with nontrivial topology band and vertical ferroelectricity exhibit fascinating characteristics to achieving electrostatic control of quantum phases.While, only a few such 2D materials have been theoretically predicted. In this work, based on first principles calculations we explore the superconductivity and ferroelectric properties in fluorinated 2D Nb2N. H3-Nb2NF2 breaks the spatial inversion symmetry, exhibiting vertical ferroelectric and metallic properties. More interesting, it not only possesses intrinsic superconductivity with Tc of 10 K, but also exhibits nontrivial band topology. While, H1-Nb2NF2, which contains the inversion symmetry, shows the highest Tc of 32 K, surpassing most of superconductors with nontrivial band topological properties. Our research has enriched 2D superconducting materials with nontrivial band topology and ferroelectric properties, and provided a theoretical basis for the preparation of devices switching between superconducting and ferroelectric states with external electric field.</description>

      <title>Scheme for braiding Majorana zero modes in vortices using an STT-matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently conducted experiments on two-dimensional topological superconductors have revealed various indications of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, progress in the manipulation of MZM braiding has been limited, impeding the realization of topological quantum computing. In this study, we propose a potential braiding scheme based on a spintronic device matrix. This scheme involves utilizing a matrix composed of spin-transfer torque devices (STT-matrix) alongside a two-dimensional topological superconductor material. By programming the ON/OFF states of the spintronic devices within the STT-matrix, it becomes possible to manipulate vortices hosting MZMs in the two-dimensional topological superconductor. To further investigate this concept, we construct a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model and perform numerical simulations to analyze vortex-driving dynamics, MZM braiding processes, and MZM fusion phenomena. Our findings demonstrate that this system exhibits high versatility and flexibility in manipulating vortices. With advancements in spintronic device technology, our proposed scheme offers a feasible and practical method for operating MZMs within vortices present in topological superconductors.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Superconducting Magnetoelectric Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A supercurrent flow can induce a nonvanishing spin magnetization in noncentrosymmetric superconductors with spin-orbit interaction. Often known as the non-dissipative magnetoelectric effect, these are most commonly found at linear order in supercurrent flow. Here, we argue that a nonlinear superconducting magnetoelectric effect (NSM) can naturally manifest in altermagnet/superconductor (ALM/SC) heterostructures: NSM manifests as a spin polarization generated as a second-order response to a driving supercurrent. Strikingly, we find NSM is the leading order magnetization response in ALM/SC heterostructures and survives even in the presence of centrosymmetry; $C_4 \mathcal{T}$ symmetry in altermagnets zeroes both the equilibrium magnetization as well as out-of-plane linear magnetoelectric response. This renders NSM a powerful electric and non-dissipative means of controlling magnetization in ALM/SC heterostructures, a promising platform for superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Self-training superconducting neuromorphic circuits using reinforcement learning rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in a wide range of applications, from gaming and robotics to autonomous vehicles. In this paper we describe a set of reinforcement learning-based local weight update rules and their implementation in superconducting hardware. Using SPICE circuit simulations, we implement a small-scale neural network with a learning time of order one nanosecond. This network can be trained to learn new functions simply by changing the target output for a given set of inputs, without the need for any external adjustments to the network. In this implementation the weights are adjusted based on the current state of the overall network response and locally stored information about the previous action. This removes the need to program explicit weight values in these networks, which is one of the primary challenges that analog hardware implementations of neural networks face. The adjustment of weights is based on a global reinforcement signal that obviates the need for circuitry to back-propagate errors.</description>

      <title>High-performance gate-controlled superconducting switches: large output voltage and reproducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logic circuits consist of devices that can be controlled between two distinct states. The recent demonstration that a superconducting current flowing in a constriction can be controlled via a gate voltage ($V_G$) - can lead to superconducting logic with better performance than existing logics. However, before such logic is developed, high reproducibility in the functioning of GCS devices and optimization of their performance must be achieved. Here, we report an investigation of gated Nb devices showing GCS with unprecedently-high reproducibility. Based on the investigation of a statistically-significant number of devices, we demonstrate that the GCS is independent of the constriction width, in contrast with previous reports, and confirm a strong correlation between the GCS and the leakage current ($I_{leak}$) induced by $V_G$. We also achieve a voltage output in our devices larger than the typical values reported to date by at least one order of magnitude, which is relevant for the future interconnection of devices, and show that $I_{leak}$ can be used as a tool to modulate the operational $V_G$ of devices on a $SiO_2$ substrates. These results altogether represent an important step forward towards the optimization of reproducibility and performance of GCS devices, and the future development of a GCS-based logic.</description>

      <title>Fractional ac Josephson effect as evidence of topological hinge states in a Dirac semimetal NiTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate Josephson current between two 5~$\mu$m spaced superconducting indium leads, coupled to a NiTe$_2$ single crystal flake, which is a type-II Dirac semimetal. Under microwave irradiation, we demonstrate a.c. Josephson effect at millikelvin temperatures as a number of Shapiro steps. In addition to the integer ($n=1,2,3,4...$) steps, we observe fractional ones at half-integer values $n=1/2,3/2,5/2$ and 7/2, which corresponds to $\pi$ periodicity of current-phase relationship. In contrast to previous investigations, we do not observe $4\pi$ periodicity (disappearance of the odd $n=1,3,5...$ Shapiro steps), while the latter is usually considered as a fingerprint of helical surface states in Dirac semimetals and topological insulators. We argue, that our experiment confirms Josephson current through the topological hinge states in NiTe$_2$: since one can exclude bulk supercurrent in 5~$\mu$m long Josephson junctions, interference of the hinge modes is responsible for the $\pi$ periodicity, while stable odd Shapiro steps reflect chiral character of the topological hinge states.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz transitions and Weyl semimetals from a topological superconductor with supercurrent flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A current flowing through a superconductor induces a spatial modulation in its superconducting order parameter, characterized by a wavevector $Q$ related to the total momentum of a Cooper pair. Here we investigate this phenomenon in a $p$-wave topological superconductor, described by a one-dimensional Kitaev model. We demonstrate that, by treating $Q$ as an extra synthetic dimension, the current carrying non-equilibrium steady state can be mapped into the ground state of a half-filled two-dimensional Weyl semimetal, whose Fermi surface exhibits Lifshitz transitions when varying the model parameters. Specifically, the transition from Type-I to Type-II Weyl phases corresponds to the emergence of a gapless $p$-wave superconductor, where Cooper pairs coexist with unpaired electrons and holes. Such transition is signaled by the appearance of a sharp cusp in the $Q$-dependence of the supercurrent, at a critical value $Q^*$ that is robust to variations of the chemical potential $\mu$. We determine the maximal current that the system can sustain in the topological phase, and discuss possible implementations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Phonon in Charge-Density-Wave Phase of Kagome Metal CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CsV3Sb5, a notable compound within the kagome family, is renowned for its topological and superconducting properties, as well as its detection of local magnetic field and anomalous Hall effect in experiments. However, the origin of this local magnetic field is still veiled. In this study, we employ the first-principles calculations to investigate the atomic vibration in both the pristine and the charge-density-wave phases of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our analysis reveals the presence of ``anomalous phonons" in these structures, these phonon induce the circular vibration of atoms, contributing to the phonon magnetic moments and subsequently to the observed the local magnetic fields. Additionally, we observe that lattice distortion in the charge-density-wave phase amplifies these circular vibrations, resulting in a stronger local magnetic field, particularly from the vanadium atoms. This investigation not only reveals the potential relation between lattice distortion and atomic polarization but also offers a novel idea to understand the origin of local magnetic moment in CsV3Sb5.</description>

      <title>Molecular Pairing in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theory for how the weak phonon-mediated interaction ($J_{\rm A}\!=\!1\!\sim\!4$meV) wins over the prohibitive Coulomb repulsion ($U\!=\!30\!\sim\!60$meV) and leads to a superconductor in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). We find the pairing mechanism akin to that in the A$_3$C$_{60}$ family of molecular superconductors: Each AA stacking region of MATBG resembles a C$_{60}$ molecule, in that optical phonons can dynamically lift the degeneracy of the moir\'e orbitals, in analogy to the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect. Such induced $J_{\rm A}$ has the form of an inter-valley anti-Hund's coupling and is less suppressed than $U$ by the Kondo screening near a Mott insulator. Additionally, we also considered an intra-orbital Hund's coupling $J_{\rm H}$ that originates from the on-site repulsion of a carbon atom. Under a reasonable approximation of the realistic model, we prove that the renormalized local interaction between quasi-particles must have a pairing (negative) channel in a doped correlated insulator at $\nu=\pm(2+\delta\nu)$, albeit the bare interaction is positive definite. The proof is non-perturbative and based on exact asymptotic behaviors of the vertex function imposed by Ward identities. Existence of an optimal $U$ for superconductivity is predicted. We also analyzed the pairing symmetry. In a large area of the parameter space of $J_{\rm A}$, $J_{\rm H}$, the ground state has a nematic $d$-wave singlet pairing, which, however, can lead to a $p$-wave-like nodal structure due to the Berry's phase on Fermi surfaces (or Euler obstruction).</description>

      <title>Orbital-selective Superconductivity in the Pressurized Bilayer Nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: An Infinite Projected Entangled-Pair State Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The newly discovered high-$T_c$ nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has generated significant research interest. To uncover the pairing mechanism, it is essential to investigate the intriguing interplay between the two $e_g$, i.e., $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Here we perform an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) study of the bilayer $t$-$J$ model, directly in the thermodynamic limit and with orbitally selective parameters for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, respectively. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons exhibit significant intralayer hopping $t_\parallel$ and spin couplings $J_\parallel$, with interlayer $J_\perp$ passed from the $d_{z^2}$ electrons. However, the interlayer $t_\perp$ is negligible in this case. In contrast, the $d_{z^2}$ orbital demonstrates strong interlayer $t_\perp$ and $J_\perp$, while the inherent intralayer $t_\parallel$ and $J_\parallel$ are small. Based on the iPEPS results, we find clear orbital-selective behaviors in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals exhibit robust superconductive (SC) order driven by the interlayer coupling $J_\perp$; while the $d_{z^2}$ band shows relatively weak SC order as a result of small $t_\parallel$ (lack of coherence) but large $t_\perp$ (strong Pauli blocking). Furthermore, by substituting rare-earth element Pm or Sm with La, we find an enhanced SC order, which opens up a promising avenue for discovering nickelate superconductors with even higher $T_c$.</description>

      <title>Josephson current through the SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the equilibrium Josephson current through a disordered interacting quantum dot described by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model contacted by two BCS superconductors. We show that, at zero temperature and at the conformal limit, i.e. in the strong interacting limit, the Josephson current is suppressed by $U$, the strength of the interaction, as $\ln(U)/U$ and becomes universal, namely it gets independent on the superconducting pairing. At finite temperature $T$, instead, it depends on the ratio between the gap $\Delta$ and the temperature. A proximity effect exists but the self-energy corrections induced by the coupling with the superconducting leads seem subleading as compared to the self-energy due to the interaction for large number of particles. Finally we compare the results of the original four-fermion model with those obtained considering zero interaction, two-fermions and a generalized q-fermion model.</description>

Abstract: A high-throughput screening using density functional calculations is performed to search for stable boride superconductors from the existing materials database. The workflow employs the fast frozen phonon method as the descriptor to evaluate the superconducting properties quickly. 23 stable candidates are identified from the screening. For almost all found binary compounds, the superconductivity was obtained earlier experimentally or computationally. For ternary borides, previous studies are very limited. Our extensive search among ternary systems confirmed superconductivity in known systems and found several new compounds. Among these discovered superconducting ternary borides, Ta(MoB)$_2$ shows the highest superconducting temperature of ~12K. Most predicted compounds were synthesized previously; therefore, our predictions can be examined experimentally. Our work also demonstrates that the boride systems can have diverse structural motifs that lead to superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Generic reduction theory for Fermi sea topology in metallic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fermi sea in a metal can host exotic quantum topology, which determines its conductance quantization and is characterized by Euler characteristic $\chi_F$. Unlike gapped band topology described by the global feature of wave function, this topology of gapless system is associated with the geometry of Fermi sea, and thus probing and identifying $\chi_F$ are inherently difficult in higher-dimensional systems. Here, we propose a dimensional reduction theory for Fermi sea topology in $d$-dimensional metallic systems, showing that $\chi_F$ can be determined by the feature of so-called reduced critical points on Fermi surfaces, with theoretical simplicity and observational intuitiveness. We also reveal a nontrivial correspondence between the Fermi sea topology and the gapped band topology by using an ingenious mapping, of which $\chi_F$ exactly equals to the topological invariant of gapped topological phases. This provides a potential way to capture $\chi_F$ through the topological superconductors. Our work opens an avenue to characterize and detect the Fermi sea topology using low-dimensional momentum information.</description>
