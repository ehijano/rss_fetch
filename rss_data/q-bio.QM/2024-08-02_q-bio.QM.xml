      <title>Impact of opinion dynamics on recurrent pandemic waves: balancing risk aversion and peer pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent waves which are often observed during long pandemics typically form as a result of several interrelated dynamics including public health interventions, population mobility and behaviour, varying disease transmissibility due to pathogen mutations, and changes in host immunity due to recency of vaccination or previous infections. Complex nonlinear dependencies among these dynamics, including feedback between disease incidence and the opinion-driven adoption of social distancing behaviour, remain poorly understood, particularly in scenarios involving heterogeneous population, partial and waning immunity, and rapidly changing public opinions. This study addressed this challenge by proposing an opinion dynamics model that accounts for changes in social distancing behaviour (i.e., whether to adopt social distancing) by modelling both individual risk perception and peer pressure. The opinion dynamics model was integrated and validated within a large-scale agent-based COVID-19 pandemic simulation that modelled the spread of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 between December 2021 and June 2022 in Australia. Our study revealed that the fluctuating adoption of social distancing, shaped by individual risk aversion and social peer pressure from both household and workplace environments, may explain the observed pattern of recurrent waves of infections.</description>

      <title>Cooperative SIR dynamics as a model for spontaneous blood clot initiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blood clotting is an important physiological process to suppress bleeding upon injury, but when it occurs inadvertently, it can cause thrombosis, which can lead to life threatening conditions. Hence, understanding the microscopic mechanistic factors for inadvertent, spontaneous blood clotting, in absence of a vessel breach, can help in predicting and adverting such conditions. Here, we present a minimal model -- reminiscent of the SIR model -- for the initiating stage of spontaneous blood clotting, the collective activation of blood platelets. This model predicts that in the presence of very small initial activation signals, macroscopic activation of the platelet population requires a sufficient degree of heterogeneity of platelet sensitivity. To propagate the activation signal and achieve collective activation of the bulk platelet population, it requires the presence of, possibly only few, hyper-sensitive platelets, but also a sufficient proportion of platelets with intermediate, yet higher-than-average sensitivity. A comparison with experimental results demonstrates a qualitative agreement for high platelet signalling activity.</description>

      <title>Within-vector viral dynamics challenges how to model the extrinsic incubation period for major arboviruses: dengue, Zika, and chikungunya</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arboviruses represent a significant threat to human, animal, and plant health worldwide. To elucidate transmission, anticipate their spread and efficiently control them, mechanistic modelling has proven its usefulness. However, most models rely on assumptions about how the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) is represented: the intra-vector viral dynamics (IVD), occurring during the EIP, is approximated by a single state. After an average duration, all exposed vectors become infectious. Behind this are hidden two strong hypotheses: (i) EIP is exponentially distributed in the vector population; (ii) viruses successfully cross the infection, dissemination, and transmission barriers in all exposed vectors. To assess these hypotheses, we developed a stochastic compartmental model which represents successive IVD stages, associated to the crossing or not of these three barriers. We calibrated the model using an ABC-SMC (Approximate Bayesian Computation - Sequential Monte Carlo) method with model selection. We systematically searched for literature data on experimental infections of Aedes mosquitoes infected by either dengue, chikungunya, or Zika viruses. We demonstrated the discrepancy between the exponential hypothesis and observed EIP distributions for dengue and Zika viruses and identified more relevant EIP distributions . We also quantified the fraction of infected mosquitoes eventually becoming infectious, highlighting that often only a small fraction crosses the three barriers. This work provides a generic modelling framework applicable to other arboviruses for which similar data are available. Our model can also be coupled to population-scale models to aid future arbovirus control.</description>

      <title>DiffFit: Visually-Guided Differentiable Fitting of Molecule Structures to a Cryo-EM Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02465v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce DiffFit, a differentiable algorithm for fitting protein atomistic structures into an experimental reconstructed Cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) volume map. In structural biology, this process is necessary to semi-automatically composite large mesoscale models of complex protein assemblies and complete cellular structures that are based on measured cryo-EM data. The current approaches require manual fitting in three dimensions to start, resulting in approximately aligned structures followed by an automated fine-tuning of the alignment. The DiffFit approach enables domain scientists to fit new structures automatically and visualize the results for inspection and interactive revision. The fitting begins with differentiable three-dimensional (3D) rigid transformations of the protein atom coordinates followed by sampling the density values at the atom coordinates from the target cryo-EM volume. To ensure a meaningful correlation between the sampled densities and the protein structure, we proposed a novel loss function based on a multi-resolution volume-array approach and the exploitation of the negative space. This loss function serves as a critical metric for assessing the fitting quality, ensuring the fitting accuracy and an improved visualization of the results. We assessed the placement quality of DiffFit with several large, realistic datasets and found it to be superior to that of previous methods. We further evaluated our method in two use cases: automating the integration of known composite structures into larger protein complexes and facilitating the fitting of predicted protein domains into volume densities to aid researchers in identifying unknown proteins. We implemented our algorithm as an open-source plugin (github.com/nanovis/DiffFit) in ChimeraX, a leading visualization software in the field.

      <title>Mitosis, Cytoskeleton Regulation, and Drug Resistance in Receptor Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Methods for personalizing medical treatment are the focal point of contemporary biomedical research. In cancer care, we can analyze the effects of therapies at the level of individual cells. Quantitative characterization of treatment efficacy and evaluation of why some individuals respond to specific regimens, whereas others do not, requires additional approaches to genetic sequencing at single time points. Methods for the continuous analysis of changes in phenotype, such as in vivo and ex vivo morphology and motion tracking of cellular proteins and organelles, over time-frames spanning the minute-hour scales, can provide important insights into patient treatment options.
  Despite improvements in the diagnosis and therapy of many types of breast cancer (BC), many aggressive forms, such as receptor triple-negative cancers, are associated with the worst patient outcomes; though initially effective in reducing tumor burden for some patients, acquired resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy is almost universal, and there is no rationale for identifying intrinsically drug-resistant and drug-sensitive patient populations before initiating therapy. During cell division, the receptor triple-negative MDA-MB-231 mitotic spindles are the largest in comparison to other BC cell lines. Many of the MDA-MB-231 spindles exhibit rapid lateral twisting during metaphase, which remains unaffected by knockdown of the oncogene Myc and treatment with inhibitors of the serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), alone or in any combination.
  In this manuscript, we outline a strategy for the selection of the most optimal tubulin inhibitor based on the ability to affect MT dynamics.</description>

      <title>Structure to Property: Chemical Element Embeddings and a Deep Learning Approach for Accurate Prediction of Chemical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the elEmBERT model for chemical classification tasks. It is based on deep learning techniques, such as a multilayer encoder architecture. We demonstrate the opportunities offered by our approach on sets of organic, inorganic and crystalline compounds. In particular, we developed and tested the model using the Matbench and Moleculenet benchmarks, which include crystal properties and drug design-related benchmarks. We also conduct an analysis of vector representations of chemical compounds, shedding light on the underlying patterns in structural data. Our model exhibits exceptional predictive capabilities and proves universally applicable to molecular and material datasets. For instance, on the Tox21 dataset, we achieved an average precision of 96%, surpassing the previously best result by 10%.</description>
