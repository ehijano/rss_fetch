      <title>Minimizing Selection Bias in Inclusive Jets in Heavy-Ion Collisions with Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first-ever measurement of energy correlators within inclusive jets produced in heavy-ion collisions, revealed by the CMS Collaboration, shows a clear enhancement at large angles relative to the proton-proton (p-p) baseline. However, interpreting this enhancement is complicated due to selection bias from energy loss, which also distorts the energy correlator heavy-ion to p-p ratio in the hadronization region, hindering our understanding of parton/hadron dynamics in a colored medium. In this Letter, we introduce a new ratio of energy correlator observables that removes the leading effects of selection bias from the two-point energy correlator spectrum (E2C). Pythia and Herwig simulations show that the impact of selection bias in the E2C is reduced by an order of magnitude, while sensitivity to any other medium modifications is retained. This quantity can be obtained directly from the experimental measurements presented by CMS, as illustrated in the accompanying note.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Ionization in the Central Molecular Zone by sub-GeV Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the anomalous ionization rate observed in the Central Molecular Zone can be attributed to MeV dark matter annihilations into $e^+e^-$ pairs for galactic dark matter profiles with slopes $\gamma&gt;1$. The low annihilation cross-sections required avoid cosmological constraints and imply no detectable inverse Compton, bremsstrahlung or synchrotron emissions in radio, X and gamma rays. The possible connection to the source of the unexplained 511 keV line emission in the Galactic Center suggests that both observations could be correlated and have a common origin.</description>

      <title>Grand Unification at the Cosmological Collider with Chemical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a tree-level chemical potential mechanism for spin-1 particles within cosmological collider physics, allowing them to be detected in primordial non-Gaussianities for masses above the inflationary Hubble scale. We apply this mechanism to orbifold grand unification and the massive unification partners of the standard model gauge bosons. Our mechanism requires at least a pair of massive vector fields which are singlets of the standard model, a condition which is satisfied in the classic "trinification" scenario. Assuming that the gauge hierarchy problem is solved by supersymmetry, gauge coupling running points to unification partners at ~ $10^{15}$ GeV. We show that, within high-scale inflation, chemical potential enhancement can lead to observably strong signals for trinification partners in future cosmological surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note serves as a companion to a Letter, where we introduce a new energy correlator-based observable designed to minimize the impact of selection bias due to energy loss in inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions.

      <description>arXiv:2409.07572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss recent higher order calculations to properties of $B$ mesons. This includes next-to-next-to-leading order corrections to nonleptonic and next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order corrections to semileptonic $B$ meson decays. The latter is important in connection to the determination of the CKM matrix element $V_{cb}$. We also discuss next-to-next-to-leading order corrections to the width difference in the neutral $B$ meson system.</description>

      <title>Towards NNLO QCD corrections to Higgs boson pair production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higgs boson pair production plays an important role in the determination of the Higgs boson self coupling. The predictions based on next-to-leading order corrections show a large dependence on the renormalization scheme of the top quark mass, which requires a next-to-next-to-leading order calculation. We discuss the current status and show first results of the three-loop virtual corrections.</description>

      <title>Optimal collision energy for realizing macroscopic high baryon-density matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the volume and lifetime of the high baryon-density matter created in heavy-ion collisions and estimate the optimal collision energy to realize the high baryon-density region over a large spacetime volume. We simulate central collisions of gold ions for the center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.4 - 19.6\;{\rm GeV}$ with a microscopic transport model JAM. We discover that the optimal collision energy is around $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3 - 4\;{\rm GeV}$, where a baryon density exceeding three times the normal nuclear density is realized with a substantially large spacetime volume. Higher and lower energies are disfavored due to short lifetime and low density, respectively. We also point out that event-by-event fluctuations of the spacetime density profile are large, indicating the importance of the event selection in the experimental analysis.</description>

      <title>Charged Higgs Boson Phenomenology in the Dark Z mediated Fermionic Dark Matter Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenology of the charged Higgs boson, $H^\pm$,appearing in the fermionic dark matter model mediated by the dark $Z$ boson. This model is in favor of the light dark $Z$ boson, $Z'$, and the light additional neutral Higgs boson, $h$. We find that $H^\pm \to W^\pm h$ and the $H^\pm \to W^\pm Z'$ are dominant decay channels. Thus the promising final states are trilepton signals, $e \mu \mu$ or $\mu \mu \mu$ following $Z' \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays and leptonic decays of the $W^\pm$ boson. The charged Higgs boson will be produced from the top quark decays $t \to b H^\pm$ following $t \bar{t}$ production, if $H^\pm$ is light. Whereas $H^\pm$ is heavier than the top quark, the dominant production processes are associated productions with either $Z'$ or $h$, $pp \to W^\star \to H^\pm h$ and $pp \to W^\star \to H^\pm Z'$. We explore the discovery potential of the charged Higgs boson at the LHC. We also discuss the implications of dark matter in relation with the charged Higgs phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Direct Detection of Higgsino Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While much supersymmetric WIMP parameter space has been ruled out, one remaining important candidate is Higgsino dark matter. The Higgsino can naturally realize the ``inelastic dark matter" scenario, where the scattering off a nucleus occurs between two nearly-degenerate states, making it invisible to WIMP direct detection experiments if the splitting is too large to be excited. It was realized that a ``luminous dark matter" detection process, where the Higgsino upscatters in the Earth and subsequently decays into a photon in a large neutrino detector, offers the best sensitivity to such a scenario. We consider the possibility of adding a large volume of a heavy element, such as Pb or U, around the detector. We also consider the presence of U and Th in the Earth itself, and the effect of an enhanced high-velocity tail of the dark matter distribution due to the presence of the Large Magellanic Cloud. These effects can significantly improve the sensitivity of detectors such as JUNO, SNO+, and Borexino, potentially making it possible in the future to cover much of the remaining parameter space for this classic SUSY WIMP dark matter.</description>

      <title>Masses of higher excited states of $\Xi_{c}'$ and $\Omega_{c}$ baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant efforts have been made in recent years to measure the properties of charmed baryons. In this work, we study the $\Xi_{c}'$ and $\Omega_{c}$ baryons in the relativistic flux tube model with a quark-diquark picture of a baryon. The modified Regge relation between mass and angular momentum is used to predict the spin-average masses. The spin-dependent interactions are also included to compute the spin-dependent splitting. We calculate the masses of states belonging to the $1F$-wave and $1G$-wave of $\Xi_{c}'$ and $\Omega_{c}$ baryons, which are not yet detected experimentally. Our mass predictions can offer valuable insights to experimental facilities in their search to discover the higher excited states of $\Xi_{c}'$ and $\Omega_{c}$ baryons.</description>

      <title>Multi-component dark matter and Galactic 511 keV $\gamma$-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multi-component dark matter scenarios and the Galactic 511 keV $\gamma$-ray emission line signal in the framework of a local, dark $U(1)_D$ extension of the Standard Model. A light vector dark matter particle associated with the dark $U(1)_D$ may decay and annihilate to electron-positron pairs. The produced positrons may in turn form positroniums that subsequently annihilate to two photons, accounting for the observed line signal of the Galactic 511 keV $\gamma$-ray emission. Three scenarios are investigated. First, we consider the minimal $U(1)_D$ extension where a dark gauge boson and a dark Higgs boson are newly introduced to the particle content. As a second scenario, we consider WIMP-type dark matter with the introduction of an extra dark fermion which, in addition to the dark gauge boson, may contribute to the dark matter relic abundance. It is thus a multi-component dark matter scenario with a UV-complete dark $U(1)_D$ symmetry. In particular, the vector dark matter may account for a small fraction of the total dark matter relic abundance. Finally, we consider the scenario where the dark matter particles are of the FIMP-type. In this case, both the light vector and fermion dark matter particles may be produced via the freeze-in and super-WIMP mechanisms. Considering theoretical and observational constraints, we explore the allowed parameter space where the Galactic 511 keV $\gamma$-ray line signal and the dark matter relic can both be explained. We also discuss possible observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of top quarks in pair and single top quark production within the non-commutative standard model at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of top quark phenomenology within the Non-Commutative Standard Model. We calculate non-commutative corrections to the squared amplitudes for top quark pair production, as well as for single top quark production via the $t$-channel and $tW$-channel, while noting that the $s$-channel remains unaffected by non-commutative geometry. Utilizing MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, we determine total cross-sections at various center-of-mass energies and examine differential distributions in transverse momentum and rapidity at leading order in both the strong coupling $\alpha_S$ and the non-commutative parameter $\Theta$. For single top production in the $t$-channel, a matching technique is employed to extend the validity of the distribution to low $p_t^{top}$ values through resummation. We also compare the non-commutative corrections with higher-order QCD corrections obtained at NLO using MCFM and at NNLO from existing literature. Our findings reveal significant deviations arising from non-commutative geometry at high energies, providing insights into potential new physics at energy scales accessible by current and future colliders.</description>

      <title>Mass hierarchies in gauge theory with two index symmetric representation matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In gauge theories, the running of the anomalous dimension of a fermion bilinear operator is believed to lead to chiral symmetry breaking when gamma=1. Naively using perturbative results to judge when gamma=1 leads to the possibility of large dynamically generated mass hierarchies in models with both two index symmetric representation and fundamental representation fermions. In this paper we study a holographic model of this physics to predict the separation in scales in the meson spectrum. We study SU(Nc) theories at different Nc with one flavour of two index symmetric representation as a function of the number of fundamental fermion flavours NfF. The largest hierarchy we find is for Nc=7 and NfF=22 where the rho mesons made of the two different representations are separated in scale by a factor of 13. For general Nc the hierarchy can be made greater than 7 by tuning NfF. We display the hierarchy as a function of NfF and investigate the quark mass dependence. These predictions do depend on the extrapolation of gamma from the perturbative regime - even in a pessimistic scenario a distinct gap can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Unified study of nucleon and $\Delta$ baryon spectra and their strong decays with chiral dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we systematically study both the mass spectra and strong decays of the nucleon and $\Delta$ resonances up to the $N=2$ shell within a unified quark model framework with chiral dynamics. In this framework we achieve a good description of the strong decay properties of the well-established nucleon and $\Delta$ resonances. Meanwhile, the mass reversal between $N(1440)1/2^{+}$ as the first radial excitation state and the $1P$-wave nucleon resonances can be explained. We show that the three-body spin-orbit potential arising from the one-gluon exchange can cause a large configuration mixing between $N(1520)3/2^-$ and $N(1700)3/2^-$, and is also responsible for the large splitting between $\Delta(1600)1/2^-$ and $\Delta(1700)1/2^-$. Some of these baryon resonances turn to weakly couple to the $N\pi$, $N\eta$, $K\Lambda$, and $K\Sigma$ channels, which may answer the question why they have not been established in these channels via the $\pi N$ and $\gamma N$ scatterings. It shows that these ``missing resonances" may have large potentials to be established in the $N\pi\pi$ final state due to their large decay rates into either the $\Delta(1232)$ or $1P$-wave nucleon resonances via the pionic decays. Further experimental search for their signals in charmonium decays at BESIII is thus strongly recommended.</description>

      <title>Exotic Hidden-heavy Hadrons and Where to Find Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Born-Oppenheimer potentials for QCD with light quarks include adjoint-hadron potentials that are repulsive at short distances and heavy-hadron-pair potentials that approach thresholds at large distances. The adjoint-hadron potentials must connect smoothly to the heavy-hadron-pair potentials at intermediate distances. We identify exotic hidden-heavy hadrons as bound states and resonances in adjoint-hadron potentials that cross a heavy-hadron-pair threshold and then approach it from below. This explains why many exotic hidden-charm and hidden-bottom hadrons have energies near heavy-hadron-pair thresholds. The remarkable properties of some exotic hidden-heavy mesons can be explained by fine tunings of adjoint-meson energies in QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically study the 1D charmonium spin-triplet (with the $J^{PC}=1^{--}, 2^{--}, 3^{--}$) and spin-singlet (with the $J^{PC}=2^{-+}$) via the QCD sum rules in comparison with the present experimental results. More experimental data on the D-wave charmonium states will help us to unravel the mass spectrum of the charmonium states near the open-charm thresholds.</description>

      <title>A Procedure g5anchor to Anchor $\gamma_5$ in Feynman Diagrams for the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a procedure g5anchor to anchor $\gamma_5$ in the definition of a Dirac trace with $\gamma_5$ in Dimensional Regularization (DR) in Feynman diagrams for the Standard Model, based on a recent revision of the works by Kreimer, Gottlieb and Donohue. For each closed fermion chain with an odd number of primitive (i.e.~not-yet-clearly-defined) $\gamma_5$ in a given Feynman diagram, g5anchor returns a definite set of anchor points for $\gamma_5$, in terms of pairs of ordered fermion propagators; at each of these $\gamma_5$ anchor points a fixed expression in terms of the Levi-Civita tensor and elementary Dirac matrices will be inserted together with a sign determined by anticommutatively shifting all $\gamma_5$ from their original places (dictated by the Feynman rules) to this anchor point. The defining expressions for the cyclic $\gamma_5$-odd Dirac traces in DR associated with closed fermion chains in amplitudes, or more generally squared amplitudes, thus follow from this procedure, where the Levi-Civita tensors are not necessarily treated strictly in 4-dimensions. We propose utilizing this definition in practical perturbative calculations in the Standard Model at least to three-loop orders with the current implementation, and maybe to higher loop orders in absence of Yukawa couplings to Higgs fields. Certain limitations and modifications of the KKS and/or the Kreimer scheme are addressed.</description>

      <title>First Extraction of Transverse Momentum Dependent Helicity Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the first global analysis of transverse momentum dependent helicity distributions of the proton. The analysis is performed at next-to-leading order with the evolution factor at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy. Nonzero signals are determined for up and down quarks and their $k_T$-integrated polarization are consistent with analyses in collinear factorization, while the distributions of other flavors are loosely constrained by existing data. With increasing transverse momentum, quarks at large $x$ become less polarized while those at small $x$ become more polarized.</description>

      <title>Can millicharge be probed at future Super Tau Charm Facility via mono-$\pi^0$ searches?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new channel to search for millicharged particles at the future Super Tau Charm Facility (STCF) via mono-$\pi^0$ signature. For the first time, we compute the mono-$\pi^0$ signal events at the future STCF due to millicharged particle production, as well as due to standard model irreducible/reducible backgrounds. By utilizing the assumed 20 ab$^{-1}$ luminosity for each running energy with $\sqrt{s}= 2$ GeV, 4 GeV and 7 GeV, we derive the corresponding upper limits on millicharge, respectively. Via mono-$\pi^0$ searches at the future STCF with $\sqrt{s}=2$ GeV, the upper limits on millicharge can be improved than ArgoNeuT when the mass of millicharged particle is less than about 500 MeV, but are not very competitive compared to a latest derivation from a past BEBC experiment and a new SENSEI experiment. Regardless, the mono-$\pi^0$ searches could be an important complement to investigate the invisible particles, such as dark matter.</description>

Abstract: We present the two-loop helicity amplitudes contributing to the next-to-next-to-leading order QCD predictions for W-boson production in association with two photons at the Large Hadron Collider. We derived compact analytic expressions for the two-loop amplitudes in the leading colour limit, and provide numerical results for the subleading colour contributions. We employ a compact system of integration-by-part identities provided by the NeatIBP package, allowing for an efficient computation of the rational coefficients of the scattering amplitudes over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Insights from Binary Pulsars and Laboratories into Baryon Number Violation: Implications for GeV Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare processes in laboratory and within astrophysical environments can be highly sensitive probes of baryon-number violating interactions at the TeV scale. We demonstrate the power of neutron stars to constrain baryon number violation by considering a minimal extension of the standard model involving a TeV-mass scalar mediator and a GeV scale Majorana fermion $\psi$. We find that a $\Delta B = 2$ mass-loss process in binary pulsar systems via $n \to \gamma \psi$ and the subsequent scattering $\psi n \to \pi^- K^+$ places stringent constraints on the model parameter space. These limits will become much stronger, due to the possibility of $\Lambda \rightarrow \gamma \psi$ decays at the tree level, if the neutron star equation of state is hyperonic. We compare these constraints with ongoing and future collider experiments, $n-\bar{n}$ oscillations, and dinucleon decay searches at future large-scale neutrino experiments, finding that the binary pulsars bounds on couplings are significantly tighter for specific flavor combinations.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Curvaton Post-Planck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expected improvements in the precision of inflationary physics observables including the scalar spectral index $n_{s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ will reveal more than just the viability of a particular model of inflation. In the presence of a curvaton field $\chi$, supposedly dead models of inflation can be resurrected as these observables are affected by curvaton perturbations. For currently successful models, improved constraints will enable us to constrain the properties of extra decaying scalar degrees of freedom produced during inflation. In this work, we demonstrate these diverse uses of a curvaton field with the most recent constraints on ($n_{s},r$) and two exemplary inflation models, the Starobinsky model, and a model of new inflation. Our analysis invokes three free parameters: the curvaton mass $m_{\chi}$, its decay rate $\Gamma_{\chi}$ the reheating temperature $T_{\rm RH}$ produced by inflaton decays. We systematically analyze possible post-inflationary era scenarios of a curvaton field. By projecting the most recent CMB data on ($n_{s},r$) into this parameter space, we can either set constraints on the curvaton parameters from successful models of inflation (so that the success is not spoiled) or determine the parameters which are able to save a model for which $n_{s}$ is predicted to be below the experimental data. We emphasize that the initial value of $\langle \chi^2 \rangle \propto H^4/m_\chi^2$ produced during inflation is determined from a stochastic approach and thus not a free parameter in our analysis. We also investigate the production of local non-Gaussianity $f_{NL}^{(\rm loc)}$ and apply current CMB constraints to the parameter space. Intriguingly, we find that a large value of $f_{NL}^{(\rm loc)}$ of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ can be produced for both of the two representative inflation models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting primordial neutrino asymmetries, spectral distortions and cosmological constraints with full neutrino transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primordial neutrino asymmetry leave profound imprints on the evolution history of the universe, which can be constrained by cosmological observations, including Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and Large-Scale Structure (LSS). We present comprehensive analysis on implications and constraints of the primordial neutrino asymmetry $\xi_\nu$, based on a precise treatment of neutrino decoupling by solving the complete (anti)neutrino quantum kinetic equations in the Closed-Time-Path formalism. The effective number of neutrinos $ N_{\rm eff}$ and (anti)neutrino spectral distortions are calculated, and we find that the non-instantaneous decoupling correction is given by $\delta N_{\rm eff} = 0.0440 + 0.0102 \, \xi_\nu^2$. Then we perform the state-of-the-art calculation for the abundance of light elements including (anti)neutrino spectral distortions, which indicate a positive asymmetry $0.032 \leq \xi_\nu \leq 0.052$ from EMPRESS data. The implications of the neutrino asymmetry for the CMB and LSS are studied in detail, and we find that the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) are also significantly affected by $\xi_\nu$ in addition to the sum of neutrino masses. A combined analysis with EMPRESS BBN, Planck CMB and BOSS BAO data yields a tighter constraint $\xi_\nu = 0.024 \pm 0.013$, which provides constraints on UV models capable of producing large asymmetries.</description>

      <title>How new physics affects primordial neutrinos decoupling: Direct Simulation Monte Carlo approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological observations from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) offer crucial insights into the Early Universe, enabling us to trace its evolution back to lifetimes as short as 0.01 seconds. Upcoming CMB spectrum measurements, such as those underway at the Simons Observatory, will achieve unprecedented precision, allowing for more accurate extraction of information about the properties of the primordial plasma and, in particular, primordial neutrinos. This provides an opportunity to test whether these properties align with the predictions of the standard cosmological model or indicate the presence of new physics that influenced the evolution of the MeV-temperature plasma. A key component in understanding how new physics may have affected primordial neutrinos is solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation. In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving this equation that offers model independence, transparency, and computational efficiency - features that current state-of-the-art methods lack. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept implementation and apply it to several toy scenarios, showcasing key aspects of the primordial plasma's evolution in the presence of new physics.</description>

      <title>Cutting rule for in-in correlators and cosmological collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a cutting rule for equal-time in-in correlators including cosmological correlators based on Keldysh $r/a$ basis, which decomposes diagrams into fully retarded functions and cut-propagators consisting of Wightman functions. Our derivation relies only on basic assumptions such as unitarity, locality, and the causal structure of the in-in formalism, and therefore holds for theories with arbitrary particle contents and local interactions at any loop order. As an application, we show that non-local cosmological collider signals arise solely from cut-propagators under the assumption of microcausality. Since the cut-propagators do not contain (anti-)time-ordering theta functions, the conformal time integrals are factorized, simplifying practical calculations.</description>

      <title>Dyonic bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study (multi) fermion - monopole bound states, many of which are the states that dyons adiabatically transition into as fermions become light. The properties of these bound states depend critically on the UV symmetries preserved by the fermion mass terms, their relative size, and the value of $\theta$. Depending on the relative size of the mass terms and the value of $\theta$, the bound states can undergo phase transitions as well as transition from being stable to unstable. In some simple situations, the bound state solution can be related to the Witten effect of another theory with fewer fermions and larger gauge coupling. These bound states are a result of mass terms and symmetry breaking boundary conditions at the monopole core and, consequently, these bound states do not necessarily have definite quantum numbers under accidental IR symmetries. Additionally, they have binding energies that are $\mathcal{O}(1)$ times the fermion mass and bound state radii of order their inverse mass. As the massless limit is approached, the bound state radii approach infinity, and they become new asymptotic states with odd quantum numbers giving a dynamical understanding to the origin of semitons.</description>

Abstract: Within the framework of symmetric teleparallel $f\left( Q\right) $-gravity for a connection defined in the non-coincidence gauge we derive the Wheeler-DeWitt equation of quantum cosmology. Because the gravitational field equation in $f\left( Q\right) $-gravity admits a minisuperspace description the Wheeler-DeWitt equation is a single inhomogeneous partial differential equations. We assume the power-law $f\left( Q\right) =f_{0}Q^{\mu}$ model and with the application of linear quantum observables we calculate the wavefunction of the universe. Finally, we investigate the effects of the quantum correction terms in the semi-classical limit.</description>

Abstract: We examine the framework of relativistic spin-hydrodynamics in the context of electron hydrodynamics in graphene. We develop a spin-hydrodynamic model for a (2 + 1)-dimensional system of fermions under the condition of small spin polarization. Our analysis confirms that thermal vorticity, which satisfies the global equilibrium condition, is also a solution to the spin-hydrodynamic equations. Additionally, we calculate the magnetization of the system in global equilibrium and introduce a novel phenomenon - thermovortical magnetization - resulting from thermal vorticity, which can be experimentally observed in graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As one of the predictions of perturbative QCD, the effect of color transparency has been the focus of attention in the community studying modifications of hadrons in nuclear medium for several decades. The search for this effect in reactions involving heavy nuclei can be complicated by uncertainties in nuclear characteristics (nucleon density distributions and wave functions), which can affect the interpretation of experiments. In this work, we consider the reaction $d(p,pp)n$ at $p_{\rm lab}=15$ GeV/c caused by hard elastic $pp$ scattering, in which these uncertainties are actually reduced to the behavior of the deuteron wave function at large momenta. It is shown that for transverse momenta of the spectator neutron $\leq 0.4$ GeV/c the choice of the deuteron wave function cannot affect the identification of the color transparency effect. A simple method for studying color transparency in $dd$ collisions is also suggested based on the identification of quasi-free $pd$ interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-energy and vacuum polarization effects in quantum electrodynamics (QED) are calculated for the supercritical Coulomb field, where Dirac energy levels become embedded in the negative-energy continuum. In this regime, the quantum vacuum becomes unstable, resulting in spontaneous electron-positron pair creation. By calculating the imaginary part of the QED correction, we gain access to an unexplored channel of vacuum instability: radiative spontaneous pair creation. Our results show that this radiative channel is greatly enhanced in the vicinity of the threshold of the supercritical regime, providing evidence for nonperturbative effects with respect to the fine-structure constant $\alpha$. We therefore conjecture that the total probability of spontaneous pair creation could differ significantly from the predictions of Dirac theory, especially near the supercritical threshold.</description>

Abstract: We use Bayesian statistics to infer the breakdown scale of pionless effective field theory in its standard power counting and with renormalization of observables carried out using the power-divergence subtraction scheme and cutoff regularization. We condition our inference on predictions of the total neutron-proton scattering cross section up next-to-next-to leading order. We quantify a median breakdown scale of approximately 1.4$m_\pi$. The 68% degree of belief interval is $[0.96,1.69]m_\pi$. This result confirms the canonical expectation that the pion mass is a relevant scale in low-energy nuclear physics.</description>

Abstract: We present a calculation of the $C$-odd radiative corrections to $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-$ in a dispersive formalism, concentrating on the leading pion-pole contribution in the virtual box diagrams. In particular, we show how the effect of a general pion vector form factor in the loop integral can be incorporated in a model-independent way and how the cancellation of infrared singularities proceeds in this case. The numerical results, dominated by the infrared enhanced contributions, indicate significant corrections beyond scalar QED, essentially confirming recent findings in generalized vector-meson-dominance models.</description>

      <title>Hierarchies from Landscape Probability Gradients and Critical Boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If the gradient of a probability distribution on a landscape of vacua aligns with the variation of some fundamental parameter, the parameter may be likely to take some non-generic value. Such non-generic values can be associated to critical boundaries, where qualitative changes of the landscape properties happen, or an anthropic bound is located. Assuming the standard volume-weighted and the local probability measures, we discuss ordered landscapes which can produce several types of the aligned probability gradients. The resulting values of the gradients are defined by the "closeness" of a given vacuum to the highest- or the lowest-energy vacuum. Using these ingredients we construct a landscape scanning independently the Higgs mass and the cosmological constant (CC). The probability gradient pushes the Higgs mass to its observed value, where a structural change of the landscape takes place, while the CC is chosen anthropically.</description>

Abstract: Particle decays do not constitute a spin ``measurement'' in the quantum-mechanical sense, but still modify the spin state, in particular for an entangled system. We show that for a spin-entangled pair of particles the entanglement of the system can increase after the decay of one particle. This unique phenomenon has no equivalent for stable particles and could be observable in top pair production at a high-energy polarized $e^+ e^-$ collider.</description>

      <title>Inferring flavor mixtures in multijet events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multijet events with heavy-flavors are of central importance at the LHC since many relevant processes -- such as $t\bar t$, $hh$, $t\bar t h$ and others -- have a preferred branching ratio for this final state. Current techniques for tackling these processes use hard-assignment selections through $b$-tagging working points, and suffer from systematic uncertainties because of the difficulties in Monte Carlo simulations. We develop a flexible Bayesian mixture model approach to simultaneously infer $b$-tagging score distributions and the flavor mixture composition in the dataset. We model multidimensional jet events, and to enhance estimation efficiency, we design structured priors that leverages the continuity and unimodality of the $b$-tagging score distributions. Remarkably, our method eliminates the need for a parametric assumption and is robust against model misspecification -- It works for arbitrarily flexible continuous curves and is better if they are unimodal. We have run a toy inferential process with signal $bbbb$ and backgrounds $bbcc$ and $cccc$, and we find that with a few hundred events we can recover the true mixture fractions of the signal and backgrounds, as well as the true $b$-tagging score distribution curves, despite their arbitrariness and nonparametric shapes. We discuss prospects for taking these findings into a realistic scenario in a physics analysis. The presented results could be a starting point for a different and novel kind of analysis in multijet events, with a scope competitive with current state-of-the-art analyses. We also discuss the possibility of using these results in general cases of signals and backgrounds with approximately known continuous distributions and/or expected unimodality.</description>

      <title>Foundations of automatic feature extraction at LHC--point clouds and graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning algorithms will play a key role in the upcoming runs of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), helping bolster various fronts ranging from fast and accurate detector simulations to physics analysis probing possible deviations from the Standard Model. The game-changing feature of these new algorithms is the ability to extract relevant information from high-dimensional input spaces, often regarded as "replacing the expert" in designing physics-intuitive variables. While this may seem true at first glance, it is far from reality. Existing research shows that physics-inspired feature extractors have many advantages beyond improving the qualitative understanding of the extracted features. In this review, we systematically explore automatic feature extraction from a phenomenological viewpoint and the motivation for physics-inspired architectures. We also discuss how prior knowledge from physics results in the naturalness of the point cloud representation and discuss graph-based applications to LHC phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field effect on hadron yield ratios and fluctuations in hadron resonance gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the influence of an external magnetic field on hadron yields and fluctuations in a hadron resonance gas by performing calculations within an updated version of the open-source Thermal-FIST package. The presence of the magnetic field has a sizable influence on certain hadron yield ratios. Most notably, it leads to enhanced $p/\pi$ and suppressed $n/p$ ratios, which may serve as a magnetometer in heavy-ion collisions. By attributing the centrality dependence of the $p/\pi$ ratio in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02~TeV measured by the ALICE Collaboration entirely to the magnetic field, its maximal strength at freeze-out is estimated to be $eB \simeq 0.12$~GeV$^2 \simeq 6.3 m_\pi^2$ in peripheral collisions. The magnetic field also enhances various conserved charge susceptibilities, which is qualitatively consistent with recent lattice QCD data and is driven in the HRG model by the increase of hadron densities. However, the variances of hadrons do not show any enhancement when normalized by the means, therefore, measurements of second-order fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions appear to offer limited additional information about the magnetic field relative to mean multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Helicity-changing Decays of Cosmological Relic Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the possibility that massive neutrinos are unstable due to their invisible decays $\nu^{}_i \to \nu^{}_j + \phi$, where $\nu^{}_i$ and $\nu^{}_j$ (for $i, j = 1, 2, 3$) are any two of neutrino mass eigenstates with masses $m^{}_i &gt; m^{}_j$ and $\phi$ is a massless Nambu-Goldstone boson, and explore the implications for the detection of cosmological relic neutrinos in the present Universe. First, we carry out a complete calculation of neutrino decay rates in the general case where the individual helicities of parent and daughter neutrinos are specified. Then, the invisible decays of cosmological relic neutrinos are studied and their impact on the capture rates on the beta-decaying nuclei (e.g., $\nu^{}_e + {^3{\rm H}} \to {^3{\rm He}} + e^-$) is analyzed. The invisible decays of massive neutrinos could substantially change the capture rates in the PTOLEMY-like experiments when compared to the case of stable neutrinos. In particular, we find that the helicity-changing decays of Dirac neutrinos play an important role whereas those of Majorana neutrinos have no practical effects. However, if a substantial fraction of heavier neutrinos decay into the lightest one, the detection of relic neutrinos will require a much higher energy resolution and thus be even more challenging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the potential to search for semi-visible jets (SVJs) at the LHC using initial-state radiation (ISR). Both photon ISR and jet ISR channels are considered, using a benchmark signal model with the decay of a leptophobic $Z^\prime$ mediator forming two SVJs. We compare and extend several techniques to decompose the missing transverse momentum into per-jet contributions, in order to reconstruct the mediator mass and to define a new observable measuring the fraction of invisible dark hadrons. The presence of ISR facilitates the identification of the SVJs, and the resulting boost improves the resolution of the observables, especially for models with high invisible fractions. We combine the two observables to propose a complete search strategy and discuss an extension of the strategy to probe the whole model parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The femtoscopic $\phi N$ correlation function is studied within a hadronic effective Lagrangian approach with coupled channels, based on hidden local symmetry. The results are compared with the data recently reported by the ALICE collaboration. We find that the correlation function has very different features for the $\phi N$ system in the spin 1/2 and 3/2 configurations, with the spin-averaged combination matching well with the experimental data. A strong attraction, leading to the formation of a $\phi N$ bound state or a very prominent cusp is found in the spin 3/2 case. The correlation function for spin 1/2, on the other hand, is strongly impacted by the negative parity $N^*(1895)$ nucleon resonance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.00022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos play a critical role of transporting energy and changing the lepton density within core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. The quantum kinetic equations (QKEs) combine the effects of neutrino-matter interactions treated in classical Boltzmann transport with the neutrino flavor-changing effects treated in neutrino oscillation calculations. We present a method for extending existing neutrino interaction rates to full QKE source terms for use in numerical calculations. We demonstrate the effects of absorption and emission by nucleons and nuclei, electron scattering, electron-positron pair annihilation, nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung, neutrino-neutrino scattering. For the first time, we include all these collision terms self-consistently in a simulation of the full isotropic QKEs in conditions relevant to core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. For our choice of parameters, the long-term evolution of the neutrino distribution function proceeds similarly with and without the oscillation term, though with measurable differences. We demonstrate that electron scattering, nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung processes, and four-neutrino processes dominate flavor decoherence in the protoneutron star (PNS), absorption dominates near the shock, and all of the considered processes except elastic nucleon scattering are relevant in the decoupling region. Finally, we propose an effective decoherence opacity that at most energies predicts decoherence rates to within a factor of 10 in our model PNS and within 20% outside of the PNS.</description>

      <title>Tightening the reins on non-minimal dark sector physics: Interacting Dark Energy with dynamical and non-dynamical equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive reassessment of the state of Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) cosmology, namely models featuring a non-gravitational interaction between Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE). To achieve high generality, we extend the dark sector physics by considering two different scenarios: a non-dynamical DE equation of state $w_0\neq-1$, and a dynamical $w(a)=w_0+w_a(1-a)$. In both cases, we distinguish two different physical regimes resulting from a phantom or quintessence equation of state. To circumvent early-time superhorizon instabilities, the energy-momentum transfer should occur in opposing directions within the two regimes, resulting in distinct phenomenological outcomes. We study quintessence and phantom non-dynamical and dynamical models in light of two independent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments - the Planck satellite and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. We analyze CMB data both independently and in combination with Supernovae (SN) distance moduli measurements from the Pantheon-Plus catalog and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the SDSS-IV eBOSS survey. Our results update and extend the state-of-the-art analyses, significantly narrowing the parameter space allowed for these models and limiting their overall ability to reconcile cosmological tensions. Although considering different combinations of data leaves some freedom to increase $H_0$ towards the value measured by the SH0ES collaboration, our most constraining dataset (CMB+BAO+SN) indicates that fully reconciling the tension solely within the framework of IDE remains challenging.</description>

      <title>Phantom matter: a challenging solution to the cosmological tensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea of composite dark energy (DE) is quite natural since on general grounds we expect that the vacuum energy density (associated with the cosmological term $\Lambda$) may appear in combination with other effective forms of DE, denoted X. Here we deal with model $w$XCDM, a simplified version of the old $\Lambda$XCDM model (Grande et al., 2006), and exploit the possibility that X behaves as `phantom matter' (PM), which appears in stringy versions of the running vacuum model (RVM). Unlike phantom DE, the PM fluid satisfies the strong energy condition like usual matter, hence bringing to bear positive pressure at the expense of negative energy. Bubbles of PM may appear in the manner of a transitory `phantom vacuum' tunneled into the late universe before it heads towards a new de Sitter era, thereby offering a crop field for the growing of structures earlier than expected. Using SNIa, cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO (BAO 2D), LSS data and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that the $H_0$ and growth tensions virtually disappear, provided that BAO 2D are the only source of BAO data used in the fit. In contrast, our preliminary analysis using exclusively anisotropic BAO (BAO 3D) indicates that the ability to ease the $H_0$ tension is significantly reduced as compared to the scenario with BAO 2D, despite the fact that the overall fit to the cosmological data is still better than in the $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, our approach with BAO 2D favors quintessence-like behavior of the DE below $z\simeq 1.5$ at $\gtrsim 3\sigma$ CL, which is compatible with the recent DESI measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct explicit models of classical primordial standard clocks in an alternative to inflation, namely the slowly contracting ekpyrotic scenario. We study the phenomenology of massive spectator fields added to a state-of-the-art ekpyrotic model, with coupling functions that allow for these heavy fields to be classically excited while the background is slowly contracting. We perform numerical computations of the corrections to the scalar primordial power spectrum and compare with analytical estimates. Our full numerical results reveal so-called clock signals, sharp feature signals, as well as signals that link the two together. The models are found to predict oscillatory features that are resolutely different from what is calculated in inflation, and thus, such features represent unique fingerprints of a slowly contracting universe. This confirms the capability of primordial standard clocks to model-independently discriminate among very early universe scenarios.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we develop a semi-standard Young tableau (SSYT) approach to construct a basis of non-factorizable superamplitudes in N = 1 massless supersymmetry. This amplitude basis can be directly translated to a basis for higher dimensional supersymmetric operators, yielding both the number of independent operators and their form. We deal with distinguishable (massless) chiral/vector superfields at first, then generalize the result to the indistinguishable case. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this method compared to the previously studied Hilbert series approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy photons of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) might be emitted at different intrinsic times with energy dependence at the source. In this letter, we expand the model from previous works on testing the Lorentz Invariance Violation (LV) with the observed GRB data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We reanalyze the previous data with the full Bayesian parameter estimation method and get consistent results by assuming that the time delays are due to an LV term and a constant intrinsic time delay term. Subsequently, we neglect the LV effect and only consider the intrinsic time delay effect. We assume a common intrinsic time delay term along with a source energy correlated time delay of high-energy photons. We find that the energy-dependent emission times can also explain the observed GRB data of high-energy photon events. Finally, we integrate these two physical mechanisms into a unified model to distinguish and evaluate their respective contributions using the observed GRB data.</description>
