      <title>Rhythm Generation, Robustness, and Control in Stick Insect Locomotion: Modeling and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stick insect stepping patterns have been studied for insights about locomotor rhythm generation and control, because the underlying neural system is relatively accessible experimentally and produces a variety of rhythmic outputs. Harnessing the experimental identification of effective interactions among neuronal units involved in stick insect stepping pattern generation, previous studies proposed computational models simulating aspects of stick insect locomotor activity. While these models generate diverse stepping patterns and transitions between them, there has not been an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms underlying their dynamics. In this study, we focus on modeling rhythm generation by the neurons associated with the protraction-retraction, levitation-depression, and extension-flexion antagonistic muscle pairs of the mesothoracic (middle) leg of stick insects. Our model features a reduced central pattern generator (CPG) circuit for each joint and includes synaptic interactions among the CPGs; we also consider extensions such as the inclusion of motoneuron pools controlled by the CPG components. The resulting network is described by an 18-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations. We use fast-slow decomposition, projection into interacting phase planes, and a heavy reliance on input-dependent nullclines to analyze this model. Specifically, we identify and elucidate dynamic mechanisms capable of generating a stepping rhythm, with a sequence of biologically constrained phase relationships, in a three-joint stick insect limb model. Furthermore, we explain the robustness to parameter changes and tunability of these patterns. In particular, the model allows us to identify possible mechanisms by which neuromodulatory and top-down effects could tune stepping pattern output frequency.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium physics of brain dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information processing in the brain is coordinated by the dynamic activity of neurons and neural populations at a range of spatiotemporal scales. These dynamics, captured in the form of electrophysiological recordings and neuroimaging, show evidence of time-irreversibility and broken detailed balance suggesting that the brain operates in a nonequilibrium stationary state. Furthermore, the level of nonequilibrium, measured by entropy production or irreversibility appears to be a crucial signature of cognitive complexity and consciousness. The subsequent study of neural dynamics from the perspective of nonequilibrium statistical physics is an emergent field that challenges the assumptions of symmetry and maximum-entropy that are common in traditional models. In this review, we discuss the plethora of exciting results emerging at the interface of nonequilibrium dynamics and neuroscience. We begin with an introduction to the mathematical paradigms necessary to understand nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous and discrete state-spaces. Next, we review both model-free and model-based approaches to analysing nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous-state recordings and neural spike-trains, as well as the results of such analyses. We briefly consider the topic of nonequilibrium computation in neural systems, before concluding with a discussion and outlook on the field.</description>

      <title>RISE-iEEG: Robust to Inter-Subject Electrodes Implantation Variability iEEG Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) is increasingly used for clinical and brain-computer interface applications due to its high spatial and temporal resolution. However, inter-subject variability in electrode implantation poses a challenge for developing generalized neural decoders. To address this, we introduce a novel decoder model that is robust to inter-subject electrode implantation variability. We call this model RISE-iEEG, which stands for Robust to Inter-Subject Electrode Implantation Variability iEEG Classifier. RISE-iEEG employs a deep neural network structure preceded by a participant-specific projection network. The projection network maps the neural data of individual participants onto a common low-dimensional space, compensating for the implantation variability. In other words, we developed an iEEG decoder model that can be applied across multiple participants' data without requiring the coordinates of electrode for each participant. The performance of RISE-iEEG across multiple datasets, including the Music Reconstruction dataset, and AJILE12 dataset, surpasses that of advanced iEEG decoder models such as HTNet and EEGNet. Our analysis shows that the performance of RISE-iEEG is about 7\% higher than that of HTNet and EEGNet in terms of F1 score, with an average F1 score of 0.83, which is the highest result among the evaluation methods defined. Furthermore, Our analysis of the projection network weights reveals that the Superior Temporal and Postcentral lobes are key encoding nodes for the Music Reconstruction and AJILE12 datasets, which aligns with the primary physiological principles governing these regions. This model improves decoding accuracy while maintaining interpretability and generalization.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the Primacy Effect in Structured State-Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13729v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human and animal memory for sequentially presented items is well-documented to be more accurate for those at the beginning and end of the sequence, phenomena known as the primacy and recency effects, respectively. By contrast, artificial neural network (ANN) models are typically designed with a memory that decays monotonically over time. Accordingly, ANNs are expected to show the recency effect but not the primacy effect. Contrary to this theoretical expectation, however, the present study reveals a counterintuitive finding: a recently developed ANN architecture, called structured state-space models, exhibits the primacy effect when trained and evaluated on a synthetic task that mirrors psychological memory experiments. Given that this model was originally designed for recovering neuronal activity patterns observed in biological brains, this result provides a novel perspective on the psychological primacy effect while also posing a non-trivial puzzle for the current theories in machine learning.</description>
