      <title>Learning Density Functionals to Bridge Particle and Continuum Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting interfacial thermodynamics across molecular and continuum scales remains a central challenge in computational science. Classical density functional theory (cDFT) provides a first-principles route to connect microscopic interactions with macroscopic observables, but its predictive accuracy depends on approximate free-energy functionals that are difficult to generalize. Here we introduce a physics-informed learning framework that augments cDFT with neural corrections trained directly against molecular-dynamics data through adjoint optimization. Rather than replacing the theory with a black-box surrogate, we embed compact neural networks within the Helmholtz free-energy functional, learning local and nonlocal corrections that preserve thermodynamic consistency while capturing missing correlations. Applied to Lennard-Jones fluids, the resulting augmented excess free-energy functional quantitatively reproduces equilibrium density profiles, coexistence curves, and surface tensions across a broad temperature range, and accurately predicts contact angles and droplet shapes far beyond the training regime. This approach combines the interpretability of statistical mechanics with the adaptability of modern machine learning, establishing a general route to learned thermodynamic functionals that bridge molecular simulations and continuum-scale models.</description>

      <title>BF-APNN: A Low-Memory Method for Accelerating the Solution of Radiative Transfer Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Radiative Transfer Equations (RTEs) exhibit high dimensionality and multiscale characteristics, rendering conventional numerical methods computationally intensive. Existing deep learning methods perform well in low-dimensional or linear RTEs, but still face many challenges with high-dimensional or nonlinear RTEs. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Basis Function Asymptotically Preserving Neural Network (BF-APNN), a framework that inherits the advantages of Radiative Transfer Asymptotically Preserving Neural Network (RT-APNN) and accelerates the solution process. By employing basis function expansion on the microscopic component, derived from micro-macro decomposition, BF-APNN effectively mitigates the computational burden associated with evaluating high-dimensional integrals during training. Numerical experiments, which involve challenging RTE scenarios featuring, nonlinearity, discontinuities, and multiscale behavior, demonstrate that BF-APNN substantially reduces training time compared to RT-APNN while preserving high solution accuracy. Moreover, BF-APNN exhibits superior performance in addressing complex, high-dimensional RTE problems, underscoring its potential as a robust tool for radiative transfer computations.</description>

      <title>Random Batch Sum-of-Gaussians Method for Molecular Dynamics of Born-Mayer-Huggins Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Born-Mayer-Huggins (BMH) potential, which combines Coulomb interactions with dispersion and short-range exponential repulsion, is widely used for ionic materials such as molten salts. However, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of BMH systems are often limited by computation, communication, and memory costs. We recently proposed the random batch sum-of-Gaussians (RBSOG) method, which accelerates Coulomb calculations by using a sum-of-Gaussians (SOG) decomposition to split the potential into short- and long-range parts and by applying importance sampling in Fourier space for the long-range part. In this work, we extend the RBSOG to BMH systems and incorporate a random batch list (RBL) scheme to further accelerate the short-range part, yielding a unified framework for efficient simulations with the BMH potential. The combination of the SOG decomposition and the RBL enables an efficient and scalable treatment of both long- and short-range interactions in BMH system, particularly the RBL well handles the medium-range exponential repulsion and dispersion by the random batch neighbor list. Error estimate is provided to show the theoretical convergence of the RBL force. We evaluate the framework on molten NaCl and mixed alkali halide with up to $5\times10^6$ atoms on $2048$ CPU cores. Compared to the Ewald-based particle-particle particle-mesh method and the RBSOG-only method, our method achieves approximately $4\sim10\times$ and $2\times$ speedups while using $1000$ cores, respectively, under the same level of structural and thermodynamic accuracy and with a reduced memory usage. These results demonstrate the attractive performance of our method in accuracy and scalability for MD simulations with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Fast Poisson brackets and constraint algebras in canonical gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of alternative or extended theories of gravity, Dirac's Hamiltonian constraint algorithm is invaluable for enumerating the propagating modes and gauge symmetries. For gravity, this canonical approach is frequently applied as a means for finding pathologies such as strongly coupled modes; more generally it facilitates the reconstruction of gauge symmetries and the quantization of gauge theories. For gravity, however, the algorithm can become notoriously arduous to implement. We present a simple computer algebra package for efficiently computing Poisson brackets and reconstructing constraint algebras. The tools are stress-tested against pure general relativity and modified gravity, including the order reduction of general relativity at two loops.</description>

      <title>NeuralCrop: Combining physics and machine learning for improved crop yield predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global gridded crop models (GGCMs) simulate daily crop growth by explicitly representing key biophysical processes and project end-of-season yield time series. They are a primary tool to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and assess associated risks for food security. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art GGCMs still have substantial uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes due to limited process understanding. Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components. The model is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM before it is fine-tuned on observational data. We show that NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs across site-level and large-scale cropping regions. Across moisture conditions, NeuralCrop reproduces the interannual yield anomalies in European wheat regions and the US Corn Belt more accurately during the period from 2000 to 2019 with particularly strong improvements under drought extremes. When generalizing to conditions unseen during training, NeuralCrop continues to make robust projections, while pure machine learning models exhibit substantial performance degradation. Our results show that our hybrid crop modelling approach offers overall improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and intensifying extreme weather conditions.</description>

      <title>Assessing generative modeling approaches for free energy estimates in condensed matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate estimation of free energy differences between two states is a long-standing challenge in molecular simulations. Traditional approaches generally rely on sampling multiple intermediate states to ensure sufficient overlap in phase space and are, consequently, computationally expensive. Several generative-model-based methods have recently addressed this challenge by learning a direct bridge between distributions, bypassing the need for intermediate states. However, it remains unclear which approaches provide the best trade-off between efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. In this work, we systematically review these methods and benchmark selected approaches with a focus on condensed-matter systems. In particular, we investigate the performance of discrete and continuous normalizing flows in the context of targeted free energy perturbation as well as FEAT (Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport) together with the escorted Jarzynski equality, using coarse-grained monatomic ice and Lennard-Jones solids as benchmark systems. We evaluate accuracy, data efficiency, computational cost, and scalability with system size. Our results provide a quantitative framework for selecting effective free energy estimation strategies in condensed-phase systems.</description>

      <title>Bridging Visual Intuition and Chemical Expertise: An Autonomous Analysis Framework for Nonadiabatic Dynamics Simulations via Mentor-Engineer-Student Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing nonadiabatic molecular dynamics trajectories traditionally heavily relies on expert intuition and visual pattern recognition, a process that is difficult to formalize. We present VisU, a vision-driven framework that leverages the complementary strengths of two state-of-the-art large language models to establish a "virtual research collective." This collective operates through a "Mentor-Engineer-Student" paradigm that mimics the collaborative intelligence of a professional chemistry laboratory. Within this ecosystem, the Mentor provides physical intuition through visual reasoning, while the Engineer adaptively constructs analysis scripts, and the Student executes the pipeline and manages the data and results. VisU autonomously orchestrates a four-stage workflow comprising Preprocessing, Recursive Channel Discovery, Important-Motion Identification, and Validation/Summary. This systematic approach identifies reaction channels and key nuclear motions while generating professional academic reports. By bridging visual insight with chemical expertise, VisU establishes a new paradigm for human-AI collaboration in the analysis of excited-state dynamics simulation results, significantly reducing dependence on manual interpretation and enabling more intuitive, scalable mechanistic discovery.</description>

      <title>Towards mechanistic understanding in a data-driven weather model: internal activations reveal interpretable physical features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large data-driven physics models like DeepMind's weather model GraphCast have empirically succeeded in parameterizing time operators for complex dynamical systems with an accuracy reaching or in some cases exceeding that of traditional physics-based solvers. Unfortunately, how these data-driven models perform computations is largely unknown and whether their internal representations are interpretable or physically consistent is an open question. Here, we adapt tools from interpretability research in Large Language Models to analyze intermediate computational layers in GraphCast, leveraging sparse autoencoders to discover interpretable features in the neuron space of the model. We uncover distinct features on a wide range of length and time scales that correspond to tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, diurnal and seasonal behavior, large-scale precipitation patterns, specific geographical coding, and sea-ice extent, among others. We further demonstrate how the precise abstraction of these features can be probed via interventions on the prediction steps of the model. As a case study, we sparsely modify a feature corresponding to tropical cyclones in GraphCast and observe interpretable and physically consistent modifications to evolving hurricanes. Such methods offer a window into the black-box behavior of data-driven physics models and are a step towards realizing their potential as trustworthy predictors and scientifically valuable tools for discovery.</description>

      <title>Generative forecasting with joint probability models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems exhibit strong sensitivity to initial conditions and often contain unresolved multiscale processes, making deterministic forecasting fundamentally limited. Generative models offer an appealing alternative by learning distributions over plausible system evolutions; yet, most existing approaches focus on next-step conditional prediction rather than the structure of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we reframe forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. This new perspective allows the model to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies, represent multistep trajectory segments, and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. We also introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and show how it enables assessment of forecast robustness and reliability using three complementary uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift), without access to ground truth. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two canonical chaotic dynamical systems, the Lorenz-63 system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and show that joint generative models yield improved short-term predictive skill, preserve attractor geometry, and achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behaviour than conventional conditional next-step models.</description>

      <title>Upscaling from ab initio atomistic simulations to electrode scale: The case of manganese hexacyanoferrate, a cathode material for Na-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generalizable scale-bridging computational framework that enables predictive modeling of insertion-type electrode materials from atomistic to device scales. Applied to sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate, a promising cathode material for grid-scale sodium-ion batteries, our methodology employs an active-learning strategy to train a Moment Tensor Potential through iterative hybrid grand-canonical Monte Carlo--molecular dynamics sampling, robustly capturing configuration spaces at all sodiation levels. The resulting machine learning interatomic potential accurately reproduces experimental properties including volume expansion, operating voltage, and sodium concentration-dependent structural transformations, while revealing a four-order-of-magnitude difference in sodium diffusivity between the rhombohedral (sodium-rich) and tetragonal (sodium-poor) phases at 300 K. We directly compute all critical parameters -- temperature- and concentration-dependent diffusivities, interfacial and strain energies, and complete free-energy landscapes -- to feed them into pseudo-2D phase-field simulations that predict phase-boundary propagation and rate-dependent performances across electrode length scales. This multiscale workflow establishes a blueprint for rational computational design of next-generation insertion-type materials, such as battery electrode materials, demonstrating how atomistic insights can be systematically translated into continuum-scale predictions.</description>

      <title>Computational Analysis of Disease Progression in Pediatric Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.25027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive cardiopulmonary disease that leads to increased pulmonary pressures, vascular remodeling, and eventual right ventricular (RV) failure. Pediatric PAH remains understudied due to limited data and the lack of targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In this study, we developed and calibrated multi-scale, patient-specific cardiovascular models for four pediatric PAH patients using longitudinal MRI and catheterization data collected approximately two years apart. Using the CRIMSON simulation framework, we coupled three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models of the pulmonary arteries with zero-dimensional (0D) lumped-parameter heart and Windkessel models to simulate patient hemodynamics. An automated Python-based optimizer was developed to calibrate boundary conditions by minimizing discrepancies between simulated and clinical metrics, reducing calibration time from weeks to days. Model-derived metrics such as arterial stiffness, pulse wave velocity, resistance, and compliance were found to align with clinical indicators of disease severity and progression. Our findings demonstrate that computational modeling can non-invasively capture patient-specific hemodynamic adaptation over time, offering a promising tool for monitoring pediatric PAH and informing future treatment strategies.</description>

Abstract: A classical Monte Carlo algorithm based on the quasi-classical approximation is applied to the pseudospin Hamiltonian of the model cuprate. The model takes into account both local and non-local correlations, Heisenberg spin-exchange interaction, single-particle and correlated two-particle transfer. We define the state selection rule that gives both the uniform distribution of states in the phase space and the doped charge conservation. The simulation results show a qualitative agreement of a phase diagrams with the experimental ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting governing physical laws from computational or experimental data is crucial across various fields such as fluid dynamics and plasma physics. Many of those physical laws are dissipative due to fluid viscosity or plasma collisions. For such a dissipative physical system, we propose a framework to learn the corresponding laws of the systems based on their energy-dissipation laws, assuming either continuous data (probability density) or discrete data (particles) are available. Our methods offer several key advantages, including their robustness to corrupted/noisy observations, their easy extension to more complex physical systems, and the potential to address higher-dimensional systems. We validate our approaches through representative numerical examples and carefully investigate the impacts of data quantity and data property on model discovery.</description>

      <title>Rapid Variable Resolution Particle Initialization for Complex Geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accuracy of meshless methods like Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is highly dependent on the quality of the particle distribution. Existing particle initialization techniques often struggle to simultaneously achieve adaptive resolution, handle intricate boundaries, and efficiently generate well-packed distributions inside and outside a boundary. This work presents a fast and robust particle initialization method that achieves these goals using standard SPH building blocks. Our approach enables simultaneous initialization of fluid and solid regions, supports arbitrary geometries, and achieves high-quality, quasi-uniform particle arrangements without complex procedures like surface bonding. Extensive results in both 2D and 3D demonstrate that the obtained particle distributions exhibit good boundary conformity, low spatial disorder, and minimal density variation, all with significantly reduced computational cost compared to existing approaches. This work paves the way for automated particle initialization to accurately model flow in and around bodies with meshless methods, particularly with SPH.</description>

      <title>Dependence of Microstructure Classification Accuracy on Crystallographic Data Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks are increasingly being used to analyze and classify material microstructures, motivated by the possibility that they will be able to identify relevant microstructural features more efficiently and impartially than human experts. While up to now convolutional neural networks have mostly been applied to light optimal microscopy and scanning electron microscope micrographs, application to EBSD micrographs will be increasingly common as rational design generates materials with unknown textures and phase compositions. This raises the question of how crystallographic orientation should be represented in such a convolutional neural network, and whether this choice has a significant effect on the network's analysis and classification accuracy. Four representations of orientation information are examined and are used with convolutional neural networks to classify five synthetic microstructures with varying textures and grain geometries. Of these, a spectral embedding of crystallographic orientations in a space that respects the crystallographic symmetries performs by far the best, even when the network is trained on small volumes of data such as could be accessible by practical experiments.</description>

      <title>A space-time extension of a conservative two-fluid cut-cell method for moving diffusion problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a space-time extension of a conservative Cartesian cut-cell finite-volume method for two-phase diffusion problems with prescribed interface motion. The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: one scalar field is solved in each phase with discontinuous material properties, coupled by sharp interface conditions enforcing flux continuity and jump laws. To handle moving boundaries on a fixed Cartesian grid, the discrete balance is written over phase-restricted space-time control volumes, whose geometric moments (swept volumes and apertures) are used as weights in the finite-volume operators. This construction naturally accounts for the creation and destruction of cut cells (fresh/dead-cell events) and yields strict discrete conservation. The resulting scheme retains the algebraic structure of the static cut-cell formulation while incorporating motion through local geometric weights and interface coupling operators. A series of verification and validation tests in two and three dimensions demonstrate super-linear accuracy in space, robust behavior under repeated topology changes and conservation across strong coefficient jumps and moving interfaces. The proposed space-time cut-cell framework provides a conservative building block for multiphase transport in evolving geometries and a foundation for future free-boundary extensions such as Stefan-type phase change.</description>

      <title>Partially polaron-transformed quantum master equation for exciton and charge transport dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.02812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polaron-transformed quantum master equation (PQME) offers a unified framework to describe the dynamics of quantum systems in both limits of weak and strong couplings to environmental degrees of freedom. Thus, PQME serves as an efficient method to describe charge and exciton transfer/transport dynamics for a broad range of parameters in condensed or complex environments. However, in some cases, the polaron transformation (PT) being employed in the formulation invokes an over-relaxation of slow modes and results in premature suppression of important coherence terms. A formal framework to address this issue is developed in the present work by employing a partial PT that has smaller weights for low frequency bath modes. It is shown here that a closed form expression of a 2nd order time-local PQME including all the inhomogeneous terms can be derived for a general form of partial PT, although more complicated than that for the full PT. All the expressions needed for numerical calculation are derived in detail. Applications to a model of two-level system coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators, with test calculations focused on those due to homogeneous relaxation terms, demonstrate the feasibility and the utility of the present approach.</description>

      <title>Simple and general unitarity conserving numerical real time propagators of time dependent Schr\"odinger equation based on Magnus expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnus expansion (ME) provides a general way to expand the real-time propagator of a time-dependent Hamiltonian within the exponential such that the unitarity is satisfied at any order. We use this property and explicit integration of Lagrange interpolation formulas for the time-dependent Hamiltonian within each time interval and derive approximations that preserve unitarity for the differential time evolution operators of general time-dependent Hamiltonians. The resulting second-order approximation is the same as using the average of Hamiltonians for two end points of time. We identify three fourth-order approximations involving commutators of Hamiltonians at different times and also derive a sixth-order expression. A test of these approximations along with other available expressions for a two-state time-dependent Hamiltonian with sinusoidal time dependences provides information on the relative performance of these approximations and suggests that the derived expressions can serve as useful numerical tools for time evolution in time-resolved spectroscopy, quantum control, quantum sensing, real-time ab initio quantum dynamics, and open system quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fermi's golden rule rate expression for transitions due to nonadiabatic derivative couplings in the adiabatic basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from a general molecular Hamiltonian expressed in the basis of adiabatic electronic and nuclear position states, where a compact and complete expression for nonadiabatic derivative coupling (NDC) Hamiltonian term is obtained, we provide a general analysis of the Fermi's golden rule (FGR) rate expression for nonadiabatic transitions between adiabatic states. We then consider a quasi-adiabatic approximation that uses crude adiabatic states evaluated at the minimum potential energy configuration of the initial adiabatic state as the basis for the zeroth order adiabatic and NDC coupling terms of the Hamiltonian. Although application of this approximation is rather limited, it allows deriving a general FGR rate expression without further approximation and still accounts for non-Condon effect arising from momentum operators of NDC terms and its coupling with vibronic displacements. For a generic and widely used model where all nuclear degrees of freedom and environmental effects are represented as linearly coupled harmonic oscillators, we derive a closed form FGR rate expression that requires only Fourier transform. The resulting rate expression includes quadratic contributions of NDC terms and their couplings to Franck-Condon modes, which require evaluation of two additional bath spectral densities in addition to conventional one that appears in a typical FGR rate theory based on the Condon approximation. Model calculations for the case where nuclear vibrations consist of both a sharp high frequency mode and an Ohmic bath spectral density illustrate new features and implications of the rate expression. We then apply our theoretical expression to the nonradiative decay from the first excited singlet state of azulene, which illustrates the utility and implications of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Investigation of resistive switching in Au/MoS2/Au using Reactive Molecular Dynamics and ab-initio quantum transport calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the underlying physical mechanism for electric-field induced resistive switching in Au/MoS2/Au based memristive devices by combining reactive Molecular Dynamics (MD) and ab-initio quantum transport calculations. Using MD with Au/Mo/S ReaxFF potential, we observe the formation of realistic conductive filament consisting of gold atoms through monolayer MoS2 layer when sufficient electric field is applied. We furthermore instigate the rupture of the gold atom filament when a sufficiently large electric field is applied in the opposite direction. To calculate the conductance of the obtained structures and identify the High Resistance (HR) and Low Resistance (LR) states, we employ the ab-initio electron transport calculations by importing the atomic structures from MD calculations. For single-defect MoS2 memristors, the obtained LRS, HRS current densities are in order of 10^7 A/cm^2 which agrees reasonably well with the reported experiments.</description>

      <title>A Gas-Kinetic Scheme for Maxwell Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gas-Kinetic Scheme (GKS), widely used in computational fluid dynamics for simulating hypersonic and other complicated flow phenomena, is extended in this work to electromagnetic problems by solving Maxwell's equations. In contrast to the classical GKS formulation, the proposed scheme employs a discrete rather than a continuous velocity space. By evaluating a time-accurate numerical flux at cell interfaces, the proposed scheme attains second-order accuracy within a single step. Its kinetic formulation provides an inherently multidimensional framework, while the finite-volume formulation ensures straightforward extension to unstructured meshes. Through the incorporation of a collision process, the scheme exhibits lower numerical dissipation than classical flux-vector splitting (FVS) methods. Furthermore, the kinetic decomposition enables direct implementation of non-reflecting boundary conditions. The proposed scheme is validated against several benchmark problems and compared with established methods, including the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method and FVS. A lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) implementation is also included for comparative analysis. Finally, the technique is applied to simulate electromagnetic wave propagation in a realistic aircraft configuration, demonstrating its ability to model complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning atomistic semi-empirical pseudopotential model for nanomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The semi-empirical pseudopotential method (SEPM) has been widely applied to provide computational insights into the electronic structure, photophysics, and charge carrier dynamics of nanoscale materials. We present "DeepPseudopot", a machine-learned atomistic pseudopotential model that extends the SEPM framework by combining a flexible neural network representation of the local pseudopotential with parameterized non-local and spin-orbit coupling terms. Trained on bulk quasiparticle band structures and deformation potentials from GW calculations, the model captures many-body and relativistic effects with very high accuracy across diverse semiconducting materials, as illustrated for silicon and group III-V semiconductors. DeepPseudopot's accuracy, efficiency, and transferability make it well-suited for data-driven in silico design and discovery of novel optoelectronic nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Enhanced premelting at the ice-rubber interface using all-atom molecular dynamics simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ice-rubber interface is critical in applications such as tires and shoe outsoles, yet its molecular tribology remains unclear. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we studied premelting layers at the basal face of ice in contact with styrene-butadiene rubber from 254 to 269 K. Despite its hydrophobicity, rubber enhances structural disorder of interfacial water, promoting premelting. In contrast, water mobility is suppressed by confinement from polymer chains, leading to glassy dynamics distinct from the ice-vapor interface. Near the melting point, rubber chains become more flexible and penetrate the premelting layer, forming a mixed rubber-water region that couples the dynamics of both components. These results suggest that nanoscale roughness and morphology of hydrophobic polymers disrupt ice hydrogen-bond networks, thereby enhancing premelting. Our findings provide molecular-level insight into ice slipperiness and inform the design of polymer materials with controlled ice adhesion and friction.</description>

      <title>GoodRegressor: A General-Purpose Symbolic Regression Framework for Physically Interpretable Materials Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18325v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbolic regression offers a promising route toward interpretable machine learning, yet existing methods suffer from poor predictability and computational intractability when exploring large expression spaces. I introduce GoodRegressor, a general-purpose C++-based framework that resolves these limitations while preserving full physical interpretability. By combining hierarchical descriptor construction, interaction discovery, nonlinear transformations, statistically rigorous model selection, and stacking ensemble, GoodRegressor efficiently explores symbolic model spaces such as $1.44 \times 10^{457}$, $5.99 \times 10^{124}$, and $4.20 \times 10^{430}$ possible expressions for oxygen-ion conductors, NASICONs, and superconducting oxides, respectively. Across these systems, it produces compact equations that surpass state-of-the-art black-box models and symbolic regressors, improving $R^2$ by $4 \sim 40$ %. The resulting expressions reveal physical insights, for example, into oxygen-ion transport through coordination environment and lattice flexibility. Independent ensemble runs yield nearly identical regressed values and the identical top-ranked candidate, demonstrating high reproducibility. With scalability up to $10^{4392}$ choices without interaction terms, GoodRegressor provides a foundation for general-purpose interpretable machine intelligence.</description>

      <title>Martini Mapper: An Automated Fragment-Based Framework for Developing Coarse-Grained Models within the Martini 3 Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coarse-graining (CG) reduces molecular details to extend the time and length scales of molecular dynamics simulations to microseconds and micrometers. However, the CG approaches have long been limited by the difficulty of constructing both accurate and transferable models efficiently, considering the large diversity of chemical structures of materials. Among CG force fields, Martini is the most widely used, as it retains essential chemical features while offering substantial computational efficiency. Its most recent version, Martini 3, expands chemical resolution through a much broader bead set, particularly for small molecules. However, this flexibility also complicates the mapping of organic molecules because of context-dependent rules and the lack of standardized procedures. To address this issue, we present an automated framework that builds Martini 3 models directly from SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings by combining a curated bead dictionary with a hierarchical, rule-based algorithm. Our framework, Martini Mapper, generated Martini 3 models for more than 5,000 molecules across four chemically diverse datasets. A curated subset of 1,081 mapped structures was benchmarked through octanol-water free-energy ($\Delta G_{OW}$) and partition-coefficient ($\log P$) calculations, yielding strong agreement with experimental values. The workflow can also map large molecules containing up to 126 heavy atoms, exceeding the capabilities of existing automated approaches. The algorithm and the complete set of more than 5,000 mapped itp/top files are available at the \href{https://github.com/eliobaby/Martini_mapping}{Martini Mapper}. Our framework, therefore, enables systematic and scalable Martini 3 structures for high-throughput simulations relevant to drug discovery and materials design.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution of Elliptic PDE Solutions Using Least Squares Support Vector Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hybrid computational approach that integrates the finite element method (FEM) with least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) is introduced to solve partial differential equations. The method combines FEM's ability to provide the nodal solutions and LSSVR with higher-order Legendre polynomial kernels to deliver a closed-form analytical solution for interpolation between the nodes. The hybrid approach implements element-wise enhancement (super-resolution) of a given numerical solution, resulting in high resolution accuracy, while maintaining consistency with FEM nodal values at element boundaries. It can adapt any low-order FEM code to obtain high-order resolution by leveraging localized kernel refinement and parallel computation without additional implementation overhead. Therefore, effective inference/post-processing of the obtained super-resolved solution is possible. Evaluation results show that the hybrid FEM-LSSVR approach can achieve significantly higher accuracy compared to the base FEM solution. Comparable accuracy is a achieved when comparing the hybrid solution with a standalone FEM result with the same polynomial basis function order. The convergence studies were conducted for four elliptic boundary value problems to demonstrate the method's ability, accuracy, and reliability. Finally, the algorithm can be directly used as a plug-and-play method for super-resolving low-order numerical solvers and for super-resolution of expensive/under-resolved experimental data.</description>
