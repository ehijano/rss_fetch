      <title>Multiple merger coalescent inference of effective population size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variation in a sample of molecular sequence data informs about the past evolutionary history of the sample's population. Traditionally, Bayesian modeling coupled with the standard coalescent, is used to infer the sample's bifurcating genealogy and demographic and evolutionary parameters such as effective population size, and mutation rates. However, there are many situations where binary coalescent models do not accurately reflect the true underlying ancestral processes. Here, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric method for inferring effective population size trajectories from a multifurcating genealogy under the $\Lambda-$coalescent. In particular, we jointly estimate the effective population size and model parameters for the Beta-coalescent model, a special type of $\Lambda-$coalescent. Finally, we test our methods on simulations and apply them to study various viral dynamics as well as Japanese sardine population size changes over time. The code and vignettes can be found in the phylodyn package.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems for coupled nonlocal nonlinear systems arising in mathematical biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and study several inverse problems of determining unknown parameters in nonlocal nonlinear coupled PDE systems, including the potentials, nonlinear interaction functions and time-fractional orders. In these coupled systems, we enforce non-negativity of the solutions, aligning with realistic scenarios in biology and ecology. There are several salient features of our inverse problem study: the drastic reduction in measurement/observation data due to averaging effects, the nonlinear coupling between multiple equations, and the nonlocality arising from fractional-type derivatives. These factors present significant challenges to our inverse problem, and such inverse problems have never been explored in previous literature. To address these challenges, we develop new and effective schemes. Our approach involves properly controlling the injection of different source terms to obtain multiple sets of mean flux data. This allows us to achieve unique identifiability results and accurately determine the unknown parameters. Finally, we establish a connection between our study and practical applications in biology, further highlighting the relevance of our work in real-world contexts.</description>

      <title>Selection pressure/Noise driven cooperative behaviour in the thermodynamic limit of repeated games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the scenario where an infinite number of players (i.e., the \textit{thermodynamic} limit) find themselves in a Prisoner's dilemma type situation, in a \textit{repeated} setting. Is it reasonable to anticipate that, in these circumstances, cooperation will emerge? This paper addresses this question by examining the emergence of cooperative behaviour, in the presence of \textit{noise} (or, under \textit{selection pressure}), in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games, involving strategies such as \textit{Tit-for-Tat}, \textit{Always Defect}, \textit{GRIM}, \textit{Win-Stay, Lose-Shift}, and others. To analyze these games, we employ a numerical Agent-Based Model (ABM) and compare it with the analytical Nash Equilibrium Mapping (NEM) technique, both based on the \textit{1D}-Ising chain. We use \textit{game magnetization} as an indicator of cooperative behaviour. A significant finding is that for some repeated games, a discontinuity in the game magnetization indicates a \textit{first}-order \textit{selection pressure/noise}-driven phase transition. The phase transition is particular to strategies where players do not severely punish a single defection. We also observe that in these particular cases, the phase transition critically depends on the number of \textit{rounds} the game is played in the thermodynamic limit. For all five games, we find that both ABM and NEM, in conjunction with game magnetization, provide crucial inputs on how cooperative behaviour can emerge in an infinite-player repeated Prisoner's dilemma game.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann machine learning and regularization methods for inferring evolutionary fields and couplings from a multiple sequence alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05006</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.05006v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inverse Potts problem to infer a Boltzmann distribution for homologous protein sequences from their single-site and pairwise amino acid frequencies recently attracts a great deal of attention in the studies of protein structure and evolution. We study regularization and learning methods and how to tune regularization parameters to correctly infer interactions in Boltzmann machine learning. Using $L_2$ regularization for fields, group $L_1$ for couplings is shown to be very effective for sparse couplings in comparison with $L_2$ and $L_1$. Two regularization parameters are tuned to yield equal values for both the sample and ensemble averages of evolutionary energy. Both averages smoothly change and converge, but their learning profiles are very different between learning methods. The Adam method is modified to make stepsize proportional to the gradient for sparse couplings. It is shown by first inferring interactions from protein sequences and then from Monte Carlo samples that the fields and couplings can be well recovered, but that recovering the pairwise correlations in the resolution of a total energy is harder for the natural proteins than for the protein-like sequences. Selective temperature for folding/structural constrains in protein evolution is also estimated.</description>

      <title>Cost optimisation of individual-based institutional reward incentives for promoting cooperation in finite populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of cost optimisation of individual-based institutional incentives (reward, punishment, and hybrid) for guaranteeing a certain minimal level of cooperative behaviour in a well-mixed, finite population. In this scheme, the individuals in the population interact via cooperation dilemmas (Donation Game or Public Goods Game) in which institutional reward is carried out only if cooperation is not abundant enough (i.e., the number of cooperators is below a threshold $1\leq t\leq N-1$, where $N$ is the population size); and similarly, institutional punishment is carried out only when defection is too abundant. We study analytically the cases $t=1$ for the reward incentive under the small mutation limit assumption and two different initial states, showing that the cost function is always non-decreasing. We derive the neutral drift and strong selection limits when the intensity of selection tends to zero and infinity, respectively. We numerically investigate the problem for other values of $t$ and for population dynamics with arbitrary mutation rates.</description>

      <title>Identifying circular orders for blobs in phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interest in the inference of evolutionary networks relating species or populations has grown with the increasing recognition of the importance of hybridization, gene flow and admixture, and the availability of large-scale genomic data. However, what network features may be validly inferred from various data types under different models remains poorly understood. Previous work has largely focused on level-1 networks, in which reticulation events are well separated, and on a general network's tree of blobs, the tree obtained by contracting every blob to a node. An open question is the identifiability of the topology of a blob of unknown level. We consider the identifiability of the circular order in which subnetworks attach to a blob, first proving that this order is well-defined for outer-labeled planar blobs. For this class of blobs, we show that the circular order information from 4-taxon subnetworks identifies the full circular order of the blob. Similarly, the circular order from 3-taxon rooted subnetworks identifies the full circular order of a rooted blob. We then show that subnetwork circular information is identifiable from certain data types and evolutionary models. This provides a general positive result for high-level networks, on the identifiability of the ordering in which taxon blocks attach to blobs in outer-labeled planar networks. Finally, we give examples of blobs with different internal structures which cannot be distinguished under many models and data types.</description>

      <title>Natural Selection and Random Matrix Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.09812v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We will study the relationship between two well-known theories, genetic evolution and random matrix theory in the context of many-body systems. It is suggested that genetic evolution can be described by a random matrix theory with statistical distribution in which natural selection acts as a Gross-Witten-Wadia phase transition.</description>
