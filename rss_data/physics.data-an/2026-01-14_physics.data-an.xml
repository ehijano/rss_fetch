      <title>Evolving spatiotemporal patterns and urban scaling of deaths from external causes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban scaling theory posits that urban indicators follow power-law relations with population, yet the evolution of these patterns - and the role of regional differences in settings marked by social inequalities and unplanned urbanization - remains poorly understood. Here, we analyze nearly three decades of mortality data from Brazilian cities to investigate the scaling of external causes of death: homicides, suicides, and accidents. Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework and spatial correlation analysis, we find that these mortality indicators exhibit distinct, regionally heterogeneous scaling trajectories. Homicide mortality has significantly attenuated its typical superlinear scaling with increased spatial clustering, suggesting a redistribution of violence to smaller cities and intensified intercity interactions, possibly linked to the consolidation of organized crime. Suicide mortality, usually sublinear, has trended upward, implying a weakening of urban agglomerations' protective effect. Accident mortality remains superlinear, with transport fatalities scaling nearly proportionally, and non-transport accidents becoming superlinear. The scaling changes for suicides and accidents coincide with less correlated and stable spatial patterns, suggesting that the underlying processes predominantly operate within city boundaries. Finally, while scaling exponents have evolved more homogeneously across Brazilian states, scale-adjusted mortality remains highly heterogeneous, indicating that fundamental processes govern scaling laws, whereas state-specific factors drive scale-adjusted metrics.</description>

      <title>Recurrence Patterns Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrence plots (RPs) are powerful tools for visualizing time series dynamics; however, traditional Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) often relies on global metrics, such as line counting, that can overlook system-specific, localized structures. To address this, we introduce Recurrence Pattern Correlation (RPC), a quantifier inspired by spatial statistics that bridges the gap between qualitative RP inspection and quantitative analysis. RPC is designed to measure the correlation degree of an RP to patterns of arbitrary shape and scale. By choosing patterns with specific time lags, we visualize the unstable manifolds of periodic orbits within the Logistic map bifurcation diagram, dissect the mixed phase space of the Standard map, and track the unstable periodic orbits of the Lorenz '63 system's 3-dimensional phase space. This framework reveals how long-range correlations in recurrence patterns encode the underlying properties of nonlinear dynamics and provides a more flexible tool to analyze pattern formation in recurrent dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of the coupled entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupled entropy, $H_\kappa,$ is proven to uniquely satisfy the requirement that a generalized entropy be a measure of the uncertainty at the scale, $\sigma,$ for a class of non-exponential distributions. The coupled stretched exponential distributions, including the generalized Pareto and Student's t distributions, are uniquely parameterized to quantify linear uncertainty with the scale and nonlinear uncertainty with the tail shape for a broad class of complex systems. Thereby, the coupled entropy optimizes the representation of the uncertainty due to linear sources. Lemmas for the composability and extensivity of the coupled entropy are proven. The uniqueness of the coupled entropy is further supported by demonstrating consistent thermodynamic relationships, which correspond to a model used for the momentum of high-energy particle collisions. Applications of the coupled entropy in measuring statistical complexity, training variational inference algorithms, and designing communication channels are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Rotational Kinematics in the Globular Cluster System of M31: Insights from Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As ancient stellar systems, globular clusters (GCs) offer valuable insights into the dynamical histories of large galaxies. Previous studies of GC populations in the inner and outer regions of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) have revealed intriguing subpopulations with distinct kinematic properties. Here, we build upon earlier studies by employing Bayesian modelling to investigate the kinematics of the combined inner and outer GC populations of M31. Given the heterogeneous nature of the data, we examine subpopulations defined by GCs' metallicity and by associations with substructure, in order to characterise possible relationships between the inner and outer GC populations. We find that lower-metallicity GCs and those linked to substructures exhibit a common, more rapid rotation, whose alignment is distinct from that of higher-metallicity and non-substructure GCs. Furthermore, the higher-metallicity GCs rotate in alignment with Andromeda's stellar disk. These pronounced kinematic differences reinforce the idea that different subgroups of GCs were accreted to M31 at distinct epochs, shedding light on the complex assembly history of the galaxy.</description>
