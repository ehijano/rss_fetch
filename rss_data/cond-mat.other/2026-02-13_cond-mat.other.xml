      <title>MagneX: A High-Performance, GPU-Enabled, Data-Driven Micromagnetics Solver for Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to comprehensively investigate the multiphysics coupling in spintronic devices, it is essential to parallelize and utilize GPU-acceleration to address the spatial and temporal disparities inherent in the relevant physics. Additionally, the use of cutting-edge time integration libraries as well as machine learning (ML) approaches to replace and potentially accelerate expensive computational routines are attractive capabilities to enhance modeling capabilities moving forward. Leveraging the Exascale Computing Project software framework AMReX, as well as SUNDIALS time-integration libraries and python-based ML workflows, we have developed an open-source micromagnetics modeling tool called MagneX. This tool incorporates various crucial magnetic coupling mechanisms, including Zeeman coupling, demagnetization coupling, crystalline anisotropy interaction, exchange coupling, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) coupling. We demonstrate the GPU performance and scalability of the code and rigorously validate MagneX's functionality using the mumag standard problems and widely-accepted DMI benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the data-driven capability of MagneX by replacing the computationally-expensive demagnetization physics with neural network libraries trained from our simulation data. With the capacity to explore complete physical interactions, this innovative approach offers a promising pathway to better understand and develop fully integrated spintronic and electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of Hexagonal Close-Packed Water Ice at Conditions in Ice Giant Planetary Interiors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowing the phase transformations in dense water ice is key to unraveling the peculiar geophysical properties of Uranus and Neptune, whose stratified interior models predict a thick ice layer beneath a convective ionic fluid layer. In the latter, water ice is currently assumed to adopt an fcc superionic structure, a phase that has recently been observed experimentally. Here, we report the observation of an hcp ice phase under such planetary conditions, using synchrotron x-ray diffraction in laser-heated diamond anvil cells. Between 80 and 200 GPa, we observe the coexistence of fcc and hcp ices, arising from stacking disorder developing within the fcc oxygen lattice upon temperature cycling. Above 200 GPa, the hcp phase dominates at high temperature, indicating increased thermodynamic stability upon entering a superionic state suggested by an anomalous thermal expansion. An anisotropic proton conductivity of superionic hcp ice, and the existence of a fcc-hcp martensitic transition may have planetary implications for dynamo models and for the dynamics of the ice mantle.</description>
