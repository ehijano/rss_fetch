      <title>Between Flat-Earthers and Fitness Coaches: Who is Citing Scientific Publications in YouTube Video Descriptions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we undertake an extensive analysis of YouTube channels that reference research publications in their video descriptions, offering a unique insight into the intersection of digital media and academia. Our investigation focuses on three principal aspects: the background of YouTube channel owners, their thematic focus, and the nature of their operational dynamics, specifically addressing whether they work individually or in groups. Our results highlight a strong emphasis on content related to science and engineering, as well as health, particularly in channels managed by individual researchers and academic institutions. However, there is a notable variation in the popularity of these channels, with professional YouTubers and commercial media entities often outperforming in terms of viewer engagement metrics like likes, comments, and views. This underscores the challenge academic channels face in attracting a wider audience. Further, we explore the role of academic actors on YouTube, scrutinizing their impact in disseminating research and the types of publications they reference. Despite a general inclination towards professional academic topics, these channels displayed a varied effectiveness in spotlighting highly cited research. Often, they referenced a wide array of publications, indicating a diverse but not necessarily impact-focused approach to content selection.</description>

      <title>AI speeds up science, but scientists should guide its direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16839v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past century, the focus of scientific practices has shifted from purely intellectual exploration to problem-solving, leading to uneven development in scientific knowledge. Our analysis of 41 million research articles over the past six decades reveals this trend of uneven development, with atypical papers representing complementary innovation becoming the majority and displacement papers representing substitutive innovation decreasing to the minority. While AI can enhance human memory capacity, it may not necessarily accelerate progress in canonical concepts without changing the agenda of science and its organization.</description>
