      <title>Gravitational friction from d'Alembert's principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The least action principle played a central role in the development of modern physics. A major drawback of the principle is that its applicability is limited to holonomic constraints. In the present work, we investigate the energy lost by particles as a result of the gravitational interaction in a homogeneous low-density medium subject to non-holonomic constraints. We perform the calculation for an arbitrary particle and outline the specific result for photons. The energy lost is calculated from first principles based on the principle of virtual work and the d'Alembert principle. Under the formalism mentioned above, the dissipative nature of the effect is established. Furthermore, we show that the results agree with an alternative derivation based on continuum mechanics and the Euler-Cauchy stress principle.</description>

      <title>The amplitude decay of a harmonic oscillator damped simultaneously by weak linear and nonlinear damping forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive approximate expressions for the amplitude decay of harmonic oscillations weakly damped by the simultaneous action of three different damping forces: force of constant magnitude, force linear in velocity, and force quadratic in velocity. Our derivation is based on a basic understanding of the undamped harmonic oscillator and the connection between the energy dissipation rate and the power of the total damping force. By comparing our approximate analytical solutions with the corresponding numerical solutions, we find that our solutions excellently describe the dynamics of the oscillator in the regime of weak damping by combinations of these three forces for an experimentally relevant range of corresponding damping constants. The physical concepts and mathematical techniques we employ are suitable for undergraduate physics teaching.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Recirculation Flow Pattern Induced by Nanosecond Discharges and Criterion for its Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium plasmas generated by spark discharges induce chemical, thermal, and flow dynamic effects that are beneficial in many applications such as plasmalysis, plasma-assisted combustion, and plasma flow control. Among the flow dynamic effects generated by these discharges, vorticity is of particular interest because it enhances the mixing of the discharge products with the surrounding environment and accelerates the cooling of the kernel. This article provides a comprehensive examination of the vorticity produced by nanosecond discharges in air. Using computational fluid dynamic simulations of the blast wave resulting from energy deposition in the interelectrode volume during the nanosecond pulse, we analyze the various sources of vorticity during the post-discharge period. The non-uniform strength of the leading shock of the blast wave is found to be the primary promoter of vorticity. Other sources, such as the barocline torque, play a secondary role in explaining the overall recirculation pattern. In addition, the discharge cooling mechanisms are also investigated. The cooling regimes and their efficiencies are classified according to the discharge parameters, such as the inter-electrode gap, the initial kernel temperature, or the frequency of repetitive pulses. Finally, a physics-based, non-dimensional number PI* , equal to the ratio of the initial kernel temperature to the ambient temperature, is introduced. A numerical analysis shows that the transition between the recirculating and non-recirculating flow regimes occurs for PI* on the order of 10. This criterion is validated against experimental and numerical results from the literature.</description>

      <title>Elastically induced phase-shift and birefringence in optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute how elastic deformations of optical fibers affect light propagation therein. Specifically, we consider differences in wave-guiding properties of straight fibers subject to different external temperatures, pressures, and gravitational fields. This is done by solving, perturbatively to first order, the Maxwell equations in deformed and anisotropic fibers using a multiple-scales approximation scheme. We derive explicit expressions for the induced phase shift and birefringence. The phase shift can be expressed in terms of the average radial pressure, longitudinal tension, and change in temperature, while birefringence depends on the quadrupole of the external pressure distribution and the stresses on the axis of the fiber.</description>

      <title>The Verifications of No Bright and Dark Fringes In a Standing-wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04014v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After Wiener's experiment, it had been widely accepted that only electric-field was the fundamental-factor for optical interference and believed that there were alternating bright and dark fringes in a light standing-wave field which was formed by a pair of parallel light-beams traveling in mutually opposite directions. While being supplied to the bright fringes, the light-energy from the beams must pass across the dark fringes or across the electric-field nodes, so that the electric-field would not keep zero at the nodes. However, it was inconsistent with the characteristic of electric-field nodes at which the electric-field was zero anytime. Therefore, this naturally led to a presumption that there were no bright and dark interference-fringes in a standing-wave field, which was consistent with zero of the electromagnetic energy-flux-density in a standing-wave field. In this paper, it was fully verified from several aspects, including an ideal experiment, comparing a standing-wave with an LC circuit, a group of experiments and theoretical deductions of formulas. An inclination factor was introduced into the previous common formula of two-beams-interference to rectify it back to the original meaning of its initial definition by energy-flux-density rather than electric-field energy-density. Given the angle between the two-beams to be 180 degrees as a validation, it was verified by the corrected formula that the light-intensities of the bright interference-fringes in a standing-wave were equal to zero. i.e., no interference-fringes existed in a standing-wave field.Thus, instead of electric-field energy-density alone from Wiener's conclusions, interference-energy-flux density was the fundamental-factor to form interference-fringes. The magnetic-field vector acts the same role as the electric-field vector on light interacting with substance.</description>
