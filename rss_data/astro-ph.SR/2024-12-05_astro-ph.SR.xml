      <title>Constraining differential rotation in gamma Doradus stars from inertial dips properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of dips in the gravity modes period spacing versus period diagram of gamma Doradus stars is now well established by recent asteroseismic studies. Such Lorentzian-shaped inertial dips arise from the interaction of gravito-inertial modes in the radiative envelope of intermediate-mass main sequence stars with pure inertial modes in their convective core. They allow to study stellar internal properties. This window on stellar internal dynamics is extremely valuable in the context of the understanding of angular momentum transport inside stars, since it allows us to probe rotation in their core. We investigate the signature and the detectability of a differential rotation between the convective core and the near-core region inside gamma Doradus stars from the inertial dip properties. We study the coupling between gravito-inertial modes in the radiative zone and pure inertial modes in the convective core in the sub-inertial regime, allowing for a two-zones differential rotation from the two sides of the boundary. Taking a bi-layer rotation profile, we derive the wave equations in the convective core and the radiative envelope. We solve the coupling equation numerically and match the result to an analytical derivation of the Lorentzian dip. We then use typical values of measured near-core rotation and buoyancy travel time to infer ranges of parameters for which differential core to near-core rotation would be detectable in current Kepler data. We show that increasing the convective core rotation with respect to the near-core rotation leads to a shift of the period of the observed dip to lower periods. In addition, the dip gets deeper and thinner as the convective core rotation increases. We demonstrate that such a signature is detectable in Kepler data, given appropriate dip parameter ranges and near-core structural properties.</description>

      <title>The total mass of the close, double degenerate (DA+DQ) system NLTT~16249</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the binary and stellar properties of the double-degenerate system NLTT 16249. An analysis of new echelle spectra, supported by a joint study of a DQZ velocity template NLTT 44303, confirms the orbital period and constrains the mass ratio revealing a carbon-polluted DQ white dwarf that is up to ~6 percent more massive than its hydrogen-rich DA companion. Our new model atmosphere analysis of the DA and DQ components, constrained by an accurate Gaia parallax measurement that places the binary at a distance of 57.8 pc, reveals lower mass and temperature than previously estimated for both components, but with higher carbon and nitrogen abundances in the DQ atmosphere. The two components are nearly coeval and could have been generated following a single common envelope event.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Topology of quiet-Sun Ellerman bombs and associated Ultraviolet brightenings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quiet-Sun Ellerman bombs (QSEBs) are small-scale magnetic reconnection events in the lower atmosphere of the quiet Sun. Recent work has shown that a small percentage of them can occur co-spatially and co-temporally to ultraviolet (UV) brightenings in the transition region. We aim to understand how the magnetic topologies associated with closely occurring QSEBs and UV brightenings can facilitate energy transport and connect these events. We used high-resolution H-beta observations from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) and detected QSEBs using k-means clustering. We obtained the magnetic field topology from potential field extrapolations using spectro-polarimetric data in the photospheric Fe I 6173 A line. To detect UV brightenings, we used coordinated and co-aligned data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and imposed a threshold of 5 sigma above the median background on the (IRIS) 1400 A slit-jaw image channel. We identify four distinct magnetic configurations that associate QSEBs with UV brightenings, including a simple dipole configuration and more complex fan-spine topologies with a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic null point. In the fan-spine topology, the UV brightenings occur near the 3D null point, while QSEBs can be found close to the footpoints of the outer spine, the inner spine, and the fan surface. We find that the height of the 3D null varies between 0.2 Mm to 2.6 Mm, depending on the magnetic field strength in the region. We note that some QSEBs and UV brightenings, though occurring close to each other, are not topologically connected with the same reconnection process. We find that the energy released during QSEBs falls in the range of 10^23 to 10^24 ergs. This study shows that magnetic connectivity and topological features, like 3D null points, are crucial in linking QSEBs in the lower atmosphere with UV brightenings in the transition region.</description>

      <title>The Variable Sources in the Gaia archive</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the core of the Gaia mission is a multi-epoch survey consisting of astrometric, photometric, spectrophotometric, and spectroscopic measurements. The astrometric time series provides parallaxes and proper motions, along with information on astrometric binary systems. The photometric time series offers a means to investigate the variability of the sources. Due to their whole-sky, multi-epoch nature, multiple instruments, their magnitude range covering 21 magnitudes, and their remarkable photometric precision, these data allow us to describe the variability of celestial phenomena in an unprecedented manner. For the third Gaia Data Release (DR3), the data collection spanned 34 months, with a median number of field-of-view measurements in the G band of about 44, reaching up to 270. At publication time, DR3 delivered the largest collection of variable sources with an associated classification across the entire sky. All these sources have their $G$, $G_{BP}$, $G_{RP}$ epoch data published and accessible in the Gaia ESA archive. In summary, there are 10.5 million variable sources, including 9.5 million variable stars and 1 million QSOs. Additionally, 2.5 million galaxies were identified thanks to spurious variability caused by the non-axisymmetric nature of galaxies and the way Gaia collects data. Moreover, all the epoch data and time series of nearly 1.3 million sources in a pencil beam around the Andromeda galaxy are published, regardless of their status (constant or variable); This dataset is known as the Gaia Andromeda Photometric Survey. We also introduce the citizen science project, GaiaVari to classify variable stars, the Focused Product Release delivered on October 10, 2023. In the future, DR4 will cover 66 months, and we hope DR5 will have accumulated 10.5 years of data.</description>

      <title>Prospects for gamma-ray emission from magnetar regions in CTAO observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent multi-wavelength observations have highlighted magnetars as significant sources of cosmic rays, particularly through their gamma-ray emissions. This study examines three magnetar regions - CXOU J171405.7-31031, Swift J1834-0846, and SGR 1806-20 - known for emitting detectable electromagnetic signals. We assess the detectability of these regions using the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) by conducting an ON/OFF spectral analysis and compare the expected results with existing observations. Our findings indicate that CTAO will detect gamma-ray emissions from these three magnetar regions with significantly reduced emission flux errors compared to current instruments. In special, the study shows that the CXOUJ1714-3810 and SwiftJ1834-0846 magnetar regions can be observed by the full southern and northern CTAO arrays in just five hours of observation, with mean significances above $10 \,\sigma$ and $30 \,\sigma$, respectively. This paper discusses the regions analyzed, presents key results, and concludes with insights drawn from the study.</description>

      <title>Difficulties of two exploding white dwarfs to account for type Ia supernovae with bimodal nebular emission profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a simple dynamical scheme to simulate the ejecta of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) scenarios with two exploding white dwarfs (WDs) and find that the velocity distribution of the ejecta has difficulties accounting for bimodal emission line profiles with a large separation between the two emission peaks. The essence of the dynamical code is in including the fact that the ejecta does not leave the system instantaneously. We find that the final separation velocity between the centers of masses of the two WDs' ejecta is ~80% of the pre-explosion WDs' orbital velocity, i.e., we find separation velocities of 4200-5400 km/s for two WDs of masses M1=M2=0.94 Mo. The lower separation velocities we find challenge scenarios with two exploding WDs to explain bimodal emission line profiles with observed velocity separations of up to ~7000 km/s. Only the mass in the ejecta of one WD with an explosion velocity lower than the separation velocity contributes to one peak of the bimodal profile; this is the inner ejecta. We find the inner ejecta to be only &lt;15% of the ejecta mass in energetic explosions. Less energetic explosions yield higher inner mass but lower separation velocities. We encourage searching for alternative explanations of bimodal line profiles.</description>

      <title>Energy Dissipation in Strong Collisionless Shocks: The Crucial Role of Ion-to-Electron Scale Separation in Particle-in-Cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy dissipation in collisionless shocks is a key mechanism in various astrophysical environments. Its non-linear nature complicates analytical understanding and necessitate Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. This study examines the impact of reducing the ion-to-electron mass ratio ($m_r$), to decrease computational cost, on energy partitioning in 1D3V (one spatial and three velocity-space dimensions) PIC simulations of strong, non-relativistic, parallel electron-ion collisionless shocks using the SHARP code. We compare simulations with a reduced mass ratio ($m_r = 100$) to those with a realistic mass ratio ($m_r = 1836$) for shocks with high ($\mathcal{M}_A = 21.3$) and low ($\mathcal{M}_A = 5.3$) Alfv$\acute{\text{e}}$n Mach numbers. Our findings show that the mass ratio significantly affects particle acceleration and thermal energy dissipation. At high $\mathcal{M}_A$, a reduced mass ratio leads to more efficient electron acceleration and an unrealistically high ion flux at higher momentum. At low $\mathcal{M}_A$, it causes complete suppression of electron acceleration, whereas the realistic mass ratio enables efficient electron acceleration. The reduced mass ratio also results in excessive electron heating and lower heating in downstream ions at both Mach numbers, with slightly more magnetic field amplification at low $\mathcal{M}_A$. Consequently, the electron-to-ion temperature ratio is high at low $\mathcal{M}_A$ due to reduced ion heating and remains high at high $\mathcal{M}_A$ due to increased electron heating. In contrast, simulations with the realistic $m_r$ show that the ion-to-electron temperature ratio is independent of the upstream magnetic field, a result not observed in reduced $m_r$ simulations.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling of thermal dust polarization from aligned grains in the envelope of evolved stars with updated POLARIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are thought to influence the formation and evolution of circumstellar envelopes around evolved stars. Thermal dust polarization from aligned grains is a promising tool for probing magnetic fields and dust properties in these environments; however, a quantitative study on the dependence of thermal dust polarization on the physical properties of dust and magnetic fields for these circumstellar environments is still lacking. In this paper, we first perform the numerical modeling of thermal dust polarization in the IK Tau envelope using the magnetically enhanced radiative torque (MRAT) alignment mechanism implemented in our updated POLARIS code, accounting for the effect of grain drift relative to the gas. Despite experiencing grain drift and high gas density $n_{\rm gas} &gt; 10^6\,\rm cm^{-3}$, the minimum grain size required for efficient MRAT alignment of silicate grains is $\sim 0.007 - 0.05\,\rm\mu m$ due to strong stellar radiation fields. Ordinary paramagnetic grains can achieve perfect alignment by MRAT in the inner envelope of $r &lt; 500\,\rm au$ due to stronger magnetic fields of $B\sim10$ mG - 1G, producing the polarization degree of $\sim10\%$. The polarization degree can be enhanced to $\sim20-40\%$ for superparamagnetic grains with embedded iron inclusions. The magnetic field geometry affects the resulting polarization degree due to the projection effect. We investigate the effect of rotational disruption by RATs (RAT-D) and find that the RAT-D effect decreases the dust polarization degree due to the decrease in the maximum grain size. Our modeling results motivate further observational studies at far-infrared/sub-millimeter to constrain the properties of magnetic fields and dust in evolved star's envelopes.</description>

      <title>Mass Ratio Distribution of Hierarchical Triple Systems from the LAMOST-MRS Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hierarchical triple-star systems consists of three components organised into an inner binary ($M_{1}$,$M_{2}$) and a more distant outer tertiary ($M_{3}$) star. The LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey (LAMOST-MRS) has offered a great sample for the study of triple system populations. We used the Peak Amplitude Ratio (PAR) method to obtain the mass ratio ($q_\mathrm{{in}}$, $q_\mathrm{{out}}$) of a triple system from its normalised spectrum. By calculating Cross-Correlation Function (CCF), we determined the correlation between the mass ratio $q_\mathrm{{out}}$ ($M_{3}$/($M_{1}$+$M_{2}$)) and the amplitude ratio ($A_{3}$/($A_{1}$+$A_{2}$)). We derived $q_\mathrm{{in}}$ of $0.5-1.0$ and $q_\mathrm{{out}}$ between 0.2 and 0.8. By fitting a power-law function of the corrected $q_\mathrm{{in}}$ distribution, the $\gamma_\mathrm{{in}}$ are estimated to be $-0.654\pm2.915$, $4.304\pm1.125$ and $11.371\pm1.309$ for A, F and G type stars. The derived $\gamma_\mathrm{{in}}$-values increase as the mass decrease, indicating that less massive stars are more likely to have companion stars with similar masses. By fitting a power-law function of the corrected $q_\mathrm{{out}}$ distribution, the ${\gamma_\mathrm{{out}}}$ are estimated to be $-2.016\pm0.172$, $-1.962\pm0.853$ and $-1.238\pm0.141$ for G, F and A type stars, respectively. The ${\gamma_\mathrm{{out}}}$-values show a trend of growth toward lower primary star masses.</description>

      <title>A gravitational wave detectable candidate Type Ia supernova progenitor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae, critical for studying cosmic expansion, arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs, but their precise progenitor pathways remain unclear. Growing evidence supports the ``double-degenerate'' scenario, where two white dwarfs interact. The absence of other companion types capable of explaining the observed Ia rate, along with observations of hyper-velocity white dwarfs interpreted as surviving companions of such systems provide compelling evidence in favor of this scenario. Upcoming millihertz gravitational wave observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are expected to detect thousands of double-degenerate systems, though the most compact known candidate Ia progenitors produce only marginally detectable gravitational wave signals. Here, we report observations of ATLAS J1138-5139, a binary white dwarf system with an orbital period of 28 minutes. Our analysis reveals a 1 solar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting from a helium-core white dwarf. Given its mass, the accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarf is poised to trigger a typical-luminosity Type Ia supernova within a few million years, or to evolve into a stably mass-transferring AM CVn system. ATLAS J1138-5139 provides a rare opportunity to calibrate binary evolution models by directly comparing observed orbital parameters and mass transfer rates closer to merger than any previously identified candidate Type Ia progenitor. Its compact orbit ensures detectability by LISA, demonstrating the potential of millihertz gravitational wave observatories to reveal a population of Type Ia progenitors on a Galactic scale, paving the way for multi-messenger studies offering insights into the origins of these cosmologically significant explosions.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a Sharp CO Snowline Transition in a Protoplanetary Disk and Implications for Millimeter-wave Observations of CO Isotopologues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of CO isotopologue emission from protoplanetary disks at millimeter wavelengths are a powerful tool for probing the CO snowline, an important marker for disk chemistry, and also for estimating total disk gas mass, a key quantity for planet formation. We use simple models to demonstrate that the vertical thickness of an isothermal layer around the disk midplane has important effects on the CO column density radial profile, with a thick layer producing a sharp CO snowline transition. We simulate ngVLA and ALMA images to show that this sharp change in CO column density can be detected in the derivative of the radial profile of emission from optically thin CO isotopologue lines. We apply this method to archival ALMA observations of the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 in the C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines to identify a sharp CO snowline transition near 80 au (0.8 arcsec at 101 pc), and show the CO column density decreases by more than a factor of 20. This finding is consistent with previous inferences from the steep rise of N$_2$H$^+$ emission, which marks the location where CO depletes. We also demonstrate that the disk's thermal structure introduces a significant systematic uncertainty to estimates of total disk gas mass derived from these lines. The substantial improvement in sensitivity envisioned for the ngVLA over ALMA for observations of ground-state lines of CO isotopologues has the potential to extend this approach to a much larger population of disks.</description>

      <title>Association between Recurrent Novae and Nova Super-Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nova super-remnants (NSRs) are substantially extended structures (up to ~130 parsecs across) encompassing recurrent novae. NSRs grow as a result of frequent nova eruptions transporting vast quantities of the locally surrounding interstellar medium away from the binary system over many millennia into a thin high-density shell, as the central white dwarf grows towards the Chandrasekhar limit. The prototypical NSR, first identified as such in 2014, is situated in the Andromeda Galaxy and belongs to the annually erupting nova, M31N 2008-12a (or '12a'). In this short review, modelling of evolving NSRs (including the 12a NSR) will be outlined as motivation towards searching for more of these phenomena in the Galaxy and beyond. The latest developments in this upcoming subfield of nova research will then be presented including the discovery of two new Galactic nova super-remnants (and their consequent modelling) and the first survey undertaken with the sole purpose of finding NSRs in the Andromeda Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>
