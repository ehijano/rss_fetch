      <title>Characterising memory in infinite games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12044v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with games of infinite duration played over potentially infinite graphs. Recently, Ohlmann (LICS 2022) presented a characterisation of objectives admitting optimal positional strategies, by means of universal graphs: an objective is positional if and only if it admits well-ordered monotone universal graphs. We extend Ohlmann's characterisation to encompass (finite or infinite) memory upper bounds.
  We prove that objectives admitting optimal strategies with $\varepsilon$-memory less than $m$ (a memory that cannot be updated when reading an $\varepsilon$-edge) are exactly those which admit well-founded monotone universal graphs whose antichains have size bounded by $m$. We also give a characterisation of chromatic memory by means of appropriate universal structures. Our results apply to finite as well as infinite memory bounds (for instance, to objectives with finite but unbounded memory, or with countable memory strategies).
  We illustrate the applicability of our framework by carrying out a few case studies, we provide examples witnessing limitations of our approach, and we discuss general closure properties which follow from our results.</description>

      <title>The Identity Problem in virtually solvable matrix groups over algebraic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tits alternative states that a finitely generated matrix group either contains a nonabelian free subgroup $F_2$, or it is virtually solvable. This paper considers two decision problems in virtually solvable matrix groups: the Identity Problem (does a given finitely generated subsemigroup contain the identity matrix?), and the Group Problem (is a given finitely generated subsemigroup a group?). We show that both problems are decidable in virtually solvable matrix groups over the field of algebraic numbers $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. Our proof also extends the decidability result for nilpotent groups by Bodart, Ciobanu, Metcalfe and Shaffrir, and the decidability result for metabelian groups by Dong (STOC'24). Since the Identity Problem and the Group Problem are known to be undecidable in matrix groups containing $F_2 \times F_2$, our result significantly reduces the decidability gap for both decision problems.</description>
