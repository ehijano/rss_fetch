      <title>Towards Accurate Asteroseismic Masses for Luminous Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismology, the study of stellar oscillations, provides high-precision measurements of masses and ages for red giants. Scaling relations are a powerful tool for measuring fundamental stellar parameters, and the derived radii are in good agreement with fundamental data for low-luminosity giants. However, for luminous red giant branch (RGB) stars, there are clear systematic offsets. In APOKASC-3, the third joint spectroscopic and asteroseismic catalog for evolved stars in the Kepler fields, we tied asteroseismic radii to a reference system based on Gaia astrometry by introducing correction factors. This work proposes an alternative formulation of the correction scheme, which substantially reduces the sensitivity of the results to the technique used to infer mean density from frequency spacings. Compared to APOKASC-3, our adjusted correction scheme also reduces fractional discrepancies in median masses and ages of lower RGB and upper RGB within the $\alpha$-rich population from $6.65\%$ to $1.72\%$ and from $-21.81\%$ to $-9.55\%$, respectively. For the $\alpha$-poor population, the corrected mass scale leads to an improved agreement between theory and observation of the surface carbon-to-nitrogen abundance ratio, a significant diagnostic of the first dredge-up.</description>

      <title>Role of CME clusters and CME-CME interactions in producing sustained $\gamma$-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast (V$_{\rm CME}$&gt;1000${\rm \,km\,s^{-1}}$) coronal mass ejections (CMEs) capable of accelerating protons beyond 300MeV are thought to trigger hours-long sustained $\gamma$-ray emission (SGRE) after the impulsive flare phase. Meanwhile, CME-CME interactions can cause enhanced proton acceleration, increasing the fluxes of solar energetic particles. This study explores the role of fast CME interactions in SGRE production during CME clusters, which we define as a series of CMEs linked to &gt;C-class flares with waiting times &lt;$\,$1$\,$day from the same active region (AR). We focus on clusters in major CME-productive ARs (major ARs), by defining a major AR as one that produced &gt;$\,$1 CME-associated major (&gt;M-class) flare. The study identified 76 major ARs between 2011 and 2019, of which 12 produced all SGRE events. SGRE-producing ARs exhibit higher median values for the speed of their fastest CMEs (2013 vs. 775${\rm \,km\,s^{-1}}$) and the class of their strongest flares (X1.8 vs. M5.8), compared to SGRE-lacking ARs. They also produced relatively faster CMEs (median speed: 1418 vs. 1206.5${\rm \,km\,s^{-1}}$), with the SGRE-associated CMEs occurring during periods of higher CME rates than typical fast CME epochs. Twelve of 22 (54.5%) SGRE events and 5 of 7 (71.4%) long-duration (&gt;$10\,$h) SGRE events occurred during CME clusters, with high chances of CME-CME interactions. A case study on very active major ARs showed that all SGRE-associated CMEs with V$_{\rm CME}\lesssim$ 2000${\rm \,km\,s^{-1}}$ underwent CME-CME interactions within 10$\,$R$_\odot$, while SGRE-associated CMEs faster than 3000${\rm \,km\,s^{-1}}$ did not undergo interactions.</description>

      <title>Entering the Wind Roche Lobe Overflow realm in Symbiotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a suite of dynamical simulations designed to explore the orbital and accretion properties of compact (2--7 AU) symbiotic systems, focusing on wind accretion, drag forces, and tidal interactions. Using three levels of physical complexity, we model systems of accreting white dwarfs (WDs) with masses of 0.7, 1.0, and 1.2 M$_\odot$ orbiting evolving Solar-like stars with 1, 2, and 3 M$_\odot$. We show that systems alternate between standard wind accretion and Wind Roche Lobe Overflow (WRLO) regimes during periods of high mass-loss rate experienced by the donor star (the peak of red giant phase and/or thermal pulses). For some configurations, the standard wind accretion has mass accretion efficiencies similar to those obtained by WRLO regime. Tidal forces play a key role in compact systems, leading to orbital shrinkage and enhanced accretion efficiency. We find that systems with high-mass WDs ($\geq 1$ M$_\odot$) and massive donors (2--3 M$_\odot$) are the only ones to reach the Chandrasekhar limit. Interestingly, the majority of our simulations reach the Roche lobe overflow condition that is not further simulated given the need of more complex hydrodynamical simulations. Our analysis shows that increasing physical realism, by including drag and tides, systematically leads to more compact final orbital configurations. Comparison with compact known symbiotic systems seems to suggest that they are very likely experiencing orbital decay produced by tidal forces.</description>

      <title>Large Model Driven Solar Activity AI Forecaster: A Scalable Dual Data-Model Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar activity drives space weather, affecting Earth's magnetosphere and technological infrastructure, which makes accurate solar flare forecasting critical. Current space weather models under-utilize multi-modal solar data, lack iterative enhancement via expert knowledge, and rely heavily on human forecasters under the Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action (OODA) paradigm. Here we present the "Solar Activity AI Forecaster", a scalable dual data-model driven framework built on foundational models, integrating expert knowledge to autonomously replicate human forecasting tasks with quantifiable outputs. It is implemented in the OODA paradigm and comprises three modules: a Situational Perception Module that generates daily solar situation awareness maps by integrating multi-modal observations; In-Depth Analysis Tools that characterize key solar features (active regions, coronal holes, filaments); and a Flare Prediction Module that forecasts strong flares for the full solar disk and active regions. Executed within a few minutes, the model outperforms or matches human forecasters in generalization across multi-source data, forecast accuracy, and operational efficiency. This work establishes a new paradigm for AI-based space weather forecasting, demonstrating AI's potential to enhance forecast accuracy and efficiency, and paving the way for autonomous operational forecasting systems.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Solar EUV Irradiance Using CaII K Images and SOHO/SEM Data with Bayesian Deep Learning and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiance plays a crucial role in heating the Earth's ionosphere, thermosphere, and mesosphere, affecting atmospheric dynamics over varying time scales. Although significant effort has been spent studying short-term EUV variations from solar transient events, there is little work to explore the long-term evolution of the EUV flux over multiple solar cycles. Continuous EUV flux measurements have only been available since 1995, leaving significant gaps in earlier data. In this study, we propose a Bayesian deep learning model, named SEMNet, to fill the gaps. We validate our approach by applying SEMNet to construct SOHO/SEM EUV flux measurements in the period between 1998 and 2014 using CaII K images from the Precision Solar Photometric Telescope. We then extend SEMNet through transfer learning to reconstruct solar EUV irradiance in the period between 1950 and 1960 using CaII K images from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory. Experimental results show that SEMNet provides reliable predictions along with uncertainty bounds, demonstrating the feasibility of CaII K images as a robust proxy for long-term EUV fluxes. These findings contribute to a better understanding of solar influences on Earth's climate over extended periods.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) XXII: Keplerian disk, disk structures and jets/outflows in the Class 0 protostar IRAS 04166+2706</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ALMA observations of the Class 0 protostar IRAS 04166+2706, obtained as part of the ALMA large program Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). These observations were made in the 1.3 mm dust continuum and molecular lines at angular resolutions of $\sim 0.05''$ ($\sim 8$ au) and $\sim 0.16''$ ($\sim25$ au), respectively. The continuum emission shows a disk-like structure with a radius of $\sim22$ au. Kinematical analysis of $^{13}$CO(2-1), C$^{18}$O(2-1), H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$-2$_{0,2}$), CH$_3$OH (4$_2$-3$_1$) emission demonstrates that these molecular lines trace the infalling-rotating envelope and possibly a Keplerian disk, enabling us to estimate the protostar mass to be $0.15 \rm{M_\odot} &lt; \rm{M_\star} &lt; 0.39 M_\odot$. The dusty disk is found to exhibit a brightness asymmetry along its minor axis in the continuum emission, probably caused by a flared distribution of the dust and the high optical depth of the dust emission. In addition, the CO(2-1) and SiO(5-4) emissions show knotty and wiggling motions in the jets. Our high angular resolution observations revealed the most recent mass ejection events, which have occurred within the last $\sim 25$ years.</description>

      <title>The role of rotation on the yields of the two {\gamma}-ray emitters 26Al and 60Fe ejected by massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the observed 60Fe/26Al flux ratio provided by the SPectrometer on INTEGRAL satellite (0.24 +- 0.04) can be reproduced only if rotation is taken into account in the computation of the stellar models. Predictions from non-rotating stellar models yield to a significantly lower ratio (0.062), which is incompatible with the observed value. The adopted models and the associated yields are based on a combination of models already published by Limongi &amp; Chieffi (2018) complemented by additional ones fully consistent with the original grid, allowing a finer resolution in the initial rotational velocity distribution.</description>

      <title>The impact of metallicity on the period-luminosity relation of Mira variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolution of stars with initial masses $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}=1.1M_\odot$, $1.3M_\odot$, $1.5M_\odot$ and relative mass abundances of metals $Z=0.006$ and 0.02 was computed from the main sequence up to the final AGB stage. Selected models of evolutionary sequences were used as initial conditions for solution of the equations of hydrodynamics describing pulsations of red giants, whereas for each evolutionary sequence of Mira variables pulsating in the fundamental mode we determined the theoretical period-luminosity relation. A change in the metal abundance is shown to substantially affect the period-luminosity relation because of significant growth of the slope with decreasing $Z$. In particular, Mira variables of the LMC ($Z=0.006$) are brighter by 0.2-0.5 mag than galactic Mira variables ($Z=0.02$) with same pulsation periods. The low boundary of fundamental mode pulsations changes from $\Pi\approx 70$ day for $Z=0.02$ to $\Pi\approx 120$ day for $Z=0.006$.</description>

      <title>Solar Flux Atlases: The new HARPS-N Quiet Sun Benchmark and Ca II H &amp; K Lines Continuum Normalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Solar flux atlases observe the spatially integrated light from the Sun, treating it as a star. They are fundamental tools for gaining insight into the composition of the Sun and other stars, and are utilized as reference material for a wide range of solar applications such as stellar chemical abundances, atmospheric physics, stellar activity, and radial velocity signals. Aims. We provide a detailed comparison of solar activity in some of the well-known solar atlases against the new High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) Quiet Sun (QS) and measured activity (MA) atlases that are published, for the first time, in this work. Methods. Ten of the widely used individual spectral lines from each flux atlas were selected to compare solar activity using three methods: 1) Equivalent Widths 2) Activity number, a novel activity measure which we introduce in this work. 3) Bisectors and radial velocity. Results. The significantly smaller activity measured in the MA atlas compared to the other atlases, relative to the QS atlas, underscores the dominance of instrumental effects over solar activity in their impact on spectral lines, which cannot be corrected through simple line convolution to match resolutions of other atlases. Additionally, our investigation unexpectedly revealed a substantial intensity shift in the Ca ii H &amp; K lines of other atlases compared to our HARPS-N atlases, likely caused by assumptions in normalisation techniques used in the early Kitt Peak atlases. Conclusions. With an average spot number of zero, our QS atlas is well suited to serve as an absolute benchmark atlas representative of solar minimum for the visible spectrum that other atlases can be compared against. Our recommendations are 1) publication of a detailed log along with the observations, to include exact dates and indications of solar activity...</description>

      <title>A Data-constrained Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of Successive X-class Flares in Solar Active Region 13842. II. Dynamics of the Solar Eruption Associated with the X9.0 Solar Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active region NOAA 13842 produced two successive solar flares: an X7.1-class flare on October 1, 2024, and an X9.0-class flare on October 3, 2024. This study continues our previous simulation work that successfully reproduced the X7.1-class solar flare (Matsumoto et al. 2025). In this study, we performed a data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation using the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) as the initial condition to investigate the X9.0-class solar flare. The NLFFF showed the sheared field lines, resulting in the tether-cutting reconnection, the magnetic flux ropes (MFRs), and eventually led to eruption. The magnetic reconnection during the pre-eruption phase plays a critical role in accelerating the subsequent eruption, which is driven by torus instability and magnetic reconnection. Furthermore, our simulation results are consistent with several observational features associated with the X9.0 flare. This simulation could reproduce diverse phenomena associated with the X9.0 flare, including the tether-cutting reconnection, the flare ribbons and the flare loops, the transverse field enhancement, and the remote brightening away from the flare ribbons. However, the initial trigger, magnetic flux emergence, was inferred from observations rather than explicitly modeled, and future comprehensive simulations should incorporate this mechanism directly.</description>

      <title>Virtual Observatory and machine learning for the study of low-mass objects in photometric and spectroscopic surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass objects are ubiquitous in our Galaxy. Their low temperature provides them with complex atmospheres characterised by the presence of strong molecular absorption bands which, together with their faintness, have made their accurate characterisation a great challenge for astronomers over the last decades. M dwarfs account for 75% of the census of stars within 10 pc of the Sun, and their suitability as targets in the search for Earth-like planets has led many research groups to focus on the study of these objects, which is crucial for the understanding of the structure and kinematics of our Galaxy. Very low-mass stars and substellar objects with spectral types M7 or later, including the extended L, T, and Y spectral types, constitute the domain of ultracool dwarfs. The study of these objects, discovered definitively in 1995, is key for understanding the boundary between stellar and substellar objects and promises to experience a quantum leap thanks to the characteristics of new-generation surveys such as Euclid or LSST.
  Data analysis in the field of observational astronomy has undergone a paradigm shift during the last decades driven by an exponential growth in the volume and complexity of available data. In this revolution, the Virtual Observatory has become a cornerstone providing a system that fosters interoperability between astronomical archives around the world. In response to this growth in data complexity, the astronomical community has increasingly adopted machine learning techniques for the development of scalable, automated solutions.
  This thesis explores the discovery and characterisation of M dwarfs and ultracool dwarfs, using data-driven approaches supported by Virtual Observatory technologies and protocols. We rely on a variety of machine and deep learning techniques to develop flexible methodologies aimed at advancing our understanding of low-mass objects.</description>

      <title>Differential rotation of solar {\alpha}-sunspots and implications for stellar light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential rotation is a key driver of magnetic activity and dynamo processes in the Sun and other stars, especially as the rate differs across the solar layers, but also in active regions. We aim to accurately quantify the velocity at which round {\alpha}-spots traverse the solar disk as a function of their latitude, and compare these rates to those of the quiet-Sun and other sunspot types. We then extend this work to other stars and investigate how differential rotation affects the modulation of stellar light curves by introducing a generalized stellar differential rotation law. We manually identify and track 105 {\alpha}-sunspots in the 6173 {\AA} continuum using the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We measure the angular velocities of each spot through center-of-mass and geometric ellipse-fitting methods to derive a differential rotation law for round {\alpha}-sunspots. Results. Using over a decade of HMI data we derive a differential rotation law for {\alpha}-sunspots. When compared to previous measurements we find that {\alpha}-sunspots rotate 1.56% faster than the surrounding quiet-Sun, but 1.35% slower than the average sunspot population. This supports the hypothesis that the depth at which flux tubes are anchored influences sunspot motions across the solar disk. We extend this analysis to other stars by introducing a scaling law based on the rotation rates of these stars. This scaling law is implemented into the Stellar Activity Grid for Exoplanets (SAGE) code to illustrate how differential rotation alters the photometric modulation of active stars.

      <title>The Yin-Yang Magnetic Flux Eruption (Yin-Yang-MFE) Code: A Global Corona Magnetohydrodynamic Code with the Yin-Yang grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the numerical algorithms of a global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code utilizing the Yin-Yang grid, called the Yin-Yang Magnetic Flux Eruption (Yin-Yang-MFE) code, suitable for modeling the large-scale dynamical processes of the solar corona and the solar wind. It is a single-fluid MHD code taking into account the non-adiabatic effects of the solar corona, including the electron heat conduction, optically thin radiative cooling, and empirical coronal heating. We describe the numerical algorithms used to solve the set of MHD equations (with the semi-relativistic correction, or the Boris correction) in each of the partial spherical shell Yin Yang domains, and the method for updating the boundary conditions in the ghost-zones of the two overlapping domains with the code parallelized with the message passing interface (MPI). We validate the code performance with a set of standard test problems, and finally present a solar wind solution with a dipolar magnetic flux distribution at the solar surface, representative of solar minimum configuration.</description>

      <title>The Impact of External Radiation on the Inner Disk Chemistry of Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of young stars hosting planet-forming disks exist within clustered environments, like the Orion Nebula, implying that seemingly `extreme' UV environments (10^4 G_0 and above) are not so atypical in the context of planet formation. Using thermo-chemical modeling, we explore how the temperature and chemistry within a protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star is impacted by the surrounding UV environment. The disk becomes hotter due to heating by photodissociation of molecules, photoelectric heating, H_2, and atomic processes and as a result the area in which molecules exist in the ice-phase shrinks, being pushed both downward and inward. Beyond 1AU the chemistry changes most significantly in a UV-rich background; the atmosphere becomes more H2O, OH, and atomic-rich. Hydrocarbons, however, reside primarily well within 1AU of the disk, thus their abundance and distribution is not impacted by the UV field, up to a 10^6 G0. The products of photodissociation and photochemistry are formed deeper into the disk with increasing UV background field strength beyond 1AU, impacting the chemistry near the midplane. Effectively a `reset' chemistry takes place, with an enhancement of atoms, simple molecules, and molecules in the gas-phase. Planets that form in highly irradiated regions will be exposed to a different chemical reservoir in the gas and ice-phases than that in an isolated disk, and the impact from the UV background should only be detectable in highly irradiated disks (~10^6 G_0).</description>

Abstract: We present new photometric observations of the core-collapse supernova SN 2023ixf occurred in M101, taken with the RC80 and BRC80 robotic telescopes in Hungary. The initial nickel mass from the late-phase bolometric light curve extending up to 400 days after explosion, is inferred as $M_{\rm Ni} = 0.046 \pm 0.007$ M$_\odot$. The comparison of the bolometric light curve with models from hydrodynamical simulations as well as semi-analytic radiative diffusion codes reveals a relatively low-mass ejecta of $M_{\rm ej} \lesssim 9$ M$_\odot$, contrary to SN~2017eaw, another H-rich core-collapse event, which had $M_{\rm ej} \gtrsim 15$ M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Millisecond Pulsars in M2: New discoveries and a detailed timing analysis</title>

Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) offer a unique environment for discovering and studying millisecond pulsars. In this paper, we present a multi-epoch search and detailed timing analysis of millisecond pulsars in the GC M2, using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope. We have discovered two new binary millisecond pulsars in M2, designated M2F and M2G, respectively. We provide measurements of the emission properties of all known pulsars in M2, including their polarization profiles, rotation measures, flux densities, scintillation characteristics, and so forth. In particular, we report the first rotation measure at the distance and direction of this cluster. Additionally, we report the first phase-coherent timing solutions for the M2 pulsars. From our Bayesian timing analysis, we have measured their spin and orbital parameters with high precision, including the advance of periastron for M2A and M2E indicating total system masses of 1.75(13) and 1.80(5) solar masses respectively. Using archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope, we have identified an optical counterpart of M2C, which is likely the white dwarf companion of the pulsar. By combining results from optical and radio observations, we have reconstructed the binary evolution track of this system and estimated the cooling age of the companion to be approximately 10\,Myr, making it the youngest white dwarf in any known GC binary pulsars. Furthermore, using the spin period derivatives of M2 pulsars, we have investigated the gravitational potential of the cluster and found that our results strongly support the latest central-stellar-velocity dispersion measurement in M2.</description>

      <title>Planets Around Solar Twins/Analogs (PASTA) II: chemical abundances, systematic offsets, and clues to planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Previous studies have suggested that the Sun is relatively depleted in refractory elements compared to other solar twins or analogs, potentially as a result of planet formation. However, such conclusions are often limited by inhomogeneous samples and a lack of direct comparison with stars known to host planets.
  Aims. We aim to perform a homogeneous and precise abundance analysis of solar twins and analogs that host planets, to investigate possible chemical signatures associated with planet formation.
  Methods. We obtain high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio Magellan/MIKE spectra for 25 solar-like stars, including 22 confirmed or candidate planet hosts and three comparison stars. Stellar parameters and elemental abundances for 23 elements (from C to Eu) are derived through a strict line-by-line differential analysis relative to the Sun.
  Results. Our sample spans [Fe/H] = -0.23 to +0.18 dex and includes 20 solar analogs, six of which are solar twins. Typical abundance uncertainties range from 0.01 to 0.05 dex for lighter elements (e.g., Fe, Si, C, O, Na) and up to 0.1 dex for neutron-capture elements. The Sun is consistently depleted in refractory elements relative to all solar analogs and twins, regardless of planet type. Stars hosting small planets tentatively show slightly stronger refractory element depletion than those hosting giant planets, though the difference is not yet statistically significant.
  Conclusions. We emphasize the need for strictly differential, line-by-line analyses relative to the Sun, as well as careful consideration of systematic differences between instruments, to ensure consistency and the homogeneity required to achieve our goals.</description>

      <title>A tunable Monte Carlo method for mixing correlated-k opacities. PRAS: polynomial reconstruction and sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately accounting for mixed-gas opacities is critical for radiative-transfer (RT) calculations in sub-stellar atmospheres. To produce the total k-coefficients of an arbitrary mixture of gases and their associated volume mixing ratios (VMRs), several methods are applied in the literature with various levels of overall accuracy and ease of computation. We propose a simple, tunable random overlap method, polynomial reconstruction and sampling (PRAS). PRAS is a Monte Carlo-based technique, sampling polynomial approximations of the opacity cumulative distribution function (CDF) in a wavelength band for each species requiring mixing. The method enables control over the end accuracy of the opacity mixture through choices in CDF fitting and number of random samples used in the mixing scheme. We find PRAS is typically as accurate, or more accurate, than other methods at recovering individual, pre-mixed k-coefficients. In an emission spectrum comparison test, PRAS, even with a small number of samples (100), is within ~2% of the reference 16+16 Legendre quadrature node random overlap with resorting and rebinning (RORR) results, and is typically more accurate than the 4+4 and 8+8 Legendre node schemes. In the vertical flux and heating rate tests, we also find that PRAS is generally more accurate than other schemes, and an improvement over the adaptive equivalent extinction (AEE) method. Overall, our current tests show PRAS is a generally viable alternative for the calculation of randomly overlapped opacities, especially in scenarios where increased accuracy of the RT calculation is required and when larger numbers of quadrature points are used. PRAS may therefore provide a benefit in performance and accuracy for high-precision retrieval modelling of JWST data.</description>

      <title>The reflex instability: exponential growth of a large-scale $m=1$ mode in astrophysical discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the finding of a linear, non-axisymmetric, global instability in gas discs around stars, which may be relevant to other astrophysical discs. It takes the form of an $m=1$ mode that grows in the disc density distribution while the star-barycentre distance rises exponentially with a characteristic timescale that is orders of magnitude longer than the orbital period. We present results of hydrodynamical simulations with various codes and numerical methods, using either barycentric or stellocentric reference frames, with or without the disc's self gravity: all simulations consistently show an unstable mode growing exponentially.
  The instability disappears if, and only if, the reflex motion of the star due to the disc's asymmetry is not taken into account in the simulations. For this reason we refer to this instability as the reflex instability. We identify a feedback loop as a possible origin, whereby the acceleration of the star excites the eccentricity of the disc, yielding an $m=1$ mode in the density distribution which, in turn, pulls the star. The growth timescale of the instability decreases with increasing disc mass and is a few hundred orbits for disc-to-star mass ratios of a few percent. If truly physical, and not due to a numerical artifact that would be common to all the codes we have employed, the reflex instability could have a dramatic impact on protoplanetary discs evolution and planetary formation.</description>

      <title>Magnetic, Kinetic, and Transition Regime: Spatially-Segregated Structure of Compressive MHD Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence is a complex physical process prevalent in modern physics, particularly in ionized environments like interstellar gas, where magnetic fields play a dynamic role. However, the precise influence of magnetic fields in such settings remains unclear. We employ the Alfv\'{e}n Mach number, ${M}_{\mathrm{A}} = \sqrt{E_{\mathrm{k}}/E_{\mathrm{B}}}$, to gauge the magnetic field's significance relative to turbulent motion, uncovering diverse interaction patterns. In the low-${M}_{\mathrm{A}}$ magnetic regime, the field is force-free, yet gas motion does not align with it. At intermediate ${M}_{\mathrm{A}}$ (magnetic-kinetic transition regime), velocity and magnetic fields show peak alignment, likely due to rapid relaxation. In the high-${M}_{\mathrm{A}}$ kinetic regime, both fields are irregular and unaligned. These regimes find observational counterparts in interstellar gas, highlighting the multifaceted nature of MHD turbulence and aiding future astrophysical interpretations.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Hubble and matter density parameters with and without modelling the CMB anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider constraints on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$ from: (i) the age of the Universe based on old stars and stellar populations in the Galactic disc and halo (Cimatti &amp; Moresco 2023); (ii) the turnover scale in the matter power spectrum, which tells us the cosmological horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality (Philcox et al. 2022); and (iii) the shape of the expansion history from supernovae (SNe) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) with no absolute calibration of either, a technique known as uncalibrated cosmic standards (UCS; Lin, Chen, &amp; Mack 2021). A narrow region is consistent with all three constraints just outside their $1\sigma$ uncertainties. Although this region is defined by techniques unrelated to the physics of recombination and the sound horizon then, the standard $Planck$ fit to the CMB anisotropies falls precisely in this region. This concordance argues against early-time explanations for the anomalously high local estimate of $H_0$ (the 'Hubble tension'), which can only be reconciled with the age constraint at an implausibly low $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$. We suggest instead that outflow from the local KBC supervoid (Keenan, Barger, &amp; Cowie 2013) inflates redshifts in the nearby universe and thus the apparent local $H_0$. Given the difficulties with solutions in the early universe, we argue that the most promising alternative to a local void is a modification to the expansion history at late times, perhaps due to a changing dark energy density.</description>

      <title>POSYDON Version 2: Population Synthesis with Detailed Binary-Evolution Simulations across a Cosmological Range of Metallicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether considering rare astrophysical events on cosmological scales or unresolved stellar populations, accurate models must account for the integrated contribution from the entire history of star formation upon which that population is built. Here, we describe the second version of POSYDON, an open-source binary population synthesis code based on extensive grids of detailed binary evolution models computed using the MESA code, which follows both stars' structures as a binary system evolves through its complete evolution from the zero-age main sequence, through multiple phases of mass transfer and supernovae, to their death as compact objects. To generate synthetic binary populations, POSYDON uses advanced methods to interpolate between our large, densely spaced grids of simulated binaries. In our updated version of POSYDON, we account for the evolution of stellar binaries across a cosmological range of metallicities, extending from $10^{-4}$ $Z_{\odot}$ to 2 $Z_{\odot}$, including grids specifically focused on the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (0.2 $Z_{\odot}$ and 0.45 $Z_{\odot}$). In addition to describing our model grids and detailing our methodology, we outline several improvements to POSYDON. These include the incorporation of single stars in stellar populations, a treatment for stellar mergers, and a careful modeling of "reverse-mass transferring" binaries in which a once-accreting star later becomes a donor star. Our simulations are focused on binaries with at least one high-mass component, such as those that host neutron stars and black holes, and we provide post-processing methods to account for the cosmological evolution of metallicity and star formation as well as rate calculations for transient events.</description>

      <title>ALMA chemical survey of disk-outflow sources in Taurus (ALMA-DOT) VII: the layered molecular outflow from HL Tau and its relationship with the ringed disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ringed disk around HL Tau stands out as the iconic signature of planet formation, but the origin of the substructures is still debated. The HL Tau system also drives a powerful bipolar wind, and we analyze its outermost component traced by CO emission, to determine the relationship of the flow with the disk and its substructures. We use ALMA observations of the ${}^{12}$CO (2-1) line at 1.3 mm, with 0.2 km/s and ~ 0.28" resolution, conducted within the ALMA-DOT project. The channel maps and position-velocity diagrams show a rich structure of concatenated bubble- and arc-shaped features, whose size and distance from the source increase with velocity. The superposition of the features generates the apparent conical shape. The tomographic reconstruction of the morphology and kinematics of the red-shifted lobe suggests the presence of distinct nested shells having higher velocity and steeper velocity gradient for shells closer to the axis, rotating in the same sense of the disk. Such configuration can be justified by different classes of models. In this paper we compare the derived wind parameters with the predictions of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk winds. Under this hypothesis, the launch radii of the three outermost shells are found to be at about the position of three adjacent dust rings in the disk at 58, 72 and 86 au. The wind may be capable of removing angular momentum from the outer disk, and we derive a magnetic lever arm of $\lambda \sim 4 - 5$, higher than that commonly adopted for MHD winds from these regions. Interpretations are discussed. The arrangement of the wind in nested shells with brighter emission rooted at the location of ring substructures could support the results of non-ideal MHD simulations according to which magnetic instabilities can generate the disk ring-gap system with a connected layered wind, alternatively to the action of yet undetected protoplanets.</description>

      <title>Polka-dotted Stars: a Hierarchical Model for Mapping Stellar Surfaces Using Occultation Light Curves and the Case of TOI-3884</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present StarryStarryProcess, a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for mapping stellar surfaces using exoplanet transit light curves. While previous methods relied solely on stellar rotational light curves -- which contain limited information about spot properties -- our approach leverages planetary transits as probes of stellar surfaces. When a planet crosses a spot during transit, it creates a distinctive change in the light curve that directly reveals spot properties. Our model integrates planetary transit modeling with stellar variability analysis by combining the spherical harmonic surface map representation from starry, the probabilistic approach to spot properties of StarryProcess, and a comprehensive transit model that accounts for spot-crossing events during transits. We demonstrate through synthetic data experiments that our model successfully recovers spot distributions, stellar orientation, and spot physical properties. We extend the framework to handle evolving stellar surfaces through time-dependent modeling. Applying our method to TESS observations of TOI-3884, we find evidence for high-latitude spot concentrations and significant spin-orbit misalignment. The transit-based approach overcomes fundamental limitations of previous models by providing constraints on spot properties that would remain hidden in the null space of rotational light curves alone. This methodology enables more accurate exoplanet characterization by disentangling stellar activity due to starspots from planetary signals while simultaneously providing insights into stellar magnetic activity patterns.

Abstract: We present Band 6 and Band 7 observations of 10 Lupus disks around M3-K6 stars from the ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks (AGE-PRO) Large Program. In addition to continuum emission in both bands, our Band 6 setup covers the $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}$, $\mathrm{{}^{13}CO}$ and $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 lines, while our Band 7 setup covers the $\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2 line. All of our sources are detected in $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}$ and $\mathrm{{}^{13}CO}$, 7 out of 10 are detected in $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$, and 3 are detected in $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$. We find strong correlations between the CO isotopologue line fluxes and the continuum flux densities. With the exception of one disk, we also identify a strong correlation between the $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2 fluxes, indicating similar CO abundances across this sample. For the two sources with well-resolved continuum and $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}\,J$=2-1 images, we find that their gas-to-dust size ratio is consistent with the median value of $\sim 2$ inferred from a larger sample of Lupus disks. We derive dust disk masses from continuum flux densities. We estimate gas disk masses by comparing $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 line fluxes with those predicted by the limited grid of self-consistent disk models of Ruaud et al. (2022). A comparison of these mass estimates with those derived by Trapman et al. (2025), using a combination of CO isotopologue and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$ line emission, shows that the masses are consistent with each other. Some discrepancies appear for small and faint disks, but they are still within the uncertainties. Both methods find gas disk masses increase with dust disk masses, and gas-to-dust mass ratios are between $10-100$ in the AGE-PRO Lupus sample.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): XII. Extreme millimetre variability detected in a Class II disc</title>

Abstract: Variability of millimetre wavelength continuum emission from Class II protoplanetary disks is extremely rare, and when detected it is usually interpreted as originating from non-thermal emission mechanisms that relate to the host star itself rather than its disk. During observations made as part of the AGE-PRO ALMA Large program, significant variability in the brightness of the 2MASS J16202863-2442087 system was detected between individual executions. We report the observed properties of the variability detected at millimetre wavelengths and investigate potential driving mechanisms. To investigate the nature of the variability we construct a light curve from the continuum observations and analyse imaged constructed from both flaring and quiescent emission. We characterise the dust disk around the star through analysis in the image and visibility plane, and carry out kinematic analysis of the CO(2-1) emission from the gas disk. The continuum flux decays by a factor of 8 in less than an hour, and by a factor of 13 within 8 days. The peak brightness coincides with an expected brightness maximum extrapolated from the periodicity of previously observed optical variability. The flare is most likely the product of synchrotron emission in the close vicinity of the star. The nature of the millimetre flare closely resembles those detected in very close binary systems, and may be due to the interaction of magnetic fields in an as yet undetected binary. Alternatively if the central host is a single-star object, the flare may be due to the interaction of magnetic field loops at the stellar surface or a strong accretion burst.</description>
