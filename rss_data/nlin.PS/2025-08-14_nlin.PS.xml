      <title>Multipulse Soliton Attractors Facilitated by High-Birefringence Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of optical solitons is a crucial factor in various applications. This work reveals a novel stable multipulse soliton attractor in fiber lasers. The attractor represents a bound state of multiple solitons, pulling other dynamical states toward itself. By introducing a polarization-maintaining fiber (PMF), the enhanced birefringence in the cavity induces the differential group delay (DGD) between the polarization components of the pulse, leading to soliton splitting and, ultimately, the formation of multi-soliton states. These multi-solitons, affected by intracavity nonlinear and dissipative effects, form attractors consisting of one to seven soliton pulses. Through a combination of experiments and numerical simulations, we systematically investigate the robustness and dynamical behavior of the multipulse soliton attractors. In this context, we analyze disturbances introduced by "rogue" solitons with different frequencies and conduct a comprehensive study of their interaction with the multipulse soliton attractors. The results show that the multipulse soliton attractors are structurally stable and highly resistant to external disturbances, highlighting their potential for high-precision fiber lasers and advanced multipulse systems.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and dynamics of one-dimensional solitons in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Bose mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation, stability, and dynamics of solitons in a one-dimensional binary Bose-Einstein condensate under the action of the spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) and Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction to the underlying system of the Gross-Pitaevskii equations. We identify the semi-dipole (SD) family of solitons and thoroughly analyze its properties. The numerical analysis reveals intricate bifurcations, including transitions from real to complex-valued stationary wavefunctions of the SD solitons and norm-dependent dynamical instabilities. Stability maps in the plane of the solitons' norm and interaction strength exhibit areas of monostability, oscillatory behavior, and soliton splitting. Solitons with complex stationary wavefunctions emerge as ground states in broad parameter areas, due to the effects of the LHY terms. The other soliton species, in the form of mixed modes (MMs), does not feature the compexification bifurcation. In the LHY-dominated regime, the SD and MM solitons exhibit identical values of the energy for the same norm. The results deepen the understanding of nonlinear matter-wave states and reveal multi-stable ones in quantum gases.</description>

      <title>From Order to Chimeras: Unraveling Dynamic Patterns in Active Fluids with Nonlinear Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore pattern formation in an active fluid system involving two chemical species that regulate active stress: a fast-diffusing species ($A$) and a slow-diffusing species ($I$). The growth of species $A$ is modelled using a nonlinear logistic term. Through linear stability analysis, we derive phase diagrams illustrating the various dynamical regimes in parameter space. Our findings indicate that an increase in the P\'eclet number results in the destabilisation of the uniform steady state. In contrast, counter-intuitively, an increase in the nonlinear growth parameter of $A$ actually stabilises the homogeneous steady-state regime. Additionally, we observe that greater asymmetry between the species leads to three distinct dynamical phases, while low asymmetry fails to produce oscillatory instability. Numerical simulations conducted in instability regimes show patterns that range from irregular, arrhythmic configurations at high P\'eclet numbers to both transient and robust symmetry-breaking chimera states. Notably, these chimera patterns are more prevalent in the oscillatory instability regime, and our stability analysis indicates that this regime is the most extensive for high nonlinear growth parameters and moderately high P\'eclet numbers. Further, we also find soliton-like structures where aggregations of species $A$ merge, and new aggregations spontaneously emerge, and these patterns are prevalent in the phase of stationary instability. Overall, our study illustrates that a diverse array of patterns can emerge in active matter influenced by nonlinear growth in a chemical species, with chimeras being particularly dominant when the nonlinear growth parameter is elevated.</description>
