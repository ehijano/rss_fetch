      <title>Ladder equation for the three-particle vertex and its approximate solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the three two-particle Bethe-Salpeter equations to ten three-particle ladders. These equations are exact and yield the exact three-particle vertex, if we knew the three-particle vertex irreducible in one of the ten channels. However, as we do not have this three-particle irreducible vertex at hand, we approximate this building block for the ladder by the sum of two-particle irreducible vertices each connecting two fermionic lines. The comparison to the exact solution shows that this approximation is only good for rather weak interactions and even than only qualitatively - at least for the non-linear response function analyzed.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a distinct class of antiferromagnets with electronic structures resembling those of d-wave superconductors, exhibit intriguing properties that have gained significant attention in recent research. In this article, we propose synthetic altermagnets, composed of two anisotropic ferromagnetic layers arranged such that the total net magnetization is zero. We investigate the properties of these synthetic altermagnets, focusing on their electronic band structures, spin current, Berry curvature, and anomalous Hall conductivity. By developing a minimal model for our synthetic altermagnets, we examine the influence of factors such as anisotropic coupling strengths and spin-orbit coupling on the physical phenomena altermagnets manifest. Our findings open a new path for the realization of altermagnetic materials experimentally and highlight their potential applications in magneto-electronics, magneto-optics, and spintronics devices.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised machine learning for the detection of exotic phases in skyrmion phase diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Undoubtedly, machine learning techniques are being increasingly applied to a wide range of situations in the field of condensed matter. Amongst these techniques, unsupervised techniques are especially attractive, since they imply the possibility of extracting information from the data without previous labeling. In this work, we resort to the technique known as anomaly detection to explore potential exotic phases in skyrmion phase diagrams, using two different algorithms: Principal Component Analysis and Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). First, we train these algorithms with an artificial dataset of skyrmion lattices constructed from an analytical parametrization, for different magnetizations, skyrmion lattice orientations, and skyrmion radii. We apply the trained algorithms to a set of snapshots obtained from Monte Carlo simulations for three ferromagnetic skyrmion models: two with in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DMI) in the triangular and kagome lattices, and one with an additional out of plane DMI in the kagome lattice. Then, we compare the root mean square error (RMSE) and the binary cross entropy between the input and output snapshots as a function of the external magnetic field and temperature. We find that the RMSE and its variance in the CAE case may be useful to not only detect exotic low temperature phases, but also to differentiate between the characteristic low temperature orderings of a skyrmion phase diagram (helical, skyrmions and ferromagnetic). Moreover, we apply the skyrmion trained CAE to two antiferromagnetic models in the triangular lattice, one that gives rise to antiferromagnetic skyrmions, and the pure exchange antiferromagnetic case. Despite the predictably larger RMSE, we find that, even in these cases, RMSE is also an indicator of different orderings and the emergence of particular features, such as the well-known pseudo-plateau in the pure exchange case.</description>

      <title>Mathematical analysis of a Mu\~noz-Delgado model for cigar-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present mathematical analysis of one-dimensional effective models proposed in [\cite{MunozDelgado}] concerning Bose-Einstein condensates in the presence of harmonic confinement. Among the demonstrated properties, we can mention: existence, uniqueness, orbital stability, symmetry and gaussian asymptotic decay of ground-state solutions in the repulsive case. We also report formul\ae\ for the minimal energy $E_{\mn}$ and the associate chemical potential $\mu$ as functions of a parameter $\lambda$, which is related to $N$ (the number of atoms) and/or $a$ (the s-wave scattering length). By considering Taylor's development of the non-quadratic therm of the energy and using appropriate gaussian functions as approximations for the ground state, we present some numerical experiments to illustrate our results.</description>
