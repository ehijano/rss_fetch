      <title>ML-based Calibration and Control of the GlueX Central Drift Chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GlueX Central Drift Chamber (CDC) in Hall D at Jefferson Lab, used for detecting and tracking charged particles, is calibrated and controlled during data taking using a Gaussian process. The system dynamically adjusts the high voltage applied to the anode wires inside the chamber in response to changing environmental and experimental conditions such that the gain is stabilized. Control policies have been established to manage the CDC's behavior. These policies are activated when the model's uncertainty exceeds a configurable threshold or during human-initiated tests during normal production running. We demonstrate the system reduces the time detector experts dedicate to calibration of the data offline, leading to a marked decrease in computing resource usage without compromising detector performance.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Models for Ultra-High Granularity Particle Physics Detector Simulation: A Voyage From Emulation to Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating ultra-high-granularity detector responses in Particle Physics represents a critical yet computationally demanding task. This thesis aims to overcome this challenge for the Pixel Vertex Detector (PXD) at the Belle II experiment, which features over 7.5M pixel channels-the highest spatial resolution detector simulation dataset ever analysed with generative models. This thesis starts off by a comprehensive and taxonomic review on generative models for simulating detector signatures. Then, it presents the Intra-Event Aware Generative Adversarial Network (IEA-GAN), a new geometry-aware generative model that introduces a relational attentive reasoning and Self-Supervised Learning to approximate an "event" in the detector. This study underscores the importance of intra-event correlation for downstream physics analyses. Building upon this, the work drifts towards a more generic approach and presents YonedaVAE, a Category Theory-inspired generative model that tackles the open problem of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) simulation. YonedaVAE introduces a learnable Yoneda embedding to capture the entirety of an event based on its sensor relationships, formulating a Category theoretical language for intra-event relational reasoning. This is complemented by introducing a Self-Supervised learnable prior for VAEs and an Adaptive Top-q sampling mechanism, enabling the model to sample point clouds with variable intra-category cardinality in a zero-shot manner. Variable Intra-event cardinality has not been approached before and is vital for simulating irregular detector geometries. Trained on an early experiment data, YonedaVAE can reach a reasonable OOD simulation precision of a later experiment with almost double luminosity. This study introduces, for the first time, the results of using deep generative models for ultra-high granularity detector simulation in Particle Physics.</description>

      <title>Systematic approach to measure the performance of microchannel-plate photomultipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to systematically measure numerous performance parameters of MCP-PMTs. The experimental setups, the analyses and selected results are discussed. Although the techniques used may be different in other locations, the document is intended as a guide for comparable measurements with other types of MCP-PMTs. Measurements are shown for the following performance parameters: spectral and spatial quantum efficiency, collection efficiency, gain as a function of voltage, position and magnetic field, time resolution, rate capability and lifetime. By using a dedicated 3-axis stepper and an FPGA-based DAQ system, also inner PMT parameters are measured as a function of the active area, such as relative detection efficiency, dark count rate, time resolution, recoil electron and afterpulse distributions, as well as charge sharing and electronic crosstalk. In addition, some of the parameters are investigated inside a strong magnetic field. For many of these measurements, the change of most setup parameters and the subsequent analysis can be controlled semi-automatically by software scripts.</description>

      <title>Measurement of muon flux variations with scintillators in Mexico City and their correlation to solar activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we report the variations of the atmospheric muons flux in Mexico City. The measurements were performed from September to December 2023 at at the Institute of Nuclear Sciences of UNAM, located at coordinates 19.32$^{\circ}$N 99.18$^{\circ}$W, with an altitude of 2274 meters above see level and a cutoff rigidity of 8.24 GV. The experimental setup consists of a pair of scintillators, with dimensions of 50cm x 1m. To compensate for fluctuations in air pressure, we calculate the barometric coefficient using data, which is determined to be -0.21%/mb. The observed muon flux corresponds to $98.3 \pm 2.6$ m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$, and is consistent with other measurements at the same location. We have identified three variations in the pressure-corrected muon flux that exhibit a pattern similar to those observed by a neutron cosmic ray detector at UNAM. Through an extensive analysis of the publicly available geomagnetic data, we have correlated these variations with a phenomenon known as a Forbush decrease.</description>

      <title>Aging suppression in Multistrip Multigap Resistive Plate Chambers for high counting rate experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long term operation of Multi-Strip Multi-Gap Resistive Plate Chambers (MSMGRPC) with gas mixtures based on C2H2F4 and SF6 leads to aging effects, observed as depositions on the surface of the resistive electrodes. Moreover, enhanced depositions and higher noise rates were evidenced around the nylon spacers used for defining the gas gaps between the resistive electrodes. The aging effects are reflected in an increase of the dark current and dark counting rate, with negative impact on the long term performance of the chamber and data volume in a free running readout mode operation. MSMGRPC prototypes designed with a direct gas flow through the gas gaps and minimization of the number of spacers in the active area were developed as mitigation solution. Prototypes with this new design and different granularities were assembled using fishing line as spacers and investigated for aging effects. Although a significant reduction in the dark current and dark counting rate was evidenced, dark counting rate localized around the fishing line spacers remains. In this paper, a new generation of direct flow chambers based on discrete spacers is presented. The results of their aging investigations show that, even at lower gas flows, the aging effects become negligible.</description>

      <title>A new class of axion haloscope resonators: the polygonal coaxial cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the search for axionic Dark Matter, the high frequency part of the QCD axion parameter space is favored, as indicated by both cosmological and astrophysical arguments and recent indications from lattice QCD calculations. To extend the probing range of cavity haloscopes, solutions addressing the unfavorable scaling of cavity volume with frequency must be developed. Here, we present a novel type of high-volume thin shell resonator for high frequency haloscope dark matter searches. The cavity is formed by two nested and coaxial right angle polygonal prisms enclosed within two flat endcaps. For the axion-sensitive (pseudo-)TM010 mode, finite element simulations yield form factor of the order of 0.8 and Q factor of the order of 60000 for a copper cavity at 4$\,$K. High tunability of up to $\sim 5\%$ is achieved by reciprocal rotation of the two prisms, without significant changes in haloscope sensitivity. A prototype aluminium hexagonal cavity was built and tested, confirming the main characteristics of the design.</description>

      <title>Application of the VMM ASIC for SiPM-based calorimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly integrated multichannel readout electronics is crucial in contemporary particle physics experiments. A novel silicon photomultiplier readout system based on the VMM3a ASIC was developed, for the first time exploiting this chip for calorimetric purposes. To extend the dynamic range the signal from each SiPM channel was processed by two electronics channels with different gain. A fully operational prototype system with 256 SiPM readout channels allowed the collection of data from a prototype of the ALICE Forward Hadron Calorimeter (FoCal-H). The design and the test beam results using high energy hadron beams are presented and discussed, confirming the applicability of VMM3a-based solutions for energy measurements in a high rate environment.</description>

      <title>Needle in a haystack: efficiently finding atomically defined quantum dots for electrostatic force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ongoing development of single electron, nano and atomic scale semiconductor devices would benefit greatly from a characterization tool capable of detecting single electron charging events with high spatial resolution, at low temperature. In this work, we introduce a novel Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) instrument capable of measuring critical device dimensions, surface roughness, electrical surface potential, and ultimately the energy levels of quantum dots and single electron transistors in ultra miniaturized semiconductor devices. Characterization of nanofabricated devices with this type of instrument presents a challenge: finding the device. We therefore also present a process to efficiently find a nanometre size quantum dot buried in a $10 \times 10~\text{mm}^2$ silicon sample using a combination of optical positioning, capacitive sensors and AFM topography in vacuum.</description>

      <title>Polarization-sensitive PHASR Scanner and calibration technique for accurate mapping of the Stokes vectors in terahertz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, handheld and portable terahertz instruments have been in rapid development for various applications ranging from non-destructive testing to biomedical imaging and sensing. For instance, we have deployed our Portable Handheld Spectral Reflection (PHASR) Scanners for in vivo full-spectroscopic imaging of skin burns in large animal models in operating room settings. In this paper, we debut the polarimetric version of the PHASR Scanner, and describe a generalized calibration technique to map the spatial and spectral dependence of the Jones matrix of an imaging scanner across its field of view. Our design is based on placement of two orthogonal photoconductive antenna (PCA) detectors separated by a polarizing beam splitter in the PHASR Scanner housing. We show that at least three independent measurements of a well-characterized polarimetric calibration target are sufficient to determine the polarization state of the incident beam at the sample location, as well as to extract the Jones propagation matrix from the sample location to the detectors. We have tested the accuracy of our scanner by validating polarimetric measurements obtained from a birefringent crystal rotated to various angles, as compared to the theoretically predicted response of the sample. This new version of our PHASR scanner can be used for high-speed imaging and investigation of heterogeneity of polarization-sensitive samples in the field.</description>

      <title>Dynamic motion trajectory control with nanoradian accuracy for multi-element X-ray optical systems via laser interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past decades have witnessed the development of new X-ray beam sources with brightness growing at a rate surpassing Moore's law. Current and upcoming diffraction limited and fully coherent X-ray beam sources, including multi-bend achromat based synchrotron sources and high repetition rate X-ray free electron lasers, puts increasingly stringent requirements on stability and accuracy of X-ray optics systems. Parasitic motion errors at sub-micro radian scale in beam transport and beam conditioning optics can lead to significant loss of coherence and brightness delivered from source to experiment. To address this challenge, we incorporated optical metrology based on interferometry and differential wavefront sensing as part of the X-ray optics motion control system. A prototype X-ray optics system was constructed following the optical layout of a tunable X-ray cavity. On-line interferometric metrology enabled dynamical feedback to a motion control system to track and compensate for motion errors. The system achieved sub-microradian scale performance, as multiple optical elements are synchronously and continuously adjusted. This first proof of principle measurement demonstrated both the potential and necessity of incorporating optical metrology as part of the motion control architecture for large scale X-ray optical systems such as monochromators, delay lines, and in particular, X-ray cavity systems to enable the next generation cavity-based X-ray free electron lasers.</description>

      <title>A miniaturized magnetic field sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a prime candidate for quantum sensing technologies. Ongoing miniaturization calls for ever-smaller sensors maintaining good measurement performance. Here, we present a fully integrated mechanically robust fiber-based endoscopic sensor capable of $5.9\,\mathrm{nT}/ \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ magnetic field sensitivity utilizing $15\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ sized microdiamonds at a microwave power of $50\,\mathrm{mW}$ and optical power of $2.15\,\mathrm{mW}$. A direct laser writing process is used to localize a diamond containing NV centers above the fiber's core by a polymer structure. This structure enables stable optical access and independent guiding of excitation and fluorescent light in different optical fibers. This separation strongly reduces the contribution of autofluorescence from the excitation light in the optical fiber. Moreover, a metallic direct laser written antenna structure is created next to the fibers' facet, allowing microwave manipulation of the NV centers' spins. The fabricated endoscopic sensor provides a robust platform with a tip diameter of $1.25\,\mathrm{mm}$. The device enables remote optical and microwave access to perform the full range of coherent spin measurements with NV centers at a spatial resolution of $15\,\mathrm{\mu m}$. We demonstrate the capability of vector magnetic field measurements in a magnetic field as used in state-of-the-art ultracold quantum gas experiments, opening a potential field in which high resolution and high sensitivity are necessary.</description>
