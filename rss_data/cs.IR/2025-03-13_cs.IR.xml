      <title>LLM-Driven Usefulness Labeling for IR Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the information retrieval (IR) domain, evaluation plays a crucial role in optimizing search experiences and supporting diverse user intents. In the recent LLM era, research has been conducted to automate document relevance labels, as these labels have traditionally been assigned by crowd-sourced workers - a process that is both time and consuming and costly. This study focuses on LLM-generated usefulness labels, a crucial evaluation metric that considers the user's search intents and task objectives, an aspect where relevance falls short. Our experiment utilizes task-level, query-level, and document-level features along with user search behavior signals, which are essential in defining the usefulness of a document. Our research finds that (i) pre-trained LLMs can generate moderate usefulness labels by understanding the comprehensive search task session, (ii) pre-trained LLMs perform better judgement in short search sessions when provided with search session contexts. Additionally, we investigated whether LLMs can capture the unique divergence between relevance and usefulness, along with conducting an ablation study to identify the most critical metrics for accurate usefulness label generation. In conclusion, this work explores LLM-generated usefulness labels by evaluating critical metrics and optimizing for practicality in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generative LLMs For Automated Metadata Description Generation to Enhance Data Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data catalogs serve as repositories for organizing and accessing diverse collection of data assets, but their effectiveness hinges on the ease with which business users can look-up relevant content. Unfortunately, many data catalogs within organizations suffer from limited searchability due to inadequate metadata like asset descriptions. Hence, there is a need of content generation solution to enrich and curate metadata in a scalable way. This paper explores the challenges associated with metadata creation and proposes a unique prompt enrichment idea of leveraging existing metadata content using retrieval based few-shot technique tied with generative large language models (LLM). The literature also considers finetuning an LLM on existing content and studies the behavior of few-shot pretrained LLM (Llama, GPT3.5) vis-\`a-vis few-shot finetuned LLM (Llama2-7b) by evaluating their performance based on accuracy, factual grounding, and toxicity. Our preliminary results exhibit more than 80% Rouge-1 F1 for the generated content. This implied 87%- 88% of instances accepted as is or curated with minor edits by data stewards. By automatically generating descriptions for tables and columns in most accurate way, the research attempts to provide an overall framework for enterprises to effectively scale metadata curation and enrich its data catalog thereby vastly improving the data catalog searchability and overall usability.</description>

      <title>LREF: A Novel LLM-based Relevance Framework for E-commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query and product relevance prediction is a critical component for ensuring a smooth user experience in e-commerce search. Traditional studies mainly focus on BERT-based models to assess the semantic relevance between queries and products. However, the discriminative paradigm and limited knowledge capacity of these approaches restrict their ability to comprehend the relevance between queries and products fully. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent research has begun to explore their application to industrial search systems, as LLMs provide extensive world knowledge and flexible optimization for reasoning processes. Nonetheless, directly leveraging LLMs for relevance prediction tasks introduces new challenges, including a high demand for data quality, the necessity for meticulous optimization of reasoning processes, and an optimistic bias that can result in over-recall. To overcome the above problems, this paper proposes a novel framework called the LLM-based RElevance Framework (LREF) aimed at enhancing e-commerce search relevance. The framework comprises three main stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Data Selection, Multiple Chain of Thought (Multi-CoT) tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for de-biasing. We evaluate the performance of the framework through a series of offline experiments on large-scale real-world datasets, as well as online A/B testing. The results indicate significant improvements in both offline and online metrics. Ultimately, the model was deployed in a well-known e-commerce application, yielding substantial commercial benefits.</description>

      <title>Towards Next-Generation Recommender Systems: A Benchmark for Personalized Recommendation Assistant with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems (RecSys) are widely used across various modern digital platforms and have garnered significant attention. Traditional recommender systems usually focus only on fixed and simple recommendation scenarios, making it difficult to generalize to new and unseen recommendation tasks in an interactive paradigm. Recently, the advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the foundational architecture of RecSys, driving their evolution into more intelligent and interactive personalized recommendation assistants. However, most existing studies rely on fixed task-specific prompt templates to generate recommendations and evaluate the performance of personalized assistants, which limits the comprehensive assessments of their capabilities. This is because commonly used datasets lack high-quality textual user queries that reflect real-world recommendation scenarios, making them unsuitable for evaluating LLM-based personalized recommendation assistants. To address this gap, we introduce RecBench+, a new dataset benchmark designed to access LLMs' ability to handle intricate user recommendation needs in the era of LLMs. RecBench+ encompasses a diverse set of queries that span both hard conditions and soft preferences, with varying difficulty levels. We evaluated commonly used LLMs on RecBench+ and uncovered below findings: 1) LLMs demonstrate preliminary abilities to act as recommendation assistants, 2) LLMs are better at handling queries with explicitly stated conditions, while facing challenges with queries that require reasoning or contain misleading information. Our dataset has been released at https://github.com/jiani-huang/RecBench.git.</description>

      <title>Learning Cascade Ranking as One Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cascade Ranking is a prevalent architecture in large-scale top-k selection systems like recommendation and advertising platforms. Traditional training methods focus on single-stage optimization, neglecting interactions between stages. Recent advances such as RankFlow and FS-LTR have introduced interaction-aware training paradigms but still struggle to 1) align training objectives with the goal of the entire cascade ranking (i.e., end-to-end recall) and 2) learn effective collaboration patterns for different stages. To address these challenges, we propose LCRON, which introduces a novel surrogate loss function derived from the lower bound probability that ground truth items are selected by cascade ranking, ensuring alignment with the overall objective of the system. According to the properties of the derived bound, we further design an auxiliary loss for each stage to drive the reduction of this bound, leading to a more robust and effective top-k selection. LCRON enables end-to-end training of the entire cascade ranking system as a unified network. Experimental results demonstrate that LCRON achieves significant improvement over existing methods on public benchmarks and industrial applications, addressing key limitations in cascade ranking training and significantly enhancing system performance.</description>

      <title>Exposing Product Bias in LLM Investment Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), as a new generation of recommendation engines, possess powerful summarization and data analysis capabilities, surpassing traditional recommendation systems in both scope and performance. One promising application is investment recommendation. In this paper, we reveal a novel product bias in LLM investment recommendation, where LLMs exhibit systematic preferences for specific products. Such preferences can subtly influence user investment decisions, potentially leading to inflated valuations of products and financial bubbles, posing risks to both individual investors and market stability. To comprehensively study the product bias, we develop an automated pipeline to create a dataset of 567,000 samples across five asset classes (stocks, mutual funds, cryptocurrencies, savings, and portfolios). With this dataset, we present the bf first study on product bias in LLM investment recommendations. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit clear product preferences, such as certain stocks (e.g., `AAPL' from Apple and `MSFT' from Microsoft). Notably, this bias persists even after applying debiasing techniques. We urge AI researchers to take heed of the product bias in LLM investment recommendations and its implications, ensuring fairness and security in the digital space and market.</description>

      <title>Quality Over Quantity? LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains challenging. We present Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA), which aligns audiovisual (AV) scene content beyond mere temporal synchronization via a Large Language Model (LLM)-based data curation pipeline. Specifically, AVVA scores and selects high-quality training clips using Whisper (speech-based audio foundation model) for audio and DINOv2 for video within a dual-encoder contrastive learning framework. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate that this approach can achieve significant accuracy gains with substantially less curated data. For instance, AVVA yields a 7.6% improvement in top-1 accuracy for audio-to-video retrieval on VGGSound compared to ImageBind, despite training on only 192 hours of carefully filtered data (vs. 5800+ hours). Moreover, an ablation study highlights that trading data quantity for data quality improves performance, yielding respective top-3 accuracy increases of 47.8, 48.4, and 58.0 percentage points on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound over uncurated baselines. While these results underscore AVVA's data efficiency, we also discuss the overhead of LLM-driven curation and how it may be scaled or approximated in larger domains. Overall, AVVA provides a viable path toward more robust, text-free audiovisual learning with improved retrieval accuracy.</description>

      <title>xVLM2Vec: Adapting LVLM-based embedding models to multilinguality using Self-Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current literature, most embedding models are based on the encoder-only transformer architecture to extract a dense and meaningful representation of the given input, which can be a text, an image, and more. With the recent advances in language modeling thanks to the introduction of Large Language Models, the possibility of extracting embeddings from these large and extensively trained models has been explored. However, current studies focus on textual embeddings in English, which is also the main language on which these models have been trained. Furthermore, there are very few models that consider multimodal and multilingual input. In light of this, we propose an adaptation methodology for Large Vision-Language Models trained on English language data to improve their performance in extracting multilingual and multimodal embeddings. Finally, we design and introduce a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of multilingual and multimodal embedding models.</description>

      <title>Search-R1: Training LLMs to Reason and Leverage Search Engines with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language models (LLMs). Retrieval augmentation and tool-use training approaches where a search engine is treated as a tool lack complex multi-turn retrieval flexibility or require large-scale supervised data. Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities during inference to use search engines is not optimal, since the LLM does not learn how to optimally interact with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of the DeepSeek-R1 model where the LLM learns -- solely through reinforcement learning (RL) -- to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM rollouts with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 26% (Qwen2.5-7B), 21% (Qwen2.5-3B), and 10% (LLaMA3.2-3B) over SOTA baselines. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning.

      <title>Dual Test-time Training for Out-of-distribution Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning has been widely applied in recommender systems, which has achieved revolutionary progress recently. However, most existing learning-based methods assume that the user and item distributions remain unchanged between the training phase and the test phase. However, the distribution of user and item features can naturally shift in real-world scenarios, potentially resulting in a substantial decrease in recommendation performance. This phenomenon can be formulated as an Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) recommendation problem. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Dual Test-Time-Training framework for OOD Recommendation, termed DT3OR. In DT3OR, we incorporate a model adaptation mechanism during the test-time phase to carefully update the recommendation model, allowing the model to specially adapt to the shifting user and item features. To be specific, we propose a self-distillation task and a contrastive task to assist the model learning both the user's invariant interest preferences and the variant user/item characteristics during the test-time phase, thus facilitating a smooth adaptation to the shifting features. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis to support the rationale behind our dual test-time training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to address OOD recommendation via a test-time-training strategy. We conduct experiments on three datasets with various backbones. Comprehensive experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of DT3OR compared to other state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Graph Embeddings for Session-based Recommendation with Item Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In session-based recommender systems, predictions are based on the user's preceding behavior in the session. State-of-the-art sequential recommendation algorithms either use graph neural networks to model sessions in a graph or leverage the similarity of sessions by exploiting item features. In this paper, we combine these two approaches and propose a novel method, Graph Convolutional Network Extension (GCNext), which incorporates item features directly into the graph representation via graph convolutional networks. GCNext creates a feature-rich item co-occurrence graph and learns the corresponding item embeddings in an unsupervised manner. We show on three datasets that integrating GCNext into sequential recommendation algorithms significantly boosts the performance of nearest-neighbor methods as well as neural network models. Our flexible extension is easy to incorporate in state-of-the-art methods and increases the MRR@20 by up to 12.79%.</description>

      <title>Balancing Content Size in RAG-Text2SQL System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for converting natural language queries into SQL commands, enabling seamless database interaction. However, these Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) systems face inherent limitations, hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and untraceable reasoning. To address these challenges, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Text2SQL models has gained traction. RAG serves as a retrieval mechanism, providing essential contextual information, such as table schemas and metadata, to enhance the query generation process. Despite their potential, RAG + Text2SQL systems are susceptible to the quality and size of retrieved documents. While richer document content can improve schema relevance and retrieval accuracy, it also introduces noise, increasing the risk of hallucinations and reducing query fidelity as the prompt size of the Text2SQL model increases. This research investigates the nuanced trade-off between document size and quality, aiming to strike a balance that optimizes system performance. Key thresholds are identified where performance degradation occurs, along with actionable strategies to mitigate these challenges. Additionally, we explore the phenomenon of hallucinations in Text2SQL models, emphasizing the critical role of curated document presentation in minimizing errors. Our findings provide a roadmap for enhancing the robustness of RAG + Text2SQL systems, offering practical insights for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>MultiConIR: Towards multi-condition Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MultiConIR, the first benchmark designed to evaluate retrieval models in multi-condition scenarios. Unlike existing datasets that primarily focus on single-condition queries from search engines, MultiConIR captures real-world complexity by incorporating five diverse domains: books, movies, people, medical cases, and legal documents. We propose three tasks to systematically assess retrieval and reranking models on multi-condition robustness, monotonic relevance ranking, and query format sensitivity. Our findings reveal that existing retrieval and reranking models struggle with multi-condition retrieval, with rerankers suffering severe performance degradation as query complexity increases. We further investigate the performance gap between retrieval and reranking models, exploring potential reasons for these discrepancies, and analysis the impact of different pooling strategies on condition placement sensitivity. Finally, we highlight the strengths of GritLM and Nv-Embed, which demonstrate enhanced adaptability to multi-condition queries, offering insights for future retrieval models. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/MultiConIR.</description>

      <title>MERGE -- A Bimodal Dataset for Static Music Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Music Emotion Recognition (MER) field has seen steady developments in recent years, with contributions from feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning. The landscape has also shifted from audio-centric systems to bimodal ensembles that combine audio and lyrics. However, a severe lack of public and sizeable bimodal databases has hampered the development and improvement of bimodal audio-lyrics systems. This article proposes three new audio, lyrics, and bimodal MER research datasets, collectively called MERGE, created using a semi-automatic approach. To comprehensively assess the proposed datasets and establish a baseline for benchmarking, we conducted several experiments for each modality, using feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning methodologies. In addition, we propose and validate fixed train-validate-test splits. The obtained results confirm the viability of the proposed datasets, achieving the best overall result of 79.21% F1-score for bimodal classification using a deep neural network.</description>

      <title>ReCon: Enhancing True Correspondence Discrimination through Relation Consistency for Robust Noisy Correspondence Learning</title>

Abstract: Can we accurately identify the true correspondences from multimodal datasets containing mismatched data pairs? Existing methods primarily emphasize the similarity matching between the representations of objects across modalities, potentially neglecting the crucial relation consistency within modalities that are particularly important for distinguishing the true and false correspondences. Such an omission often runs the risk of misidentifying negatives as positives, thus leading to unanticipated performance degradation. To address this problem, we propose a general Relation Consistency learning framework, namely ReCon, to accurately discriminate the true correspondences among the multimodal data and thus effectively mitigate the adverse impact caused by mismatches. Specifically, ReCon leverages a novel relation consistency learning to ensure the dual-alignment, respectively of, the cross-modal relation consistency between different modalities and the intra-modal relation consistency within modalities. Thanks to such dual constrains on relations, ReCon significantly enhances its effectiveness for true correspondence discrimination and therefore reliably filters out the mismatched pairs to mitigate the risks of wrong supervisions. Extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmark datasets, including Flickr30K, MS-COCO, and Conceptual Captions, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of ReCon compared with other SOTAs.

      <title>OASIS: Order-Augmented Strategy for Improved Code Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code embeddings capture the semantic representations of code and are crucial for various code-related large language model (LLM) applications, such as code search. Previous training primarily relies on optimizing the InfoNCE loss by comparing positive natural language (NL)-code pairs with in-batch negatives. However, due to the sparse nature of code contexts, training solely by comparing the major differences between positive and negative pairs may fail to capture deeper semantic nuances. To address this issue, we propose a novel order-augmented strategy for improved code search (OASIS). It leverages order-based similarity labels to train models to capture subtle differences in similarity among negative pairs. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate that our OASIS model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models focusing solely on major positive-negative differences. It underscores the value of exploiting subtle differences among negative pairs with order labels for effective code embedding training.</description>
