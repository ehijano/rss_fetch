      <title>H\"older estimates of weak solutions to chemotaxis systems of fast diffusion type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a quasilinear chemotaxis system of singular type, where the diffusion operator is given by $\Delta u^m$ with $0&lt;m&lt;1$, corresponding to the fast diffusion regime, and where the chemotactic drift is nonlinear. Since H\"older continuity constitutes the optimal regularity class for weak solutions to the porous medium equation, we establish analogous regularity results for bounded solutions of parabolic--parabolic chemotaxis systems in this setting. The proof is based on a refined De Giorgi--Di Benedetto iteration scheme adapted to the coupled structure of the system. These results advance the understanding of the fine regularity properties of chemotaxis models with nonlinear diffusion, and demonstrate that the interplay between singular diffusion and aggregation exhibits a regularizing mechanism consistent with the porous medium paradigm.</description>

      <title>Travelling Waves in a Mathematical Model for Oncolytic Virotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oncolytic virotherapy (OVT) is a promising cancer treatment strategy in which engineered viruses selectively infect and destroy tumor cells. Motivated by the biological mechanisms underlying viral spread and tumor invasion into the tissue, we analyze a non-cooperative reaction-diffusion model capturing the invasion of tumor tissue by oncolytic viruses. Using carefully constructed upper and lower solutions together with Schauder's fixed point theorem, we establish the existence of positive travelling-wave solutions. In particular, we identify a minimal wave speed value $\bar c$ such that positive travelling waves exist for all $c \geq \bar c$ . Our analysis also highlights parameter regions where the existence of travelling waves remains ambiguous, suggesting new mathematical questions about the propagation of viral treatments through tumor environments.</description>

      <title>Mass splitting in the time-discrete generalized Euler equations and non-Monge solutions in multi-marginal optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-discretized, spatially continuous generalized Euler equations are a prototype example of multi-marginal optimal transport, yet the question whether they exhibit mass-splitting (or equivalently, whether they have solutions that are not of Monge form) has remained open. Here we resolve this question by giving a mass-splitting example in one spatial dimension. Moreover we present a related and very simple fully discrete example of mass-splitting which reveals a transparent underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>New approach for elastic collisions with singular stress functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A collision of a rubber rod to a hard floor is regarded as a simple example of obstacle problems for elastic material. In this article we have proposed a new mathematical model for the collision phenomenon by applying beam equations with singular stress functions, which is investigated in our recent works. As in the works we have established a mathematical method to deal with the singular stress function. Here, we demonstrate the validity of our modeling through observation to the numerical results. Also, we present existence and uniqueness results of the model given as initial boundary value problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of quasiconvexity for continuous functions $f$ defined on the vector bundle of linear maps between the tangent spaces of a smooth Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ and $\mathbb{R}^m$, naturally generalizing the classical Euclidean definition. We prove that this condition characterizes the sequential lower semicontinuity of the associated integral functional \[ F(u, \Omega) = \int_{\Omega} f(du) \, d\mu \] with respect to the weak$^*$ topology of $W^{1,\infty}(\Omega, \mathbb{R}^m)$, for every bounded open subset $\Omega\subseteq M$.</description>

      <title>On Liouiville Type Theorem for the 3D Isentropic Navier-Stokes System without D-condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish Liouville-type theorems for the steady compressible Navier-Stokes system. Assuming a smooth solution \(u \in L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)\), \(3 \le p \le \frac{9}{2}\), with bounded density, one obtains \(u \equiv0\). This generalizes the result of Li-Yu \cite{Li-Yu} by removing the Dirichlet condition \(\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} |\nabla u|^2 \, dx &lt; \infty\). If \(\frac{9}{2} &lt; p &lt; 6\), Liouville-type theorem holds under the additional oscillation condition for momentum \(\rho u \in \dot{B}^{\frac{3}{p} - \frac{3}{2}}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)\). For the marginal case \(u \in L^6(\mathbb{R}^3)\), the oscillation condition can be replaced by \(\rho u \in BMO^{-1}(\mathbb{R}^3)\). We also present results in Morrey-type spaces: \(u \in \dot{M}^{s,6}(\mathbb{R}^3)\) and \(\rho u \in \dot{M}_w^{q,3}(\mathbb{R}^3)\) for \(2 \le s \le 6\) and \(\frac{3}{2} &lt; q \le 3\).</description>

      <title>Higher order H{\"o}lder approximation by solutions of second order elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given second order elliptic operation $\mathcal{L}$ in a domain $\Omega\subset{\mathbb{R}}^\mathbf{N}$, $\mathbf{N}\ $, and a compact set $\mathbf{K}\subset\Omega$, order $\mathbf{N}$-$2$-Ahlfors-David regular, we define the space $\mathcal{H}^{\mathbf{r}+\omega}_{\mathcal{L}}(\mathbf{K})$ of continuous functions $f(x),\, x\in\mathbf{K}$, admitting, for any $\delta&gt;0$, a local approximation in the $\delta $-neighborhood of any point $x\in\mathbf{K}$, with $\delta^{\mathbf{r}}\omega(\delta)$-error estimate, by solutions of the equation $\mathcal{L} u=0$. For such functions, we prove the existence of a global approximation $v_\delta$ on $\mathbf{K}$ with the same order of error estimate, by a solution of the same equation in a $\delta$-neighborhood of $\mathbf{K}$. A number of properties of these functions $v_\delta$ and their derivatives are established.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem for linear parabolic equations in divergence form. Under mild assumptions on the source term and the domain, we prove the existence of globally H\"{o}lder continuous solutions. Notably, our results accommodate data exhibiting singularities nearly as critical as the inverse square of the distance from the boundary.</description>

      <title>The W-Operator: A Volterra Fractional Time Operator with Non-Bernstein Symbol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new two-parameter fractional time operator with Volterra structure, denoted by the W-operator, defined through a generalized Laplace symbol. The operator preserves the Caputo-type high-frequency behavior while allowing a controlled modification of the low-frequency regime through an additional parameter, leading to regularized memory effects. We develop a complete symbolic and Volterra theory, including explicit Prabhakar-type kernels, a left-inverse Volterra integral, and a fractional fundamental theorem of calculus. We show that the natural factorization of the Laplace symbol does not fit the classical Bernstein product mechanism and that the symbol is not a Bernstein function in general. Despite this non-Bernstein character, we establish well-posedness of abstract fractional Cauchy problems with sectorial generators by resolvent estimates and Laplace inversion, yielding a W-resolvent family with temporal regularity and smoothing properties. As an illustration, we apply the theory to a W-fractional diffusion model and discuss the influence of the modulation parameter on the relaxation of spectral modes.</description>

      <title>Rational-Kernel Fractional Evolution Equations with Almost Sectorial Operators: A Resolvent Framework Unifying ABC and W Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fractional evolution equations driven by rational-kernel time operators with non-singular memory, including the Atangana-Baleanu-Caputo operator and a generalized W-operator. These operators are characterized by Laplace symbols that do not necessarily belong to the classical Bernstein class. The analysis is carried out in the framework of almost sectorial operators, which allows resolvent estimates beyond standard analytic semigroup theory. Existence, uniqueness, and temporal regularity of mild solutions are established by Laplace transform techniques and contour integration, leading to the construction of associated resolvent families. A unified resolvent framework is developed, enabling a precise comparison between ABC and W dynamics and clarifying the influence of rational memory kernels on decay and smoothing properties. Several examples, including fractional diffusion-type equations, illustrate the abstract theory and highlight the impact of non-singular memory on long-time behavior.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with competing singular nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonlinear elliptic equations arising as stationary states of inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with competing singular nonlinearities. Working in a weighted Sobolev space that combines the homogeneous Sobolev space with a weighted Lebesgue term, we establish continuous and compact embeddings of Caffarelli--Kohn--Nirenberg type. These embeddings, together with a model that displays a natural scaling, allow us to apply the abstract critical point framework of Mercuri and Perera (2025), yielding a sequence of nonlinear eigenvalues for the associated problem. This scaling property leads to a classification of weighted power-type nonlinearities into subscaled, scaled, and superscaled regimes. Within this variational setting, we obtain broad existence and multiplicity results for equations driven by sums of weighted power nonlinearities, covering superscaled, scaled, and subscaled interactions, both in the subcritical and critical cases. We also provide a nonexistence result as a consequence of a Pohozaev-type identity. Finally, in the radial setting we employ improved radial CKN inequalities to enlarge the admissible embedding ranges. This yields strengthened radial versions of all our main results, including two-dimensional configurations with more singular weights, where no compact embeddings are available in the nonradial case.</description>

      <title>Average gradient localisation for degenerate elliptic equations in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Lipschitz solutions to the possibly highly degenerate elliptic equation $ {\rm div} G(\nabla u)=0$ in $B_1\subset\mathbb{R}^2 $, for any continuous strictly monotone vector field $G \colon \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$. We show that $u$ is either $C^1$ at $0$, or any blowup limit $v(x)=\lim \frac{u(\delta x)-u(0)}{\delta} $ along a sequence $\delta\to 0$ satisfies $ \nabla v\in \mathcal{D}\cap \mathcal{S} \text{ a.e} $. Here, $ \mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ can be roughly interpreted as the sets where ellipticity degenerates from below and above, that is, the symmetric parts of $ \nabla G$ and $(\nabla G)^{-1}$ have a zero eigenvalue. This is a strong indication in favor of the expected continuity of $H(\nabla u)$ for any continuous $H$ vanishing on $\mathcal{D}\cap \mathcal{S}$. In contrast with previous results in the same spirit, we do not make any assumption on the structure of $G$ besides its continuity and strict monotony.</description>

      <title>On the monotonicity of the entropy production in the Landau-Maxwell equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the homogeneous Landau equation with Maxwell molecules and prove that the entropy production is non-increasing provided the directional temperatures are well-distributed and the solution admits a moment of order $\ell$, for some $\ell$ arbitrarily close to $2$. It implies that for an initial condition with finite moment of order $\ell$, the entropy production is guaranteed to be non-increasing after a certain time, that we explicitly compute. This is the first partial answer to a conjecture made by Henry P. McKean in 1966 on the sign of the time-derivatives of the entropy. We also obtain algebraic decay estimates for the entropy production for large time; as well as a short-time estimate without moment assumptions.</description>

      <title>Freely floating cylinder on a 3D fluid governed by the Boussinesq equations in the axisymmetric without swirl case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the interactions of waves governed by a non-linear dispersive Boussinesq type system with the vertical displacement of a cylindrical floating structure in an axisymmetric without swirl situation. The Boussinesq regime is a good approximation of free surface Euler's equations when the non-linear parameter and the shallowness parameter are small. The vertical motion of the floating body is governed by the Newton equation. The full coupled wave-structure interaction problem under consideration is reduced to a boundary problem. The boundary condition satisfied by the discharge is given in terms of the vertical displacement of the floating cylinder. The latter is calculated using an ODE, which requires knowledge of the trace of the surface elevation and its second-time derivative. We use the dispersion in order to exhibit a hidden second order ODE on the trace of the surface elevation. This finally allows us to rewrite the waves-structure interaction problem as a system of non-local conservative PDEs plus bounded radial terms with a dispersive boundary layer, combined with an ODE at the boundary. This is what we call the Augmented formulation. Afterwards we showed that this formulation is well-posed with two different methods. Finally, we study the return to equilibrium situation in the linear regime. In particular, we improved previous results on the explicit time decay. We showed that the center mass of the floating body cannot converge to its equilibrium faster than $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/2})$ in 2D without viscosity and faster than $\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/2})$ with viscosity.</description>

      <title>Subprincipal Controlled Quasimodes and Spectral Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we explore, in a series of articles, semiclassical quasimodes u(h,b), approximative solutions P(h)u(h,b)\sim 0, depending on $0&lt;h&lt;1$, and on b, the subprincipal symbol. We study a pseudodifferential operator with transversal intersections of bicharacteristics, where the principal symbol has double multiplicity, $p=dp=0$, in a small neigborhood $\Omega$. Because of this fact, we instead study the subprincipal symbol b, and we can conclude that we get transport equations depending on b where sign changes for the imaginary part of b give approximative solutions with small support. These modes are used to estimate spectral instability, or the pseudospectrum. We also investigate the possibility that we can factorize the model operator as $P(h)=h^2P_1P_2,$ in this way actually annihilating the subprincipal symbol, thus there is no condition for the imaginary part of b. In a follow-up article, we examine different cases for more complex operators with tangential intersections of bicharacteristics, thereby generalizing the findings here.</description>

      <title>A Schr\"odinger-Based Dispersive Regularization Approach for Numerical Simulation of One-Dimensional Shallow Water Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel dispersive regularization framework for the numerical simulation of the one-dimensional shallow water equations (SWE). The classical hyperbolic system is regularized by a third-order dispersive term in the momentum equation, which renders the system equivalent, via the Madelung transform, to a defocusing cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a drift term induced by bottom topography.
  Instead of solving the shallow water equations directly, we solve the associated Schr\"odinger equation and recover the hydrodynamic variables through a simple postprocessing procedure. This approach transforms the original nonlinear hyperbolic system into a semilinear complex-valued equation, which can be efficiently approximated using a Strang time-splitting method combined with a spectral element discretization in space.
  Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in subcritical regimes without shock formation, the Schr\"odinger regularization provides an $O(\varepsilon)$ approximation to the classical shallow water solution, where $\varepsilon$ denotes the regularization parameter. Importantly, we observe that this convergence behavior persists even in the presence of moving wetting--drying interfaces, where vacuum states emerge and standard shallow water solvers often encounter difficulties. These results suggest that the Schr\"odinger-based formulation offers a robust and promising alternative framework for the numerical simulation of shallow water flows with dry states.</description>

      <title>Master equations with indefinite nonlinearities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following indefinite fully fractional heat equation involving the master operator \begin{equation} (\partial_t -\Delta)^{s} u(x,t) = x_1u^p(x,t)\ \ \mbox{in}\ \R^n\times\R , \end{equation} where $s\in(0,1)$, and $-\infty &lt; p &lt; \infty$. Under mild conditions, we prove that there is no positive bounded solutions. To this end, we first show that the solutions are strictly increasing along $x_1$ direction by employing the direct method of moving planes. Then by constructing an unbounded sub-solution, we derive the nonexistence of bounded solutions.
  To circumvent the difficulties caused by the fully fractional master operator, we introduced some new ideas and novel approaches that, as we believe, will become useful tool in studying a variety of other fractional elliptic and parabolic problems.</description>

      <title>Information geometric regularization of unidimensional pressureless Euler equations yields global strong solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial differential equations describing compressible fluids are prone to the formation of shock singularities, arising from faster upstream fluid particles catching up to slower, downstream ones. In geometric terms, this causes the deformation map to leave the manifold of diffeomorphisms. Information geometric regularization addresses this issue by changing the manifold geometry to make it geodesically complete. Empirical evidence suggests that this results in smooth solutions without adding artificial viscosity. This work makes a first step towards understanding this phenomenon rigorously, in the setting of the unidimensional pressureless Euler equations. It shows that their information geometric regularization has smooth global solutions. By establishing $\Gamma$-convergence of its variational description, it proves convergence of these solutions to entropy solutions of the nominal problem, in the limit of vanishing regularization parameter. A consequence of these results is that manifolds of unidimensional diffeomorphisms with information geometric regularization are geodesically complete.</description>

      <title>Regularity of solutions for fully fractional parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the fully fractional heat equation involving the master operator: $$ (\partial_t -\Delta)^{s} u(x,t) = f(x,t)\ \ \mbox{in}\ \mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R} , $$ where $s\in(0,1)$ and $f(x,t) \geq 0$.
  First we derive H\"{o}lder and Schauder estimates for nonnegative solutions of this equation. Due to the {\em nonlocality} of the master operator, existing results (cf. \cite{ST}) rely on global bounds of the solutions $u$ to control their higher local norms. However, such results are inadequate for blow-up and rescaling analysis aimed at obtaining a priori estimates for solutions to {\em nonlocal } equations on unbounded domains, as the global norms of the rescaled functions may diverge.
  This limitation raises to a natural and challenging question:
  {\em Can local bounds of solutions replace global bounds to control their higher local norms?}
  Here, we provide an affirmative answer to this question for nonnegative solutions. To achieve this, we introduced several new ideas and novel techniques. One of the key innovations is to use a {\em directional perturbation average} to derive an important estimate for the fully fractional heat kernel, as stated in Lemma \ref{key0}. We believe this estimate, along with other new techniques introduced here, will serve as powerful tools in regularity estimates for a wide range of nonlocal equations.
  Building on this breakthrough, we employ the blow-up and rescaling arguments to establish a priori estimates for solutions to a broader class of nonlocal equations in unbounded domains, such as $$(\partial_t -\Delta)^{s} u(x,t) = b(x,t) |\nabla_x u (x,t)|^q + f(x, u(x,t))\ \ \mbox{in}\ \ \mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}.$$ Under appropriate conditions, we prove that all nonnegative solutions, along with their spatial gradients, are uniformly bounded.</description>

Abstract: We formulate new admissibility criteria for initial value problems motivated by the least action principle. These are applied to a two-dimensional Riemann initial value problem for the isentropic compressible Euler fluid flow. It is shown that the criterion prefers the 2-shock solution to solutions obtained by convex integration by Chiodaroli and Kreml or to the hybrid solutions recently constructed by Markfelder and Pellhammer.</description>

      <title>Global existence of the irrotational Euler-Nordstr\"om equations with a positive cosmological constant: The gravitational field equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02023v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our aim is to establish the global existence of classical solutions to the nonlinear irrotational Euler--Nordstr\"om system, which incorporates a linear equation of state and a cosmological constant. In this setting, gravitation is described by a single scalar field satisfying a specific semilinear wave equation. We restrict attention to spatially periodic perturbations of the background metric and therefore study this equation on the three-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^3$, working within the Sobolev spaces $H^m(\mathbb{T}^3)$.
  We begin by analysing the Nordstr\"om equation in isolation, with a source term generated by an irrotational fluid obeying a linear equation of state. This separation is motivated by the fact that such a fluid produces a source term containing a nonlinear contribution of fractional order.
  To obtain a global solution for the gravitational field, the fractional-order nonlinearity $(1+u)^\mu$, with $\mu\in\mathbb{R}$, must remain smooth throughout the evolution. This condition, in turn, requires that $u$ remain small for all time. We ensure this by introducing a suitably chosen energy functional. We also prove that, asymptotically, the solutions tend to a constant.</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity and a priori estimates for fractional equations on unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the boundary H\"older regularity for solutions to the fractional Dirichlet problem in unbounded domains with boundary \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  (-\Delta)^s u(x) = g(x),&amp;\text{in } \Omega,
  u(x)=0, &amp;\text{in } \Omega^c.
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation*} Existing results rely on the global $L^{\infty}$ norm of solutions to control their boundary $C^s$ norm, which is insufficient for blow-up and rescaling analysis to obtain a priori estimates in unbounded domains. To overcome this limitation, we first derive a local version of boundary H\"older regularity for nonnegative solutions in which we replace the global $L^{\infty}$ norm by only a local $L^{\infty}$ norm. Then as an important application, we establish a priori estimates for nonnegative solutions to a family of nonlinear equations on unbounded domains with boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider equations of nonlinear transport on the circle with regular self interactions appearing in aggregation models and deterministic mean field dynamics. We introduce a random perturbation of such systems through a stochastic orientation preserving flow, which is given as an integrated infinite dimensional periodic Ornstein- Uhlenbeck process with reflection. As our main result we show that the induced stochastic dynamics yields a measure valued Markov process on a class of regular measures. Moreover, we show that this process is strong Feller in the corresponding topology. This is interpreted as a qualitative regularisation by noise phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Impact of memory on clustering in spontaneous particle aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of short-term and long-term memory on spontaneous aggregation of organisms is investigated using a stochastic agent-based model. Each individual modulates the amplitude of its random motion according to the perceived local density of neighbors. Memory is introduced via a chain of $K$~internal variables that allow agents to retain information about previously encountered densities. The parameter $K$ controls the effective length of memory. A formal mean-field limit yields a macroscopic Fokker--Planck equation, which provides a continuum description of the system in the large-population limit. Steady states of this equation are characterized to interpret the emergence and morphology of clusters. Systematic stochastic simulations in one- and two-dimensional spatial domains reveal that short- or moderate-term memory promotes coarsening, resulting in a smaller number of larger clusters, whereas long-term memory inhibits aggregation and increases the proportion of isolated individuals. Statistical analysis demonstrates that extended memory reduces the agents' responsiveness to environmental stimuli, explaining the transition from aggregation to dispersion as $K$ increases. These findings identify memory as a key factor controlling the collective organization of self-driven agents and provide a bridge between individual-level dynamics and emergent spatial patterns.</description>
