      <title>A triangular decomposition for the crystal lattice of the quantized function algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a triangular decomposition theorem for the lower crystal lattice $\mathcal{O}_{t}^{A_{0}}(G)$ of the quantized function algebra $\mathcal{O}_{t}(G)$, where $G$ is a connected simply connected complex Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and compact real form $K$. As a consequence, we prove that $\mathcal{O}_{t}^{A_{0}}(G)$ is contained in $\mathcal{O}_{t}^{A_{0}}(K)$, as conjectured by Matassa &amp; Yuncken. We also prove that the two notions of crystallized quantized function algebra given by Matassa &amp; Yuncken and Giri &amp; Pal coincide in the type $A_{n}$ case.</description>

      <title>Applications of the factorization theorem of conformal blocks to vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the factorization and vector bundle propositionerty of the sheaves of conformal blocks on $\overline{\mathscr{M}}_{g,n}$. defined by vertex operator algebras (VOAs) and give geometric proofs of essential results in the representation theory of strongly rational VOAs. We first prove the associativity of the fusion tensor product by investigating four-point conformal blocks on genus zero curves. Then we give a formula to calculate the ranks of VOA-conformal block bundles. Finally, by investigating one-point conformal blocks on genus-one curves, we prove the modular invariance of intertwining operators for VOAs, which is a generalization of Zhu's modular invariance for module vertex operators of strongly rational VOAs, and is a specialization of Huang's recent modular invariance of logarithmic intertwining operators for $C_2$-cofinite VOAs.</description>

      <title>On indecomposable involutive solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation whose squaring map is a $p$-cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pioneering work of Rump, which proved Gateva-Ivanova's conjecture concerning the decomposability of square-free solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation, significantly motivated further research into the associated squaring map $T$. This line of inquiry has yielded numerous decomposability theorems based on the underlying structure of $T$. Two seminal questions, posed by Ram\'irez and Vendramin, ask about the existence of certain indecomposable involutive solutions whose squaring maps are transpositions or 3-cycles. In this paper, we explore this problem in a more general setting by examining the case where $T$ is a $p$-cycle, for an arbitrary prime number $p$. Our results provide negative answers to the aforementioned questions under the assumption that the solution is latin or that its size is a prime-power. As a further application, we also present some decomposability theorems for solutions whose permutation groups are nilpotent.</description>

      <title>A Gentle Introduction to Algebraic Operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This text, based on the author's Bachelor's thesis, introduces the theory of Algebraic Operads, a mathematical formalism that provides a unifying framework for modern algebra. We demonstrate how the fundamental theories of associative, commutative, and Lie algebras can be fully recovered as categories of representations of three archetypal operads: $\mathsf{As}$, $\mathsf{Com}$ and $\mathsf{Lie}$ -- the so-called 'three graces' of algebra.
  Following a deductive and self-contained approach, the notion of an operad is initially presented in its classical form, as a single-object multicategory. Subsequently, alternative definitions -- namely, the partial and functorial definitions -- are provided. This framework allows for the extension of classical algebraic notions, such as free objects and quotients, to the operadic context, thereby enabling operads to be formally presented through generators and relations.
  The central result of this work is the rigorous proof of the correspondence between operads and algebras. We establish isomorphisms of categories between the algebras over the operads $\mathsf{As}$, $\mathsf{Com}$ and $\mathsf{Lie}$, and their respective classical counterparts.
  This thesis thus highlights how the theory of operads offers a higher-level language for algebra, encoding entire algebraic theories within single mathematical objects. This formalism not only unifies known structures but also lays the foundation for advanced concepts, such as 'algebras up to homotopy,' with applications in fields like theoretical physics and geometry.</description>

      <title>Cartier integration of infinitesimal 2-braidings via 2-holonomy of the CMKZ 2-connection, I: Hexagonators and the Breen polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper follows on from "Syllepses from 3-shifted Poisson structures and second-order integration of infinitesimal 2-braidings". Given a symmetric strict infinitesimal 2-braiding on a symmetric strict monoidal cochain 2-category, we construct a candidate hexagonator series as a 2-holonomy with respect to the Cirio-Martins-Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (CMKZ) fake flat 2-connection over the configuration space of 3 distinguishable particles on the complex line, $Y_3$. The second-order term of the hexagonator series is computed and found to agree with the "infinitesimal hexagonator" from the aforementioned work. Finally, we assume a coherent totally symmetric strict infinitesimal 2-braiding and prove that the Breen polytope axiom is satisfied by translating it into a 2-loop in $Y_3$.</description>

      <title>Brace $B_{\infty}$ algebras associated with Hopf algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the operadic modeling of brace $B_{\infty}$ algebras, as developed by Gerstenhaber and Voronov, to the context of Hopf algebroids in the sense of Xu. Specifically, we construct a strict $B_{\infty}$ isomorphism between the type I and type II twisted brace $B_{\infty}$ algebras arising from any twistor of a Hopf algebroid. As an application of this framework, we examine two specific brace $B_{\infty}$ algebras derived from Lie algebra pairs, and reveal previously obscured relationships between them. One of these is the dg Lie algebra governing deformations of algebraic dynamical twists, while the other arises from the quantum groupoid comprised of particular invariant differential operators.</description>

      <title>Quantum symmetry of $3$-transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum automorphism group of $3$-transitive graphs in this article. Those are highly symmetric graphs that were classified by Cameron and Macpherson in 1985, and we compute the quantum automorphism group of all such graphs, excluding the orthogonal graphs $\mathrm{O}^-(6,q)$ for $q&gt;3$. We show that there is no quantum symmetry for the McLaughlin graph and the orthogonal graphs $\mathrm{O}^-(6,q)$ with $q = 2, 3$, while that the quantum automorphism group of the affine polar graphs $\mathrm{VO}^{+}(2k,2)$ and $\mathrm{VO}^{-}(2k,2)$ are monoidally equivalent to $\mathrm{PO}(n)$ and $\mathrm{PSp}(n)$, respectively. We use planar algebras to obtain our results, where the $3$-transitivity of the graphs gives bounds on the dimensions of the $2$-- and $3$-box spaces of the associated planar algebras.</description>

      <title>The Order of the Monster Finite Simple Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the order of the largest of the twenty-six sporadic simple groups known as the Monster, using a straightforward computational approach. The Monster is here defined as a subgroup of the symmetry group of the 196884-dimensional Griess algebra generated by a group of type $2^{1+24}_+.Co_1$ and an additional triality automorphism. Our approach is based on counting arguments for certain idempotents of the Griess algebra called axes. Our proof is self-contained, requiring only established properties of the Conway group as the automorphism group of the Leech lattice, and some of its subgroups.
  Although our approach is conceptually simple, it requires extensive calculation inside a 196884-dimensional matrix group that current computer algebra systems cannot easily handle directly. Instead, we use the software package mmgroup, developed by the second author, which supports fast calculations inside the Monster. To our knowledge, this paper contains the first self-contained computation of the order of the Monster.
  The Monster also acts on the Moonshine module V^#, which is a vertex operator algebra of central charge c=24. We provide a new proof that the Monster is the full automorphism group of the Griess algebra and of the Moonshine module using Borcherds' proof of the Monstrous Moonshine conjectures. In addition, we show that the Monster has exactly two conjugacy classes of involutions. The order of the Baby Monster, the second largest of the sporadic simple groups, is also determined.</description>

      <title>Algebraic structures of Vassiliev invariants for knot families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore algebraic relations on Vassiliev knot invariants expressed through correlators in the 3-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. Vassiliev invariants form an infinite-dimensional algebra. We focus on $k$-parametric knot families with Vassiliev invariants being polynomials in family parameters. It turns out that such a 1-parametric algebra of Vassiliev invariants is always finitely generated, while in the case of more parameters, the number of generators can be infinite. Inside a knot family, there appear extra algebraic relations on Vassiliev invariants. We show that there are $\leq k$ algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants for a $k$-parametric knot family. However, in all our examples, the number of algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants is exactly $k$, and it is an open question if there exists a $k$-parametric knot family with a fewer number of algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants. We also demonstrate that a complete knot invariant of some $k$-parametric knot families consists of $\leq k$ Vassiliev invariants. Again, we have only examples of a set of $k$ Vassiliev invariants being a complete invariant of a $k$-parametric knot family. Currently, it is unknown whether a set of a fewer number of Vassiliev invariants cannot be a complete knot family invariant.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cluster State Spin Chain with Ising Fusion Category Symmetry: A Perspective from Weak Hopf SymTFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a construction of a cluster state lattice Hamiltonian that exhibits the symmetry of the Ising fusion algebra. This construction is formulated within the framework of weak Hopf symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), where we assign smooth and rough boundaries to the weak Hopf quantum double model, thereby extending the conventional cluster state model. Central to our construction is the weak Hopf Ising boundary tube algebra $\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}$, whose representation category is equivalent to the Ising fusion category $\mathsf{Ising}$. We take this algebra as the input data for the weak Hopf quantum double model. The resulting model exhibits Ising fusion symmetry on both open and closed $1\text{d}$ manifolds. On open manifolds, the symmetry is governed by $\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}} \otimes \mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee}$; on closed manifolds, it reduces to $\operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}) \otimes \operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee})$. Since the Ising fusion algebra embeds into $\operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee})$, the model faithfully realizes the symmetry of the Ising fusion category.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the long-standing problem of variational calculus on a noncommutative space or spacetime for a significant class of models with trivial jet bundle. Our approach entails a quantum version of the Anderson variational double complex $\Omega(J^\infty)$ and includes Euler-Lagrange equations and a partial Noether's theorem. We show in detail how this works for a free field on a $\Bbb Z^m$ lattice regarded as a discrete noncommutative geometry, obtaining the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar field, including with a general metric and gauge field background, as the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion for an action. In the case of a flat metric we also obtain an exactly on-shell conserved stress-energy tensor and Noether charges for a scalar field on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Wick theorem and matrix Capelli identity for quantum differential operators on Reflection Equation Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum differential operators on Reflection Equation Algebras, corresponding to Hecke symmetries R were introduced in previous publications. In the present paper we are mainly interested in quantum analogs of the Laplace and Casimir operators, which are invariant with respect to the action of the Quantum Groups U_q(sl(N)), provided R is the Drinfeld-Jimbo $R$-matrix. We prove that any such an operator maps the central characteristic subalgebra of a Reflection Equation algebra into itself. Also, we define the notion of normal ordering for the quantum differential operators and prove an analog of the Wick theorem for the product of partially ordered operators. As an important corollary we find a set of universal matrix Capelli identities generalizing the results of [Ok2] and [JLM]. Besides, we prove that the normal ordered form of any central differential operator from the characteristic subalgebra is also a central differential operator.</description>

      <title>Analytic Conformal Blocks of $C_2$-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras III: The Sewing-Factorization Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite VOA, not necessarily rational or self-dual. In this paper, we establish various versions of the sewing-factorization (SF) theorems for conformal blocks associated to grading-restricted generalized modules of $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$ (where $N\in\mathbb N$). In addition to the versions announced in the Introduction of [GZ23], we prove the following coend version of the SF theorem:
  Let $\mathfrak F$ be a compact Riemann surface with $N$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points, and let $\mathfrak G$ be another compact Riemann surface with $K$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points. Assign $\mathbb W\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes N})$ and $\mathbb X\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes K})$ to the incoming marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. For each $\mathbb{M} \in \mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes R})$, assign $\mathbb{M}$ and its contragredient $\mathbb M'$ to the outgoing marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. Denote the corresponding spaces of conformal blocks by $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb W)$ and $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak{G}}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes\mathbb X)$. Let the $\mathfrak X$ be the $(N+K)$-pointed surface obtained by sewing $\mathfrak F$, $\mathfrak G$ along their outgoing marked points. Then the sewing of conformal blocks-proved to be convergent in [GZ24]-yields an isomorphism of vector spaces $$\int^{\mathbb{M}\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes R})}\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb{W})\otimes_{\mathbb C} \mathscr T_{\mathfrak G}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes \mathbb X)\simeq\mathscr T_{\mathfrak X}^*(\mathbb W\otimes \mathbb X)$$
  We also discuss the relation between conformal blocks and the modular functors defined using Lyubashenko's coend in the case where $\mathbb V$ is strongly finite and rigid.</description>

The main theorem is that the fusion-equivariant stability conditions form a closed, complex submanifold of the moduli space of stability conditions on $D$. As an application of this framework to finite group actions on categories, we generalise a result of Macr\`{i}--Mehrotra--Stellari by establishing a biholomorphism between the space of $G$-invariant stability conditions on $D$ and the space of $rep(G)$-equivariant stability conditions on the equivariant category $D^G$. We also describe applications to the study of stability conditions associated to McKay quivers and to geometric stability conditions on free quotients of smooth projective varieties.</description>

      <title>Graded Frobenius Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a PROP which encodes 2D-TQFTs with a grading. This defines a graded Frobenius algebra as algebras over this PROP. We also give a description of graded Frobenius algebras in terms of maps and relations. This structure naturally arises as the cohomology of manifolds, loop homology and Hochschild homology of Frobenius algebras. In addition, we give a comprehensive description of the signs that arise in suspending algebras over PROPs.</description>

      <title>Good involutions of conjugation subquandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08090v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Posed by Taniguchi, the classification of quandles with good involutions is a difficult question with applications to surface-knot theory. We address this question for subquandles of conjugation quandles, including all core quandles. We also study good involutions of faithful racks. In particular, we obtain sharp bounds on the number of good involutions of racks in these families.
  As an application of our results, we implement group-theoretic algorithms that compute all good involutions of conjugation quandles and core quandles; we provide data for those up to order 23. As another application, we construct infinite families of connected, noninvolutory symmetric quandles.
  We also classify symmetric and Legendrian racks, quandles, and kei up to order 8 using a computer search. Finally, we exhibit an equivalence of categories between racks and Legendrian racks that induces an equivalence between involutory racks, Legendrian kei, and symmetric kei.</description>
