      <title>Submillimeter galaxy overdensities around physically associated quasar pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A commonly employed method to detect protoclusters in the young universe is the search for overdensities of massive star forming galaxies, such as submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), around high-mass halos, including those hosting quasars. In this work, we study the Megaparsec environment surrounding nine physically associated quasar pairs between $z=2.45$ and $z=3.82$ with JCMT/SCUBA-2 observations at 450 $\mu$m and 850 $\mu$m covering a field of view of roughly 13.7 arcmin in diameter (or 32 Mpc$^2$ at the median redshift) for each system. We identify a total of 170 SMG candidates and 26 non-SMG and interloper candidates. A comparison of the underlying 850 $\mu$m source models recovered with Monte Carlo simulations to the blank field model reveals galaxy overdensities in all fields, with a weighted average overdensity factor of $\delta_{\rm cumul} = 3.4 \pm 0.3$. From this excess emission at 850 $\mu$m, we calculate a star formation rate density of $1700 \pm 100$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, consistent with predictions from protocluster simulations and observations. Compared to fields around single quasars, those surrounding quasar pairs have higher excess counts and more centrally peaked star formation, further highlighting the co-evolution of SMGs and quasars. We do not find preferential alignment of the SMGs with the quasar pair direction or their associated Ly$\alpha$ nebulae, indicating that cosmic web filaments on different scales might be traced by the different directions. Overall, this work substantiates the reliability of quasar pairs to detect overdensities of massive galaxies and likely sites of protocluster formation. Future spectroscopic follow-up observations are needed to confirm membership of the SMG candidates with the physically associated quasar pairs and definitively identify the targeted fields as protoclusters.</description>

      <title>Modeling Gravitational Wave Bias from 3D Power Spectra of Spectroscopic Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for relating gravitational wave (GW) sources to the astrophysical properties of spectroscopic galaxy samples. We show how this can enable using clustering measurements of gravitational wave (GW) sources to infer the relationship between the GW sources and the astrophysical properties of their host galaxies. We accomplish this by creating mock GW catalogs from the spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 galaxy survey. We populate the GWs using a joint host-galaxy probability function defined over stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and metallicity. This probability is modeled as the product of three broken power-law distributions, each with a turnover point motivated by astrophysical processes governing the relation between current-day galaxy properties and BBH mergers, such as galaxy quenching and BBH delay time. Our results show that GW bias is most sensitive to host-galaxy probability dependence on stellar mass, with increases of up to $\sim O (10)\%$ relative to galaxy bias as the stellar mass pivot scale rises. We also find a notable relationship between GW bias and SFR: when the host-galaxy probability favors low-SFR galaxies, the GW bias significantly increases. In contrast, we observe no strong correlation between GW bias and metallicity. These findings suggest that the spatial clustering of GW sources is primarily driven by the stellar mass and SFR of their host galaxies and shows how GW bias measurements can inform models of the host-galaxy probability function.</description>

      <title>Galaxies at the edges: a complete census of MACS J0416.1-2403 cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous studies have established that the environment influences the physical properties of a galaxy. While gas inflows supply the fuel for SF, high density and temperature conditions suppress SF activity through various quenching processes. Investigations into large scale structures, such as filaments and overdense regions in the cluster outskirts, have focused on the low z. To move to intermediate z and explore galaxy pathways combined with environmental effects, it is crucial to join wide field spectroscopy and deep photometry. Our primary objective is to spectroscopically analyze the photometric overdensities observed by Estrada et al.(2023) in the outskirts of massive cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 (z=0.397), interpreted as evidence of ongoing group infall, i.e. the pre processing scenario, and to investigate the behavior of galaxies in the outskirts about their g-r color, Mstar, and local density, emphasizing the influence of the environment on galaxy evolution. We conducted a spectroscopic analysis out to 5.5R200, using the AAOmega spectrograph. The large FoV and depth allowed us to explore galaxies up to the cluster periphery and across a wide Mstar range, reaching down to the limit of dwarf galaxies. Redshifts were obtained through independent but comparable methods: Redrock, EZ, and Redmost. We identified 148 new spectroscopic cluster members from a sample of 1236 objects. We found 81 galaxies located in filamentary and overdense regions, supporting the role of filamentary infall in the cluster mass assembly history. Our analysis revealed that galaxies in high density regions are more massive, redder, and more passive, compared to galaxies in low density regions that appear to be bluer, less massive, and more SF. These findings underscore the significance of environmental effects and the role of pre processing in shaping galaxy properties before cluster infall.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes in cosmological simulations: growth prospects for supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been suggested that a fraction of the dark matter in the Universe could exist in the form of primordial black holes (PBHs) that have existed since the radiation dominated era. Recent studies have suggested that these PBHs may be the progenitors to the population of high-redshift, supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed since the launch of JWST. For the first time, we have included PBHs in cosmological simulations, to test whether PBHs can sink to the center of collapsing halos, locate dense gaseous regions experience significant growth. We tested PBH-to-DM mass ratios of $f_{\rm PBH}$ = $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$, with an initial PBH mass of 1000 M$_\odot$, as inspired by recent observational constraints. We find that at $f_{\rm PBH} = 10^{-3}$, a number of PBHs were able to embed themselves in dense gas and grow to $10^{4}$-$10^{5}$ M$_\odot$ by $z=20$. These intermediate black holes (IMBHs) are possible progenitors to the highest redshift SMBH observations such as GNZ-11 ($10^{6}$ M$_\odot$ by $z=10$), outperforming light seed black hole (BH) growth seen in recent simulations without the need to invoke heavy seeding prescriptions. On the other hand, $f_{\rm PBH} = 10^{-4}$ resulted in no significant BH growth, emphasizing that the ability of PBHs to act as SMBH seeds is sensitive to the true value of $f_{\rm PBH}$ in the Universe, and showing that the $f_{\rm PBH} =10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ boundary marks the threshold above which SMBH seeding via 1000 M$_\odot$ PBHs becomes effective. This is the first step towards building a realistic PBH framework in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an HI 21 cm absorption system at z=2.327 with CHIME</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of a new HI absorption system associated with the radio source NVSS J164725+375218 at a redshift of z=2.327, identified through a blind survey conducted by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). This marks the fifth detection of an associated system at z &gt; 2. By analyzing a subset of available data, we conducted a blind survey for HI absorption systems within the redshift range of 0.78 to 2.55 along 202 lines of sight in the declination range of 35 to 60 degrees. We detected three HI absorbers, including two previously known intervening systems and one newly discovered associated system. By fitting the absorption profile with a number of Gaussian functions, we put lower limits on the optical depth, velocity integrated optical depth and the ratio between the HI column density and the spin temperature of the absorption systems. These results represent a validation of CHIME's absorber search strategy, and demonstrate CHIME's ability to discover new absorbers even in small subsets of its full dataset.</description>

      <title>C and N abundances in globular clusters. I. The case of 47 Tuc and the effect of the first dredge-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters exhibit star-to-star chemical variations, traceable through both photometric and spectroscopic data. In this study, we investigate chemical variations in the globular cluster NGC104 (47Tucanae), aiming to trace multiple stellar populations across evolutionary phases and examine how the C/N anti-correlation evolves from the main sequence (MS) to the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). We also assess the impact of these populations on the interpretation of the V vs. V-I diagram. [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] abundances are obtained from CN and the CH features, while atmospheric parameters are homogeneously derived from photometry. The inferred abundances allow us to disentangle multiple populations along the CMD and refine cluster parameters. We find that MS stars are more C- and N-rich than their red giant branch, horizontal branch, and AGB counterparts. The C/N anti-correlation shifts during the sub-giant branch phase, coinciding with the first dredge-up. Interestingly, stars with different C and N abundances occupy distinct regions of the V vs V-I diagram, a pattern not attributable to differential reddening. Proper CMD fitting requires two isochrones with differing helium content, metallicity, and possibly age.</description>

      <title>Semi-empirical constraints on the HI mass function of star-forming galaxies and $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ at $z\sim 0.37$ from interferometric surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The HI mass function is a crucial tool to understand the evolution of the HI content in galaxies over cosmic times and to constrain both the baryon cycle in galaxy evolution and the reionization history of the Universe. We aim to derive semi-empirical constraints at $z\sim 0.37$ by combining literature results on the stellar mass function from optical surveys with recent findings on the $M_{\rm HI}-M_\star$ scaling relation derived via spectral stacking analysis applied to 21-cm line interferometric data from the MIGHTEE and CHILES surveys, conducted with MeerKAT and the VLA, respectively. We draw synthetic stellar mass samples directly from the publicly-available results underlying the analysis of the COSMOS2020 galaxy photometric sample. Afterwards, we convert $M_\star$ into $M_{\rm HI}$ using analytical fitting functions to the data points from HI stacking. We then fit a Schechter function to the median HIMF from all the samples via MCMC. We finally derive the posterior distribution for $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ by integrating the models for the HIMF built from the posteriors samples of the Schechter parameters. We find evolution of the HIMF at $z\sim 0.37$ with respect to results at $z\sim 0$ from the ALFALFA survey and at $z\sim 1$ from uGMRT data. Our results for $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ are in broad agreement with other literature results, and follow the trend on $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ as a function of redshift. The derived value $\Omega_{\rm HI}=\left(7.02^{+0.59}_{-0.52}\right)\times10^{-4}$ at $z\sim 0.37$ from the combined analysis deviates at $ \sim 2.9\sigma$ from the ALFALFA result at $z\sim 0$. We conclude that the HIMF and $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ constraints that we derive from state-of-the-art deep interferometric surveys suggest an evolution of the HIMF and of the cosmic HI density, supporting a picture of smooth transition of the HI content of galaxies from $z\sim 0$ to $z\sim 1$.</description>

      <title>Circum-nuclear eccentric gas flow in the Galactic Center revealed by ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the CS (J=2-1) line cube from the internal data release obtained by the large-scale program "ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES)" to investigate the kinematic structure of the innermost $\sim 10$ pc region of the Galaxy, which contains the high-velocity compact cloud (HVCC) at $(l,b,v_{\rm lsr})\sim(+0^\circ.02,-0^\circ.02, 100 {\rm km~s}^{-1})$ (hereafter G0.02). The longitude-velocity diagram (LVD) of the cloud draws an elliptical structure, which is interpreted as an orbital trajectory in the $(l,V_{\rm lsr})$ space of a noncircular (eccentric) motion of the molecular gas in the gravitational potential of an extended mass distribution in the central 10 pc of the Galaxy. We argue that G0.02 is a kinematic tracer of the inner potential, a rare case of a dense gas following an eccentric orbit in the nuclear gravitational field.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the outer disk of eXtended-UV galaxies in the optical domain with deep surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims : Extended-UV (XUV) galaxies are galaxies presenting an extended outer ultraviolet disks. Although some Giant Low Surface Brightness (GLSB) galaxies are also XUV, their relation has been seldom studied. This work aims to determine whether a sample of nine XUV galaxies can be classified as GLSBs, by analyzing their photometric properties in deep optical images. Method : The method presented here uses optical data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to construct surface brightness (SB) profiles for each galaxy. A characteristic UV radius is defined to examine the XUV disks. The surface brightness profiles are fitted using simple exponential functions, and the extracted parameters are compared with the literature to identify possible GLSB galaxies. We examined also other diagnostics, including color profiles. Results : The analysis of the optical surface brightness profiles of XUV galaxies reveal that they can be classified into three different families. One third meet the GLSB criteria in terms of diffuseness, another third are regular, and the remaining have a stronger decline in the outer disk than in the inner disk, opposite to GLSBs. The color profiles allowed us, in addition to distinguish one of the galaxy, NGC1140, likely resulting from a rare dwarf-dwarf merger.</description>

      <title>Hydroxylated Mg-rich amorphous silicates as catalysts for molecular hydrogen formation in the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from an experimental study on the interaction of atomic deuterium with Mg-rich amorphous enstatite and forsterite type silicates. Infrared spectroscopy was used to examine the process. During D atom exposure, deuteroxyl group formation was observed. The cross section for OD group formation, estimated from the OD stretching band intensity with D atom fluence, is 4.2.10^{-18} cm^2 for both silicates. HD (D2) molecules form via D atom abstraction of chemisorbed H(D) atoms from OH (OD) groups, with a cross section of 7.0.10^{-18} cm^2. Quantum chemical calculations on enstatite and forsterite amorphous nano-clusters were used to analyze chemisorption and abstraction energies of H atoms. The formation of OH groups on forsterite is barrierless, while enstatite has a small energy barrier. H2 abstraction from hydroxyl groups is barrierless in both silicates. The results support our interpretation of IR spectral changes during D atom exposure as addition and exchange reactions, with catalytic molecular deuterium formation. These findings, obtained at 300 K, are relevant to astrophysical environments like photodissociation regions and interstellar clouds at lower temperatures. Amorphous silicates, like carbon grains, undergo hydrogenation in the diffuse interstellar medium due to interactions with atomic hydrogen and UV photons. The detection of these components on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko connects primitive solar system objects to interstellar dust, offering new insights into their evolution.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a Population of Strong Galaxy-Galaxy Lensed Faint Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurements of the number density of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses can be used to put statistical constraints on the foreground mass distributions. Dusty galaxies uncovered in submillimeter surveys are particularly useful in this regard because of the large volume probed by these surveys. Previous discoveries of strong galaxy-galaxy lensed dusty galaxies are predominantly the brightest in the sky discovered by Herschel, SPT, and Planck. However, models have also predicted a non-negligible fraction of strong galaxy-galaxy lensed faint dusty galaxies, which were difficult to confirm due to technical difficulties. Utilizing the deepest SCUBA-2 submillimeter survey, STUDIES, in both the COSMOS and the UDS fields, together with a red JWST color selection method, we discover a population of 13 strong galaxy-galaxy lensed faint dusty galaxies. The rich ancillary data allow us to confirm their strongly lensed nature via estimates of redshifts and lens modeling. Our systematic search has allowed us to construct the 450$\mu$m number counts of strongly lensed sources down to the flux levels about an order of magnitude fainter than previous measurements. The measured lensing fractions of $\sim$1% are consistent with predictions from models that also successfully produce the number density of the strong galaxy-galaxy lensed bright dusty galaxies. Future searches from Euclid and Roman are expected to discover orders of magnitude more strongly lensed faint dusty galaxies.</description>

The massive track connects the super-bright galaxies at cosmic dawn ($z&gt;8$) to the super-massive quiescent galaxies and black holes (BHs) at cosmic morning ($z=4-7$). The dark-matter halos $&gt;10^{10.5}M_\odot$ at $z=10$ are expected to undergo feedback-free starbursts (FFB) with high star-formation efficiency in dense star clusters within compact galaxies. The less massive halos avoid FFB and form stars gradually under stellar feedback, leading to the peak star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon ($z=1-3$). The FFB and non-FFB halos originate from $&gt;4\sigma$ and $2-3\sigma$ density peaks, respectively. The post-FFB galaxies quench their star formation soon after the FFB phase and remain quiescent due to (a) gas depletion by the FFB starbursts and outflows, (b) compaction events driven by angular-momentum loss in colliding streams within the high-sigma-peak FFB halos, (c) turbulent circum-galactic medium (CGM) that suppresses feeding by cold streams, and (d) BH feedback, being a key for complete quenching. BH feedback is enhanced by FFB-driven BH seeding and growth. It seems capable of disrupting the streams by generating CGM turbulence or photo-heating, but this remains an open challenge. The cosmic-morning quiescent galaxies are expected to be massive, compact, showing signatures of compaction, outflows and AGN, with a comoving number density $\sim 10^{-5} {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$, comparable to the super-bright galaxies at cosmic dawn and the AGN at cosmic morning. Their UV luminosity function should peak about $M_{\rm uv} \sim -22$ and contribute $\sim 10\%$ of the galaxies there.</description>

      <title>HeII emitters in the cosmic noon and beyond. Characterising the HeII {\lambda}1640 emission with MUSE and JWST/NIRSpec</title>

Abstract: The study of high-redshift galaxies provides critical insights into the early stages of cosmic evolution, particularly during the so-called 'cosmic noon', when star formation activity reached its peak. Within this context, the origin of the nebular emission remains an open question. In this work, we conduct a systematic, multi-wavelength investigation of a sample of z ~ 2-4 emitters from the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field surveys, utilising both MUSE and JWST/NIRSpec data and extending the sample presented by previous studies. We derive gas-phase metallicities and key physical properties, including electron densities, temperatures and the production rates of hydrogen- and He+-ionising photons. Our results suggest that a combination of factors-such as stellar mass, initial mass function, stellar metallicity, and stellar multiplicity-likely contributes to the origin of the observed nebular emission. Specifically, for our galaxies with higher gas-phase metallicity (12 + log(O/H) &gt; 7.55), we find that models for binary population with Salpeter IMF (Mup=100 Msol) and stellar metallicity ~ 0.001 (i.e., similar to that of the gas) can reproduce the observed ionising conditions. However at lower metallicities, models for binary population with `top-heavy' initial mass function (Mup = 300 Msol) and Zstar much lower &lt; Zstar) than that of the gas are required to fully account for the observed ionising photon production. These results reinforce that the ionisation keeps challenging current stellar populations, and the ionisation problem persists in the very low metallicity regime.</description>

      <title>The Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array Local Group L-band Survey (LGLBS)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Local Group L-Band Survey (LGLBS), a Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) survey producing the highest quality 21-cm and 1-2 GHz radio continuum images to date for the six VLA-accessible, star-forming, Local Group galaxies. Leveraging the VLA's spectral multiplexing power, we simultaneously survey the 21-cm line at high 0.4 km/s velocity resolution, the 1-2 GHz polarized continuum, and four OH lines. For the massive spiral M31, the dwarf spiral M33, and the dwarf irregular galaxies NGC6822, IC10, IC1613, and the Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte Galaxy (WLM), we use all four VLA configurations and the Green Bank Telescope to reach angular resolutions of $&lt; 5''$ ($10{-}20$~pc) for the 21-cm line with $&lt;10^{20}$~cm$^{-2}$ column density sensitivity, and even sharper views ($&lt; 2''$; $5{-}10$~pc) of the continuum. Targeting these nearby galaxies ($D\lesssim1$ Mpc) reveals a sharp, resolved view of the atomic gas, including 21-cm absorption, and continuum emission from supernova remnants and HII regions. These datasets can be used to test theories of the abundance and formation of cold clouds, the driving and dissipation of interstellar turbulence, and the impact of feedback from massive stars and supernovae. Here, we describe the survey design and execution, scientific motivation, data processing, and quality assurance. We provide a first look at and publicly release the wide-field 21-cm HI data products for M31, M33, and four dwarf irregular targets in the survey, which represent some of the highest physical resolution 21-cm observations of any external galaxies beyond the LMC and SMC.</description>

      <title>Stellar Velocity Dispersion versus Age: Consistency across Observations and Simulations, with the Milky Way as an Outlier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within disk galaxies, the velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, of stars increases with age, $\tau$, as measured in the Milky Way (MW) and nearby galaxies. This relation provides a key window into galactic formation history, tracing both the kinematics of stars at birth and the dynamical heating of stars after birth. We compile and compare observational measurements of the MW, M31, M33, and 16 galaxies from the PHANGS survey. The MW exhibits significantly colder stellar kinematics, with 2-3 times lower $\sigma(\tau)/v_{\phi,0}$ at a given age, than all but one other observed galaxy. Therefore, the MW is a kinematic outlier. To assess how measurement effects influence $\sigma(\tau)$, we analyze the FIRE-2 cosmological simulations, quantifying the impact of uncertainties in stellar age, aperture size, galactocentric radius, and galaxy inclination. Aperture size and galactocentric radius affect $\sigma(\tau)$ by up to a factor of $\approx2$ for stars younger than 100 Myr, with milder effects on older stars. Age uncertainties up to 40\% change the \textit{value} of $\sigma(\tau)$ at a given age by $\lesssim20\%$ but can reshape the relation with age and erase merger signatures. We compare $\sigma(\tau)/v_{\phi,0}$ in FIRE-2 simulations with observations. FIRE-2 agrees well with M31 and M33 at all measured ages, and with PHANGS for stars older than $\approx500$ Myr. The average $\sigma(\tau)/v_{\phi,0}$ in FIRE-2 is about two times higher than the MW at most ages, but the youngest stars show better agreement. The velocity ratios ($\sigma_{\phi}/\sigma_{R}$, $\sigma_{Z}/\sigma_{\phi}$, $\sigma_{Z}/\sigma_{R}$) in FIRE-2 broadly agree with the MW. We conclude that $\sigma(\tau)$ in FIRE-2, and most cosmological zoom-in simulations, reasonably matches observed nearby galaxies, but matching the MW is rare, because it is a kinematic outlier.</description>

      <title>Chemo-dynamics of the stellar component of the Sculptor dwarf galaxy II: dynamical properties and dark matter halo density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies satellite of the Milky Way are excellent laboratories for testing dark matter (DM) models and baryonic feedback implementation in simulations. The Sculptor 'classical' dwarf spheroidal galaxy, a system with two distinct stellar populations and high-quality data, offers a remarkable opportunity to study DM distributions in these galaxies. In this work, we infer the DM halo density distribution of Sculptor, applying a method based on spherically symmetric distribution functions depending on actions to fit the stellar structural and kinematic properties of Sculptor. The galaxy is represented via four components: two distinct stellar populations based on distribution functions, tracers within a fixed and dominant DM potential, plus the contribution of a third stellar component that accounts for possible sources of contamination. The model-data comparison accounts for the kinematics and metallicities of individual stars, allowing us to assign probabilities of membership to each star. The modeling is applied on the largest available set of spectroscopic data, which have not been previously analyzed with this objective. We find the DM distribution of Sculptor to have a logarithmic inner slope of 0.39+0.23-0.26 and a scale radius of 0.79+0.38-0.17 kpc at 1 sigma confidence level. Our results show that Sculptor DM density profile deviates from predictions of DM-only simulations at a 3 sigma level over a large range of radii. Our analysis suggests that the velocity distribution of Sculptor's two main stellar components is isotropic in the center and becomes radially anisotropic in the outskirts. Additionally, we provide predictions for the projected radial and tangential velocity dispersion profiles. We also present updated DM annihilation and decay J- and D-factors, finding J = 18.15+0.11-0.12 and D = 18.07+0.10-0.10 for an angular aperture of 0.5 degrees.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-Faint, Chemically Primitive Galaxy Forming at the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of the first stars and galaxies marked the onset of cosmic structure and chemical enrichment, yet direct observations of such primordial systems remain elusive. Here we present James Webb Space Telescope spectroscopic observations of LAP1-B, an ultra-faint galaxy at redshift z_{spec}=6.625 +/-0.001, corresponding to a cosmic age of 800 million years after the Big Bang, strongly magnified by gravitational lensing. LAP1-B exhibits a gas-phase oxygen abundance of (4.2 +/- 1.8) x 10^{-3} times the solar value, making it the most chemically primitive galaxy ever identified at any epoch to date. The galaxy displays an exceptionally hard ionizing radiation field, which is inconsistent with chemically enriched stellar populations or accreting black holes, but consistent with theoretical predictions for zero-metallicity stars. It also shows an elevated carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratio for its metallicity in the interstellar medium, matching nucleosynthetic yields expected from stellar population formed in the absence of initial metals. The lack of detectable stellar continuum constrains the stellar mass to &lt;2700 Msun, while the dynamical mass, derived from emission-line kinematics, exceeds the combined stellar and gas mass by more than two orders of magnitude, indicating the presence of a dominant dark matter halo. These observations establish LAP1-B as the most chemically primitive star-forming galaxy yet identified, offering a rare window into the earliest stages of galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field in the Lobes of the Seyfert Galaxy NGC3516: Suggestions of a Helical field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present polarization images from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Giant {Metrewave} Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 5.5, 10 GHz and 663 MHz of the changing-look (CL) AGN, NGC3516. A transverse gradient in the rotation measure (RM) is detected in the northern and southern kpc-scale lobes. Such gradients have typically been suggested to be signatures of a helical magnetic (B-) field. We detect circular polarization in the core and inner jet-knot of this source which is known to host a precessing radio jet interacting with emission-line gas. Soft X-ray emission from the Chandra X-ray Observatory suggests the presence of a hot wind emerging from the nucleus of NGC3516. Taken together with the RM gradient, this presents a picture of jet+wind outflow in this Seyfert galaxy with the B-field confining both the jet and lobe emission. A magnetically driven outflow may in turn cause accretion disk warping and jet precession which is observed in the case of NGC3516.</description>

      <title>Effective supernova dust yields from rotating and non-rotating stellar progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernovae (SNe) are believed to be the dominant sources of dust production at high redshift. However, the reverse shock generated by the interaction of the SN forward shock and the interstellar medium (ISM) significantly reduces the mass of newly formed dust in SN ejecta. This study quantifies the mass, composition, and grain size distribution of surviving dust after the passage of the reverse shock using the GRASHrev model. Our analysis covers a grid of SN models with progenitor masses $13\,M_\odot\leq m_\star\leq120M_\odot$, metallicity $-3\leq\text{[Fe/H]}\leq0$, and rotation velocities $v = 0$ and $300\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The SN explosions occur in a uniform ISM with densities $n_\text{ISM} = 0.05, 0.5$, and $5\text{ cm}^{-3}$. We find that the larger grains ($\gtrsim10\text{ nm}$) are more resistant to destruction by the reverse shock, with amorphous carbon dominating the surviving dust mass in most models. The surviving dust mass decreases with increasing ISM density. For non-rotating progenitors, the maximum mass of dust surviving the passage of the reverse shock is $\simeq 0.02\,M_\odot$ released by SN explosions of a $120\,M_\odot$ progenitor with $\text{[Fe/H]}=0$ in the ISM density $0.5\,\text{cm}^{-3}$, corresponding to $\simeq4\%$ of the initial dust mass before the passage of the reverse shock. Among rotating progenitors, a maximum surviving mass fraction is $\simeq5\%$ with a final dust mass $\simeq0.03\,M_\odot$ in $\text{[Fe/H]}=-1$ models. Although the reverse shock has a strong destructive impact, our results indicate that, on very short timescales, SNe can enrich the ISM with carbonaceous grains ranging in size from approximately $1\text{ nm}$ to $100\text{ nm}$ (up to $\simeq1\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ in non-rotating models). This is notable given the detection of the 2175 \r{A} extinction bump in galaxies at $z&gt;6$, suggesting the early presence of such dust.</description>

      <title>MIGHTEE-HI: The direct detection of neutral hydrogen in galaxies at $z&gt;0.25$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic hydrogen constitutes the gas reservoir from which molecular gas and star formation in galaxies emerges. However, the weakness of the line means it has been difficult to directly detect in all but the very local Universe. Here we present results from the first search using the MeerKAT International Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) Survey for high-redshift ($z&gt;0.25$) H{\sc i} emission from individual galaxies. By searching for 21-cm emission centered on the position and redshift of optically-selected emission-line galaxies we overcome difficulties that hinder untargeted searches. We detect 11 galaxies at $z&gt;0.25$, forming the first sample of $z&gt;0.25$ detections with an interferometer, with the highest redshift detection at $z = 0.3841$. We find they have much larger H{\sc i} masses than their low-redshift H{\sc i}-selected counterparts for a given stellar mass. This can be explained by the much larger cosmological volume probed at these high redshifts, and does not require any evolution of the H{\sc i} mass function. We make the first-ever measurement of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (bTFr) with H{\sc i} at $z&gt;0.25$ and find consistency with the local bTFr, but with tentative evidence of a flattening in the relation at these redshifts for higher-mass objects. This may signify evolution, in line with predictions from hydrodynamic simulations, or that the molecular gas mass in these high-mass galaxies could be significant. This study paves the way for future studies of H{\sc i} beyond the local Universe, using both searches targeted at known objects and via pure H{\sc i} selection.</description>

      <title>Patchy Helium and Hydrogen Reionization from the Kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect and Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments will measure temperature fluctuations on small angular scales with unprecedented precision, enabling improved measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. This secondary anisotropy has emerged as a valuable probe of the distribution of ionized electrons in the post-recombination Universe. Although the sensitivity of the kSZ effect has recently been utilized to study the high-redshift epoch of hydrogen (H) reionization, its redshift-integrated nature -- combined with anticipated improvements in measurement precision -- suggests that accounting for the later epoch of helium (He) reionization will become increasingly important in the near future. Joint characterization of the epochs will allow for a more coherent understanding of early-star and -quasar formation, as these sources drive the ionization of H and He in the intergalactic medium. In this paper, we extend the kSZ higher-order statistic introduced by Smith \&amp; Ferraro (2017) to forecast the ability of upcoming CMB surveys to probe the morphology of both H and He reionization. Moreover, given that upcoming large-scale structure surveys will trace density fluctuations at redshifts overlapping with the epoch of He reionization, we propose a novel cross-correlation between the kSZ higher-order statistic and galaxy survey measurements. Using a joint information-matrix analysis of H and He reionization, we show that next-generation CMB and galaxy surveys will have sufficient statistical power to characterize the patchy morphology of H reionization and set constraints on the redshift evolution of its He counterpart.</description>

      <title>JWST lens model for A370: A very low dark matter fraction for a brightest cluster galaxy and lensing properties for the Dragon arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new lens model for the $z=0.375$ galaxy cluster Abell 370 based on previously spectroscopically confirmed lensed galaxies and new lensed systems identified in JWST data, including recent data from the MAGNIF program. Based on the best models able to reproduce two radial arcs near the BCGs, we compare the stellar mass to the total mass from the lens model and find that the fraction of dark matter in the south BCG is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM while in the north BCG we find a very small amount of dark matter, more consistent with alternative models to $\Lambda$CDM. We discuss possible causes for this and conclude that additional data is needed to clarify the situation. We study the lensing properties, magnification, time delay and strength of the critical curve, along the Dragon arc, where previous studies have reported tens of alleged microlensing events from supergiant stars at $z=0.7251$. The new lens model is able to reproduce the distribution of microlensing events with great accuracy. Some of the microlensing events may be reinterpreted as long-period Cepheid in future observations. We consider this possibility and study in more detail the challenges for such detection from intervening microlenses.</description>

Abstract: We report our discovery of a faint nebula surrounding a previously little-studied 15th-mag variable star, ASASSN-19ds, in the southern-hemisphere constellation Antlia. Spectra verify that the star is a cataclysmic variable (CV). Using new and archival photometry, we confirm that ASASSN-19ds is an eclipsing binary with an orbital period of 0.139 days (3.34 hr). Moreover, its out-of-eclipse brightness shows a "sawtooth" light curve with an amplitude of $\sim$1~mag and an interval between peaks that varies between about three to nearly five weeks. Its mean absolute magnitude in the Gaia system is $M_G=+6.5$. These combined properties lead to a classification of ASASSN-19ds as a Z Camelopardalis-type CV. We obtained deep narrow-band images of the nebulosity, using modest-sized telescopes and extremely long exposure times. Our imagery reveals a bipolar morphology, with thin arcs at the ends of the major axis, likely indicating an interaction with the interstellar medium. We consider several scenarios for the origin of the nebula, but from the existing information we are unable to distinguish between it being ejecta from an unobserved classical-nova outburst several centuries ago, or an ancient planetary nebula. Future observations should be able to decide between these possibilities. At the star's distance of only $\sim$557 pc, a nova eruption would have been a spectacular naked-eye event.</description>

      <title>FAUST XXVII: The circumbinary disk and the outflow of the L 1551 IRS 5 binary system</title>

Abstract: Using continuum and $\text{C}^{18}\text{O}\:(2-1)$ line data obtained from the large ALMA program FAUST, we studied the structure of the protostellar binary system L1551 IRS5 at scales between 30 and 3,000 au to constrain its properties, from the circumstellar and circumbinary disks up to the envelope and outflow scales, which exhibits complex and entangled structures at the scales of its inner and outer envelopes, presumably caused by the influence of the central binary. Assuming a dust-to-gas ratio of 100, we calculated the dust+gas mass for the circumbinary disk and each circumstellar disk of the binary, obtaining 0.018 M$_{\odot}$, for the circumbinary disk, 0.004 M$_{\odot}$, and 0.002 M$_{\odot}$, for the northern and southern circumstellar disk respectively. From the line emission, we retrieved the gas masses for each structure component. With the $\text{C}^{18}\text{O}\:(2-1)$ PV diagram along the circumbinary disk, we were able to constrain the centrifugal barrier, $r_{CB}=55$ au, update the specific angular momentum, $j\sim270$~au~km~s$^{-1}$. We built an analytical model that can be used to predict the influence of the morphology of the outflow and a few dynamic features that can reproduce the system emission, allowing us to explain and discern the outflow contribution from the complex emission due to the binary. Additionally, we inferred the density power law index, $\alpha=1.7$, and the envelope rotation velocity, $v_{c}=2$~km~s$^{-1}$. Finally, the observations gave us the physical constraints to obtain a coherent outflow model for L1551 IRS5.</description>

      <title>Differences in the Physical Properties of Satellite Galaxies within Relaxed and Disturbed Galaxy Groups and Clusters</title>

Abstract: Galaxy groups and clusters are the most massive collapsed structures in the Universe. Those structures are formed by collapsing with other smaller structures. Groups and cluster mergers provide an appropriate environment for the evolution and transformation of their galaxies. The merging process of groups and clusters can affect the properties of their galaxy populations. Our aim is to characterise the distribution of galaxies' colour, specific star formation rate, quenched galaxy fraction, and gas availability in galaxies bounded to groups and clusters and to examine how these properties relate to the dynamical state of their host environments. We used the most massive halos ($M &gt; 10^{13} M_{\odot}$) in Illustris TNG100 simulations and separated the sample into two categories: relaxed and disturbed halos. This classification was done based on the offset between the position of the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) and the centre of mass of the gas. Subsequently, we classified their galaxy populations into red and blue galaxies using a threshold derived from a double Gaussian fit to their colour distribution. Our findings reveal differences in physical properties such as colour, star formation rates, and gas availability among satellite galaxies bound to interacting clusters compared to relaxed clusters. Disturbed clusters exhibit more blue, star-forming galaxies than their relaxed counterparts. This discrepancy in the fraction of blue and star-forming galaxies can be attributed to higher gas availability, including hot, diffuse, and condensed gas in satellite galaxies in disturbed clusters compared to relaxed ones. Furthermore, our study shows that during cluster mergers, there are two crucial phases; at the beginning of the interaction, there is an important boost in the star formation rate followed by suppression as the cluster reaches the equilibrium state.</description>

Abstract: High spatial and spectral resolution observations are essential for identifying sub-arcsecond dual and lensed quasars and confirming their redshifts. We present Gemini/GMOS and HST/STIS optical spectra for 27 dual quasar candidates selected based on their variability-induced astrometric noise or double detections in Gaia (the VODKA project). From this follow-up, we spectroscopically identify 11 star superpositions and 7 dual/lensed quasars. Among the remaining targets, 2 are likely dual/lensed quasars based on additional radio imaging, while the rest are quasars with unknown companions. Without prior photometric or spectroscopic selection, we find the star contamination rate to be 41-67%, while the dual/lensed quasar fraction is $\gtrsim$ 26% in the follow-up VODKA sample. However, when combined with existing unresolved spectra and spatially-resolved two-band color cuts, the dual/lensed quasar fraction can be increased to $\gtrsim$ 67%. Our study highlights the need for high-quality spectral data, including a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 20, spatial resolution that is at least twice finer than the source separation, and a spectral resolution of $R \gtrsim 1000$, in order to separate close sources, exclude stellar superpositions, and reliably identify dual quasars.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray-Driven Galactic Winds with Resolved ISM and Ion-Neutral Damping</title>

Abstract: Feedback processes in galaxies dictate their structure and evolution. Baryons can be cycled through stars, which inject energy into the interstellar medium (ISM) in supernova explosions, fueling multiphase galactic winds. Cosmic rays (CRs) accelerated at supernova remnants are an important component of feedback. CRs can effectively contribute to wind driving; however, their impact heavily depends on the assumed CR transport model. We run high-resolution "tallbox" simulations of a patch of a galactic disk using the moving mesh magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO, including varied CR implementations and the CRISP non-equilibrium thermochemistry model. We characterize the impact of CR feedback on star formation and multiphase outflows. While CR-driven winds are able to supply energy to a global-scale wind, a purely thermal wind loses most of its energy by the time it reaches 3 kpc above the disk midplane. We further find that the adopted CR transport model significantly affects the steady-state of the wind. In the model with CR advection, streaming, diffusion, and nonlinear Landau damping, CRs provide very strong feedback. Additionally accounting for ion-neutral damping (IND) decouples CRs from the cold ISM, which reduces the impact of CRs on the star formation rate. Nevertheless, CRs in this most realistic model are able to accelerate warm gas and levitate cool gas in the wind but have little effect on cold gas and hot gas. This model displays moderate mass loading and significant CR energy loading, demonstrating that IND does not prevent CRs from providing effective feedback.</description>

      <title>The PICS Project. I. The impact of metallicity and helium abundance on the bright end of the planetary nebula luminosity function</title>

Abstract: Planetary nebulae (PNe) and their luminosity function (PNLF) in galaxies have been used as a cosmic distance indicator for decades, yet a fundamental understanding is still lacking to explain the universality of the PNLF among different galaxies. Models for the PNLF have generally assumed solar metallicities and artificial stellar populations. In this work, we investigate how metallicity and helium abundances affect the PNe and PNLF, and the importance of the initial-to-final mass relation (IFMR), to resolve the tension between PNLF observations and models. We introduce PICS (PNe In Cosmological Simulations), a PN model framework that accounts for metallicity and is applicable to realistic stellar populations from cosmological simulations and observations. The framework combines stellar evolution models with post-AGB tracks, PN models, and circumnebular extinction to obtain PNe from a parent stellar population. We find that metallicity plays an important role for the resulting PNe: old metal-rich populations can harbor much brighter PNe than old metal-poor ones. We show that the helium abundance is a vital ingredient at high metallicities and explore the impact on the PNLF of a possible saturation of helium at high metallicities. We present PNLF grids for different stellar ages and metallicities, where the observed PNLF bright end can be reached even for old stellar populations of 10 Gyr at high metallicities. Finally, we find that the PNLFs of old stellar populations are sensitive to the IFMR, allowing for the production of bright PNe. With PICS, we have laid the groundwork for studying how different models affect the PNe and PNLF. Two central ingredients for this are the metallicity and helium abundance. Future applications of PICS include modeling PNe in a cosmological framework to explain the origin of the universal PNLF cutoff and using it as a diagnostic tool for galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>MaNGA AGN dwarf galaxies (MAD) -- III. The role of mergers and environment in AGN activity in dwarf galaxies</title>

Abstract: Investigating whether and how galaxy mergers affect black hole growth can be determinant for black hole-galaxy evolution models and, in particular, for understanding how early Universe seed black holes grew to become supermassive. However, while mergers have been observed to enhance the active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, and thus black hole growth in massive galaxies, it is yet not known how this relation and the role of the environment translates to dwarf galaxies (the most likely hosts of the early seed black holes), since there are scarce and mixed results in the literature. We want to assess the impact of galaxy mergers and the environment on AGN triggering in dwarf galaxies. We use a sample of 3280 dwarf galaxies with integral-field spectroscopic data from the MaNGA survey to study the AGN fraction throughout the merger process and how it is affected by the environment (characterized by galaxy isolation, being in a void, and group richness). We also compare the fraction of interacting galaxies in AGN and non-AGN dwarf galaxies. We find that dwarf galaxy mergers can ignite AGNs at separations below 20 kpc. The AGN fraction increases notoriously after the first pass and remains enhanced until the final stage. Despite this, mergers are not the dominant AGN triggering mechanism. We also find that the environment has a non-negligible impact on AGN activity in dwarf galaxies, as the AGN fraction increases when moving to lower density environments. These findings provide the most statistically robust constraints to date on the effects of dwarf galaxy mergers and environment on AGN activity and black hole growth.</description>

      <title>Identifying Dwarfs of MC Analog GalaxiEs (ID-MAGE): The Search for Satellites Around Low-Mass Hosts</title>

Abstract: We present results from ID-MAGE (Identifying Dwarfs of MC Analog GalaxiEs), a survey aimed at identifying and characterizing unresolved satellite galaxies around 36~nearby LMC- and SMC-mass hosts (D$=$4$-$10~Mpc). We use archival DESI Legacy Survey imaging data and perform an extensive search for dwarf satellites, extending out to a radius of 150~kpc ($\sim$$R_{vir}$). We identify 355 candidate satellite galaxies, including 264 new discoveries. Extensive tests with injected galaxies demonstrate that the survey is complete down to $M_V\sim-$9.0 (assuming the distance of the host) and $\mu_{0,V}\sim$26 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ (assuming a n$=$1 S\'ersic profile). We perform consistent photometry, via S\'ersic profile fitting, on all candidates and have initiated a comprehensive follow-up campaign to confirm and characterize candidates. Through a systematic visual inspection campaign, we classify the top candidates as high-likelihood satellites. On average, we find 4.0$\pm$1.4 high-likelihood candidate satellites per LMC-mass host and 2.1$\pm$0.6 per SMC-mass host which is within the range predicted by cosmological models. We use this sample to establish upper and lower estimates on the satellite luminosity function of LMC/SMC-mass galaxies. ID-MAGE nearly triples the number of low-mass galaxies surveyed for satellites with well-characterized completeness limits, providing a unique dataset to explore small-scale structure and dwarf galaxy evolution around low-mass hosts in diverse environments.</description>

Abstract: We study the G013.313+0.193 G013.313 region, a complex environment characterized by molecular cloud interactions indicative of cloud-cloud collision (CCC). Observations of the NH3(1,1) and (2,2) inversion transitions were obtained using the Nanshan 26 m radio telescope, while HCO+ (1-0), 12CO, 13CO, and C18O(1-0) transitions from the Purple Mountain Observatory Delingha 14 m telescope. Archival data are also included. We identified key observational signatures of CCC, including complementary spatial distributions, U-shaped structures, bridge features, and V-shaped velocity distributions. The position-velocity diagrams (P-V) reveal clear indications of gas interaction between two velocity components, suggesting an ongoing collision at an estimated angle of approximately 45 degree to the line of sight. The estimated collision timescale is 0.35-1.03 Myr, aligned with the inferred ages of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the region, supporting the hypothesis of collision-induced star formation. Hub-filament system (HFS) are identified in the compressed gas region, where filaments converge toward a dense hub, suggesting the CCC as a potential driver of HFS formation and massive star formation. The high column density suggests favorable conditions for the formation of massive stars. Although alternative kinematic drivers such as longitudinal collapse and shear motion are considered, CCC remains the most plausible explanation for the observed features. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of cloud dynamics and massive star formation in turbulent molecular environments.</description>

      <title>First Detections of PN, PO, and PO+ toward a Shocked Low-mass Starless Core</title>

Abstract: Phosphorus is a key element that plays an essential role in biological processes important for living organisms on Earth. The origin and connection of phosphorus-bearing molecules to early Solar system objects and star-forming molecular clouds is therefore of great interest, yet there are limited observations throughout different stages of low-mass ($M &lt; $ a few M$_\odot$) star formation. Observations from the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes detect for the first time in the 7mm, 3mm, and 2mm bands multiple transitions of PN and PO, as well as a single transition of PO$^{+}$, toward a low-mass starless core. The presence of PN, PO and PO$^{+}$ is kinematically correlated with bright SiO(1-0) emission. Our results reveal not only that shocks are the main driver of releasing phosphorus from dust grains and into the gas-phase, but that the emission originates from gas not affiliated with the shock itself, but quiescent gas that has been shocked in the recent past. From radiative transfer calculations, the PO/PN abundance ratio is found to be $3.1^{+0.4}_{-0.6}$, consistent with other high-mass and low-mass star-forming regions. This first detection of PO$^{+}$ toward any low-mass star-forming region reveals a PO$^{+}$/PO ratio of $0.0115^{+0.0008}_{-0.0009}$, a factor of ten lower than previously determined from observations of a Galactic Center molecular cloud, suggesting its formation can occur under more standard Galactic cosmic-ray ionization rates. These results motivate the need for additional observations that can better disentangle the physical mechanisms and chemical drivers of this precursor of prebiotic chemistry.</description>

      <title>Evolution of star clusters with initial bulk rotation via N-body simulations</title>

Abstract: Young star clusters can inherit bulk rotation from the molecular clouds from which they have formed. This rotation can affect the long-term evolution of a star cluster and its constituent stellar populations. In this study, we aim to characterize the effects of different degrees of initial rotation on star clusters with primordial binaries. The simulations are performed using NBODY6++GPU. We find that initial rotation strongly affects the early evolution of star clusters. Rapidly rotating clusters show angular momentum transport from the inner parts to the outskirts, resulting in a core collapse. Angular momentum transport is accompanied by a highly elongated bar-like structure morphology. The effects of bulk rotation are reduced on the timescale of two-body relaxation. Rotating and non-rotating clusters experience changes in the direction of angular momentum near the dissolution and early evolution due to the tidal field, respectively. We present synthetic observations of simulated clusters for comparison with future observations in filters of Gaia, CSST, and HST. This work shows the effects of bulk rotation on systems with primordial binaries and could be used for the identification of rotation signatures in observed open clusters.</description>

Abstract: Star formation and metal enrichment in galaxies are regulated by supernova (SN) explosions and metal yields from massive stars, which are sensitive to the high-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF). Recent JWST observations found evidence for an invariant relation between stellar mass, metallicity, and star formation rate up to $z\sim 8$ and its breakdown at higher redshifts. It is crucial to understand the underlying physics, especially the role played by the IMF. We explore the impact of IMF on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies and the interplay between IMF and galactic outflow parameters. The ultimate goal is to constrain the high-mass end of the IMF by the cosmic star formation history and stellar mass-metallicity-star formation rate relation (MZSFR) inferred from observations at $z\sim 4-10$. Using the semi-analytical galaxy evolution code A-SLOTH, we follow galactic baryon cycles along merger trees built from a high-resolution cosmological simulation. Stellar feedback is modeled with up-to-date stellar evolution tracks covering the full metallicity range ($Z \sim 10^{-11} - 0.03$) and a broad stellar mass range ($m_\star\sim2 - 600\ \rm M_\odot$) including the metal yields from stellar winds and all types of SNe. Assuming a Kroupa-like shape of the IMF with a varying upper mass limit $m_{\max}$, we find $m_{\max} \gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$ is required to reproduce the observed MZSFR. Observational data at $z\gtrsim 6$ favor a galactic outflow model where the outflow rate is proportional to the supernova energy injection rate divided by the halo binding energy. We conclude that very massive ($\gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$) stars can play important roles in the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of high-$z$ galaxies and discuss the implications of our results for reionization and transient sources of both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Fading in the Flow: Suppression of cold gas growth in expanding galactic outflows</title>

Abstract: Multiwavelength observations reveal multiphase outflows that play a crucial role in redistributing gas and metals in and around galaxies. Theoretical modelling of such multiphase outflows often employs wind tunnel simulations of a spherical cold ($\sim 10^4 \ \rm K$) cloud facing a uniform hot ($\sim 10^6\ \rm K$) wind. However, outflows are naturally expanding and wind conditions change downstream -- a crucial aspect overlooked in most idealized simulations. To address this, we examine how an expanding wind influences the survival, morphology, and dynamics of a cloud. We perform idealized hydrodynamic simulations of radiative cloud-crushing in an expanding wind, where the steady background wind is modelled using the adiabatic Chevalier &amp; Clegg 1985 (CC85) analytic solution. Moving downstream, we find that the clouds remain locally isobaric with the wind, leading to a steep decline in their density contrast with respect to the ambient medium, and they eventually dissipate into the wind. This also suppresses the growth of cold gas mass in comparison to a plane-parallel wind since entrained clouds move into a less radiative background. Using analytic scaling arguments, we present a physical picture of cloud evolution in a CC85 wind. Cloud expansion and local pressure equilibrium are the key regulators of cold mass growth. Unlike traditional homogeneous wind tunnel simulations, our simulations account for the differential expansion experienced by the long cometary tails of clouds moving in an outflow. Consequently, a strong head-to-tail emission gradient in the filamentary cold gas tails develop -- features closer to observations. In addition, we demonstrate that the dynamics of individual clouds may substantially alter the radial properties of their host multiphase outflows.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Isotope Ratios in Hydrogen-Deficient Carbon Stars: A Correlation with Effective Temperature and Implications for White Dwarf Merger Outcomes</title>

Abstract: Hydrogen-deficient Carbon (HdC) stars are a class of supergiants with anomalous chemical compositions, suggesting that they are remnants of CO-He white dwarf (WD) mergers. This class comprises two spectroscopically similar subclasses - dusty R Coronae Borealis (RCB) and dustless Hydrogen-deficient Carbon (dLHdC) stars. Both subclasses have a stark overabundance of $^{18}\textrm{O}$ in their atmospheres, but spectroscopic differences between them remain poorly studied. We present high-resolution ($R \approx 75000$) K-band spectra of six RCB and six dLHdC stars, including four newly discovered dLHdC stars, making this the largest sample to date. We develop a semi-automated fitting routine to measure $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}$ ratios for this sample, tripling the number of dLHdC stars with oxygen isotope ratios measured from high resolution spectra. All six dLHdC stars have $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}&lt;1$, while the RCB stars have $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}&gt;4$. Additionally, for the first time, we find a trend of decreasing $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}$ ratios with increasing effective temperature for HdC stars, consistent with predictions of theoretical WD merger models. However, we note that current models overpredict the low $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}$ ratios of dLHdC stars by two orders of magnitude. We also measure abundances of C, N, O, Fe, S, Si, Mg, Na, and Ca for these stars. We observe a correlation between the abundances of $^{14}\textrm{N}$ and $^{18}\textrm{O}$ in our sample, suggesting that a fixed fraction of the $^{14}\textrm{N}$ is converted to $^{18}\textrm{O}$ in these stars via $\alpha$-capture. Our results affirm the emerging picture that the mass ratio/total mass of the WD binary determine whether an RCB or dLHdC is formed post-merger.</description>

      <title>Refining lower bounds on sterile neutrino dark matter mass from estimates of phase space densities in dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are recognized as being highly dominated by Dark Matter (DM), making them excellent targets for testing DM models through astrophysical observations. One effective method involves estimating the coarse-grained phase-space density (PSD) of the galactic DM component. By comparing this PSD with that of DM particles produced in the early Universe, it is possible to establish lower bounds on the DM particle mass. These constraints are particularly relevant for models of warm DM, such as those involving sterile neutrinos. Utilizing the GravSphere code, we obtain a fit of the DM PSD based on the latest reliable stellar dynamics data for twenty of the darkest dSphs, refining earlier lower bounds on sterile neutrino masses in non-resonant production scenarios. Additionally, we introduce an alternative approach involving the Excess Mass Function (EMF), which yields even tighter constraints. Specifically, using the maximum PSD, we derive a lower bound of $m&gt;1.02\,$keV at 95% confidence level, while the EMF method provides a stronger limit of $m&gt;1.98\,$keV at 95% CL. For the general thermal relic fermion dark matter mass the limits translate into $m&gt;0.28\,$keV and $m&gt;0.49\,$keV, respectively. Both methods are versatile and can be extended to more complex DM production mechanisms in the early Universe. For the first time, we also constrain parameters of models involving non-standard cosmologies during the epoch of neutrino production. Our analysis yields $m&gt;2.54\,$keV for models with kination domination and $m&gt;4.71\,$keV for scenarios with extremely low reheating temperature.</description>

      <title>SHAM-OT: Rapid Subhalo Abundance Matching with Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) is widely used for connecting galaxies to dark matter haloes. In SHAM, galaxies and (sub-)haloes are sorted according to their mass (or mass proxy) and matched by their rank order. In this work, we show that SHAM is the solution of the optimal transport (OT) problem on empirical distributions (samples or catalogues) for any metric transport cost function. In the limit of large number of samples, it converges to the solution of the OT problem between continuous distributions. We propose SHAM-OT: a formulation of abundance matching where the halo-galaxy relation is obtained as the optimal transport plan between galaxy and halo mass functions. By working directly on these (discretized) functions, SHAM-OT eliminates the need for sampling or sorting and is solved using efficient OT algorithms at negligible compute and memory cost. Scatter in the galaxy-halo relation can be naturally incorporated through regularization of the transport plan. SHAM-OT can easily be generalized to multiple marginal distributions. We validate our method using analytical tests with varying cosmology and luminosity function parameters, and on simulated halo catalogues. The efficiency of SHAM-OT makes it particularly advantageous for Bayesian inference that requires marginalization over stellar mass or luminosity function uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Dynamical analysis of stacked samples of asymmetric, non-static, self-gravitating systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use numerical simulations to explore biases that arise in dynamical estimates of the mean mass profile for a collection of galaxy clusters that have been stacked to make a composite. There are three types of bias. One arises from anisotropy of the kinematic pressure tensor and has been already well studied; a second arises from departures from equilibrium; and a third arises because of heterogeneity of the clusters used, from their individual non-sphericity, and because velocities used are measured with respect to centres that are, in general, accelerating. Here we focus on the latter two. We stack clusters to measure the pressure tensor and density profiles and then estimate the dynamical mass profile using the Jeans equation, and compare to the actual mean mass profile. The main result of this paper is an estimate of the bias, that can be used to correct the dynamical mass estimate, and we show how it depends on the cluster sample selection. We find that Jeans equation typically overestimates the true mass by about 20\% at the virial radius.</description>
