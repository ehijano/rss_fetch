      <title>Charge Separation Measurements in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 7.7--200 GeV in Search of the Chiral Magnetic Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect in heavy-ion collisions predicts a charge separation signal along a magnetic field, which indicates local $P$ and $CP$ violations in the quark-gluon plasma. We report measurements of electric charge separation signals perpendicular to the spectator event plane in Au+Au collisions using high-statistics data from RHIC Beam Energy Scan II and top-energy runs. A novel event shape selection method is employed to suppress the flow-induced background. The residual charge separation signals near the zero-flow limit are positive in Au+Au collisions within the 20\%--50\% centrality range, with significance levels of $2.6\sigma$, $3.1\sigma$, and $3.3\sigma$ at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 11.5, 14.6, and 19.6 GeV, respectively. At other beam energies, the signals are either statistically limited or consistent with zero.</description>

      <title>Search for the chiral magnetic effect through beam energy dependence of charge separation using event shape selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy, heavy-ion collisions can create local domains of chirality-imbalanced quarks, reflecting the topological features of quantum chromodynamics. The chiral magnetic effect (CME) predicts an electric charge separation of quarks in such topological domains along the magnetic field ($\vec{B}$) generated by the passing of two high-$Z$ nuclei. We use a correlation observable $\Delta\gamma^{112}$ between charged meson pairs to detect the CME-induced charge separation and a novel event shape selection (ESS) method to mitigate the background effects related to elliptic flow ($v_2$). The ESS method classifies events based on the emission pattern of final-state particles and determines $\Delta\gamma^{112}_{\rm ESS}$ from the zero-flow limit. We reconstruct the $\vec{B}$ field direction from the spectator nucleons, which minimizes backgrounds unrelated to the collective motion of the system. In this work, we report the measurements of $\Delta\gamma^{112}$ and a background indicator $\Delta\gamma^{132}$ in Au+Au collisions from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan phase II and at the top RHIC energy. After background suppression, $\Delta\gamma^{132}_{\rm ESS}$ aligns with zero, and $\Delta\gamma^{112}_{\rm ESS}$ is reduced to no more than 20\% of $\Delta\gamma^{112}$. We observe a finite residual charge separation with $2.6\sigma$, $3.1\sigma$, and $3.3\sigma$ significance in the 20\%--50\% centrality range of Au+Au collisions at 11.5, 14.6, and 19.6 GeV. The results at 17.3 and 27 GeV also show positive values but with a lower significance of $1.3\sigma$ and $1.1\sigma$, respectively. The corresponding $\Delta\gamma^{112}_{\rm ESS}$ values at 7.7, 9.2, and 200 GeV are consistent with zero within uncertainties.</description>

      <title>First systematic experimental 2D mapping of linearly polarized $\gamma$-ray polarimetric distribution in relativistic Compton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of photons with relativistic electrons constitutes a fundamental electromagnetic process whose polarization transfer mechanics remain incompletely characterized. We report the first systematic measurement of spatial polarization distribution for $\gamma$-rays generated via \SI{45}{\degree} slant inverse Compton scattering (ICS) between linearly polarized \SI{0.117}{\eV} photons and \SI{3.5}{\GeV} electrons, performing full 2D mapping of intensity, polarization angle (AOP), and degree of polarization (DOP). Measurements reveal an asymmetric beam profile along the laser's polarization direction that resembles \SI{180}{\degree} backward ICS observations. The central beam region exhibits DOP $\approx$ 1.0 with AOP rigidly aligned at \SI{45}{\degree}, while peripheral regions display complex non-uniform polarization distributions. These findings confirm quantum electrodynamics predictions of near-complete polarization transfer along the beam axis in slant geometries, thus establishing slant scattering as a viable alternative to head-on configurations for generating high DOP $\gamma$-rays.</description>

      <title>Potential absence of observed $\pi^2$ linear-chain structures in $^{14}$O via $^{10}$C($\alpha,\alpha$) resonant scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The preference for light nuclear systems to coagulate into $\alpha$-particle clusters has been well-studied. The possibility of a linear chain configuration of $\alpha$-particles would allow for a new way to study this phenomenon. Purpose: A rotational band of states in $^{14}$C has been claimed showing a $\pi^2$ linear chain structure. The mirror system, $^{14}$O, has been studied here to examine how this linear chain structure is affected by replacing the valence neutrons with protons. Method: A beam of $^{10}$C was incident into a chamber filled with He:CO$_2$ gas with the tracks recorded inside the TexAT Time Projection Chamber and the recoil $\alpha$-particles detected by a silicon detector array to measure the $^{10}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\alpha)$ cross section. Results: The experimental cross section was compared with previous studies and fit using R-Matrix theory with the previously-observed $^{14}$O states being transformed to the $^{14}$C using mirror symmetry. The measured cross section does not replicate the claimed states, with the predicted cross section exceeding that observed at several energies and angles. Conclusion: A series of possibilities are highlighted with the most likely being that the originally-seen $^{14}$C states did not constitute a $\pi^2$ rotational band with a potentially incorrect spin assignment due to the limitations of the angular correlation method with non-zero spin particles. The work highlights the difficulties in measuring broad resonances corresponding to a linear chain state in a high level density.</description>

      <title>Detection of Molecular Hydrogen in a Proton Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One method of determining the free neutron lifetime involves the absolute counting of neutrons and trapped decay protons. In such experiments, a cold neutron beam traverses a segmented proton trap inside a superconducting solenoid while the neutron flux is continuously monitored. Protons that are born within the fiducial volume of the trap are confined radially by the magnetic field and axially by the electrostatic potential supplied by trap electrodes. They are periodically released and counted, and the ratio of the absolute number of neutrons to protons is proportional to the neutron lifetime. Systematic error can be introduced if protons in the trap are lost, gained, or misidentified. The influence of molecular hydrogen interactions is of particular interest because of its ubiquitous presence in ultrahigh vacuum systems. To understand how it could affect the neutron lifetime, measurements were performed on the production and detection of molecular hydrogen in an apparatus used to measure the neutron lifetime. We demonstrate that charge exchange with molecular hydrogen can occur with trapped protons, and we determine the efficiency with which the molecular hydrogen ions in the trap are detected. Finally, we comment on the potential impact on a neutron lifetime experiment using this beam technique. We find that the result of the beam neutron lifetime performed at NIST is unlikely to have been significantly affected by charge exchange with molecular hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Comparing effective temperatures in standard and Tsallis distributions from transverse momentum spectra in small collision systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of identified light charged hadrons, specifically the bosons $\pi^{\pm}$ and $K^{\pm}$ as well as the fermions $p(\bar p)$, produced in small collision systems, namely deuteron-gold (d+Au) and proton-proton (p+p) collisions at the top energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) with a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, are investigated in this paper. In present study, d+Au collisions are categorized into three centrality classes: central (0--20\%), semi-central (20--40\%), and peripheral (40--100\%) collisions. Various types of distributions, including tandard [Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) and Boltzmann] and Tsallis distributions, are employed to fit the same $p_T$ spectra to derive different effective temperatures denoted as $T_{eff}$. The results indicate that $T_{eff}$ values obtained from Bose-Einstein, Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, and Tsallis distributions exhibit orderly a decreasing trend. Meanwhile, these $T_{eff}$ values also show a decreasing trend with a decrease in collision centrality. Furthermore, based on the spectra of given particles, a perfect linear relationship is observed between different pairwise combinations of $T_{eff}$ derived from both Boltzmann and Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) distributions as well as between Tsallis and Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) distributions.</description>

      <title>Regularization Prescription for the Mixing Between Nonlocal Gluon and Quark Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that in the study of mixing between nonlocal gluon and quark bilinear operators there exists an ambiguity when relating coordinate space and momentum space results, which can be conveniently resolved through Mellin moments matching in both spaces. In this work, we show that this ambiguity is due to the lack of a proper regularization prescription of the singularity that arises when the separation between the gluon/quark fields approaches zero. We then demonstrate that dimensional regularization resolves this issue and yields consistent results in both coordinate and momentum space. This prescription is also compatible with lattice extractions of parton distributions from nonlocal operators.</description>

      <title>Unwinding the rare $\Omega$ sector: Fragmentation of fully charmed baryons from HL-LHC to FCC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By adopting a hadron-structure-oriented approach, we present and discuss the release of the novel OMG3Q1.0 set of collinear fragmentation functions for fully charmed, rare $\Omega$ baryons. Our methodology combines diquark-like proxy model inputs for both charm-quark and gluon channels, calculated at the initial energy scales, with a DGLAP evolution that ensures a consistent treatment of heavy-quark thresholds, following directly from the HF-NRevo scheme. We complement our work with a phenomenological study of NLL/NLO$^+$ resummed $\Omega_{3c}$ plus jet distributions using (sym)JETHAD at the HL-LHC and the future FCC. Unraveling the production mechanisms of rare, yet-unobserved hadrons, as provided by the OMG3Q1.0 functions, stands as a key asset for deepening our understanding of QCD at future high-energy hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>Perspectives for hyperon and hypernuclei physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypernuclei, nuclei containing one or more hyperons, serve as unique laboratories for probing the non-perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Recent progress in hypernuclear physics, driven by advanced experimental techniques and theoretical innovations, is briefly reviewed with a focus on key findings and unresolved challenges, such as the precise determination of the hypertriton binding energy, investigations of charge symmetry breaking in mirror hypernuclei, and the search for exotic systems, including the neutral nn$\Lambda$ state. Experimental breakthroughs, including invariant-mass analyses and femtoscopy studies in heavy-ion collisions, as well as high-resolution $\gamma$-spectroscopy, have enabled precise studies of light hypernuclei and offered critical insights into the hyperon-nucleon interaction. Theoretical progress, including ab initio calculations based on chiral effective field theory and lattice QCD, has further enhanced our understanding of hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions.</description>

      <title>Photon-induced production of the exotic charged charmonium-like state $Z_c(3900)$ off nuclear targets and its internal structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the possibility to study the famous charged charmonium-like state $Z_c(3900)$ production off nuclear targets and its properties in inclusive photon-induced reactions near the kinematic threshold within the collision model based on the nuclear spectral function. The model accounts for its charged components $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ production in direct photon--nucleon interactions as well as three different popular scenarios for their internal structures: compact tetraquarks, molecules of the two open-charm mesons and mixtures of both of them. We calculate the absolute and relative excitation functions for production of $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ mesons on $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei at initial photon energies of 9.0--17.5 GeV, the absolute momentum differential cross sections and their ratios for the $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ production off these target nuclei at laboratory polar angles of 0$^{\circ}$--10$^{\circ}$ and at photon energy of 14 GeV as well as the A-dependences of the ratios of the total cross sections for $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ production at photon energy of 14 GeV within the adopted scenarios for the $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ internal structures. We demonstrate that the absolute and relative observables considered show a certain sensitivity to the $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ internal structures which are by far the best known. Hence, they might be useful for the determination of these structures -- the issue which has attracted much attention in the hadron physics community -- from the comparison of them with the experimental data from the future high-precision experiments at the CEBAF facility.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous impacts of nuclear shell structure and collectivity on $\beta$ decay: Evidence from $^{80}$Ga$_{49}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gamow-Teller strength distribution covering the entire $\beta$-decay window, up to 10.312(4) MeV, of $^{80g+m}$Ga was measured for the first time in photo fission of UC$_x$ induced by a 50 MeV electron beam. The new data show significant enhancement in the high-energy region with a jump structure. Simultaneously, the $\gamma$ deexciting behavior of $\beta$-populated states presents a competition between deexcitation to 2$_1^+$ [$\beta_2$ = 0.155(9)] and to 2$_2^+$ [$\beta_2$ = 0.053$_{0.009}^{0.008}$)] in $^{80}$Ge. To understand these data, we performed a realistic shell-model calculation and systematic analysis of log $\it{ft}$ ratios between precursors' $\beta$ decay to 2$_2^+$ and to 2$_1^+$ of Ga isotopes. We conclude that these phenomena evidence simultaneous impacts of nuclear shell structure and collectivity on $\it{B}$(GT) distribution and therefore the half-life of the precursor.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity-dependent jet modification from di-hadron correlations in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short-range correlations between charged particles are studied via two-particle angular correlations in pp collisions at ${\sqrt{{\textit s}}}=13$~TeV. The correlation functions are measured as a function of the relative azimuthal angle $\Delta\varphi$ and the pseudorapidity separation $\Delta\eta$ for pairs of primary charged particles within the pseudorapidity interval $|\eta| &lt; 0.9$ and the transverse-momentum range $1 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 8$ GeV/$c$. Near-side ($|\Delta\varphi|&lt;1.3$) peak widths are extracted from a generalised Gaussian fitted over the correlations in full pseudorapidity separation ($|\Delta\eta|&lt;1.8$), while the per-trigger associated near-side yields are extracted for the short-range correlations ($|\Delta\eta|&lt;1.3$). Both are evaluated as a function of charged-particle multiplicity obtained by two different event activity estimators. The width of the near-side peak decreases with increasing multiplicity, and this trend is reproduced qualitatively by the Monte Carlo event generators PYTHIA 8, AMPT, and EPOS. However, the models overestimate the width in the low transverse-momentum region ($p_{\rm T} &lt; 3$ GeV/$c$). The per-trigger associated near-side yield increases with increasing multiplicity. Although this trend is also captured qualitatively by the considered event generators, the yield is mostly overestimated by the models in the considered kinematic range. The measurement of the shape and yield of the short-range correlation peak can help us understand the interplay between jet fragmentation and event activity, quantify the narrowing trend of the near-side peak as a function of transverse momentum and multiplicity selections in pp collisions, and search for final-state jet modification in small collision systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the inclusive isolated-photon production cross section in pp and Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ALICE Collaboration at the CERN LHC has measured the inclusive production cross section of isolated photons at midrapidity as a function of the photon transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}$), in Pb$-$Pb collisions in different centrality intervals, and in pp collisions, at centre-of-momentum energy per nucleon pair of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV. The photon transverse momentum range is between 10-14 and 40-140 GeV/$c$, depending on the collision system and on the Pb$-$Pb centrality class. The result extends to lower $p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}$ than previously published results by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the same collision energy. The covered pseudorapidity range is $|\eta^{\gamma}| &lt;0.67$. The isolation selection is based on a charged particle isolation momentum threshold $p_{\rm T}^{\rm iso,~ch} = 1.5$ GeV/$c$ within a cone of radii $R=0.2$ and $0.4$. The nuclear modification factor is calculated and found to be consistent with unity in all centrality classes, and also consistent with the HG-PYTHIA model, which describes the event selection and geometry biases that affect the centrality determination in peripheral Pb$-$Pb collisions. The measurement is compared to next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations and to the measurements of isolated photons and Z$^0$ bosons from the CMS experiment, which are all found to be in agreement.</description>

      <title>Flow harmonic correlations via multi-particle symmetric and asymmetric cumulants in Au+Au collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}}\) = 200 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02245v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multi-particle azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. We use initial conditions obtained from a Monte-Carlo Glauber model and evolve them within a viscous relativistic hydrodynamics framework that eventually gives way to a transport model in the late hadronic stage of the evolution. We compute the multi-particle symmetric and asymmetric cumulants and present the results for their sensitivity to the shear and bulk viscosities during the hydrodynamic evolution. We also check their sensitivity to resonance decay and hadronic interactions. We demonstrate that while some of these observables are more sensitive to transport properties than traditional flow observables, others are less sensitive, making them suitable for studying different stages of the evolution.</description>

      <title>Measurement of f$_{1}$(1285) production in pp collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{{\textit s}}}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents the first measurement of the f$_{1}$(1285) resonance using the ALICE detector in inelastic proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The resonance is reconstructed at midrapidity ($|y| &lt;$ 0.5) through the hadronic decay channel f$_{1} (1285) \rightarrow \mathrm{K^{0}_{S} K^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}}$. Key measurements include the determination of its mass, transverse-momentum integrated yield, and average transverse momentum. Additionally, the ratio of the transverse-momentum integrated yield of f$_{1}$(1285) to pion is compared with calculations from the canonical statistical hadronization model. The model calculation, assuming a zero total strangeness content for f$_{1}$(1285), reproduces the data within 1$\sigma$ deviation, shedding light on the quark composition of f$_{1}$(1285).</description>

      <title>Measurement of $\omega$ meson production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $p_{\rm T}$-differential cross section of $\omega$ meson production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}= 13$ TeV at midrapidity ($|y|&lt;0.5$) was measured with the ALICE detector at the LHC, covering an unprecedented transverse-momentum range of $1.6 &lt;p_{\rm T}&lt; 50$ GeV/$c$. The meson is reconstructed via the $\omega\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ decay channel. The results are compared with various theoretical calculations: PYTHIA8.2 with the Monash 2013 tune overestimates the data by up to 50%, whereas good agreement is observed with Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) calculations incorporating $\omega$ fragmentation using a broken SU(3) model. The $\omega/\pi^0$ ratio is presented and compared with theoretical calculations and the available measurements at lower collision energies. The presented data triples the $p_{\rm T}$ ranges of previously available measurements. A constant ratio of $C^{\omega/\pi^0}=0.578\pm0.006~\text{(stat.)}\pm 0.013~\text{(syst.)}$ is found above a transverse momentum of $4$ GeV/$c$, which is in agreement with previous findings at lower collision energies within the systematic and statistical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Single-Ended Event Reconstruction in PROSPECT Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Precision Reactor Oscillation and Spectrum Experiment, PROSPECT, was a segmented antineutrino detector that successfully operated at the High Flux Isotope Reactor in Oak Ridge, TN, during its 2018 run. Despite challenges with photomultiplier tube base failures affecting some segments, innovative machine learning approaches were employed to perform position and energy reconstruction, and particle classification. This work highlights the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks and graph convolutional networks in enhancing data analysis. By leveraging these techniques, a 3.3% increase in effective statistics was achieved compared to traditional methods, showcasing their potential to improve analysis performance. Furthermore, these machine learning methodologies offer promising applications for other segmented particle detectors, underscoring their versatility and impact.</description>

      <title>The role of the screening potential in the deuteron-deuteron thermonuclear reaction rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deuteron-deuteron (D-D) thermonuclear reaction rates in metallic environments (considering the electron screening effects)
  is calculated using the S-factor functions which
  were obtained by fitting to low-energy data on D-D reactions.
  For this purpose, a fitted S-factor model based on the NACRE compilation is employed.
  This limited the energy range of Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) for
  the $ ^{2}\textrm{H}\left(d,p\right) ^{3}\textrm{H}$ and $^{2} \textrm{H} \left(d,n\right) ^{3}\textrm{He}$ reactions.
  The corresponding Maxwellian-averaged thermonuclear reaction
  rates of relevance in astrophysical plasmas at temperatures in the
  range from $10^{6}$ K to $10^{10}\left(\textrm{or }1.3\times10^{8}\right)$ K are provided in tabular formats.
  In these evaluations,
  the screening energy ($ U_{e} $) is assumed to be $100, 400, 750, 1000$ eV and $1250$ eV.
  This series of values has been selected based on theoretical and experimental studies conducted so far.
  %
  Eventually, our numerical analysis suggests that the ratio of the reaction rate with the screening potential to the reaction rate without the screening potential, can be described by the term $ \exp\left(4.70 +6.50\:{U_{e}}/{T_{9}}\right) $ for both $ ^{2}\textrm{H}\left(d,p\right) ^{3}\textrm{H}$ and $^{2} \textrm{H} \left(d,n\right) ^{3}\textrm{He}$ reactions.

      <title>Summary Report of the Physics Beyond Colliders Study at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Physics Beyond Collider (PBC) Study Group was initially mandated by the CERN Management to prepare the previous European Particle Physics Strategy Update for CERN projects other than the high-energy frontier colliders. The main findings were summarized in an PBC Summary Report submitted to the Strategy Update. Following the Update process, the PBC Study Group was confirmed on a permanent basis with an updated mandate taking into account the strategy recommendations. The Study Group is now in charge of supporting the proponents of new ideas to address the technical issues and physics motivation of the projects ahead of their review by the CERN Scientific Committees and decision by the Management. The present document updates the previous PBC summary report to inform the new ongoing European Particle Physics Strategy Update process, taking into account the evolution of the CERN and worldwide landscapes and the new projects under consideration within the Study Group.</description>

      <title>On chirality and chiral neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been claimed in a number of publications that neutrinos can exhibit chirality oscillations. In this note we discuss the notion of chirality and show that chiral neutrino oscillations in vacuum do not occur. We argue that the incorrect claims to the contrary resulted from a failure to clearly discriminate between quantum fields, states and wave functions. We also emphasize the role played in the erroneous claims on the possibility of chirality oscillations by the widely spread misconceptions about negative energies.</description>
