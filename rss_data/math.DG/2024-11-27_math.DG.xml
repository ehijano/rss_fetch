      <title>Singular Complex Manifolds and the Existence of Lagrangian Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of singular complex manifolds and we develop a degenerate Kodaira-Hodge theory for this class of singular manifolds. As an application we prove the existence of Lagranien cycles which do not meet the canonical divisor in complex surfaces of general type.</description>

      <title>Classification of Semigraphical Translators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We complete the classification of semigraphical translators for mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that was initiated by Hoffman-Mart\'in-White. Specifically, we show that there is no solution to the translator equation on the upper half-plane with alternating positive and negative infinite boundary values, and we prove the uniqueness of pitchfork and helicoid translators. The proofs use Morse-Rad\'o theory for translators and an angular maximum principle.</description>

      <title>Remark on Laplacians and Riemannian Submersions with Totally Geodesic Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17078v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Riemannian submersion $(M,g) \to (B,j)$ each of whose fiber is connected and totally geodesic, we consider a certain 1-parameter family of Riemannian metrics $(g_{t})_{t &gt; 0}$ on $M$, which is called the canonical variation. Let $\lambda_{1}(g_{t})$ be the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplace--Beltrami operator $\Delta_{g_{t}}$ and $\mbox{Vol}(M,g_{t})$ the volume of $(M, g_{t})$. In 1982, B\'{e}rard-Bergery and Bourguignon showed that the scale-invariant quantity $\lambda_{1}(g_{t})\mbox{Vol}(M,g_{t})^{2/\mbox{dim}M}$ goes to $0$ with $t$. In this paper, we prove that if each fiber is Einstein and $(M,g)$ satisfies a certain condition about its Ricci curvature, then $\lambda_{1}(g_{t})\mbox{Vol}(M,g_{t})^{2/\mbox{dim}M}$ goes to $\infty$ with $t$. We consider many examples. In particular, we consider Riemannian submersions from compact rank one symmetric spaces and the twistor fibration of a quaternionic K\"{a}hler manifold of positive scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>Weil bundles and $\alpha-$structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, considering a smooth manifold $M$ and a Weil algebra $\mathbf A$, we study various classical structures on the Weil bundle $(M^\mathbf A,\tilde\pi_M,M)$: It follows that the pull-back map of the projection $\tilde\pi_M$ induces on $ M^\mathbf A$ certain classical structures such as lcs, lcc, contact, Jacobi, orientation, Riemannian, co-Kaehlerian, and Kaehlerian provided $M$ has the corresponding structure. We exhibit an example of a cosymplectic manifold that is not a suspension of a symplectic manifold.</description>

      <title>The horospherical $p$-Christoffel-Minkowski and prescribed $p$-shifted Weingarten curvature problems in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $L_p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem and the prescribed $L_p$-Weingarten curvature problem for convex hypersurfaces in Euclidean space are important problems in geometric analysis. In this paper, we consider their counterparts in hyperbolic space. For the horospherical $p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem first introduced and studied by the second and third authors, we prove the existence of smooth, origin-symmetric, strictly horospherically convex solutions by establishing a new full rank theorem. We also propose the prescribed $p$-shifted Weingarten curvature problem and prove an existence result.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Torsional Rigidity under Geometric Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the behavior of the torsional rigidity of a precompact domain as the ambient manifold evolves under a geometric flow. Specifically, we derive bounds on torsional rigidity under the Ricci Flow for Heisenberg spaces and homogeneous spheres. Additionally, we establish bounds under the Inverse Mean Curvature Flow for strictly convex, free-boundary, disk-type hypersurfaces within a ball. In this latter case, by extending the analysis to the maximal existence time of the flow, we obtain inequalities of comparison with the flat disk for both volume and torsional rigidity.</description>

      <title>Verbal ideals and unobstructed complex parallelisable nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a compact complex parallelisable nilmanifold has unobstructed deformations if and only if its associated Lie algebra satisfies a reality condition and is a free Lie algebra in a variety of Lie algebras, that is, defined by a verbal ideal in a free Lie algebra. We provide a partial classification of verbal ideals and show that there are finitely many such Lie algebras up to dimension 19, whereas infinite families start to appear in dimension 20. As a consequence, there are finitely many complex homotopy types of unobstructed complex parallelisable nilmanifolds up to dimension 19, and infinitely many in dimension 20.</description>

      <title>Deformations of calibrated subbundles in noncompact manifolds of special holonomy via twisting by special sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study special Lagrangian submanifolds in the Calabi-Yau manifold $T^*S^n$ with the Stenzel metric, as well as calibrated submanifolds in the $\text{G}_2$-manifold $\Lambda^2_-(T^*X)$ $(X^4 = S^4, \mathbb{CP}^2)$ and the $\text{Spin}(7)$-manifold $\$_{\!-}(S^4)$, both equipped with the Bryant-Salamon metrics. We twist naturally defined calibrated subbundles by sections of the complementary bundles and derive conditions for the deformations to be calibrated. We find that twisting the conormal bundle $N^*L$ of $L^q \subset S^n$ by a $1$-form $\mu \in \Omega^1(L)$ does not provide any new examples because the Lagrangian condition requires $\mu$ to vanish. Furthermore, we prove that the twisted bundles in the $\text{G}_2$- and $\text{Spin}(7)$-manifolds are associative (coassociative) and Cayley, respectively, if the base is minimal (negative superminimal) and the section holomorphic (parallel). This demonstrates that the (co-)associative and Cayley subbundles allow deformations destroying the linear structure of the fiber, while the base space remains of the same type after twisting. While the results for the two spaces of exceptional holonomy are in line with the findings in Euclidean spaces established in arXiv:1108.6090, the special Lagrangian bundle construction in $T^*S^n$ is much more rigid than in the case of $T^*\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove that each integral cycle $T$ in an oriented Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{M}$ can be approximated in flat norm by an integral cycle in the same homology class which is a smooth submanifold $\Sigma$ of nearly the same area, up to a singular set of codimension 5. Moreover, if the homology class $\tau$ is representable by a smooth submanifold, then $\Sigma$ can be chosen free of singularities.</description>

      <title>The horospherical $p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The horospherical $p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem was posed by Li and Xu (2022) as a problem prescribing the $k$-th horospherical $p$-surface area measure of $h$-convex domains in hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$. It is a natural generalization of the classical $L^p$ Christoffel-Minkowski problem in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. In this paper, we consider a fully nonlinear equation associated with the horospherical $p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem. We establish the existence of a uniformly $h$-convex solution under appropriate assumptions on the prescribed function. The key to the proof is the full rank theorem, which we will demonstrate using a viscosity approach based on the idea of Bryan-Ivaki-Scheuer (2023). When $p=0$, the horospherical $p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem in $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$ is equivalent to a Nirenberg-type problem on $\mathbb{S}^n$ in conformal geometry. Therefore, our result implies the existence of solutions to the Nirenberg-type problem.</description>

      <title>On the relative isoperimetric problem for the cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we solve the relative isoperimetric problem in $[0,1]^3$ for orthogonal polyhedra. Up to isometries of the cube or sets of measure $0$, the minimizers are of the form $[0,\epsilon]^3$, $[0,\epsilon]^2 \times [0,1]$, or $[0,\epsilon] \times [0,1]^2$ for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$.
  This should be compared to the conjectured minimizers for the unconstrained relative isoperimetric problem in $[0,1]^3$, which are (up to isometries and sets of measure $0$) of the form $\left( B^3(\epsilon) \right) \cap [0,1]^3$, $\left( B^2(\epsilon) \times [0,1] \right) \cap [0,1]^3$, or $[0,\epsilon] \times [0,1]^2$ for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Here, $B^k(\epsilon)$ is the closed ball in $\mathbb{R}^k$ of radius $\epsilon$ centered at the origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01609v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove:
  1. There is a one-to-one correspondence between: Hermitian non-K\"ahler ALE gravitational instantons $(M,h)$, and Bach-flat K\"ahler orbifolds $(\widehat{M},\widehat{g})$ of complex dimension 2 with exactly one orbifold point $q$, such that the scalar curvature $s_{\widehat{g}}$ satisfies $s_{\widehat{g}}(q)=0$ while being positive elsewhere.
  2. There is no Hermitian non-K\"ahler ALE gravitational instanton $(M,h)$ with structure group contained in $SU(2)$, except for the Eguchi-Hanson metric with reversed orientation.
  A 4-dimensional Ricci-flat metric being Hermitian non-K\"ahler is equivalent to being non-trivially conformally K\"ahler.</description>

Abstract: We study an eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian on a compact K\"{a}hler manifold. Considering the $k$-th eigenvalue $\lambda_{k}$ as a functional on the space of K\"{a}hler metrics with fixed volume on a compact complex manifold, we introduce the notion of $\lambda_{k}$-extremal K\"{a}hler metric. We deduce a condition for a K\"{a}hler metric to be $\lambda_{k}$-extremal. As examples, we consider product K\"{a}hler manifolds, compact isotropy irreducible homogeneous K\"{a}hler manifolds and flat complex tori.</description>

      <title>Deformation Theory of Asymptotically Conical Spin(7)-Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the deformation theory of instantons on asymptotically conical $Spin(7)$-manifolds where the instanton is asymptotic to a fixed nearly $G_2$-instanton at infinity. By relating the deformation complex with spinors, we identify the space of infinitesimal deformations with the kernel of the twisted negative Dirac operator on the asymptotically conical $Spin(7)$-manifold.
  Finally we apply this theory to describe the deformations of Fairlie-Nuyts-Fubini-Nicolai (FNFN) $Spin(7)$-instantons on $\mathbb{R}^8$, where $\mathbb{R}^8$ is considered to be an asymptotically conical $Spin(7)$-manifold asymptotic to the cone over $S^7$. We calculate the virtual dimension of the moduli space using Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem and the spectrum of the twisted Dirac operator.</description>

      <title>Prescribing curvatures in the disk via conformal changes of the metric: the case of negative Gaussian curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the question of prescribing the Gaussian curvature on a disk and the geodesic curvature of its boundary by means of a conformal deformation of the metric. We restrict ourselves to a symmetric setting in which the Gaussian curvature is negative, and we are able to give general existence results. Our approach is variational, and solutions will be searched as critical points of an associated functional. The proofs use a perturbation argument via the monotonicity trick of Struwe, together with a blow-up analysis and Morse index estimates. We also give a nonexistence result that shows that, to some extent, the assumptions required for existence are necessary.</description>

      <title>Zeitlin's model for axisymmetric 3-D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zeitlin's model is a spatial discretization for the 2-D Euler equations on the flat 2-torus or the 2-sphere. Contrary to other discretizations, it preserves the underlying geometric structure, namely that the Euler equations describe Riemannian geodesics on a Lie group. Here we show how to extend Zeitlin's approach to the axisymmetric Euler equations on the 3-sphere. It is the first discretization of the 3-D Euler equations that fully preserves the geometric structure, albeit restricted to axisymmetric solutions. Thus, this finite-dimensional model admits Riemannian curvature and Jacobi equations, which are discussed.</description>

      <title>Focal Curves of Closed Toroidal Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometric constructions are widely used in computer graphics and engineering drawing. A right generalized cylinder is a ruled surface whose base curve is a plane curve perpendicular to the rulings. The paper discusses relations between the base curve and the non-planar space curve on the right generalized cylinder. Based on these relations, a method for obtaining a new space curve from a given plane curve parameterized about an arbitrary parameter is presented. At first, we define a non-planar space curve on the right generalized cylinder whose base curve is the considered plane curve, parameterized about an arbitrary parameter. Later on, we examine the focal curve of the obtained cylindrical curve which is also a non-planar curve. The Frenet-Seret system of the cylindrical curve and its focal curve are expressed in terms of the signed curvature of the abovementioned plane curve and its derivatives. Finally, we obtained the parametric representation of orthogonal projection of the focal curve onto the Euclidean plane via before mentioned plane curve and its derivatives. That curve is called generalized focal curve of a plane curve. The proposed method is demonstrated for several closed plane curves used in engineering practice. These curves include: epicycloid, hypocycloid and a curve that is orthogonal projection of toroidal helix onto the Euclidean plane.</description>

      <title>Surgery and positive Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of preserving weighted Riemannian metrics of positive Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature along surgery. We establish two theorems of this type: One for connected sums, and one for surgeries along higher-dimensional spheres. In contrast to known surgery results for positive Ricci curvature, these results are local, i.e. we only impose assumptions on the weighted metric locally around the sphere along which the surgery is performed. As application we then show that all closed, simply-connected spin 5-manifolds admit a weighted Riemannian metric of positive Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature. By a result of Lott, this also provides new examples of manifolds with a Riemannian metric of positive Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Scattering Theory for Asymptotically de Sitter Vacuum Solutions in All Even Spatial Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish a definitive quantitative nonlinear scattering theory for asymptotically de Sitter solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations in $(n+1)$ dimensions with $n\geq4$ even, which are determined by small scattering data at the spacelike asymptotic boundaries $\mathscr{I}^-$ and $\mathscr{I}^+.$ The case of even spatial dimension $n$ poses significant challenges compared to its odd counterpart and was left open by the previous works in the literature. Here, scattering theory is understood to mean existence and uniqueness of scattering states, asymptotic completeness, and the existence of an invertible scattering map with quantitative control on its norm. The existence and uniqueness of scattering states imply that for any small asymptotic data there exists a unique global solution to the Einstein equations, which remains close to the de Sitter metric. Asymptotic completeness is the converse statement, showing that any such solution induces asymptotic data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ and at $\mathscr{I}^+.$ For sufficiently small asymptotic data, we construct the scattering map $\mathscr{S}$ taking data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ to data at $\mathscr{I}^+,$ and we show that the map $\mathscr{S}$ is locally invertible and locally Lipschitz at the de Sitter data, with respect to a Sobolev-type norm.
  The scattering map result is sharp and avoids any "derivative loss", in the sense that we measure the smallness of asymptotic data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ and $\mathscr{I}^+$ using the same Sobolev norm. The proof of the sharp result requires a detailed analysis of the Einstein equations involving a geometric Littlewood-Paley decomposition of the solution, carried out in our companion paper.</description>

      <title>Closed orbits of MHD equilibria with orientation-reversing symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a generalisation of the periodic orbit structure often seen in reflection or mirror symmetric MHD equilibria, we consider equilibria with other orientation-reversing symmetries. An example of such a symmetry, which is a not a reflection, is the parity transformation $(x,y,z) \mapsto (-x,-y,-z)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. It is shown under any orientation-reversing isometry, that if the pressure function is assumed to have toroidally nested level sets, then all orbits on the tori are necessarily periodic. The techniques involved are almost entirely topological in nature and give rise to a handy index describing how a diffeomorphism of $\mathbb{R}^3$ alters the poloidal and toroidal curves of an invariant embedded 2-torus.</description>
