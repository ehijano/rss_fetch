      <title>Quasiparticle pairing encoding of atomic nuclei for quantum annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is emerging as a promising tool in nuclear physics. However, the cost of encoding fermionic operators hampers the application of algorithms in current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we analyze an encoding scheme based on pairing nucleon modes. This approach significantly reduces the complexity of the encoding, while maintaining a high accuracy for the ground states of semimagic nuclei across the $sd$ and $pf$ shells and for tin isotopes. In addition, we also explore the encoding ability to describe open-shell nuclei within the above configuration spaces. When this scheme is applied to a trotterized quantum adiabatic evolution, our results demonstrate a computational advantage of up to three orders of magnitude in CNOT gate count compared to the standard Jordan-Wigner encoding. Our approach paves the way for efficient quantum simulations of nuclear structure using quantum annealing, with applications to both digital and hybrid quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Investigation of entanglement in pure final polarization states from neutron-deuteron elastic ccattering and exclusive deuteron break</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the pure polarization states of the outgoing neutron deuteron pair in elastic polarized neutron polarized deuteron scattering, as well as the pure polarization states of the three free nucleons produced in the corresponding deuteron breakup reaction. Our aim is to provide clear evidence of entanglement in their spin degrees of freedom. These final states can be generated from pure spin states of the incoming nd system, where both the neutron and the deuteron are strongly polarized by maximizing the occupation of a specific magnetic substate. To fully characterize the final configurations, we compute the corresponding spin density matrices using the high precision CD Bonn nucleon-nucleon potential. Among these pure final spin states, we identify strongly entangled, Bell-like states that include at most small admixtures of components diminishing entanglement.</description>

      <title>Cluster and Halo Structures of Light Nuclei within the NUCLEI-PACK Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the ongoing NUCLEI-PACK project, this study presents a semi-classical framework for exploring the microscopic geometry of light and exotic nuclei based on optimized sphere packing of nucleons and clusters. Starting from explicit nucleon coordinates generated by the packing algorithm, the model provides direct access to charge, matter, and core--valence radii, allowing quantitative analysis of clustering and halo formation. The study covers one-nucleon halo nuclei ($^{11}$Be, $^{15}$C, $^{19}$C, and $^{8}$B) and two-nucleon halo systems ($^{6}$He, $^{11}$Li, $^{19}$B, and $^{17}$Ne). For the halo systems, the fitted geometric offset parameter $\Delta$ exhibits an inverse correlation with the nucleon separation energy, reflecting the increasing spatial decoupling between the core and valence nucleons in weakly bound configurations. The framework also reproduces characteristic neutron--neutron separations and opening angles in Borromean nuclei and qualitatively captures the geometric arrangement of $\alpha$ clusters ($^{6}$Li, $^{7}$Li, and $^{12}$C). These results demonstrate that a simple geometric framework can effectively capture the essential features of both halo and cluster structures, providing an intuitive and computationally efficient link between nuclear geometry, binding, and experimentally observed radii.</description>

      <title>Probing vorticity through femtoscopic correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In heavy-ion collisions, as the two nuclei pass through one another and create hot and dense matter, part of their initial angular momentum is transferred to the fireball, generating a nonzero average vorticity. Understanding heavy-ion collision dynamics and its influence on key observables, including those used to probe the initial state or assess thermodynamics of nuclear matter, requires understanding the magnitude of effects tied to vorticity. In this work, we use simulations of non-central Au+Au collisions at $E_{\rm{kin}}=1.23~A\rm{GeV}$ to show that the rotation of the system impacts the space-time picture of particle emission and, in particular, leaves imprints on proton-pion femtoscopic correlations. Next, we use coarse-graining of the simulation outputs to extract the collective velocity as a function of position and time, shedding light on the dynamical origin of this effect. Moreover, we demonstrate that the displacement between the proton and pion emission centers quantifies the strength of the rotation and propose it as a new signal of vorticity in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Laser-assisted {\alpha} decay of actinide nuclei in bichromatic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Actinide nuclei provide a suitable platform for studying the laser-assisted nuclear $\alpha$ decay, with potential applications in nuclear transmutation, nuclear radiotherapy, and nuclear battery regulation. In the present work, we develop a deformed one-parameter model to quantitatively study the influence of ultra-intense laser fields on the $\alpha$ decay of actinide nuclei. Our calculations show that the $\alpha$-decay half-lives of these nuclei can be altered to some finite extent under laser intensities anticipated at near-future laser facilities. Furthermore, we found that, from the perspective of the nucleus, the laser field's effect on $\alpha$ decay is governed by the nuclear shell structure and decay energy. The $\alpha$-emitting nuclei with lower decay energies and located farther from neutron shell closures are more susceptible to the laser fields. From the perspective of the laser driver, we proposed a bichromatic laser scheme to enhance the effects of laser fields on $\alpha$ tunneling of actinide nuclei. With appropriate phase conditions and amplitude ratios, it is shown that a fundamental-second-harmonic ($\omega$-$2\omega$) bichromatic field can increase the time-averaged modification by one to two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Microscopic description of the proton halo in $^{12}$N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The year 2025 marks the 40th anniversary of the discovery of halo nuclei and the 15th anniversary of the development of the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc). In this work, we present the first DRHBc description of the proton halo phenomenon. The available experimental proton separation energies and empirical matter root-mean-square (rms) radii are reasonably well reproduced for the $N=5$ isotones, ranging from the stable nucleus $^{9}$Be to the drip-line nucleus $^{12}$N. In particular, the DRHBc theory captures the abrupt increase in rms radii at $^{12}$N, unambiguously corroborating its proton halo structure. The formation of this halo is attributed to the occupation of a weakly bound orbital with dominant $1p$ components by the valence proton, which contributes approximately $90\%$ to the diffused proton density of $^{12}$N at large distances from the nuclear center. A shape decoupling between the prolate core and the oblate halo in $^{12}$N is predicted.</description>

      <title>What to expect from microscopic nuclear modelling for k$_{\rm eff}$ calculations ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparisons between predicted and benchmark k$_{\rm eff}$ values from criticality-safety systems are often used as metrics to estimate the quality of evaluated nuclear data libraries. Relevant nuclear data for these critical systems generally come from a mixture of expert knowledge and phenomenological predictions. In the present work, we use solely microscopic nuclear modelling from TALYS to estimate actinides cross sections and angular distributions, and we compare the calculated MCNP k$_{\rm eff}$ values for fast systems between the JEFF-3.3 evaluated library, phenomenological and microscopic modelling. The conclusion is that even if the evaluated library leads to the most adequate results, the microscopic nuclear modelling can reach very similar results for these integral quantities. It demonstrates the remarkable advances in the recent decades of microscopic nuclear reaction ingredients for applied integral observables.</description>

      <title>TENDL-astro: a new nuclear data set for astrophysics interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we are presenting a new database of astrophysical interest, based on calculations performed with the nuclear reaction code TALYS. Four quantities are systematically calculated for over 8000 nuclides: cross sections, reaction rates, Maxwellian Averaged Cross Sections (or MACS) at 30 keV and partition functions. For cross sections and reaction rates, nine reactions are considered, induced by neutron, proton or alpha. The main complement of this database compared to existing ones is that the impact of reaction models ({\it e.g.} level density, gamma strength function, and optical model) is estimated by varying 9 different models, and by proposing calculated values for each of them, together with averages, standard deviations and other statistical quantities. This new database, called TENDL-astro, version 2023, is available online (https://tendl.web.psi.ch/tendl\_2023/astro/astro.html) and linked to the well-known TENDL database, used in a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Field Theoretic Approach to Interacting Two Body Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two body tunneling problems are hard to treat analytically due to the incompatibility between tunneling and perturbation theory. The lack of classical solutions of the Euclidean Lagrangian of continuous systems further thwarts semi-classical expansions. To develop an analytic theory which provides insight on interacting two-particle tunneling, we use new results to derive the Bethe-Salpeter equation of a tunneling field theory with Yukawa coupling. We show that in the one plus one dimensional case a closed solution in the instantaneous positive-energy regime is permitted. We then compute the scattering amplitude in first-order perturbation theory and recover the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to confirm physical consistency and relevancy.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the soft-hard separation in the transverse momentum spectra of $pp$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the separation of soft and hard components in the transverse momentum spectra of charged particles as measured by ALICE in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}= 2.76 TeV, 5.02 TeV and 13 TeV at the LHC. The soft component is described by a Boltzmann fit, while the residual spectra are identified as hard QCD-like fragmentation. After separation, the subtracted spectra show no evolution in the shape or peak position with multiplicity, supporting a two-component interpretation. Mean transverse momenta for both contributions remain nearly constant, while Pythia 8 Monte Carlo simulations confirm these trends. Our results support the two-component description as a robust alternative to hydrodynamical interpretations.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound peak in two-color dense QCD: confronting effective models with lattice data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice simulations of two-color, two-flavor Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at finite quark chemical potential have revealed a distinctive peak structure in the sound velocity. Although chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model have been employed to explain this phenomenon, neither approach has fully captured the observed behavior. To address this discrepancy, we have extended the NJL framework by incorporating the Medium Separation Scheme (MSS). This approach isolates medium contributions from divergent integrals, allowing for a more accurate treatment of finite-density effects. Our results indicate a clear increase in the diquark gap ($\Delta$) with increasing chemical potential, consistent with what is also seen in perturbative QCD predictions at high densities. {}Furthermore, the MSS-modified NJL model successfully reproduces the observed peak in the sound velocity.</description>

      <title>Medium modifications of $1P$-wave charmonia $\chi_{cJ}(1P)$ in cold nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we employ the quark-meson coupling model to investigate the mass shifts of $1P$-wave charmonia $\chi_{cJ}(1P)$ ($J=0,1,2$) in cold symmetric nuclear matter by incorporating in-medium loop contributions to the $\chi_{cJ}(1P)$ self-energy within the unquenched picture. At normal nuclear matter density, we obtain significant mass reductions of about 60 MeV for the $\chi_{cJ}(1P)$ states, with the $\chi_{c2}(1P)$ mass shift primarily arising from the vector-vector loop. Our results also indicate the absence of level crossing between the in-medium $\chi_{cJ}(1P)$ mass and the $D\bar{D}$ mass threshold up to $\rho_B &lt; 3\rho_0$-a feature that could be probed in the Compressed Baryonic Matter experiment at FAIR and the Beam Energy Scan program at RHIC.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar heavy-quarkonium hadroproduction from nonrelativistic fragmentation at NLL/NLO$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive hadroproduction of pseudoscalar heavy quarkonia, $\eta_c$ and $\eta_b$ mesons, in high-energy proton collisions. Our framework bases on the single-parton collinear fragmentation within a variable-flavor number scheme, tailored to describe the moderate to large transverse momentum regime. To this end, we construct a new set of collinear fragmentation functions, denoted as NRFF1.0, which evolve via standard DGLAP equations with a consistent treatment of flavor thresholds. Initial conditions for all parton-induced channels are computed using next-to-leading-order nonrelativistic QCD. We perform our analysis within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization framework, employing the JETHAD numerical interface together with the symJETHAD symbolic engine. These tools allow us to deliver predictions for high-energy observables sensitive to quarkonium final states at 13 TeV LHC. To the best of our knowledge, the NRFF1.0 sets represent the first-ever release of collinear fragmentation functions for heavy quarkonia that consistently includes all partonic channels within collinear factorization.</description>

      <title>A family of three maximally symmetric boost-invariant flows in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I discuss the constructions of boost-invariant dissipative conformal hydrodynamic flows by elaborating on the geometric procedure by Gubser and Yarom, which starts from a static, maximally symmetric flow on dS$_3\times\mathbb{R}$. Three foliations of dS$_3$ preserve three-dimensional non-Abelian isometry groups, namely, the flat ISO(2)-invariant, the spherical (closed) SO(3)-invariant, and the hyperbolic (open) SO(2,1)-invariant slicings. I show that the fluids that preserve these symmetries, after they have been Weyl transformed to flat spacetime, give rise to three physically distinct and boost-invariant solutions of the relativistic dissipative Navier-Stokes equations: the well-known and widely studied Bjorken and Gubser flows, and a seemingly thus far unexplored solution that arises from the hyperbolic slicing of dS$_3$. The new solution combines the radial expansion characteristic of the Gubser flow with the late-proper-time applicability of Bjorken's solution, and features a finite, radially bounded droplet whose expanding edge resembles a free-streaming shockwave.</description>

      <title>Realizing the Scientific Program with Polarized Ion Beams at EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarized ion beams at the Electron Ion Collider are essential to address some of the most important open questions at the twenty-first century frontiers of understanding of the fundamental structure of matter. Here, we summarize the science case and identify polarized $^2$H, $^3$He, $^6$Li and $^7$Li ion beams as critical technology that will enable experiments which address the most important science. Further, we discuss the required ion polarimetry and spin manipulation in EIC. The current EIC accelerator design is presented. We identify a significant R\&amp;D effort involving both national laboratories and universities that is required over about a decade to realize the polarized ion beams and estimate (based on previous experience) that it will require about 20 FTE over 10 years (or a total of about 200 FTE-years) of personnel, including graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, technicians and engineers. Attracting, educating and training a new generation of physicists in experimental spin techniques will be essential for successful realization. AI/ML is seen as having significant potential for both acceleration of R\&amp;D and amplification of discovery in optimal realization of this unique quantum technology on a cutting-edge collider. The R\&amp;D effort is synergistic with research in atomic physics and fusion energy science.</description>

      <title>QCD phase structure &amp; equation of state: A functional perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase structure of QCD remains an open fundamental problem of standard model physics. In particular at finite density, our knowledge is limited. Yet, numerous model studies point towards a rich and complex phase diagram at large density. Functional methods like the functional renormalization group and Dyson-Schwinger equations offer a way to study hot and dense QCD matter directly from first principles. I will discuss the phase structure of QCD and its experimental signatures through the lens of these methods.</description>

      <title>Proton-rich production of lanthanides: the {\nu}i process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical origin of the lanthanides is an open question in nuclear astrophysics. Besides the widely studied $s$, $i$, and $r$ processes in moderately-to-strongly neutron-rich environments, an intriguing alternative site for lanthanide production could in fact be robustly $\textit{proton-rich}$ matter outflows from core-collapse supernovae under specific conditions -- in particular, high-entropy winds with enhanced neutrino luminosity and fast dynamical timescales. In this environment, excess protons present after charged particle reactions have ceased can continue to be converted to neutrons by (anti-)neutrino interactions, producing a neutron capture reaction flow up to A~200. This scenario, christened the $\nu i$ process in a recent paper, has previously been discussed as a possibility. Here, we examine the prospects for $\nu i$ process through the lens of stellar abundance patterns, bolometric lightcurves, and galactic chemical evolution models, with a particular focus on hypernovae as candidate sites. We identify specific lanthanide signatures for which the $\nu i$ process can provide a credible alternative to $r$/$i$ processes.</description>

      <title>An end-to-end generative diffusion model for heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We train a generative diffusion model (DM) to simulate ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions from end to end. The model takes initial entropy density profiles as input and produces two-dimensional final particle spectra, successfully reproducing integrated and differential observables. It also captures higher-order fluctuations and correlations. These findings suggest that the generative model has successfully learned the complex relationship between initial conditions and final particle spectra for various shear viscosities, as well as the fluctuations introduced during initial entropy production and hadronization stages, providing an efficient framework for resource-intensive physical goals. The code and trained model are available at https://huggingface.co/Jing-An/DiffHIC/tree/main.</description>

      <title>Impact of dineutrons on nuclear compositions of a core-collapse supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nuclear compositions in the central region of a core-collapse supernova, assuming the existence of dineutrons ($^2n$) and tetraneutrons ($^4n$). At 100~ms after core bounce, ${}^2n$ and ${}^4n$ are more abundant than deuterons within radii of approximately 100 and 50~km, respectively. Compared to the model ignoring the existence of ${}^2n$ and ${}^4n$, the mass fraction of neutrons up to a radius of 100~km reduces, while the mass fractions of protons, deuterons, and $\rm{{}^4He}$ increase. Due to the uncertainties in the properties of $^2n$ and $^4n$, we investigate the influence of their binding energies on the nuclear composition. We find the binding energy of $^2n$ has only a modest effect on the overall composition, except for its own mass fraction, while that of $^4n$ has a negligible impact.</description>

      <title>Comparison of integral equations used to study $T_{cc}^+$ for a stable $D^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a detailed comparison between three formalisms used in recent studies of $DD^*$ scattering, which aim to understand the properties of the doubly-charmed tetraquark, $T_{cc}^+(3875)$. These methods are the three-particle relativistic field theory (RFT) formalism, the two-body Lippmann-Schwinger (LS) equation with chiral effective field theory potentials, and the two-particle relativistic framework proposed by Baiao Raposo and Hansen (BRH approach). In a simplified single-channel setting, we derive the conditions under which the infinite-volume integral equations from the RFT and BRH approaches reduce to the LS form. We present numerical examples showing that differences between these methods can be largely removed by adjusting short-range couplings. We also address a number of technical issues in the RFT approach.</description>

      <title>Neural Posterior Estimation of Neutron Star Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) from astrophysical observations of masses, radii and tidal deformabilities, using Neural posterior estimation (NPE) with Conditional Normalising Flows (CNF). To ensure that the model conforms with reality, physics-informed constraints are embedded directly into the training loss. This enables efficient, likelihood-free inference of full posterior distributions for key thermodynamic quantities-including pressure, squared speed of sound, and the trace anomaly-conditioned on observational data. Our models are trained on synthetic datasets generated from two agnostic EoS priors: polytropic parametrizations (PT) and gaussian process (GP) reconstructions. These datasets span various scenarios, including the presence or absence of tidal deformability information and observational noise. Across all settings, the method produces accurate and well-calibrated posteriors, with uncertainties reduced when tidal deformability constraints are included. Furthermore, we find that the behavior of normalized predictive dispersions is strongly correlated with the maximum central density inside NSs, suggesting that the model can indirectly infer this physically meaningful quantity. The approach generalizes well across EoS families and accurately reconstructs derivative quantities such as the polytropic index, demonstrating its robustness and potential for probing dense matter in NS cores.</description>

      <title>Sim-to-real supervised domain adaptation for radioisotope identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has the potential to improve the speed and reliability of radioisotope identification using gamma spectroscopy. However, meticulously labeling an experimental dataset for training is often prohibitively expensive, while training models purely on synthetic data is risky due to the domain gap between simulated and experimental measurements. In this research, we demonstrate that supervised domain adaptation can substantially improve the performance of radioisotope identification models by transferring knowledge between synthetic and experimental data domains. We consider two domain adaptation scenarios: (1) a simulation-to-simulation adaptation, where we perform multi-label proportion estimation using simulated high-purity germanium detectors, and (2) a simulation-to-experimental adaptation, where we perform multi-class, single-label classification using measured spectra from handheld lanthanum bromide (LaBr) and sodium iodide (NaI) detectors. We begin by pretraining a spectral classifier on synthetic data using a custom transformer-based neural network. After subsequent fine-tuning on just 64 labeled experimental spectra, we achieve a test accuracy of 96% in the sim-to-real scenario with a LaBr detector, far surpassing a synthetic-only baseline model (75%) and a model trained from scratch (80%) on the same 64 spectra. Furthermore, we demonstrate that domain-adapted models learn more human-interpretable features than experiment-only baseline models. Overall, our results highlight the potential for supervised domain adaptation techniques to bridge the sim-to-real gap in radioisotope identification, enabling the development of accurate and explainable classifiers even in real-world scenarios where access to experimental data is limited.</description>

      <title>Nature of the $P_c$ states from compositeness criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a coupled-channel approach, we investigate the structures of four $P_c$ states through compositeness criteria. Toward a more precise description of the states, we have obtained refined fit results of the LHCb data on the $J/\psi p$ invariant mass distribution of the $\Lambda_b^0\to J/\psi p K^-$ decay. Allowing for the fact that each of the four $P_c$ states couples strongly to a nearby $S$-wave channel, three criteria on the compositeness/elementariness are adopted in this study: the pole-counting rule, the spectral density function, and the Gamow wave function. Compositeness information is extracted from the scattering amplitudes and the pole parameters (pole positions and residues), without any preconceived assumptions on the nature of the $P_c$ states, and without any dependence on the model parametrization. Consistently within the framework of all the three methods, it has been found that the $P_c(4312)\,1/2^-$ is mainly composed by $\bar{D}\Sigma_c$, $P_c(4380)\,3/2^-$ by $\bar{D}\Sigma_c^*$, while the $P_c(4440)\,1/2^-$ and $P_c(4457)\,3/2^-$ states both turn out as composite states of $\bar{D}^*\Sigma_c$. The upper limits of the values of their elementariness are estimated to be rather small. This paper provides an additional confirmation of the molecular interpretation for the $P_c$ states in the literature.</description>

      <title>On continuum and resonant spectra from exact WKB analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonance phenomena are central to many quantum systems, where resonant states are typically characterized by pole singularities of the S-matrix. In this work, we employ the complex scaling method (CSM) in conjunction with exact WKB analysis to elucidate the geometric structure of scattering problems that encompass both bound and resonant states. By analyzing the continuum spectrum via the exact WKB framework, we derive the S-matrix for the inverted Rosen--Morse potential and reveal its underlying complex-geometric features. Furthermore, we reinterpret the Aguilar--Balslev--Combes theorem, the foundation of CSM, from a geometric perspective, and discuss the physical significance of the Siegert boundary condition within a rigorously defined modified Hilbert space. Our analysis bridges scattering cross-sections and spectral theory, offering new geometric insights into quantum resonance and scattering phenomena.</description>
