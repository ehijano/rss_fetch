      <title>The Gravity Tunnel Superhighway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript discusses gravity tunnels formed by connecting two vertical shafts by a constant-radius tunnel within the Earth, which featured in a dream I had in September 2024. The total travel time through such a tunnel can be minimized with respect to the radius at which the shafts are connected. I derive this minimal radius and minimum time given two assumptions for Earth's interior, that of constant gravitational acceleration and that of uniform density. Both models have solutions in terms of basic functions, and are typically 10% slower than the brachistochrone curve between the same points. I also find the optimal depth of a "superhighway," which minimizes the average time to fall between any two points on a great circle. Finally, I discuss the role of problems like these in physics education.</description>

      <title>Recent advances in space sailing missions and technology: review of the 6th International Symposium on Space Sailing (ISSS 2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 6th International Symposium on Space Sailing (ISSS 2023) took place on June 5-9, 2023 at the New York City College of Technology, the City University of New York. Since its inauguration in Herrsching (Germany, 2007), the ISSS has been held in New York (USA, 2010), Glasgow (UK, 2013), Kyoto (Japan, 2017) and Aachen (Germany, 2019). During the five-day symposium, participants from 14 countries gathered to discuss recent advances in space sailing, investigating new concepts and designs, describing innovative hardware and enabling technologies, strategies for dynamics and control, and providing updates on testing results for systems under development and future mission applications. As part of the 18 sessions, almost 50 oral presentations were held and, subsequently, 17 papers were submitted for review and publication. This paper aims to give an overview of all the cutting-edge technologies, detailed analysis and promising results shared with the scientific community as part of the event. Following the noteworthy deployment of the world's first solar sail IKAROS in 2010, missions like NanoSail-D2 (2011) and LightSail-2 (2019) have showcased the potential of solar sailing technology through successful demonstrations. Besides highlighting advancements in present and future programs, the symposium was an opportunity to reflect on objectives, design and test results from research centers and universities, as well as illustrate applications for interstellar travel, evaluate degrading performance and suggest alternative solutions for known limitations. The following Symposium is scheduled for early summer 2025 and will be hosted by TU Delft.</description>
