      <title>Modeling net-charge fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of Pb+Pb data for net-charge fluctuations at LHC energies within the HYDJET++ model is presented. The strongly intensive quantities $D$ and $\Sigma$ are used to get rid of the effects related to volume fluctuations of the system. We employ two versions of the HYDJET++ for the analysis. The first one is the standard or default version, whereas the second one represents its further modification, which takes into account explicit event-by-event conservation of the electric net-charge of produced particles. Inclusion of the canonical net-charge conservation in the model allows one for better description of the experimental data obtained by the ALICE and the CMS Collaborations. Comparison with calculations of other models is also presented.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Fragmentation at the Future Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10157v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study low-energy nuclear physics at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven. By comparing the standard theory of electron-nucleus scattering with the equivalent photon method applied to Ultraperipheral Collisions (UPC) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, we extract valuable insights into both processes. In the limit of extremely high beam energies and small energy transfers, very transparent equations emerge. We apply these equations to analyze nuclear fragmentation in UPCs at the LHC and eA scattering at the EIC, demonstrating that the EIC could facilitate unique photonuclear physics studies.</description>

      <title>Electric conductivity of hot and dense nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport coefficients play an important role in characterising hot and dense nuclear matter, such as that created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions (URHIC). In the present work we calculate the electric conductivity of hot and dense hadronic matter by extracting it from the electromagnetic spectral function, through its zero energy limit at vanishing 3-momentum. We utilise the vector dominance model (VDM), in which the photon couples to hadronic currents predominantly through the $\rho$ meson. Therefore, we use hadronic many-body theory to calculate the $\rho$-meson's self-energy in hot and dense hadronic matter, by dressing its pion cloud with $\pi$-$\rho$, $\pi$-$\sigma$, $\pi$-$K$, N-hole, and $\Delta$-hole loops. We then introduce vertex corrections to maintain gauge invariance. Finally, we analyze the low-energy transport peak as a function of temperature and baryon chemical potential, and extract the conductivity along a proposed phase transition line.</description>

      <title>Coulomb confinement in the Hamiltonian limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gribov--Zwanziger scenario attributes the phenomenon of confinement to the instantaneous interaction term in the QCD Hamiltonian in the Coulomb gauge. For a static quark-antiquark pair, it leads to a potential energy that increases linearly with the distance between them. Lattice studies of the SU(2) Yang--Mills theory determined the corresponding (Coulomb) string tension for sources in the fundamental representation, $\sigma_{C}$, to be about three times larger than the Wilson loop string tension, $\sigma_F$. It is far above the Zwanziger variational bound, $\sigma_C \geq \sigma_F$. We argue that the value established in the literature is artificially inflated. We examine the lattice definition of the instantaneous potential, find the source of the string tension's enhancement, and perform its improved determination in SU(2) lattice gauge theory. We report our conservative estimate for the value of the Coulomb string tension as $\sigma_C/\sigma_F = 2.0 \pm 0.4$ and discuss its phenomenological implications.</description>

      <title>Study of $^{7}$Li elastic scattering and the lithium-induced reaction of one-nucleon transfers from $^{10}$B($^{7}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{11}$B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The angular distributions of elastic scattering of $^{7}$Li, as well as the lithium-induced reaction of one-nucleon transfers $^{10}$B($^{7}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{11}$B were measured at $E_{lab}$ = 58 MeV. Experiment was done using U-400 accelerator beam of the FLNR JINR, Dubna. Angular distribution for reaction $^{10}$B($^{7}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{11}$B with excitation of the 3.56 MeV state ($^{6}$Li*) is present for the first time. The DWBA analysis of the differential cross section of the $^{10}$B($^{7}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{11}$B ground state (g.s.) transition and excited ($J^\pi$ = 0$^+$, $T$ = 1, $E$ = 3.56 MeV) state of $^{6}$Li transition was performed. The optical model potentials were obtained by fitting of measured elastic scattering data and evaluating parameters for the output reaction channels. Phenomenological approaching based on solving an approximate equation for the reaction form factor was used to determine its radial dependence and empirical values of asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC). Obtained values of ANCs for the $^{6}$Li$_\text{g.s.}$ and $^{6}$Li*(3.56 MeV) states are similar to literature one. Comparison of the radial dependences of form factors shows that the wave function of the $^{6}$Li nucleus in excited ($J^\pi$ = 0$^+$, $T$ = 1, $E$ = 3.56 MeV) state has increased spatial dimension compared to the ground state, and in both cases some larger spatial size than the ground states of the $^{11}$B and $^{10}$B. Within the framework of our analysis, we can confirm that the radius of the $^{6}$Li nucleus in the 3.56 MeV state is larger than in the ground state. This result is an argument in favor of a halo existence in $^{6}$Li*(3.56 MeV) state, while the question of a halo in $^{6}$Li$_\text{g.s.}$ still leaves open.</description>

      <title>Dissecting a strongly coupled scalar nucleon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the stress within a strongly coupled scalar nucleon, and now dissect the gravitational form factors into contributions from its constituents, the (mock) nucleon and the (mock) pion. The computation is based on a non-perturbative solution of the scalar Yukawa model in the light-front Hamiltonian formalism with a Fock sector expansion including up to one nucleon and two pions. By employing the ``good currents" $T^{++}_i$, $T^{+-}_i$ and $T^{12}_i$, we extract the full set of gravitational form factors $A_i$, $D_i$, $\bar c_i$ without the contamination of the spurious form factors, and free of uncanceled UV divergences. With these results, we decompose the mass of the system into its constituents and compute the matter and mechanical radii, gaining insights into the strongly coupled system.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factor $D$ of charmonium from shear stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on our recent analysis of the hadronic matrix element of the stress-energy tensor in covariant light front dynamics, we extract the charmonium gravitational form factor $D(Q^2)$ from shear stress $T^{12}$. This is in contrast to our recent work using the (light-front) energy density $T^{+-}$. Indeed, by comparing these two currents, we identify terms that are responsible for the violation of the current conservation. Numerical results based on basis light-front quantization show that the violation effects are small and the $D$-term extracted from the two currents are close to each other, hence validating our previous work using $T^{+-}$.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of the heavy quark in the domain of the non-perturbative and non-eikonal gluon radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drag and diffusion coefficients of the Heavy Quarks (HQs), such as charm and bottom, are one of the prime tools for discerning the properties of the deconfined QCD medium created in the Heavy Ion Collisions experiments. The innate non-perturbative nature of the QCD medium renders it imperative to estimate the transport coefficients in that domain. The present work evaluates the drag and diffusion coefficients of the moving HQ interacting with the medium particles via two-body collisional and three-body radiative processes to the first order in opacity by employing Gribov mechanism for the non-perturbative regime. We proffer the latest results of the HQ transport coefficients computed for the non-perturbative and non-eikonal gluon radiation off the HQ. The calculations show significant increment of the transport coefficients with the increasing non-eikonality by juxtaposing the results with those of the pertubative and eikonal regions. We hope to shed fresh light towards explaining the experimental data on the nuclear modification facor, $R_{AA}$, the elliptic flow, $v_2$ of the HQ by advocating the importance of the non-eikonality of the gluon radiation off the HQ.</description>

      <title>Collisional corrections to spin polarization from quantum kinetic theory using Chapman-Enskog expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the collisional corrections to the spin polarization pseudo-vector, $\delta\mathcal{P}^{\mu}$, using quantum kinetic theory in Chapman-Enskog expansion. We derive the spin Boltzmann equation incorporating M{\o}ller scattering process. We further consider two distinct scenarios using hard thermal loop approximations for simplification. In scenario (I), the vector charge distribution function is treated as off-equilibrium under the validity domain of gradient expansion. Remarkably, the polarization induced by gradients of thermal chemical potential and shear viscous tensors are modified, but $\delta\mathcal{P}_{\textrm{ }}^{\mu}$ in this scenario does not depend on the coupling constant. In scenario (II), the vector charge distribution function is assumed to be in local thermal equilibrium. Then collisional corrections $\delta\mathcal{P}_{\textrm{ }}^{\mu}$ in this scenario are at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^{2}\partial^{2})$. Additionally, we evaluate the $\delta\mathcal{P}^{\mu}$ using relaxation time approach for comparative analysis. Our results establish the theoretical framework necessary for the future numerical investigations on the interaction corrections to spin polarization.</description>

      <title>Recent advancements in atomic many-body methods for high-precision studies of isotope shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of atomic many-body methods, capable of incorporating electron correlation effects accurately, is required for isotope shift (IS) studies. In combination with precise measurements, such calculations help to extract nuclear charge radii differences, and to probe for signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. We review here a few recently-developed methods in the relativistic many-body perturbation theory (RMBPT) and relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory frameworks for calculations of IS factors in the highly charged ions (HCIs), and neutral or singly-charged ions, respectively. The results are presented for a wide range of atomic systems in order to demonstrate the interplay between quantum electrodynamics (QED) and electron correlation effects. In view of this, we start our discussions with the RMBPT calculations for a few HCIs by rigorously treating QED effects; then we outline methods to calculate IS factors in the one-valence atomic systems using two formulations of the RCC approach. Then we present calculations for two valence atomic systems, by employing the Fock-space RCC methods. For completeness, we briefly discuss theoretical input required for the upcoming experiments, their possibilities to probe nuclear properties and implications to fundamental physics studies.</description>

      <title>Comparison of renormalized interactions using one-dimensional few-body systems as a testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even though the one-dimensional contact interaction requires no regularization, renormalization methods have been shown to improve the convergence of numerical ab initio calculations considerably. In this work, we compare and contrast these methods: `the running coupling constant' where the two-body ground state energy is used as a renormalization condition, and two effective interaction approaches that include information about the ground as well as excited states. In particular, we calculate the energies and densities of few-fermion systems in a harmonic oscillator with the configuration interaction method, and compare the results based upon renormalized and bare interactions. We find that the use of the running coupling constant instead of the bare interaction improves convergence significantly. A comparison with an effective interaction, which is designed to reproduce the relative part of the energy spectrum of two particles, showed a similar improvement. The effective interaction provides an additional improvement if the center-of-mass excitations are included in the construction. Finally, we discuss the transformation of observables alongside the renormalization of the potential, and demonstrate that this might be an essential ingredient for accurate numerical calculations.</description>

Abstract: Coupled non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger equations are crucial in describing dynamics of many particle systems. We present a quantum imaginary time evolution (ITE) algorithm as a solution to such equations in the case of nuclear Hartree-Fock equations. Under a simplified Skyrme interaction model, we calculate the ground state energy of an oxygen-16 nucleus and demonstrate that the result is in agreement with the classical ITE algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Here we report first results of applying Genetic Programming to obtain equations for constructing reduced-order models of quantum systems, with a particular interest in nuclear Density Functional Theory. We employ the reduced basis method to obtain reduced coordinates as the amplitudes of the reduced basis, and use genetic programming to avoid the need of constructing the reduced equations through, for example, a Galerkin projection. The resulting reduced-order models show excellent performance in both accuracy and speed, including for extrapolations in the control parameters, and show promise as an effective method for emulating computationally demanding calculations in Nuclear Physics</description>

      <title>Is infrared-collinear safe information all you need for jet classification?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based jet classifiers are able to achieve impressive tagging performance in a variety of applications in high-energy and nuclear physics. However, it remains unclear in many cases which aspects of jets give rise to this discriminating power, and whether jet observables that are tractable in perturbative QCD such as those obeying infrared-collinear (IRC) safety serve as sufficient inputs. In this article, we introduce a new classifier, Jet Flow Networks (JFNs), in an effort to address the question of whether IRC unsafe information provides additional discriminating power in jet classification. JFNs are permutation-invariant neural networks (deep sets) that take as input the kinematic information of reconstructed subjets. The subjet radius and a cut on the subjet's transverse momenta serve as tunable hyperparameters enabling a controllable sensitivity to soft emissions and nonperturbative effects. We demonstrate the performance of JFNs for quark vs. gluon and Z vs. QCD jet tagging. For small subjet radii and transverse momentum cuts, the performance of JFNs is equivalent to the IRC-unsafe Particle Flow Networks (PFNs), demonstrating that infrared-collinear unsafe information is not necessary to achieve strong discrimination for both cases. As the subjet radius is increased, the performance of the JFNs remains essentially unchanged until physical thresholds that we identify are crossed. For relatively large subjet radii, we show that the JFNs may offer an increased model independence with a modest tradeoff in performance compared to classifiers that use the full particle information of the jet. These results shed new light on how machines learn patterns in high-energy physics data</description>

      <title>Systematic Improvement of $x$-dependent Unpolarized Nucleon Generalized Parton Distribution in Lattice-QCD Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first study of the effects of renormalization-group resummation (RGR) and leading-renormalon resummation (LRR) on the systematic errors of the unpolarized isovector nucleon generalized parton distribution in the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). This work is done using lattice gauge ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration, consisting of 2+1+1 flavors of highly improved staggered quarks with a physical pion mass at lattice spacing $a\approx 0.09$ fm and a box width $L\approx 5.76$ fm. We present results for the nucleon $H$ and $E$ GPDs with average boost momentum $P_z\approx 2$ GeV at momentum transfers $Q^2=[0, 0.97]$ GeV$^2$ at skewness $\xi=0$ as well as $Q^2\in 0.23$ GeV$^2$ at $\xi=0.1$, renormalized in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme at scale $\mu=2.0$ GeV, with two- and one-loop matching, respectively. We demonstrate that the simultaneous application of RGR and LRR significantly reduces the systematic errors in renormalized matrix elements and distributions for both the zero and nonzero skewness GPDs, and that it is necessary to include both RGR and LRR at higher orders in the matching and renormalization processes.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang edge singularities in QCD via the Dyson-Schwinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take the Dyson-Schwinger Equation approach of QCD for the quark propagator at complex chemical potential to study the QCD phase transition. The phase transition line of the $(2+1)$-flavor QCD matter in the imaginary chemical potential region is computed via a simplified truncation scheme, whose curvature is found to be consistent with the one at real chemical potential. Moreover, the computation in the complex chemical potential plane allows us to determine the location of the Lee-Yang edge singularities. We show explicitly that the critical end point coincides with the Lee-Yang edge singularities on the real $\mu_{B}^{}$ axis. We also investigate the scaling behavior of the singularities and discuss the possibility of extrapolating the CEP from a certain range of chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Stress out of charmonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational form factors of charmonium. Our method is based on a Hamiltonian formalism on the light front known as basis light-front quantization. The charmonium mass spectrum and light-front wave functions were obtained from diagonalizing an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates confinement from holographic QCD and one-gluon exchange interaction from light-front QCD. We proposed a quantum many-body approach to construct the hadronic matrix elements of the energy momentum tensor $T^{++}$ and $T^{+-}$, which are used to extract the gravitational form factors $A(Q^2)$ and $D(Q^2)$. The obtained form factors satisfy the known constraints, e.g. von Laue condition. From these quantities, we also extract the energy, pressure and light-front energy distributions of the system. We find that hadrons are multi-layer systems.</description>

      <title>Refined determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weak mixing angle is a fundamental parameter of the electroweak theory of the standard model whose measurement in the low-energy regime is still not precisely determined. Different probes are sensitive to its value, among which atomic parity violation, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering and parity-violating electron scattering on different nuclei. In this work, we attempt for the first time to combine all these various determinations by performing a global fit that also keeps into account the unavoidable dependence on the experimentally poorly known neutron distribution radius of the nuclei employed, for which a new measurement using proton-cesium elastic scattering became available. By using all present direct determinations of the neutron distribution radius of cesium we find $\sin^2\!\vartheta_{W} =0.2396^{+0.0020}_{-0.0019}$, which should supersede the previous value determined from atomic parity violation on cesium. When including electroweak only, but also indirect, determinations of the neutron distribution radius of cesium the uncertainty reduces to 0.0017 maintaining the same central value, showing an excellent agreement independently of the method used.</description>
