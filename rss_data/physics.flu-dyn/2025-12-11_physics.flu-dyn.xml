      <title>Conserved Pseudomomenta in Linear Quasigeostrophic Fluid Flows From Noether's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations for the two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic equations linearized about a zonally-symmetric basic flow are presented. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian exhibit an infinite U(1) symmetry due to the absence of wave + wave -&gt; wave interactions in the linearized approximation. By Noether's theorem the symmetry has a corresponding infinite set of conservation laws which are the well-known pseudomomenta. There exist separately conserved pseudomomenta at each zonal wavenumber, a point that has sometimes been obscured in past treatments.</description>

      <title>Accelerating high-order energy-stable discontinous Galerkin solver using auto-differentiation and neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Methods (DGSEM) provide excellent accuracy for complex flow simulations, but their computational cost increases sharply with higher polynomial orders. %that provide very accurate solutions. To alleviate these limitations, this work presents a differentiable DG solver coupled with neural networks (NNs) that learn corrective forcing terms to correct low-order simulations and provide high-order accuracy. The solver's full differentiability enables gradient-based optimization and interactive (solver-in-the-loop) training, mitigating the data-shift problem typically encountered in static, offline learning. Two representative test cases are considered: the one-dimensional viscous Burgers' equation and two-dimensional decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence (DHIT). The results demonstrate that interactive training with extended unrolling horizons substantially improves the precision and long-term stability of the simulation compared to static training. For the Burgers' equation, a $\mathbb{P}_2$ simulation corrected using a NN-correction achieves the accuracy of a $\mathbb{P}_4$ solution with eight times reduction in computational cost. For the DHIT case, the NN-corrected low-order simulations successfully achieve high-order accuracy while reduce the error beyond the training interval. These results highlight the potential of differentiable solvers combined with neural networks as a robust and efficient framework for accelerating high-fidelity DG-based fluid simulations.</description>

      <title>Simulating surfactant effects in phase-transforming fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surfactants are critical in natural processes and engineering, but measuring their concentrations in non-equilibrium conditions and in the presence of flow is difficult. Therefore, computational methods are a key tool for improving our understanding. Predicting the effect of surfactants on liquid-vapor transformations is particularly challenging due to (1) simultaneous mass transfer, non-equilibrium thermodynamics and Marangoni stresses, and (2) the phenomenological assumptions underlying many liquid-vapor phase-change models. Starting from the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations, a first-principles approach to liquid-vapor phase transformations, we developed a model of liquid-vapor flows with surfactants. We performed simulations of bubbles under equilibrium and liquid-vapor interface oscillations to demonstrate that the model successfully reproduces surfactant-mediated reductions in surface tension. We also investigated the mechanisms whereby surfactant affects bubble coalescence and condensation. Overall, this work provides a new framework for studying the effect of surfactants on liquid-vapor transformations and suggests multiple areas for future research, including the impact of complex surface chemistries on flow around bubbles and the acoustic response of bubbles with surfactants.</description>

      <title>Predictive Compressibility Transformation for Hypersonic Turbulent Boundary Layers with Cold Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressibility transformations are used to relate hypersonic zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG) turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) to incompressible reference states, but their assessment has largely focused on the collapse of transformed mean velocity profiles, without enforcing a unique, Mach-independent representation of the mean shear. In this work, a stricter consistency condition is proposed, requiring that a single incompressible inner-outer model for the mean velocity gradient reproduce all transformed compressible profiles when expressed in terms of a transformed wall-normal coordinate. This implies collapse not only of the transformed mean velocity but also of semilocal eddy viscosity and TKE production. Existing compressibility transformations are shown, using hypersonic DNS, to incur velocity errors of 1-25% relative to the incompressible inner-outer model, particularly for strongly cooled cases. A new forward compressible-to-incompressible transformation is developed that constructs the transformed coordinate as a convex combination of semilocal and integral-type basis functions with coefficients modeled as functions of friction Mach number and wall heat transfer rate. Casewise optimization yields consistency errors of 1-4% across the available hypersonic DNS set, and this performance is retained using multi-linear and multi-quadratic regressions. The forward transformation is embedded in an inverse incompressible-to-compressible transformation framework, which reconstructs the compressible state from freestream and wall conditions at a prescribed BL thickness. The inverse solver recovers key BL parameters, velocity profiles, and skin friction distributions with good accuracy, and generally improves upon existing models for cold-wall hypersonic TBLs, thereby providing a physically constrained basis for near-wall modeling in hypersonic TBLs with strong wall cooling.</description>

      <title>Aerodynamic Forces on a Wing Surfing in a Two-dimensional Vortex Wake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the wake-surfing nature of animals, this study aims to understand the aerodynamic force variation on a wing surfing in an unsteady 2-D wake. Wind tunnel experiments were conducted using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and force measurements with a fixed wing immersed in the wake of a pitching airfoil. The comparison between force and PIV measurements shows that the lift response of the surfing wing is aligned with the impingement of flow structures, and that the dependence of the cycle-averaged lift fluctuations on the upstream flapping kinematics can be scaled as a function of the reduced amplitude and reduced frequency of the flapping motion. Good collapse of the data is found, and deviations from scaling are explained in terms of the wake characteristics. The phase-resolved lift fluctuations on the vortical wake encountering can be effectively predicted using classic unsteady aerodynamics based on measured unsteady local flow conditions (instantaneous angle of attack and speed). The theoretical predictions compare well with direct force sensor measurements.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Surrogates for Gas Dynamics: A Physics-Informed Pedagogical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressible flow problems are characterized by highly nonlinear, implicit, and often transcendental governing equations. In undergraduate gas dynamics educa- tion, solving these equations traditionally relies on iterative numerical methods or extensive look-up tables, which can obscure the physical intuition of the solution space. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework using Deep Learning to generate high-fidelity surrogate models for five canonical problems: Rayleigh flow, Fanno flow, oblique shocks, convergent-divergent nozzles, and unsteady shock tubes. We detail the specific neural network architectures and physics-informed feature en- gineering strategies required for each problem, such as using logarithmic inputs for Fanno friction parameters or geometric anchors for oblique shocks. The resulting models achieve high accuracy and enable instantaneous visualization of complex design spaces, such as thermodynamic T s diagrams and unsteady x t wave interactions. This approach demonstrates how modern data-driven techniques can be integrated into the physics curriculum to enhance conceptual understanding.</description>

      <title>Sound emission from oscillating bubbles trapped by the collapse of drop-impact craters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a drop impacts a deep pool, it forms a crater which subsequently rebounds. Under certain conditions, a dimple forms at the crater bottom, which pinches off to entrap a small bubble. The oscillation of this entrapped bubble is the primary source of the underwater sound produced by rain. We use simultaneous ultra-high-speed video imaging and synchronized acoustic recording, with an immersed hydrophone, to investigate the details of the sound formation, over a range of impact Weber numbers and different dimple shapes. With frame-rates as high as 5 million fps, we can track the shape evolution of the pinched off dimple-bubble, which experiences large volumetric compression, by as much as 50%. The subsequent volume oscillations are consistent with the observed $\simeq 125$ Pa acoustic pressure amplitude, for the strongest compression. For our configuration the sound amplitude increases for smaller bubbles pinched off from the dimple. The acoustic forcing mechanism is therefore the inertial focusing of the momentum of the liquid outside the dimple, as it pinches off. The acoustic frequency agrees well with the Minnaert theory for freely oscillating spherical bubbles, of the same size. The finer details of the acoustic signal reveal an interplay between the larger dimple bubble and the tiny bubble entrapped during the initial contact between the drop and pool. For the singular dimple where no bubble is pinched off, the sound generation has a broader range of frequencies, with the tiny bubble oscillating at $\sim 100$ kHz, after being deformed by the rapid vertical retraction of the dimple below the singular jet.</description>

      <title>Emergence of edge state in suspension of self-propelled particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study a model convection system of a suspension of self-propelled particles, motivated by recent experimental findings of localized and bistable bioconvection pattern, being distinct from classical Rayleigh--B\'{e}nard convection. Linear stability analysis of the model system reveals that the trivial noncovection state is stabilized by an increase of self-propelled speed in the vertical direction. Through numerical simulations, we found a nonlinear convection state even when the nonconvection state is stable. Applying ideas and tools developed in wall-bounded flows, we numerically identified an edge state, which is an unstable solution on a basin boundary in the model dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Lazy Diffusion: Mitigating spectral collapse in generative diffusion-based stable autoregressive emulation of turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent flows posses broadband, power-law spectra in which multiscale interactions couple high-wavenumber fluctuations to large-scale dynamics. Although diffusion-based generative models offer a principled probabilistic forecasting framework, we show that standard DDPMs induce a fundamental \emph{spectral collapse}: a Fourier-space analysis of the forward SDE reveals a closed-form, mode-wise signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that decays monotonically in wavenumber, $|k|$ for spectra $S(k)\!\propto\!|k|^{-\lambda}$, rendering high-wavenumber modes indistinguishable from noise and producing an intrinsic spectral bias. We reinterpret the noise schedule as a spectral regularizer and introduce power-law schedules $\beta(\tau)\!\propto\!\tau^\gamma$ that preserve fine-scale structure deeper into diffusion time, along with \emph{Lazy Diffusion}, a one-step distillation method that leverages the learned score geometry to bypass long reverse-time trajectories and prevent high-$k$ degradation. Applied to high-Reynolds-number 2D Kolmogorov turbulence and $1/12^\circ$ Gulf of Mexico ocean reanalysis, these methods resolve spectral collapse, stabilize long-horizon autoregression, and restore physically realistic inertial-range scaling. Together, they show that na\"ive Gaussian scheduling is structurally incompatible with power-law physics and that physics-aware diffusion processes can yield accurate, efficient, and fully probabilistic surrogates for multiscale dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Noise dissipation mechanisms of an acoustic liner under grazing flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity lattice-Boltzmann very-large-eddy simulations are performed to describe the noise dissipation mechanisms in an acoustic liner subjected to grazing turbulent flow at a Mach number of 0.3 and plane acoustic waves. The study examines the effects of sound pressure level (ranging from 130 to 160 dB) and frequency, as well as the direction of acoustic-wave propagation relative to the grazing flow. The considered mechanisms of acoustic energy dissipation are the viscous losses along the internal walls of the orifice and the vortex shedding. The latter is quantified through Howe's energy corollary. In the absence of grazing flow, acoustic energy is dissipated almost equally during both inflow and outflow phases, with vortex shedding dominating at high SPL and viscous losses at low SPL. The introduction of a grazing flow alters the flow topology; in particular, the shear layer past the orifice generates a quasi-steady vortex that confines the acoustic-induced flow to the downstream half of the orifice. This topological change modifies the two noise dissipation mechanisms: viscous losses increase at low SPL because the grazing flow pushes the fluid toward the downstream lip of the orifice; vortex shedding becomes phase dependent, dissipating acoustic energy during the inflow phase and generating acoustic energy during the outflow phase. This explains why the net acoustic dissipation decreases in the presence of grazing flow, highlighting the crucial role of near-wall flow topology on liner performances.</description>

      <title>A GPU-Accelerated Fully Coupled Fluid-Solid-Thermal SPH Solver for Industrial Gearboxes: Application to Lubricant Flow and Heat Transfer in a Bevel-Helical Reducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a GPU-accelerated, fully coupled fluid-solid-thermal Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) framework for high-fidelity analysis of splash-lubricated gearboxes. A series of thermo-fluid simulations of a bevel-helical gear reducer were conducted by varying shaft speed, oil immersion depth, and lubricant viscosity to evaluate their influence on splash dynamics, churning losses, and lubricant temperature rise. The results show that churning losses increase by nearly an order of magnitude as the speed rises from 150 to 600 rad/s, while the corresponding lubricant temperature rise becomes approximately three to four times smaller. Variations in immersion depth and viscosity adjust the heating rate only modestly-typically within 10-20%-with their influence reversing between low- and high-speed regimes. The GPU backend provides a 7-9 speedup over a high-performance desktop CPU, enabling multi-million-particle, full-gearbox thermo-fluid simulations without specialized hardware. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of high-fidelity thermal analysis of industrial gearboxes and provide quantitative insight into the coupled splash, churning, and heat-transfer mechanisms that govern gearbox thermal performance.</description>

      <title>Buoyancy-dependent induced flow by vertically migrating swimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective vertical migrations of negatively buoyant swimmers can drive large-scale fluid transport. In the ocean, zooplankton migrate over vertical distances several orders of magnitude larger than their body length. These swimmers experience changes in their buoyancy relative to the stably stratified ocean water column. The impact of net swimmer buoyancy on the scale of aggregate-scale induced flows remains unresolved. We hypothesize that as the net buoyancy of swimmers becomes increasingly negative the speed of induced flow in the opposite direction of swimming will increase due to changes in the required force to swim upward and thus the momentum imparted on the surrounding fluid. Simultaneous three-dimensional swimmer tracking and two-dimensional two-component flow measurements are used to measure the flow induced by collective vertical migration of Artemia salina. Experiments were designed to modulate the buoyant force on the swimmers by changing environmental salinity. Experimental results supported the hypothesis and were used to develop a theoretical model, which was then used to contextualize results to ocean relevant conditions with non-dimensional analysis.</description>

      <title>Graph Deep Learning for Intracranial Aneurysm Blood Flow Simulation and Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms remain a major cause of neurological morbidity and mortality worldwide, where rupture risk is tightly coupled to local hemodynamics particularly wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index. Conventional computational fluid dynamics simulations provide accurate insights but are prohibitively slow and require specialized expertise. Clinical imaging alternatives such as 4D Flow MRI offer direct in-vivo measurements, yet their spatial resolution remains insufficient to capture the fine-scale shear patterns that drive endothelial remodeling and rupture risk while being extremely impractical and expensive.
  We present a graph neural network surrogate model that bridges this gap by reproducing full-field hemodynamics directly from vascular geometries in less than one minute per cardiac cycle. Trained on a comprehensive dataset of high-fidelity simulations of patient-specific aneurysms, our architecture combines graph transformers with autoregressive predictions to accurately simulate blood flow, wall shear stress, and oscillatory shear index. The model generalizes across unseen patient geometries and inflow conditions without mesh-specific calibration. Beyond accelerating simulation, our framework establishes the foundation for clinically interpretable hemodynamic prediction. By enabling near real-time inference integrated with existing imaging pipelines, it allows direct comparison with hospital phase-diagram assessments and extends them with physically grounded, high-resolution flow fields.
  This work transforms high-fidelity simulations from an expert-only research tool into a deployable, data-driven decision support system. Our full pipeline delivers high-resolution hemodynamic predictions within minutes of patient imaging, without requiring computational specialists, marking a step-change toward real-time, bedside aneurysm analysis.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics of Black-Hole Coronae: QPOs, Turbulence, and Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The variability of X-rays observed from accreting black hole systems, including quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), suggests a complex nonlinear dynamics in the corona. Here, we propose a new theoretical framework for this problem, based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In this model, coronal variability arises from feedback between a macroscopic oscillation of the plasma and the rate at which it is cooled by the inverse Compton scattering of soft photons from the disc. The "pair thermostat'' mechanism then allows the corona to act as a heat engine that extracts work cyclically from the underlying thermal disequilibrium between the low-entropy heating and the high-entropy cooling by the soft photons, in close analogy to the well-known $\kappa$-mechanism for pulsating stars. This coronal self-oscillation may explain QPOs without the need to invoke an external resonant driving. Moreover, we argue that this mechanism can provide the power to generate turbulence and jets in the corona.</description>

      <title>High Order Numerical Methods Preserving Invariant Domain for Hyperbolic and Related Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Admissible states in hyperbolic systems and related equations often form a convex invariant domain. Numerical violations of this domain can lead to loss of hyperbolicity, resulting in illposedness and severe numerical instabilities. It is therefore crucial for numerical schemes to preserve the invariant domain to ensure both physically meaningful solutions and robust computations. For complex systems, constructing invariant-domain-preserving (IDP) schemes is highly nontrivial and particularly challenging for high-order accurate methods. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of IDP schemes for hyperbolic and related systems, with a focus on the most popular approaches for constructing provable IDP schemes. We first give a systematic review of the fundamental approaches for establishing the IDP property in first-order accurate schemes, covering finite difference, finite volume, finite element, and residual distribution methods. Then we focus on two widely used and actively developed classes of high order IDP schemes as well as their recent developments, most of which have emerged in the past decade. The first class of methods seeks an intrinsic weak IDP property in high-order schemes and then designs polynomial limiters to enforce a strong IDP property at the points of interest. This generic approach applies to high-order finite volume and discontinuousGalerkin schemes. The second class is based on the flux limiting approaches, which originated from the flux-corrected transport method and can be adapted to a broader range of spatial discretizations, including finite difference and continuous finite element methods. In this survey, we elucidate the main ideas in the construction of IDP schemes, provide some new perspectives and insights, with extensive examples, and numerical experiments in gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Neural Network-Finite Element Method for the Viscous-Plastic Sea-Ice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient hybrid Neural Network-Finite Element Method (NN-FEM) for solving the viscous-plastic (VP) sea-ice model. The VP model is widely used in climate simulations to represent large-scale sea-ice dynamics. However, the strong nonlinearity introduced by the material law makes VP solvers computationally expensive, with the cost per degree of freedom increasing rapidly under mesh refinement. High spatial resolution is particularly required to capture narrow deformation bands known as linear kinematic features in viscous-plastic models. To improve computational efficiency in simulating such fine-scale deformation features, we propose to enrich coarse-mesh finite element approximations with fine-scale corrections predicted by neural networks trained with high-resolution simulations. The neural network operates locally on small patches of grid elements, which is efficient due to its relatively small size and parallel applicability across grid patches. An advantage of this local approach is that it generalizes well to different right-hand sides and computational domains, since the network operates on small subregions rather than learning details tied to a specific choice of boundary conditions, forcing, or geometry. The numerical examples quantify the runtime and evaluate the error for this hybrid approach with respect to the simulation of sea-ice deformations. Applying the learned network correction enables coarser-grid simulations to achieve qualitatively similar accuracy at approximately 11 times lower computational cost relative to the high-resolution reference simulations. Moreover, the learned correction accelerates the Newton solver by up to 10% compared to runs without the correction at the same mesh resolution.</description>

      <title>Data-driven time-dependent bases for turbulent airfoil wake-extreme vortex gust interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze interactions between turbulent airfoil wake and an extremely strong gust using a data-driven framework with time-dependent bases. The current approach represents each snapshot with time-varying bases consisting of two-dimensional in-plane modes and one-dimensional spanwise modes, together with a reduced covariance matrix. We derive closed-form evolution equations for these time-varying components and advance them over time, requiring only a small rolling window and avoiding full-history storage. Applied to extreme vortex gust-airfoil interaction at Re=5000, we examine how in-plane modes and their associated energy level evolve across gust conditions of varying intensity and size. Before impingement, the first in-plane mode dominates; after impingement, the second mode gains energy_amplified by stronger/larger gusts. A larger leading-mode energy gap implies coherent structure and faster recovery; a smaller gap with slower decay indicates richer multiscale activity and delayed re-stabilization. These trends follow the transient lift dynamics as well, with higher amplitude and more oscillations indicated by a rise in the leading singular values. This work provides an interpretable, time-varying data-driven modal analysis of extreme gust encounter.</description>

      <title>Ultimate large-$Rm$ regime of the solar dynamo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For more than fourty years, the quest to understand how large-scale magnetic fields emerge from turbulent flows in rotating astrophysical systems, such as the Sun, has been a major thread of computational astrophysics research. Using a parameter scan and phenomenological analysis of maximally-simplified three-dimensional cartesian magnetohydrodynamic simulations of large-scale nonlinear helical turbulent dynamos, I present results in this Letter that strongly point to an asymptotic ultimate regime of the large-scale solar dynamo, at large magnetic Reynolds numbers $Rm$, involving helicity fluxes between hemispheres. I obtained corresponding numerical solutions at both $Pm&gt;1$ and $Pm&lt;1$, and show that they can currently only be achieved in clean, simplified numerical setups. The analysis further strongly suggests that all global simulations to date lie in a non-asymptotic turbulent MHD regimes highly sensitive to changes in kinetic and magnetic Reynolds numbers. Ideas are presented to attempt to reach this ultimate regime in such "realistic" global spherical models at a reasonable numerical cost. Overall, the results clarify the current state, and some hard limitations of the brute-force numerical modelling approach applied to this, and other similar astrophysical turbulence problems.</description>

      <title>Oceanic internal tides: do they get phased at the Equator?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-mode baroclinic tides play a major role in ocean dynamics, especially for energy redistribution and deep ocean mixing. These internal waves, generated by tidal flow over submarine topography, can propagate for thousands of kilometres across ocean basins, and become unstable through wave-mean flow or wave-wave interactions. Satellite observations of internal tides have shown that part of their lunar semidiurnal (M2) altimetry signal loses phase coherence in equatorial regions, thus affecting how we interpret their dynamics and energy distribution (Buijsman et al. 2017). We investigate the interaction of a baroclinic M2 internal tide wavepacket with an equatorial zonal jet, possibly of any horizontal or vertical structure. The dynamics of the low modes are explored as well as the potential excitation of higher vertical modes and how these interactions can generate incoherences in the baroclinic tide signal.
  We develop an idealized linear model using modal decomposition (Kelly et al. 2016), which is solved using Dedalus, to study the dynamics of a mode 1 M2 internal wavepacket on an equatorial beta plane. A zonal jet, with a uniform or a sheared vertical structure, is added at the equator to investigate potential wave-mean flow interaction. We find that a vertically uniform zonal jet affects the propagation of the mode 1 wavepacket. Depending on the strength of the jet, this can cause total reflection or strong distortion of the wavepacket. In contrast, a wavepacket entering a vertically sheared jet shows energy scattering into higher modes, which have lower phase and group speeds, shorter wavelengths, and are thus more susceptible to dissipation (and critical layers for non-uniform stratification). As the wavepacket exits the jet, reverse energy transfer occurs and the phase speed difference between the modes may explain part of the phase incoherence observed in altimetry data.</description>

      <title>Burgers dynamics for Poisson point process initial conditions of the Weibull class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the statistical properties of one-dimensional Burgers dynamics with stochastic initial conditions for the velocity potential defined by a Poisson point process whose intensity follows a power law with exponent $\alpha &gt; -1$. Working in the inviscid limit and exploiting the geometrical construction of solutions in terms of first-contact parabolas, we derive explicit analytical expressions for a broad set of statistical quantities. These include the one- and two-point probability distributions of the velocity, the multiplicity functions of voids and shocks, and the velocity and density correlation functions together with their associated power spectra. We also show that the full hierarchy of $n$-point distributions factorizes into a sequence of two-point conditional probabilities. This class of initial conditions leads to self-similar evolution and produces probability distributions characterized by stretched-exponential tails, with tail exponents spanning the full range from unity to infinity. The associated characteristic length scale grows as a power law of time, with an exponent lying between zero and one half.</description>

      <title>A Model Intercomparison Study of Mixed-Phase Clouds in a Laboratory Chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-phase clouds, composed of supercooled liquid droplets and ice crystals, play a critical role in weather and climate systems. Their complex microphysical interactions and coupling with turbulence at microscales govern the cloud properties at macroscales, yet remain challenging to observe and quantify under atmospheric conditions. This model intercomparison study utilizes ten model configurations to simulate mixed-phase cloud evolution in the Michigan Technological University's Pi Chamber. The models span a range of frameworks, including box models, direct numerical simulation, and large-eddy simulation models, and incorporate both bin and Lagrangian microphysics. Each model was tuned to reproduce the observed liquid-phase steady state prior to ice injection. Ice particles were then introduced into the domain at various rates to examine cloud glaciation behavior. By the intercomparison design, all models successfully reproduced the observed mean droplet radius and number concentration during the liquid-phase stage. Increasing ice particle injection rates led to consistent qualitative trends across models: depletion of liquid water, reduced total water content, and a shift in particle size distributions toward larger radii. However, quantitative differences arose due to variations in model treatment in dynamics and microphysics, including subgrid-scale turbulence parameterizations, wall forcing, and particle removal parameterizations. Most models that simulate the full chamber retained liquid droplets near the lower boundary, where supersaturation forcing is strongest and droplets are replenished before mixing into the core region. These surviving liquids droplets were absent in simulations assuming a well-mixed domain, excluding the near-wall region, or using coarse grid spacing.</description>

Abstract: The phenomenon of Taylor or shear-induced dispersion of a non-passive scalar field in a pulsatile pipe flow is investigated, accounting for the scalar field's influence on fluid density and transport coefficients. By employing multiple scale analysis, an effective one-dimensional, unsteady mixing problem for the scalar field is obtained, which includes the diffusion coefficient for shear-induced dispersion. The resulting governing equations are applicable to a range of scalar transport problems in pulsatile pipe flows.</description>

      <title>Effects of Geometric Modelling and Blood Rheology in Patient-Specific Arterial Blood Flow Simulations with Speed-Accuracy Trade-Off Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23049v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the effects of geometric model reduction on blood flow simulations in the patient-specific descending aorta, followed by speed-accuracy trade-off analysis using 3D simulations. We demonstrate how wall shear stresses (WSS) can be reliably estimated for such realistic arteries using significantly faster simulations of highly idealized equivalent geometries, for any blood rheology model. CFD simulations (3D) are performed at two levels of geometry reduction employing realistic pulsatile inflow and pressure outlet boundary conditions and utilizing both Newtonian and non-Newtonian blood rheology models, including the one developed recently by Apostolidis and Beris. The first level of reduction does not retain effects due to local asymmetry but can approximate various flow parameters and patterns, while showing a significant computational speedup. However, further simplification to an idealized smooth geometry loses all information about the vortex structures and flow circulation. The non-Newtonian models retain more accuracy than the Newtonian models in geometry reductions, as quantified by correlations defined in this study. The idealized smooth geometry, combined with area correction, yields WSS estimates that closely approximate those of the actual artery. This study is expected to be applicable in geometric reductions (and speed enhancements) for more complex patient-specific 3D simulations while maintaining accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intermittency of energy dissipation has long been studied via high-order moments in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, but not much where the boundary effects are explicitly included. Here, we derive two fundamental Reynolds number scaling expressions for dissipation moments in wall-bounded flows -- one in the outer region where the boundary effects are weak and the other close to the walls where those effects are strong -- and support these expressions by direct numerical simulations. Dissipation moments in the outer region follow universal power laws with exponents linked to anomalous scaling of velocity structure functions. In contrast, moments near the wall follow a bounded defect law, leading to a finite asymptotic limit without intermittency. For very large Reynolds numbers, the outer proposal predicts vanishing dissipation compared to that on the wall, highlighting the need for solid boundaries in generating Onsager-type singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the far-field and near-field solutions for the Green's function of a point force acting perpendicular to a no-slip wall in a Brinkman fluid, focusing on the regime where the distance between the force and the wall is much smaller than the screening length. The general solution is obtained in closed form up to a single integral and can be systematically expanded in a Taylor series in both the far-field and near-field limits. The flow can then be expressed as a series of source-multipole singularities with an additional, analytically known, correction in the proximity of the wall. Comparisons with numerical integration demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the asymptotic expansions. The results are also applicable to the unsteady Stokes flow driven by a localized assembly of forces, such as a beating cilium protruding from a flat surface.</description>

      <title>Self-similar multishock implosions for ultrahigh compression of matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a class of self-similar solutions describing ultrahigh compression of a uniform-density target by spherically converging, stacked shock waves. Extending the classical Guderley model, we derive a scaling law for the final density of the form $\rho_{r}/\rho_{0} \propto \hat{P}^{\beta (N-1)}$, where $N$ is the number of shocks, $\hat{P}$ the stage pressure ratio, and $\beta$ a numerical exponent determined by the adiabatic index $\gamma$. One-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations confirm the validity of this scaling across a broad parameter range. Notably, the relation remains accurate even in the strongly nonlinear regime up to $\hat{P} \sim 70$, well beyond the perturbative limit, highlighting the robustness and practical relevance of the model. Owing to its volumetric geometry, this compression scheme inherently avoids the Rayleigh--Taylor instability, which typically compromises shell-based implosions, and thereby establishes a theoretical benchmark for instability-free compression in inertial confinement fusion.</description>

      <title>Drag reduction via separation control using plasma actuators on a truck cabin side</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the drag reduction on a heavy-duty vehicle using dielectric-barrier discharge plasma actuators located on the A-pillars. An experimental campaign is carried out on a generalized truck model, the Ground Transportation System (GTS), which is known for its lateral separation bubbles on both sides of the truck's cabin. Measurements are performed for several yaw angles up to $7.5\degree$. Actuation is applied individually on the leeward and windward sides as well as simultaneously. Load cell measurements show that the plasma actuators effectively reduce the axial force on the GTS, with symmetric actuation achieving the highest reduction. Leeward actuation demonstrates greater control authority than the windward one; at large yaw angles the latter has a negligible effect on the axial force. Regarding side force, the leeward actuation produces a drop in its magnitude while windward actuation produces an increase. Interestingly, actuating symmetrically also augments the side force. Particle image velocimetry reveals that the plasma actuator causes a reduction in the length and width of the separation bubble on the cabin side, reducing the apparent frontal area of the truck and thus its drag. Under crosswind conditions, the stronger authority of the leeward actuator is explained by the larger separation bubble. The side force variation is driven by the net lateral suction force, which correlates with the size of the lateral recirculation regions controlled by the actuators.</description>

      <title>An Euler-Lagrangian Multiphysics Coupling Framework for Particle-Laden High-Speed Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle-laden effects in high-speed flows require a coupled Euler and Lagrangian prediction technique with varying fidelity of thermochemical models, depending on the simulation conditions of interest. This requirement makes the development of a conventional monolithic solver challenging to manage the different fidelity of the thermochemical models within a single computational framework. To address this, the present study proposes a multi-solver framework for the coupled Euler-Lagrangian predictions applicable to various particle-laden high-speed flow conditions. Volumetric and surface couplings are established between a particle solver ORACLE (OpenFOAM-based lagRAngian CoupLEr) and a thermochemical nonequilibrium flow solver based on an adaptable data exchange algorithm. The developed framework is then validated by predicting particle-laden supersonic nozzle flows and aerothermal heating around a hypersonic Martian atmospheric entry capsule. Finally, a quasi-1D approximation is proposed in conjunction with a surrogate method to efficiently and accurately predict particle-laden surface erosion, with quantified parametric uncertainty, for hypersonic aerothermal characterization.</description>

      <title>A parametric tensor ROM for the shallow water dam break problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a variant of a tensor reduced-order model (tROM) for the parameterized shallow-water dam-break problem. This hyperbolic system presents multiple challenges for model reduction, including a slow decay of the Kolmogorov $N$-width of the solution manifold, shock formation, and the loss of smooth solution dependence on parameters. These issues limit the performance of traditional Proper Orthogonal Decomposition based ROMs. Our tROM approach, based on a low-rank tensor decomposition, builds a parameter-to-solution map from high-fidelity snapshots and constructs localized reduced bases via a local POD procedure. We apply this method to 1D dry-bed and wet-bed problems and 2D wet-bed problem with topography and bottom friction, showing that the non-interpolatory variant of the tROM, combined with Chebyshev sampling near critical parameter values, effectively captures parameter-dependent behavior and significantly outperforms standard POD-ROMs. This is especially evident in the wet-bed case, where POD-ROMs exhibit poor resolution of shock waves and spurious oscillations.</description>

      <title>Modified Marrone-Treanor model: parameterization and benchmarking for five-species air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present updated parameters for five-species air (N2, O2, NO, N and O) reactions to be used with the Modified Marrone-Treanor two-temperature model. The vibrational relaxation and chemical reaction rates are derived from quasiclassical trajectory calculations and direct molecular simulations using ab initio potential energy surfaces. The resulting model enables efficient computational fluid dynamics simulations of nonequilibrium air chemistry in hypersonic flows. We show that the model reproduces direct molecular simulation benchmark solutions with high accuracy in zero-dimensional heat baths representative of strong nonequilibrium post-shock conditions. The model's analytical expressions for dissociation rate coefficient and vibrational energy change per reaction ensure that the correct amount of energy is transferred between the vibrational and trans-rotational modes. Detailed balance is imposed for three-body recombination reactions and our simulations exhibit quasi-steady-state dissociation rates and proper approach to thermochemical equilibrium. In direct comparison with the Park TTv model, the Modified Marrone-Treanor model predicts significantly slower conversion of N2 into N below 10000 K and significantly more NO production at all temperatures. This is likely due to its significantly higher Zeldovich reaction rates compared to Park.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Active Matter in Incompressible Fluid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active proteins and membrane-bound motors exert force dipole flows along fluid interfaces and lipid bilayers. We develop a unified hydrodynamic and Hamiltonian framework for the interactions of pusher and puller dipoles embedded in an incompressible two-dimensional membrane supported by a shallow viscous subphase. Beginning from the screened Stokes equations of the membrane--subphase composite, we derive the real-space incompressible Green's tensor, obtain its near- and far-field asymptotics, and construct the resulting dipolar velocity and stream functions. Although generic dipoles reorient under the local membrane vorticity, we show that the far-field dipolar flow is vorticity-free; force-free motors therefore retain fixed orientation and obey a Hamiltonian dynamics in which the positions of $N$ dipoles evolve via an effective Hamiltonian built from the dipolar stream function. In the near field, where the flow possesses finite vorticity, a Hamiltonian formulation is recovered in the quenched-orientation limit. Exploiting this structure, we simulate ensembles of pusher and puller dipoles and compare the dynamics generated by the $1/r$ near-field kernel and the subphase screened $1/r^{3}$ far-field kernel. For identical dipoles, the far-field Hamiltonian produces rapid clustering from random initial conditions, whereas the near-field Hamiltonian suppresses collapse and yields extended, non-aggregating configurations.</description>
