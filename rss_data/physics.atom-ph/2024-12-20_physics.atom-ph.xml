      <title>Time-Reversal Symmetry-Protected Coherent Control of Ultracold Molecular Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent control of atomic and molecular scattering relies on the preparation of colliding particles in superpositions of internal states, establishing interfering pathways that can be used to tune the outcome of a scattering process. However, incoherent addition of different partial wave contributions to the integral cross sections (partial wave scrambling), commonly encountered in systems with complex collisional dynamics, poses a significant challenge, often limiting control. This work demonstrates that time-reversal symmetry can overcome these limitations by constraining the relative phases of S-matrix elements, thereby protecting coherent control against partial wave scrambling, even for collisions mediated by highly anisotropic interactions. Using the example of ultracold O$_2$-O$_2$ scattering, we show that coherent control is robust against short-range dynamical complexity. Furthermore, the time-reversal symmetry also protects the control against a distribution of collisional energy. These findings show that ultracold scattering into the final states that are time-reversal-invariant, such as the J = 0, M = 0 rotational state, can always be optimally controlled by using time-reversal-invariant initial superpositions. Beyond the ultracold regime, we observe significant differences in the controllability of crossed-molecular beam vs. trap experiments with the former being easier to control, emphasizing the cooperative role of time-reversal and permutation symmetries in maintaining control at any temperature. These results open new avenues for the coherent control of complex inelastic collisions and chemical reactions both in and outside of the ultracold regime.</description>

      <title>Fast determination of the tilt of Raman lasers using the tilt-scanned fringe for atom gravimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitive axes of atom gravimeters are defined by the directions of the respective Raman lasers. Any tilt of the Raman lasers with respect to the vertical direction introduces errors in gravity measurements. In this work, we report a fast determination of the tilt of Raman lasers, where the fringe of the atom interferometer is scanned by varying the tilt, rather than the phase, of the Raman lasers. Unlike the periodic cosine fringes typically used in atom interferometers, the fringe obtained by changing the tilt, referred to as the tilt-scanned fringe, is aperiodic and symmetric with respect to zero tilt. The tilt-scanned fringe is highly sensitive to asymmetries caused by non-zero tilt, enabling fast and precise determination of the Raman laser tilt in atom gravimeters. We demonstrate that one tilt-scanned fringe, corresponding to a measurement cycle time of 13 s, can determine the tilt with a typical precision of about 30 $\mu$rad in our developed atom gravimeter. Further investigation proves that the tilt-scanned fringe approach shortens the measurement cycle time by over an order of magnitude while keeping comparable precision with conventional tilt determination techniques. The fast tilt determination presented here is significant for the application of atom gravimeters, particularly in absolute gravity surveys.</description>

      <title>Dual atom (87Rb-133Cs) grating magneto-optical trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a dual-color grating chip design method for simultaneously capturing dual atomic clouds (87Rb and 133Cs). By simulating key parameters such as the grating period, etching depth, duty cycle, coating material, and thickness, the optimal design parameters were determined to ensure efficient dual-wavelength diffraction and maximize the number of captured atoms. Experimental results demonstrate the simultaneous trapping of 1.6E8 87Rb atoms and 7.8E6 133Cs atoms, thereby offering an approach for multi-species cold atom systems. This dual-species grating magneto-optical trap (GMOT) system has potential applications in precision measurements such as cold atom clocks, quantum interferometers, and quantum electrometry.</description>

      <title>Rydberg states and new resonant states of the imidogen molecule NH: pathways for nitrogen release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral resonant states of molecules play a very important role in the dissociation dynamics and other electronic processes that occur via intermediate capture into these states. With the goal of identifying resonant states, and their corresponding widths, of the imidogen molecule NH as a function of internuclear distance, we have performed detailed R-matrix calculations on the e + NH+ system. In a previous work, we had identified bound states of NH and Feshbach resonances in the e + NH+ system at a single geometry, namely the NH+ equilibrium Re = 2.0205 a0 . Here we present a much more detailed work by repeating the calculation on over 60 internuclear distances to obtain the corresponding potential energy curves. The bound states for nine symmetries have been detailed many of which, particularly the singlet states, were never studied before. Several resonant states of different symmetries, which were unknown until now, have been systematically identified and their widths calculated in the present work, which proved much more challenging due to presence of many avoided crossings. It is hoped that the bound and the new resonant states obtained here will open up other molecular dynamics studies, since for several dissociative processes, although experimental data existed for more than a decade, these are still uncorroborated due to absence of molecular data, and hence subsequent theoretical calculations.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the Structures in the van der Waals Interactions of Alkali Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms are used in a wide range of applications due to their peculiar properties like strong dipolar and van der Waals interactions. The choice of Rydberg state has a huge impact on the strength and angular dependence of the interactions, and so a detailed understanding of the underlying processes and resulting properties of the interactions is therefore key to select the most suitable states for experiments. We study the van der Waals interactions in alkali atoms in detail and highlight the structures which allow an understanding and exploitation of the various interaction properties. A particular theme is the identification of F\"orster resonances with $n_1 \neq n_2$, which offer interaction potentials with a wide range of properties that make them particularly interesting for experimental applications. A second theme is a focus on the underlying structures that shape the angular dependency and sign of the interactions. This understanding -- instead of brute-force calculations -- allows for a much simpler and more systematic search for suitable pair states. These insights can be used for the selection of tailored interaction potentials subject to experimental constraints and requirements. We use rubidium as an example species in this work and also provide data for cesium and pair states that are coupled via two- or three-photon transitions, i.e. up to F states, in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Individual assembly of two-species Rydberg molecules using optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach to investigating Rydberg molecules by demonstrating the formation and characterization of individual Rb$^{*}$Cs Rydberg molecules using optical tweezers. By employing single-atom detection of Rb and Cs, we observe molecule formation via correlated loss of both species and study the formation dynamics with single-particle resolution. We control the interatomic distances by manipulating the relative wavefunction of atom pairs using the tweezer intensity, optimizing the coupling to molecular states and exploring the effect of the tweezer on these states. Additionally, we demonstrate molecule association with atoms trapped in separate tweezers, paving the way for state-selective assembly of polyatomic molecules. The observed binding energies, molecular alignment, and bond lengths are in good agreement with theory. Our approach is broadly applicable to Rydberg tweezer platforms, expanding the range of available molecular systems and enabling the integration of Rydberg molecules into existing quantum science platforms.</description>

      <title>Electron polarization in the resonant inelastic scattering on hydrogen-like ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the polarization of the electron acquired during the inelastic resonant scattering on hydrogen-like ions initially being in the ground state. The formation and subsequent Auger decay of the intermediate (3l3l') doubly excited states in the resonant channel modify the mechanism of polarization change by enhancing both spin-orbit and exchange interactions. Consequently, in the presence of the resonant channel, the acquired polarization can be clearly observed even for light ions when it is challenging to discern which state of the ion was excited in the process. We also show that the energy dependence of the polarization parameter clearly demonstrates strong interference both between the contributions of specific autoionizing states in the resonant channel and between the non-resonant and resonant channels.</description>

      <title>Coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states of ultracold molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotational states of ultracold polar molecules possess long radiative lifetimes, microwave-domain coupling, and tunable dipolar interactions. Coherent dynamics between pairs of rotational states have been used to demonstrate simple models of quantum magnetism and to manipulate quantum information stored as qubits. The availability of numerous rotational states has led to many proposals to implement more complicated models of quantum magnetism, higher-dimensional qudits, and intricate state networks as synthetic dimensions; however, these are yet to be experimentally realised. The primary issue limiting their implementation is the detrimental effect of the optical trapping environment on coherence, which is not easily mitigated for systems beyond two levels. To address this challenge, we investigate the applicability of magic-wavelength optical tweezer traps to facilitate multitransition coherence between rotational states. We demonstrate simultaneous second-scale coherence between three rotational states. Utilising this extended coherence, we perform multiparameter estimation using a generalised Ramsey sequence and demonstrate coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states. Our work paves the way to implementing proposed quantum simulation, computation, and metrology schemes that exploit the rich rotational structure of ultracold polar molecules.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Phase Transition in the Two-Photon Dicke Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the dissipative phase transition of the two-photon Dicke model, a topic that has garnered significant attention recently. Our analysis reveals that while single-photon loss does not stabilize the intrinsic instability in the model, the inclusion of two-photon loss restores stability, leading to the emergence of superradiant states which coexist with the normal vacuum states. Using a second-order cumulant expansion for the photons, we derive an analytical description of the system in the thermodynamic limit which agrees well with the exact calculation results. Additionally, we present the Wigner function for the system, shedding light on the breaking of the Z4-symmetry inherent in the model. These findings offer valuable insights into stabilization mechanisms in open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring complex nonlinear dynamics in two-photon Dicke models.</description>

      <title>Massive graviton dark matter searches with long-baseline atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom interferometers offer exceptional sensitivity to ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) through their precise measurement of phenomena acting on atoms. While previous work has established their capability to detect scalar and vector ULDM, their potential for detecting spin-2 ULDM remains unexplored. This work investigates the sensitivity of atom interferometers to spin-2 ULDM by considering several frameworks for massive gravity: a Lorentz-invariant Fierz-Pauli case and two Lorentz-violating scenarios. We find that coherent oscillations of the spin-2 ULDM field induce a measurable phase shift through three distinct channels: coupling of the scalar mode to atomic energy levels, and vector and tensor effects that modify the propagation of atoms and light. Atom interferometers uniquely probe all of these effects, while providing sensitivity to a different mass range from laser interferometers. Our results demonstrate the potential of atom interferometers to advance the search for spin-2 dark matter through accessing unexplored parameter space and uncovering new interactions between ULDM and atoms.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Near-Infrared Features of Kilonovae: The Importance of Gadolinium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of the kilonova AT2017gfo and investigations of its light curves and spectra confirmed that neutron star mergers are sites of r-process nucleosynthesis. However, the identification of elements responsible for the spectral features is still challenging, particularly at the near-infrared wavelengths. In this study, we systematically searched for all possible near-infrared transitions of heavy elements using experimentally calibrated energy levels. Our analysis reveals that most candidate elements with strong absorption lines are lanthanides (Z=57-71) and actinides (Z=89-103). This is due to their complex structures leading to many low-lying energy levels, which results in strong transitions in the near-infrared range. Domoto et al. (2022) have shown that La III and Ce III can explain the absorption features at $\lambda\sim$ 12,000 - 15,000 A. While our results confirm that these two elements show strong infrared features, we additionally identify Gd III as the next most promising species. Due to its unique atomic structure involving the half-filled 4f and the outer 5d orbitals, Gd III has one of the lowest-lying energy levels, between which relatively strong transitions occur. We also find absorption lines caused by Gd III in the near-infrared spectrum of a chemically peculiar star HR 465, which supports their emergence in kilonova spectra. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we confirm that Gd III lines affect the feature at $\sim$ 12,000 A previously attributed to La III. Future space-based time-series observations of kilonova spectra will allow the identification of Gd III lines.</description>

      <title>AI-Enabled Rapid Assembly of Thousands of Defect-Free Neutral Atom Arrays with Constant-time-overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assembling increasingly larger-scale defect-free optical tweezer-trapped atom arrays is essential for quantum computation and quantum simulations based on atoms. Here, we propose an AI-enabled, rapid, constant-time-overhead rearrangement protocol, and we experimentally assemble defect-free 2D and 3D atom arrays with up to 2024 atoms with a constant time cost of 60 ms. The AI model calculates the holograms for real-time atom rearrangement. With precise controls over both position and phase, a high-speed spatial light modulator moves all the atoms simultaneously. This protocol can be readily used to generate defect-free arrays of tens of thousands of atoms with current technologies, and become a useful toolbox for quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Sticking coefficient for atoms impinging on a metallic surfaces, and the x-ray photoemission by metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium electron-gas systems exhibit rich physics, which we explore through three problems. First, we study photoemission from metals, traditionally analyzed in the frequency domain. Unexpectedly, the photoemission rate oscillates at high frequencies as it decays, with the oscillation amplitude decaying faster than the average current. Analytical and numerical results reveal this behavior arises from interference between two excitation processes: one decaying via the Doniach-Sunjic power law and the other following the faster Nozi\`eres-De Dominicis law. XPS experiments targeting this feature could identify its frequency-domain counterpart. Second, we examine adiabaticity in an electron gas subject to a localized potential ramping up at a constant rate. Analytical and numerical findings map the parameter space where the system behaves adiabatically. Contrary to the Quantum Adiabatic Criterion, which links adiabaticity to slow ramp-up rates, we show that the number of energy scales involved in screening the potential dictates non-adiabaticity. Lastly, we investigate the collision of a neutral hydrogen atom with a copper surface. Electron transfer ionizes the H atom, activating an image-charge potential that pulls the ion toward the surface. Using a spinless model, we numerically track the atomic wave packets evolution and compute the sticking coefficient, the probability the atom remains near the surface. The coefficient peaks near 300 meV, balancing non-adiabatic contributions, which increase with energy, and the traversal time through the interaction region. Numerical results align semi-quantitatively with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Emergence of unidirectionality and phase separation in optically dense emitter ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transmission of light through an ensemble of two-level emitters in a one-dimensional geometry is commonly described by one of two emblematic models of quantum electrodynamics (QED): the driven-dissipative Dicke model or the Maxwell-Bloch equations. Both exhibit distinct features of phase transitions and phase separations, depending on system parameters such as optical depth and external drive strength. Here, we explore the crossover between these models via a parent spin model from bidirectional waveguide QED, by varying positional disorder among emitters. Solving mean-field equations and employing a second-order cumulant expansion for the unidirectional model -- equivalent to the Maxwell-Bloch equations -- we study phase diagrams, the emitter's inversion, and transmission depending on optical depth, drive strength, and spatial disorder. We find in the thermodynamic limit the emergence of phase separation with a critical value that depends on the degree of spatial order but is independent of inhomogeneous broadening effects. Even far from the thermodynamic limit, this critical value marks a special point in the emitter's correlation landscape of the unidirectional model and is also observed as a maximum in the magnitude of inelastically transmitted photons. We conclude that a large class of effective one-dimensional systems without tight control of the emitter's spatial ordering can be effectively modeled using a unidirectional waveguide approach.</description>

      <title>Quantum Compilation Toolkit for Rydberg Atom Arrays with Implications for Problem Hardness and Quantum Speedups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement a comprehensive quantum compilation toolkit for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem on quantum hardware based on Rydberg atom arrays. Our end-to-end pipeline involves three core components to efficiently map generic MIS instances onto Rydberg arrays with unit-disk connectivity, with modules for graph reduction, hardware compatibility checks, and graph embedding. The first module (reducer) provides hardware-agnostic and deterministic reduction logic that iteratively reduces the problem size via lazy clique removals. We find that real-world networks can typically be reduced by orders of magnitude on sub-second time scales, thus significantly cutting down the eventual load for quantum devices. Moreover, we show that reduction techniques may be an important tool in the ongoing search for potential quantum speedups, given their ability to identify hard problem instances. In particular, for Rydberg-native MIS instances, we observe signatures of an easy-hard-easy transition and quantify a critical degree indicating the onset of a hard problem regime. The second module (compatibility checker) implements a hardware compatibility checker that quickly determines whether or not a given input graph may be compatible with the restrictions imposed by Rydberg quantum hardware. The third module (embedder) describes hardware-efficient graph embedding routines to generate (approximate) encodings with controllable overhead and optimized ancilla placements. We exemplify our pipeline with experiments run on the QuEra Aquila device available on Amazon Braket. In aggregate, our work provides a set of tools that extends the class of problems that can be tackled with near-term Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Categorical Symmetries in Spin Models with Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Logical Magic State Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computation is a key goal in quantum information science. By encoding quantum information into logical qubits utilizing quantum error correcting codes, physical errors can be detected and corrected, enabling substantial reduction in logical error rates. However, the set of logical operations that can be easily implemented on such encoded qubits is often constrained, necessitating the use of special resource states known as 'magic states' to implement universal, classically hard circuits. A key method to prepare high-fidelity magic states is to perform 'distillation', creating them from multiple lower fidelity inputs. Here we present the experimental realization of magic state distillation with logical qubits on a neutral-atom quantum computer. Our approach makes use of a dynamically reconfigurable architecture to encode and perform quantum operations on many logical qubits in parallel. We demonstrate the distillation of magic states encoded in d=3 and d=5 color codes, observing improvements of the logical fidelity of the output magic states compared to the input logical magic states. These experiments demonstrate a key building block of universal fault-tolerant quantum computation, and represent an important step towards large-scale logical quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Near-to mid-IR spectral purity transfer with a tunable frequency comb: methanol frequency metrology over a record frequency span</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the upgrade and operation of a frequency-comb-assisted high-resolution mid-infrared molecular spectrometer allowing us to combine high spectral purity, SI-traceability, wide tunability and high sensitivity. An optical frequency comb is used to transfer the spectral purity of a SI-traceable 1.54 $\mu$m metrology-grade frequency reference to a 10.3 $\mu$m quantum cascade laser (QCL). The near-infrared reference is operated at the French time/frequency metrology institute, calibrated there to primary frequency standards, and transferred to Laboratoire de Physique des Lasers via the REFIMEVE fiber network. The QCL exhibits a line width of $\delta\nu\sim 0.1$ Hz, a sub-$10^{-15}$ relative frequency stability from 0.1 to 10 s and its frequency is traceable to the SI with a total relative uncertainty better than $4\times10^{-14}$ after 1-s averaging time. We have developed the instrumentation allowing comb modes to be continuously tuned over 9 GHz resulting in a QCL of record spectral purity uninterruptedly tunable at the precision of the reference over an unprecedented span of $\Delta\nu$ = 1.4 GHz. We have used our apparatus to conduct sub-Doppler spectroscopy of methanol in a multi-pass cell, demonstrating state-of-art frequency uncertainties down to the few kilohertz level ($\sim10^{-10}$ in relative value). We have observed weak intensity resonances unreported so far, resolved subtle doublets never seen before and brought to light discrepancies with the HITRAN database. This demonstrates the potential of our apparatus for probing subtle internal molecular processes, building accurate spectroscopic models of polyatomic molecules of atmospheric or astrophysical interest, and carrying out precise spectroscopic tests of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Individual Addressing and State Readout of Trapped Ions Utilizing Radio-Frequency Micromotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excess "micromotion" of trapped ions due to the residual radio-frequency (rf) trapping field at their location is often undesirable and is usually carefully minimized. Here, we induce precise amounts of excess micromotion on individual ions by adjusting the local static electric field they experience. Micromotion modulates the coupling of an ion to laser fields, ideally tuning it from its maximum value to zero as the ion is moved away from the trap's rf null. We use tunable micromotion to vary the Rabi frequency of stimulated Raman transitions over two orders of magnitude, and to individually control the rates of resonant fluorescence from three ions under global laser illumination without any changes to the driving light fields. The technique is amenable to situations where addressing individual ions with focused laser beams is challenging, such as tightly packed linear ion strings or two-dimensional ion arrays illuminated from the side.</description>

      <title>Boundaries of universality of thermal collisions for atom-atom scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal rate coefficients for some atomic collisions have been observed to be remarkably independent of the details of interatomic interactions at short range. This makes these rate coefficients universal functions of the long-range interaction parameters and masses, which was previously exploited to develop a self-defining atomic sensor for ambient pressure. Here, we employ rigorous quantum scattering calculations to examine the response of thermally averaged rate coefficients for atom-atom collisions to changes in the interaction potentials. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the universality, and the boundaries thereof, by treating the quantum scattering observables as probabilistic predictions determined by a distribution of interaction potentials. We show that there is a characteristic change of the resulting distributions of rate coefficients, separating light, few-electron atoms and heavy, polarizable atoms. We produce diagrams that illustrate the boundaries of the thermal collision universality at different temperatures and provide guidance for future experiments seeking to exploit the universality.</description>

      <title>Cold source of atomic hydrogen for loading large magnetic traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a design and performance tests of an intense source of cold hydrogen atoms for loading large magnetic traps. Our source is based on a cryogenic dissociator of molecular hydrogen at 0.6 K followed by a series of thermal accommodators at 0.5, 0.2 and 0.13 K with inner surfaces covered by a superfluid helium film. All components are thermally anchored to corresponding stages of a dilution refrigerator. The source provides a continuous flux of 7$\cdot$$10^{13}$ H atoms/s in a temperature range of 130-200 mK. We have successfully used the source for loading a large Ioffe-Pritchard magnetic trap recently built in our laboratory [arXiv:2108.09123 or Rev. Sci. Instr. 93 (2), 023201 (2022)]. Calorimetric measurements of the atomic recombination heat allow reliable determination of the atomic flux and H gas density in the trap. We have tested the performance of the source and loading of H atoms into the trap at various configurations of the trapping field, reducing the magnetic barrier height to 75% and 50% of the nominal value of 0.8 T (0.54 K) as well as at the open configuration of the trap at its lower end, when the atoms are in contact with the trapping cell walls covered by a superfluid helium film. In the latter case, raising the trapping cell temperature to 200-250 mK, the low-field seeking atoms at densities exceeding 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ can be stored for the time over 1000 s, sufficiently long for experiments on precision spectroscopy of cold H gas.</description>
