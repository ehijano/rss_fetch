      <title>Integral Motivic Cohomology of $BSO_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivic cohomology is powerful tool in algebraic geometry with associated realization maps giving important information about the relations between cohomological invariants of schemes and their classifying spaces. The problem of computing general cohomological invariants of these classifying spaces is ongoing. Most relevant to this paper is (1) Totaro's construction of the Chow ring of a classifying space in general and his use of this to study symmetric groups in arXiv:math/9802097, (2) Guillot's similar examination for the Lie groups $G_{2}$ and $Spin(7)$ in arXiv:math/0508122, (3) Field's computation of the Chow ring of $BSO(2n,\mathbb{C})$ in arXiv:math/0411424, and (4) Yagita's work on the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-motivic cohomology of $BSO_{4}$ and $BG_{2}$ in [Yag10].
  The work presented in this paper covers the computation of the motivic cohomology of $BSO_{4}$ with integral coefficients. The primary approach draws on methods laid out by Guillot and Yagita (arXiv:math/0508122, [Yag10]). These results lay the groundwork for future work, most immediately the analogous computation for $BG_{2}$ ([Por21]).</description>

      <title>Morphisms in Derived Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a characterization of morphisms in derived algebraic geometry in the more general context of morphisms in spectral algebraic geometry. Using this characterization, we prove two versions of Tannaka duality and the formal GAGA principle in the setting of derived algebraic geometry. We also show that quasi-compact and quasi-separated derived algebraic spaces satisfy $v$-descent.</description>

      <title>On the rationality of some real threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rationality of some geometrically rational three-dimensional conic and quadric surface bundles, defined over the reals and more general real closed fields, for which the real locus is connected and the intermediate Jacobian obstructions to rationality vanish. We obtain both negative and positive results, using unramified cohomology and birational rigidity techniques, as well as concrete rationality constructions.</description>

      <title>From Differential Values to Roots of the Bernstein-Sato Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a cusp in $(\mathbb C^2,\mathbf 0)$ with Puiseux pair $(n,m)$. This paper is devoted to show how the semimodule of differential values of $C$ determines a subset of the roots of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial of $C$. We add more precise results when the multiplicity of the cusp is $n\leq 4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a combinatorial description of seminormal toric varieties. The corresponding combinatorial object is a fan equipped with a collection of groups assigned to each cone. This framework introduces a more general class of toric varieties than classical normal toric varieties, while having simpler combinatorial data compared to general non-normal toric varieties.</description>

      <title>On the image of a curve in a normal surface by a plane projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a finite analytic morphism $\varphi =(f,g)$ defined from a complex analytic normal surface $(Z,z)$ to ${\mathbb C}^2$. We describe the topology of the image by $\varphi$ of a reduced curve on $(Z,z)$ by means of iterated pencils defined recursively for each branch of the curve from the initial one $\langle f,g \rangle$. This result generalizes the one obtained in a previous paper for the case in which $(Z,z)$ is smooth and the curve irreducible. As a consequence of the methods we can describe also the topological type of the discriminant curve of $\varphi$, in particular the topological type of each branch of the discriminant can be obtained from the map without the previous knowledge of the critical locus.</description>

      <title>A Frobenius splitting and cohomology vanishing for the cotangent bundles of the flag varieties of GL_n</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p&gt;0, let G=GL_n be the general linear group over k, let P be a parabolic subgroup of G, and let u_P be the Lie algebra of its unipotent radical. We show that the Kumar-Lauritzen-Thomsen splitting of the cotangent bundle Gx^Pu_P of G/P has top degree (p-1)\dim(G/P). The component of that degree is therefore given by the (p-1)-th power of a function f. We give a formula for f and deduce that it vanishes on the exceptional locus of the resolution Gx^Pu_P--&gt;\ov{\mc O} where \ov{\mc O} is the closure of the Richardson orbit of P. As a consequence we obtain that the higher cohomology groups of a line bundle on Gx^Pu_P associated to a dominant weight are zero. The splitting of Gx^Pu_P given by f^{p-1} can be seen as a generalisation of the Mehta-Van der Kallen splitting of Gx^Bu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a universal property of the construction of the ring of $p$-typical Witt vectors of a commutative ring, endowed with Witt vectors Frobenius and Verschiebung, and generalize this construction to the derived setting. We define an $\infty$-category of $p$-typical derived $\delta$-Cartier rings and show that the derived ring of $p$-typical Witt vectors of a derived ring is naturally an object in this $\infty$-category. Moreover, we show that for any prime $p$, the formation of the derived ring of $p$-typical Witt vectors gives an equivalence between the $\infty$-category of all derived rings and the full subcategory of all derived $p$-typical $\delta$-Cartier rings consisting of $V$-complete objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These are notes of my lecture courses given in the summer of 2024 in the School on Number Theory and Physics at ICTP in Trieste and in the 27th Brazilian Algebra Meeting at IME-USP in S\~ao Paulo. We give an elementary account of $p$-adic methods in de Rham cohomology of algebraic hypersurfaces with explicit examples and applications in number theory and combinatorics. These lectures are based on the series of our joint papers with Frits Beukers entitled \emph{Dwork crystals} (\cite{DCI,DCII,DCIII}). These methods also have applications in mathematical physics and arithmetic geometry (\cite{IN,Cartier0}), which we overview here towards the end. I am grateful to the organisers of both schools and to the participants of my courses whose questions stimulated writing these notes.</description>

      <title>Monodromy kernel for a stratum component of translation surfaces in genus 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present note, we complete the correspondence between stratum components of translation surfaces in low genus and finite-type Artin groups with defining Dynkin diagram containing $E_6$. In an earlier work, we showed that in genus $3$ the monodromy of the non-hyperelliptic connected components $\mathcal{H}^{\operatorname{odd}}(4)$ and $\mathcal{H}(3,1)$ are highly non-injective, as the respective kernels contain a non-abelian free group of rank $2$. The result holds since both the stratum components are orbifold classifying spaces for central extensions of the inner automorphism groups of the finite-type Artin groups $A_{E_6}$ and $A_{E_7}$, respectively. The following is a note extending the same result to the stratum $\mathcal{H}^{\operatorname{even}}(6)$ in genus $4$, which is an orbifold classifying space for a central extension of the group $\operatorname{Inn}(A_{E_8})$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Tools for Computing Polynomial Loop Invariants (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loop invariants are properties of a program loop that hold both before and after each iteration of the loop. They are often used to verify programs and ensure that algorithms consistently produce correct results during execution. Consequently, generating invariants becomes a crucial task for loops. We specifically focus on polynomial loops, where both the loop conditions and the assignments within the loop are expressed as polynomials. Although computing polynomial invariants for general loops is undecidable, efficient algorithms have been developed for certain classes of loops. For instance, when all assignments within a while loop involve linear polynomials, the loop becomes solvable. In this work, we study the more general case, where the polynomials can have arbitrary degrees.
  Using tools from algebraic geometry, we present two algorithms designed to generate all polynomial invariants within a given vector subspace, for a branching loop with nondeterministic conditional statements. These algorithms combine linear algebra subroutines with computations on polynomial ideals. They differ depending on whether the initial values of the loop variables are specified or treated as parameters. Additionally, we present a much more efficient algorithm for generating polynomial invariants of a specific form, applicable to all initial values. This algorithm avoids expensive ideal computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pl\"ucker positive region $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k,2k)$ of the orthogonal Grassmannian emerged as the positive geometry behind the ABJM scattering amplitudes. In this paper we initiate the study of the positive orthogonal Grassmannian $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k,n)$ for general values of $k$ and $n$. We determine the boundary structure of the quadric $\mathrm{OGr}_+(1,n)$ in $\mathbb{P}_+^{n-1}$ and show that it is a positive geometry. We show that $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k,2k+1)$ is isomorphic to $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k+1,2k+2)$ and connect its combinatorial structure to matchings on $[2k+2]$. Finally, we show that in the case $n &gt; 2k+1$, the positroid cells of $\mathrm{Gr}_+(k,n)$ do not induce a CW cell decomposition of $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k,n)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the inflectionary behavior of linear series on superelliptic curves $X$ over fields of arbitrary characteristic. Here we give a precise description of the inflection of linear series over the ramification locus of the superelliptic projection; and we initiate a study of those inflectionary varieties that parameterize the inflection points of linear series on $X$ supported away from the superelliptic ramification locus that is predicated on the behavior of their Newton polytopes.</description>

Abstract: We study the geometry of singular $\text{SL}_n$-Hitchin fibres over the elliptic locus. We show that orbifold singularities appear in the $\text{PGL}_n$-moduli space $M^{ell}(\text{PGL}_n)$ exactly when the $\text{SL}_n$ side $M^{ell}(\text{SL}_n)$ has a reducible Hitchin fibre. Our main theorem shows that the Fourier-Mukai transform of a skyscraper sheaf supported at an orbifold singularity in $M^{ell}(\text{PGL}_n)$ satisfies a version of the fractional Hecke eigenproperty, as conjectured by Frenkel and Witten.</description>

      <title>Tau Functions from Joyce Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07061v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argued in [Proc. Sympos. Pure Math., Vol. 103, American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2021, 1-66, arXiv:1912.06504] that, when a certain sub-exponential growth property holds, the Donaldson-Thomas invariants of a 3-Calabi-Yau triangulated category should give rise to a geometric structure on its space of stability conditions called a Joyce structure. In this paper, we show how to use a Joyce structure to define a generating function which we call the $\tau$-function. When applied to the derived category of the resolved conifold, this reproduces the non-perturbative topological string partition function of [J. Differential Geom. 115 (2020), 395-435, arXiv:1703.02776]. In the case of the derived category of the Ginzburg algebra of the A$_2$ quiver, we obtain the Painlev\'e I $\tau$-function.</description>

      <title>Links represented by phases of algebraic curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prime motivation behind this paper is to prove that any torus link can be realized as the union of the one-dimensional connected components of the set of critical values of the argument map restricted to a complex algebraic plane curve. Moreover, we give an explicit relation between the Newton polygon of such plane curves, and the number of components of the given torus link. This work aims to represent the starting point for a connection between knot theory, tropical geometry, and (co)amoebas.</description>

      <title>Heights and periods of algebraic cycles in families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Beilinson-Bloch heights and Abel-Jacobian periods of homologically trivial Chow cycles in families. For the Beilinson-Bloch heights, we show that for any $g\ge 3$, we can construct a Zariski open dense subset $\mathcal{M}_g^{\mathrm{amp}}$ of $\mathcal{M}_g$, the coarse moduli of curves of genus $g$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, such that the heights of Ceresa cycles and Gross-Schoen cycles over $\mathcal{M}_g^{\mathrm{amp}}$ have a lower bound and satisfy the Northcott property. For the Abel-Jacobi periods, we prove that the Ceresa and Gross-Schoen cycle over every non-$\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$ point in $\mathcal{M}_g^{\mathrm{amp}}$ is non-torsion.
  We also prove results and make conjectures for any family $X \rightarrow S$ of smooth projective varieties and homologically trivial cocycles $Z$ defined over a number field. Using the Betti strata, we construct a Zariski open subset $S^{\mathrm{amp}}$ of $S_{\mathbb{C}}$ over which $Z_s$ is non-torsion for all transcendental points $s$ and prove a criterion for $S^{\mathrm{amp}}$ to be dense. We conjecture the rationality of $S^{\mathrm{amp}}$ and also conjecture that $S^{\mathrm{amp}}$ is precisely the open locus on which the Beilinson-Bloch height of $Z_s$ has a lower bound and satisfies the Northcott property.</description>

      <title>Weight 11 Compactly Supported Cohomology of Moduli Spaces of Curves in excess four</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their homonymous article, Sam Payne and Thomas Willwacher construct a combinatorial graph complex to compute the weight 11 part of the compactly supported cohomology of the moduli space of curves $\cM_{g,n}$ and compute explicitly the cohomology of the introduced graph complexes in cases of complexes of excess zero, one, two, and three. In this paper, we extend the computation the cohomology to excess four graph complexes. Along the way, we give more details on generators, the computation process, and the definition of the graph complex.</description>

      <title>$p$-adic Local Langlands Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss symmetrical monoidal $\infty$-categoricalizations in relavant $p$-adic functional analysis and $p$-adic analytic geometry. Our motivation has three sources relevant in $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence: one is the corresponding foundation from Bambozzi-Ben-Bassat-Kremnizer on derived functional analysis and Clausen-Scholze on derived topologicalization, and the second one is representations of derived $E_1$-rings which is relevant in integral deformed version of the $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence with eventually Banach coefficients, and the third one is the corresponding comparison of the solid quasicoherent sheaves over two kinds of generalized prismatization stackifications over small arc stacks and small $v$-stacks: one from the de Rham Robba stackification, and the other one from the de Rham prismatization stackification. Small arc stacks imperfectize the prismatization stackification, which will then perfectize the prismatization stackification when we regard them as small $v$-stacks. After Scholze's philosophy, one can in fact imperfectize those significant $v$-stacks in Fargues-Scholze to still have the geometrization at least by using Berkovich motives. Both small arc-stacks and small $v$-stacks can be studied using local totally disconnectedness which is the key observation for condensed mathematics, theory of diamonds and perfectoid rings.</description>

      <title>Theory of Heat Equations for Sigma Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:1711.08395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the heat equations satisfied by the sigma function associated with a planar curve, extending and developing earlier pioneering work of Buchstaber and Leykin. These heat equations lead to useful {\em linear} recursive relations for the coefficients of power series expansion of the sigma function. In particular we exhibit explicit results for curves of genus 3, and give a new constructive proof of an explicit expression for the main matrix in the theory for {\em any} hyperelliptic curve. We also state and prove a new explicit formula for the eigenvalues of the linear operators associated with this matrix, as well as other practical formulae.</description>

      <title>On categorical local langlands program for $GL_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16505v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study various moduli spaces of local Shtukas in the setting of Fargues' program for $GL_n$. In certain cases, this gives us an explicit description of the spectral action which was recently introduced by Fargues and Scholze. This description sheds light to the categorical local Langlands program for $GL_n$ and allows us to construct Hecke eigensheaves associated to certain $\ell$-adic Weil representations of rank $n$ and to prove some parts of Fargues' conjecture. Moreover, by using this description, we can prove new cases of the Harris-Viehmann conjecture for non-basic Rapoport-Zink spaces and compute some parts of the cohomology of the Igusa varieties associated to $GL_n$.</description>

      <title>Outer Lipschitz Classification of Normal Pairs of H\"older Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A normal pair of H\"older triangles is the union of two normally embedded H\"older triangles satisfying some natural conditions on the tangency orders of their boundary arcs. It is a special case of a surface germ, a germ at the origin of a two-dimensional closed semialgebraic (or, more general, definable in a polynomially bounded o-minimal structure) subset of $R^n$. Classification of normal pairs considered in this paper is a step towards outer Lipschitz classification of definable surface germs. In the paper \cite{BG} we introduced a combinatorial invariant of the outer Lipschitz equivalence class of normal pairs, called $\sigma\tau$-pizza, and conjectured that it is complete: two normal pairs of H\"older triangles with the same $\sigma\tau$-pizzas are outer Lipschitz equivalent. In this paper we prove that conjecture and define realizability conditions for the $\sigma\tau$-pizza invariant. Moreover, only one of the two pizzas in the $\sigma\tau$-pizza invariant, together with some admissible permutations related to $\sigma$ and $\tau$, is sufficient for the existence and uniqueness, up to outer Lipschitz equivalence, of a normal pair of H\"older triangles.</description>

      <title>Finiteness and cofiniteness of fine Selmer groups over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the dual fine Selmer group of an abelian variety over the unramified $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-extension of a function field is finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. This is a function field version of a conjecture of Coates--Sujatha. We further prove that the fine Selmer group is finite (respectively zero) if the separable $p$-primary torsion of the abelian variety is finite (respectively zero). These results are then generalized to certain ramified $p$-adic Lie extensions.</description>
