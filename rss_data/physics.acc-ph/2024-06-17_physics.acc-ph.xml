      <title>Experimental Observation of Space-Charge Field Screening of a Relativistic Particle Bunch in Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-charge field of a relativistic charged bunch propagating in plasma is screened due to the presence of mobile charge carriers. We experimentally investigate such screening by measuring the effect of dielectric wakefields driven by the bunch in a uncoated dielectric capillary where the plasma is confined. We show that the plasma screens the space-charge field and therefore suppresses the dielectric wakefields when the distance between the bunch and the dielectric surface is much larger than the plasma skin depth. Before full screening is reached, the effects of dielectric and plasma wakefields are present simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Helicoidal Transformation Method for Finite Element Models of Twisted Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the modelling of superconducting and resistive wires with a helicoidal symmetry, subjected to an external field and a transport current. Helicoidal structures are three-dimensional, and therefore yield computationally intensive simulations in a Cartesian coordinate system. We show in this paper that by working instead with a helicoidal system of coordinates, the problem to solve can be made two-dimensional, drastically reducing the computational cost. We first introduce the state-of-the-art approach and apply it on the h-phi-formulation with helicoidally symmetric boundary conditions (e.g., axial external magnetic field, with or without transport current), with an emphasis on the function space discretization. Then, we extend the approach to general boundary conditions (e.g., transverse external magnetic field) and present numerical results with linear materials. In particular, we discuss the frequency-dependent losses in composite wires made of superconducting filaments embedded in a resistive matrix. Finally, we provide outlook to the application of the generalized model with nonlinear materials.</description>

      <title>The Method of Formal Series: Applications to Nonlinear Beam Dynamics and Invariants of Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel technique to determine invariant curves in nonlinear beam dynamics based on the method of formal series has been developed. It is first shown how the solution of the Hamilton equations of motion describing nonlinear betatron oscillations in the presence of a single sextupole can be represented in a nonperturbative form. Further, the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is obtained in a closed symbolic form as a ratio of two series in the perturbation parameter (and the nonlinear action invariant), rather than a conventional power series according to canonical perturbation theory. It is well behaved even for large values of the perturbation parameter close to strong structural resonances. The relationship between existing invariant curves and the so-called scattering orbits in classical scattering theory has been revealed.</description>

      <title>Radiation reaction in weakly magnetized black holes: can the tail term be ignored in the strong field regime?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study radiation from charged particles in circular motion around a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field. In curved space, the radiation reaction force is described by the DeWitt-Brehme equation, which includes a complicated, non-local tail term. We show that, contrary to some claims in the literature, this term cannot, in general, be neglected. We account for self-force effects directly by calculating the electromagnetic energy flux at infinity and on the horizon. The radiative field is obtained using black hole perturbation theory. We solve the relevant equations analytically, in the low-frequency and slow-motion approximation, as well as numerically in the general case. Our results show that great care must be taken when neglecting the tail term, which is often fundamental to capture the dynamics of the particle: in fact, it only seems to be negligible when the magnetic force greatly dominates the gravitational force, so that the motion is well described by the Abraham--Lorentz--Dirac equation. We also report a curious "horizon dominance effect" that occurs for a radiating particle in a circular orbit around a black hole (emitting either scalar, electromagnetic or gravitational waves): for fixed orbital radius, the fraction of energy that is absorbed by the black hole can be made arbitrarily large by decreasing the particle velocity.</description>
