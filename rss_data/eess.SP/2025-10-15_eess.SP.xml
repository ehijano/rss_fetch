      <title>A Closed-form Expression of the Gaussian Noise Model Supporting O-Band Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel closed-form model for nonlinear interference (NLI) estimation in low-dispersion O-band transmission systems. The formulation incorporates the four-wave mixing (FWM) efficiency term as well as the coherent contributions of self- and cross-phase modulation (SPM/XPM) across multiple identical spans. This extension enables accurate evaluation of the NLI in scenarios where conventional closed-form Gaussian Noise (GN) models are limited. The proposed model is validated against split-step Fourier method (SSFM) simulations and numerical integration across 41-161 channels, with a 96 GBaud symbol rate, bandwidths of up to 16.1 THz, and transmission distances from 80 to 800 km. Results show a mean absolute error of the NLI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) below 0.22 dB. The proposed closed-form model offers an efficient and accurate tool for system optimisation in O-band coherent transmission.</description>

      <title>Based on Deep Neural Networks: A Machine Learning-Assisted Channel Estimation Method for MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-assisted channel estimation approach for massive MIMO systems, leveraging DNNs to outperform traditional LS and MMSE methods. In 5G and beyond, accurate channel estimation mitigates pilot contamination and high mobility issues that harm system reliability. The proposed DNN architecture includes multi-layer perceptrons with ReLU activation, 3 hidden layers (256, 128, 64 neurons respectively), uses Adam optimizer (learning rate 1e-4) and MSE loss function. It learns from pilot signals to predict channel matrices, achieving lower NMSE and BER across different SNR levels. Simulations use the COST 2100 public standard dataset (a well-recognized MIMO channel dataset for 5G, not synthetic datasets) with 10,000 samples of 4x4 MIMO channels under urban macro scenarios. Results show the DNN outperforms LS and MMSE by 3-5 dB in NMSE at medium SNR, with robust performance in high-mobility scenarios. The study evaluates metrics like NMSE vs. SNR, BER vs. SNR, and sensitivity to pilot length, antenna configurations, and computational complexity. The DNN has 2.3 GFlOPs computational complexity, 15.6k parameters, and 1.8 ms inference time on Raspberry Pi 4, verifying deployment feasibility. This work advances ML integration in wireless communications, facilitating efficient resource allocation and improved spectral efficiency in next-generation networks. Future work may use more real-world datasets and hybrid architectures for better generalization.</description>

      <title>Using STAR-IRS to Secure Indoor Communications Through Symbol-Level Random Phase Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a secure indoor communication scheme based on simultaneous transmitting and reflecting intelligent reflecting surface (STAR-IRS). Specifically, a transmitter (Alice) sends confidential information to its intended user (Bob) indoors, while several eavesdroppers (Eves) lurk outside. To safeguard the transmission from eavesdropping, the STAR-IRS is deployed on walls or windows. Upon impinging on the STAR-IRS, the incoming electromagnetic wave is dynamically partitioned into two components, enabling both transmission through and reflection from the surface. The reflected signal is controlled to enhance reception at Bob, while the transmitted signal is modulated with symbol-level random phase shifts to degrade the signal quality at Eves. Based on such a setting, the secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated. To solve it, a graph neural network (GNN)-based scheme is developed. Furthermore, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based GNN accelerator is designed to reduce computational latency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms both the conventional scheme and the reflection-only scheme in terms of secrecy performance. Moreover, the GNN-based approach achieves superior results compared to benchmark techniques such as maximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero forcing (ZF), and minimum mean square error (MMSE) in solving the optimization problem. Finally, experimental evaluations confirm that the FPGA-based accelerator enables low inference latency.</description>

      <title>62.6 GHz ScAlN Solidly Mounted Acoustic Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a record-high 62.6 GHz solidly mounted acoustic resonator (SMR) incorporating a 67.6 nm scandium aluminum nitride (Sc0.3Al0.7N) piezoelectric layer on a 40 nm buried platinum (Pt) bottom electrode, positioned above an acoustic Bragg reflector composed of alternating SiO2 (28.2 nm) and Ta2O5 (24.3 nm) layers in 8.5 pairs. The Bragg reflector and piezoelectric stack above are designed to confine a third-order thickness-extensional (TE) bulk acoustic wave (BAW) mode, while efficiently transducing with thickness-field excitation. The fabricated SMR exhibits an extracted piezoelectric coupling coefficient (k2) of 0.8% and a maximum Bode quality factor (Q) of 51 at 63 GHz, representing the highest operating frequency reported for an SMR to date. These results establish a pathway toward mmWave SMR devices for filters and resonators in next-generation RF front ends.</description>

      <title>A Deep Multi-Task Learning Approach to Impulsive Noise Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impulsive noise poses a significant challenge to the reliability of wireless communication systems, necessitating accurate estimation of its statistical parameters for effective mitigation. This paper introduces a multitask learning (MTL) framework based on a CNN-LSTM architecture enhanced with an attention mechanism for the joint estimation of impulsive noise parameters. The proposed model leverages a unified weighted-loss function to enable simultaneous learning of multiple parameters within a shared representation space, improving learning efficiency and generalization across related tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed MTL framework achieves stable convergence, faster training, and enhanced scalability with modest computational overhead. Benchmarking against conventional single-task learning (STL) models confirms its favorable complexity-performance trade-off and significant memory savings, indicating the effectiveness of the MTL approach for real-time impulsive noise parameter estimation in wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Constellation Shaping for OFDM ISAC Signals Under Temporal-Frequency Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is considered an innovative technology in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, where utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication signals for sensing provides a cost-effective solution for implementing ISAC. However, the sensing performance of matched and mismatched filtering schemes can be significantly deteriorated due to the signaling randomness induced by finite-alphabet modulations with nonconstant modulus, such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations. Therefore, improving sensing performance without significantly compromising communication capability (i.e., maintaining randomness), remains a challenging task. To that end, we propose a unified probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) framework that is compatible with both matched and mismatched filtering schemes, by maximizing the communication rate while imposing constraints on mean square error (MSE) of sensing channel state information (CSI), power, and probability distribution. Specifically, the MSE of sensing CSI is leveraged to optimize sensing capability, which is illustrated to be a more comprehensive metric compared to the output SNR after filtering (SNRout) and integrated sidelobes ratio (ISLR). Additionally, the internal relationships among these three sensing metrics are explicitly analyzed. Finally, both simulations and field measurements validate the efficiency of proposed PCS approach in achieving a flexible S&amp;C trade-off, as well as its credibility in enhancing 6G wireless transmission in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Wireless Channel Modeling for Machine Learning -- A Critical View on Standardized Channel Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standardized (link-level) channel models such as the 3GPP TDL and CDL models are frequently used to evaluate machine learning (ML)-based physical-layer methods. However, in this work, we argue that a link-level perspective incorporates limiting assumptions, causing unwanted distributional shifts or necessitating impractical online training. An additional drawback is that this perspective leads to (near-)Gaussian channel characteristics. Thus, ML-based models, trained on link-level channel data, do not outperform classical approaches for a variety of physical-layer applications. Particularly, we demonstrate the optimality of simple linear methods for channel compression, estimation, and modeling, revealing the unsuitability of link-level channel models for evaluating ML models. On the upside, adopting a scenario-level perspective offers a solution to this problem and unlocks the relative gains enabled by ML.</description>

      <title>A New Method of Constructing Hadamard Matrices, Circulant Hadamard Matrices, CZCS, GCS, CCC, and CZCSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Hadamard matrix $H$ is a square matrix of order $n$ with entries $\pm 1$, such that $HH^\top=nI_{n}$, where $I_n$ is an identity matrix of order $n$. A circulant Hadamard matrix $H$ is a Hadamard matrix that has rows of entries in cyclic order. There exist only $8$ circulant Hadamard matrices of order 4, and here, we provide a novel construction of all such $8$ circulant Hadamard matrices using a linear operator and generalized Boolean function (GBF). The constructed circulant Hadamard matrices are used recursively to construct a binary cross Z-complementary set (CZCS) of all lengths with an even phase, a binary Golay complementary set (GCS) of all lengths, and Hadamard matrices of order $2^{n+2}$, where $n\geq1$. The construction of a binary CZCS covering all lengths was not available before. We also propose an alternative, lower-complexity construction of binary GCSs of all lengths and Hadamard matrices of order $2^{a+1}10^b26^c$ using circulant matrices, where $ a,b,c \geq 0$. The proposed binary GCS covers all lengths with a flexible flock size. The constructions of GCS are further extended to form binary complete complementary code (CCC) of the parameter $(2N,2N,2N)-CCC$ where $N=2^a10^b26^c, a,b,c \geq 0$. The constructed binary CCC provides a flexible flock size. The construction of CZCS is further extended to form a binary optimal cross-Z complementary sequence set (CZCSS) of the parameter $(2^{n+2}, 2^{n+2}, 2^{n+2}, 2^{n+1})-CZCSS$, where $n\geq1$. Finally, we provide a relation between Hadamard matrices and GCS, which enables the study of the Hadamard conjecture in a new direction. We also provided a few properties of circulant matrices over aperiodic cross-correlation (ACCF) and aperiodic auto-correlation (AACF), which are used to prove the theorems. All proposed constructions are novel, and their parameters are compared with the existing state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Beyond-Diagonal RIS Architecture Design and Optimization under Physics-Consistent Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology for future wireless communication systems. Conventional RIS is constrained to a diagonal scattering matrix, which limits its flexibility. Recently, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has been proposed as a more general RIS architecture class that allows inter-element connections and shows great potential for performance improvement. Despite extensive progress on BD-RIS, most existing studies rely on simplified channel models that ignore practical electromagnetic (EM) effects such as mutual coupling and impedance mismatching. To address this gap, this paper investigates the architecture design and optimization of BD-RIS under the general physics-consistent model derived with multiport network theory in recent literature. Building on a compact reformulation of this model, we show that band-connected RIS achieves the same channel-shaping capability as fully-connected RIS, which extends existing results obtained for conventional channel models. We then develop optimization methods under the general physics-consistent model; specifically, we derive closed-form solutions for single-input single-output (SISO) systems, propose a globally optimal semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm for single-stream multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, and design an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm for multiuser MIMO systems. Using the proposed algorithms, we conduct comprehensive simulations to evaluate the impact of various EM effects and approximations, including mutual coupling among RIS antennas and the commonly adopted unilateral approximation, on system performance.</description>

      <title>HEAR: An EEG Foundation Model with Heterogeneous Electrode Adaptive Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential technique for neuroscience research and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Recently, large-scale EEG foundation models have been developed, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities across diverse tasks and subjects. However, the heterogeneity of EEG devices not only hinders the widespread adoption of these models but also poses significant challenges to their further scaling and development. In this paper, we introduce HEAR, the first EEG foundation model explicitly designed to support heterogeneous EEG devices, accommodating varying electrode layouts and electrode counts. HEAR employs a learnable, coordinate-based spatial embedding to map electrodes with diverse layouts and varying counts into a unified representational space. This unified spatial representation is then processed by a novel spatially-guided transformer, which effectively captures spatiotemporal dependencies across electrodes. To support the development of HEAR, we construct a large-scale EEG dataset comprising 8,782 hours of data collected from over 150 distinct electrode layouts with up to 1,132 electrodes. Experimental results demonstrate that HEAR substantially outperforms existing EEG foundation models in supporting heterogeneous EEG devices and generalizing across diverse cognitive tasks and subjects.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Adaptive Waveform Processing in Next Generation Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of alternative multiplexing domains to the time-frequency domains, e.g., the delay-Doppler and chirp domains, offers a promising approach for addressing the challenges posed by complex propagation environments and next-generation applications. Unlike the time and frequency domains, these domains offer unique channel representations which provide additional degrees of freedom (DoF) for modeling, characterizing, and exploiting wireless channel features. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of channel characteristics, including delay, Doppler shifts, and channel coefficients across various domains, with an emphasis on their inter-domain relationships, shared characteristics, and domain-specific distinctions. We further evaluate the comparative advantages of each domain under specific channel conditions. Building on this analysis, we propose a generalized and adaptive transform domain framework that leverages the pre- and post-processing of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix, to enable dynamic transitions between various domains in response to the channel conditions and system requirements. Finally, several representative use cases are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed cross-domain waveform processing framework in diverse scenarios, along with future directions and challenges.</description>

      <title>Moment-based Posterior Sampling for Multi-reference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Bayesian approach to the problem of multi-reference alignment -- the recovery of signals from noisy, randomly shifted observations. While existing frequentist methods accurately recover the signal at arbitrarily low signal-to-noise ratios, they require a large number of samples to do so. In contrast, our proposed method leverages diffusion models as data-driven plug-and-play priors, conditioning these on the sample power spectrum (a shift-invariant statistic) enabling both accurate posterior sampling and uncertainty quantification. The use of an appropriate prior significantly reduces the required number of samples, as illustrated in simulation experiments with comparisons to state-of-the-art methods such as expectation--maximization and bispectrum inversion. These findings establish our approach as a promising framework for other orbit recovery problems, such as cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM).</description>

      <title>Enhanced Angle-Range Cluster Parameter Estimation in Full-Duplex ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework for targets that are spread both in the angle and range domains. We model each target using a cluster of rays parameterized by a specific density function, and propose a truncated Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) spread (TMS) algorithm to accurately estimate the parameters of the density function. Unlike the conventional MUSIC spread (CMS), TMS restricts the signal subspace rank based on the eigen decomposition of the received-signal autocorrelation. We also propose a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based algorithm for estimating the distance and range spread of each target. Leveraging these estimates, we then develop a dynamic transmit beamforming algorithm that successfully illuminates multiple targets while also serving multiple downlink (DL) users. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms over baseline schemes in both low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes as well as under a wide angular spread regime.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Neurodegeneration with Brain Age Gap Prediction Models: A Graph Signal Processing Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurodegeneration, characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal structure or function, is commonly assessed in clinical practice through reductions in cortical thickness or brain volume, as visualized by structural MRI. While informative, these conventional approaches lack the statistical sophistication required to fully capture the spatially correlated and heterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration, which manifests both in healthy aging and in neurological disorders. To address these limitations, brain age gap has emerged as a promising data-driven biomarker of brain health. The brain age gap prediction (BAGP) models estimate the difference between a person's predicted brain age from neuroimaging data and their chronological age. The resulting brain age gap serves as a compact biomarker of brain health, with recent studies demonstrating its predictive utility for disease progression and severity. However, practical adoption of BAGP models is hindered by their methodological obscurities and limited generalizability across diverse clinical populations. This tutorial article provides an overview of BAGP and introduces a principled framework for this application based on recent advancements in graph signal processing (GSP). In particular, we focus on graph neural networks (GNNs) and introduce the coVariance neural network (VNN), which leverages the anatomical covariance matrices derived from structural MRI. VNNs offer strong theoretical grounding and operational interpretability, enabling robust estimation of brain age gap predictions.

      <title>Ultrafast Grid Impedance Identification in $dq$-Asymmetric Three-Phase Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a non-parametric frequency-domain method to identify small-signal $dq$-asymmetric grid impedances, over a wide frequency band, using grid-connected converters. Existing identification methods are faced with significant trade-offs: e.g., passive approaches rely on ambient harmonics and rare grid events and thus can only provide estimates at a few frequencies, while many active approaches that intentionally perturb grid operation require long time series measurement and specialized equipment. Although active time-domain methods reduce the measurement time, they either make crude simplifying assumptions or require laborious model order tuning. Our approach effectively addresses these challenges: it does not require specialized excitation signals or hardware and achieves ultrafast ($&lt;1$ s) identification, drastically reducing measurement time. Being non-parametric, our approach also makes no assumptions on the grid structure. A detailed electromagnetic transient simulation is used to validate the method and demonstrate its clear superiority over existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Optimising Communication Control Factors for Energy Consumption in Rural LOS V2X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connected braking can reduce fatal collisions in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) by using reliable, low-latency 5G New Radio (NR) links, especially NR Sidelink Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X). In rural areas, road side units are sparse and power-constrained or off-grid, so energy efficiency must be considered alongside safety. This paper studies how three communication control factors including subcarrier spacing ($\mathrm{SCS}$), modulation and coding scheme ($\mathrm{MCS}$), and transmit power ($P_{\mathrm{t}}$) should be configured to balance safety and energy consumption in rural line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios in light and heavy traffic scenarios. Safety is quantified by the packet receive ratio ($\mathrm{PRR}$) against the minimum communication distance $D_{\mathrm{comm}}$, defined as the distance that the vehicle travels during the transmission of the safety message. Results show that, under heavy traffic, increasing $P_{\mathrm{t}}$ and selecting a low-rate $\mathrm{MCS}$ at $\mathrm{SCS} = 30$ kHz sustains high $\mathrm{PRR}$ at $D_{\mathrm{comm}}$, albeit with higher energy cost. In light traffic, maintaining lower $P_\mathrm{t}$ with low $\mathrm{MCS}$ levels achieves a favorable reliability-energy trade-off while preserving acceptable $\mathrm{PRR}$ at $D_{\mathrm{comm}}$. These findings demonstrate the necessity of adaptive, energy-aware strategy to guarantee both safety and energy efficiency in rural V2X systems.</description>

      <title>A High-Level Feature Model to Predict the Encoding Energy of a Hardware Video Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's society, live video streaming and user generated content streamed from battery powered devices are ubiquitous. Live streaming requires real-time video encoding, and hardware video encoders are well suited for such an encoding task. In this paper, we introduce a high-level feature model using Gaussian process regression that can predict the encoding energy of a hardware video encoder. In an evaluation setup restricted to only P-frames and a single keyframe, the model can predict the encoding energy with a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 9%. Further, we demonstrate with an ablation study that spatial resolution is a key high-level feature for encoding energy prediction of a hardware encoder. A practical application of our model is that it can be used to perform a prior estimation of the energy required to encode a video at various spatial resolutions, with different coding standards and codec presets.</description>

      <title>Optical communication-based identification for multi-UAV systems: theory and practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mutual relative localization and identification is an important feature for the stabilization and navigation of multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems. Camera-based communications technology, also referred to as Optical Camera Communications (OCC) in the literature, is a novel approach that could bring a valuable solution to such a complex task. In such system, the UAVs are equipped with LEDs that act as beacons and with cameras allowing them to locate the LEDs of other UAVs. Specific blinking sequences are assigned to the LEDs of each of the UAVs in order to uniquely identify them. This camera-based relative localization and identification system is immune to Radio Frequency (RF) electromagnetic interference and operates in Global Navigation satellite (GNSS) denied environments. In addition, since many UAVs are already equipped with cameras, the implementation of this system is inexpensive. In this article, we study in detail the capacity of this system and its limitations. Furthermore, we show how to construct blinking sequences for UAV LEDs in order to improve system performance. Finally, experimental results are presented to corroborate the analytical derivations.</description>

      <title>On Multiangle Discrete Fractional Periodic Transforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient multiangle centered discrete fractional Fourier transform (MA-CDFRFT) [1] has proven to be a useful tool for time-frequency analysis; in this paper, we generalize the MA-CDFRFT to general M-periodic transforms, which, among others, include the standard discrete Fourier, discrete sine, discrete cosine, Hadamard and discrete Hartley transform. Furthermore, we exploit the symmetries inherent to the MA-CDFRFT and our novel multiangle standard discrete fractional Fourier transform (MA-DFRFT) to halve the number of FFTs needed to compute these transforms, which paves the way for applications in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>BrainOmni: A Brain Foundation Model for Unified EEG and MEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure neural activity non-invasively by capturing electromagnetic fields generated by dendritic currents. Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni, the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type, enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training yields consistent improvements across both modalities. Code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Toward Efficient and Privacy-Aware eHealth Systems: An Integrated Sensing, Computing, and Semantic Communication Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time and contactless monitoring of vital signs, such as respiration and heartbeat, alongside reliable communication, is essential for modern healthcare systems, especially in remote and privacy-sensitive environments. Traditional wireless communication and sensing networks fall short in meeting all the stringent demands of eHealth, including accurate sensing, high data efficiency, and privacy preservation. To overcome the challenges, we propose a novel integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) framework. In the proposed system, a service robot utilises radar to detect patient positions and monitor their vital signs, while sending updates to the medical devices. Instead of transmitting raw physiological information, the robot computes and communicates semantically extracted health features to medical devices. This semantic processing improves data throughput and preserves the clinical relevance of the messages, while enhancing data privacy by avoiding the transmission of sensitive data. Leveraging the estimated patient locations, the robot employs an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter to actively track patient motion, thereby enabling robust beam steering for continuous and reliable monitoring. We then propose a joint optimisation of the beamforming matrices and the semantic extraction ratio, subject to computing capability and power budget constraints, with the objective of maximising both the semantic secrecy rate and sensing accuracy. Simulation results validate that the ISCSC framework achieves superior sensing accuracy, improved semantic transmission efficiency, and enhanced privacy preservation compared to conventional joint sensing and communication methods.</description>

      <title>Stimulus Modality Matters: Impact of Perceptual Evaluations from Different Modalities on Speech Emotion Recognition System Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10762v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems rely on speech input and emotional labels annotated by humans. However, various emotion databases collect perceptional evaluations in different ways. For instance, the IEMOCAP dataset uses video clips with sounds for annotators to provide their emotional perceptions. However, the most significant English emotion dataset, the MSP-PODCAST, only provides speech for raters to choose the emotional ratings. Nevertheless, using speech as input is the standard approach to training SER systems. Therefore, the open question is the emotional labels elicited by which scenarios are the most effective for training SER systems. We comprehensively compare the effectiveness of SER systems trained with labels elicited by different modality stimuli and evaluate the SER systems on various testing conditions. Also, we introduce an all-inclusive label that combines all labels elicited by various modalities. We show that using labels elicited by voice-only stimuli for training yields better performance on the test set, whereas labels elicited by voice-only stimuli.</description>

      <title>Generative Resource Allocation for 6G O-RAN with Diffusion Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation in O-RAN is critical for managing the conflicting QoS requirements of 6G network slices. Conventional reinforcement learning agents often fail in this domain, as their unimodal policy structures cannot model the multi-modal nature of optimal allocation strategies. This paper introduces Diffusion Q-Learning (Diffusion-QL), a novel framework that represents the policy as a conditional diffusion model. Our approach generates resource allocation actions by iteratively reversing a noising process, with each step guided by the gradient of a learned Q-function. This method enables the policy to learn and sample from the complex distribution of near-optimal actions. Simulations demonstrate that the Diffusion-QL approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DRL baselines, offering a robust solution for the intricate resource management challenges in next-generation wireless networks.</description>
