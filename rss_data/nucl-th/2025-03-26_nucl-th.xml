      <title>Viscous Gubser flow with conserved charges to benchmark fluid simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present semi-analytical solutions for the evolution of both the temperature and chemical potentials for viscous Gubser flow with conserved charges. Such a solution can be especially useful in testing numerical codes intended to simulate relativistic fluids with large chemical potentials. The freeze-out hypersurface profiles for constant energy density are calculated, along with the corresponding normal vectors and presented as a new unit test for numerical codes. We also compare the influence of the equation of state on the semi-analytical solutions. We benchmark the newly developed Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code CCAKE that includes both shear viscosity and three conserved charges. The numerical solutions are in excellent agreement with the semi-analytical solution and also are able to accurately reproduce the hypersurface at freeze-out.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Dynamics and Energy Dissipation of Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically explore the interplay between time-dependent magnetic fields and energy density evolution in relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD), focusing on ultra-relativistic and magnetized conformal fluids. Three characteristic magnetic field evolution models (Type-1, Type-2, Type-3), parameterized to reflect temporal profiles observed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, are integrated into a (1 + 1) D Bjorken-flow framework. For both fluid types, stronger magnetic fields universally suppress energy dissipation, with suppression magnitudes ordered as Type-1 $&gt;$ Type-2 $&gt;$ Type-3, driven by distinct decay rates of magnetic energy. To bridge QCD physics with macroscopic dynamics, we further incorporate a temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility ($\chi_{m}(T)$) derived from lattice QCD, capturing the transition from diamagnetic hadronic matter ($\chi_{m} &lt; 0$) to paramagnetic quark-gluon plasma ($\chi_{m} &gt; 0$). Our simulations reveal that $\chi_{m}(T)$ introduces a feedback loop: delayed energy dissipation sustains higher temperatures, reinforcing paramagnetic behavior and altering field evolution. These results quantify the critical role of magnetic field dynamics in regulating QGP thermalization and highlight the necessity of QCD-informed susceptibilities for realistic RMHD modeling.</description>

      <title>Effects of quark core sizes of baryons in neutron star matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the quark substructure of hadrons and the equation of state of high density neutron star matter by using the Nambu$-$Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, which is an effective quark theory based on QCD. The interaction between quarks fully respects the chiral and flavor symmetries. Guided by the success of various low energy theorems, we assume that the explicit breaking of these symmetries occurs only via the current quark masses, and all other symmetry breakings are of dynamical nature. In order to take into account the effects of the finite quark core sizes of the baryons on the equation of state, we make use of an excluded volume framework which respects thermodynamic consistency. The effects generated by the swelling quark cores generally act repulsively and lead to an increase of the pressure with increasing baryon density. On the other hand, in neutron star matter they also lead to a decrease of the density window where hyperons appear, because it becomes energetically more favorable to convert the faster moving nucleons into hyperons. Our quantitative analysis shows that the net effect of the excluded volume is too small to solve the long standing "hyperon puzzle," which is posed by the large observed masses of neutron stars. Thus the puzzle persists in a relativistic effective quark theory which takes into account the short range repulsion between baryons caused by their finite and swelling quark core sizes in a phenomenological way.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Ab Initio Radius Calculations of Boron Isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a precision study of radii in Boron isotopes for multiple realistic interactions from chiral effective field theory. We obtain predictions of radii with complete uncertainty quantification from ab initio no-core shell model calculations together with machine learning extrapolation methods. An extension to radius differences further allows us to investigate a potential proton halo in $^{8}$B and, moreover, provide predictions that relate directly to the isotope shift, which can be precisely measured in experiments.</description>

      <title>Exploiting $\nu$-dependence of projected energy correlators in HICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the recently derived factorization formula for energy-energy correlators to study the analytic structure of general $\nu$-point projected energy correlators in heavy ion collisions. The $\nu$-point projected energy correlators (or, $\nu$-correlators) are an analytically continued family of the integer $N$-point projected energy correlators, which probe correlations between $N$ final-state particles. By tracking the largest separation ($\chi$) between the $N$ particles, in vacuum, their structure is closely related to the DGLAP splitting functions and exhibits a classical scaling behavior $\sim 1/\chi$ which is modified by resummation through the anomalous dimensions. We show that, in a thermal medium, the $\nu$-correlators display non-trivial angular scaling already at the leading order in perturbation theory. We find that for non-integer values, particularly $\nu&lt;1$, medium-induced jet function is enhanced compared to $\nu&gt;1$. This is particularly manifested in the ratios of $\nu$-correlators with respect to the two-point energy correlator which encode an intrinsic angular information for $\nu&lt;1$ when compared to large $\nu$ values. Moreover, for small-$\nu$ values, the $\nu$-correlators appear to saturate at $\nu=0.01$. We further confirm our leading-order numerical computations against simulated events from JEWEL for the parton level production cross-section. Finally, we qualitatively discuss the effect of BFKL resummation for various values of $\nu$.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Energy Correlators for the Odderon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the T-odd nucleon energy correlator (NEC) at small $x$ and establish its connection with the spin-dependent odderon. Probing the T-odd NEC involves measuring a single transverse spin asymmetry (SSA) for the energy pattern in the target fragmentation region in deep inelastic scattering. We find that while the inclusive energy pattern results in a vanishing SSA, a nonzero SSA emerges when restricting the measurement to charged hadrons, which are directly measured in tracking detectors. To describe this effect, we introduce the track-based NEC and evaluate its small-$x$ limit from fracture functions using the energy sum rule. The resulting SSA exhibits an opposite sign between positively and negatively charged hadrons, providing a clear experimental signature of the odderon. Furthermore, by incorporating charge weighting into the NEC, we construct a C-odd tag in the final state, eliminating potential contamination from C-even gluonic contributions. Our results demonstrate that these track-based energy-pattern observables offer a clean and sensitive probe for unveiling odderon dynamics at the future electron-ion collider.</description>

      <title>Proton Spin Decomposition via QCD Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for investigating the spin structure of hadrons based on the two-point function in quantum field theory. In a rotating frame, we derive two independent expressions of the two-point function and identify their equivalence, which allows for a complete decomposition of the total spin of a composite system into the angular momenta of its constituent particles. Applying this approach to the proton, we analyze its spin structure in the massless quark limit. Our results indicate that the quark spin contribution accounts for approximately 27$\%$ of the total proton spin at a low-energy scale, significantly deviating from the prediction of the non-relativistic quark model.</description>

      <title>Effect of $\alpha$-clusters on particle production in O$-$O and p$-$O collisions at LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, O$-$O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7 TeV and p$-$O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 9.9 TeV are studied using PYTHIA8/Angantyr model for heavy-ion collisions. The theoretically predicted $\alpha$-cluster structure of oxygen nucleus is implemented in the model to investigate the effect of initial configuration of oxygen nucleus on final state observables. The results obtained from $\alpha$-cluster structure are compared with those obtained from Woods-Saxon nuclear charge density distribution. The Angantyr model simulation showed that the radial distribution of oxygen nucleus in $\alpha$-cluster configuration is more compact in comparison to the Woods-Saxon distribution. The results on charged and identified particle pseudorapidity distribution is obtained in the two initial state configuration of the oxygen nucleus. The results demonstrated that the effect of initial geometrical configuration is more distinct in the non-central collisions in comparison to the central collisions for both O$-$O and p$-$O collisions.</description>

      <title>Experimental Signatures for Identifying Distinct Origins of Color Field Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signatures for non-abelian dynamics have long been central to QCD and QGP. Equally important are they in spin systems and laser-plasma interactions, where they emerge as effective interactions. Distinguishing experimentally gauge inequivalent sources (and hence potentials) that produce the same field tensor is one major task in this endeavour. As a step in this direction, this paper investigates how physically distinct sources which produce the same color electric field (uniform and constant) may be distinguished experimentally in a gauge-invariant manner. We first study the motion of a test particle in such fields and show that the resultant trajectories are counterintuitive. We then examine the radiation emitted - both gluonic and photonic and show that each source (independent non-abelian configuration) leaves a unique signature in the energy spectra, laying the ground for application to specific physical systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing quantum chromo dynamics (QCD) from three to arbitrarily many color degrees of freedom suggests that baryons can be described as solitons in an effective meson theory whose interaction strength decreases with the number of colors. The exact form of that theory is unknown, but at low energies chiral symmetry and its breaking are considered as the construction recipes for modeling the theory. The Skyrmion is a static, localized solution in a non-linear field theory for pions and it is the most prominent version of a soliton in a chirally symmetric meson theory. Upon quantization it reproduces the spectrum of the low-lying baryons and their static properties reasonably well. Extending that theory by vector mesons improves on the agreement between predicted and empirical data. Chiral solitons within models for the quark flavor dynamics facilitate the investigation of nucleon structure functions. Here we provide a pedagogical overview of these facets.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Can the speed of sound of quark-gluon plasma be measured from the multiplicity and mean $p_T$ of ultracentral heavy-ion collisions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mean transverse momentum $\langle p_T \rangle$ of hadrons has been observed experimentally and in numerical simulations to have a power-law dependence on the hadronic multiplicity $N$ in ultracentral relativistic heavy-ion collisions: $\langle p_{T} \rangle \propto N^{b_{\rm UC}}$. It has been put forward that this exponent $b_{\rm UC}$ is the speed of sound of quark-gluon plasma measured at a temperature determined from $\langle p_T \rangle$. We study step by step the connection between (i) the energy and entropy of hydrodynamic simulations and (ii) experimentally measurable observables. We show that an argument based on energy and entropy should yield an exponent equal to the pressure over energy density $P/\varepsilon$, rather than the speed of sound $c_s^2$. We discuss the importance of the ``effective volume'' needed for the thermodynamics arguments. Our results indicate that the agreement of $b_{\rm UC}$ with $c_s^2$ rather than $P/\varepsilon$ is accidental.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take the first step towards incorporating compound nuclear observables at astrophysically relevant energies into the experimental evidence used to constrain optical models, by propagating the uncertainty in two global optical potentials, one phenomenological and one microscopic, to correlated fission observables using the Monte Carlo Hauser-Feshbach formalism. We compare to a wide range of historic and recent experimental fission measurements, and discuss in detail regions of disagreement. We find that the parametric optical model uncertainty in neutron-fragment correlated observables involving neutron energy is significant. On the other hand, we observe that other experimental features, particularly neutron-fragment correlations near the $^{132}$Sn shell-closure and the high energy component of neutron spectra, are unlikely to be explained by the optical potential, and will require further experimental and theoretical effort to explain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1809.09023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the coalescence behavior of the atomic Schr\"odinger wave functions from the angle of an operator product expansion (OPE) within the nonrelativistic Coulomb-Schr\"odinger effective field theory. We take the electron-nucleus coalescence as an explicit example to demonstrate our formalism, where the celebrated Kato's cusp condition can be easily reproduced. An exact OPE relation is rigorously proved to all orders in perturbation theory. Our approach can be readily extended to ascertain the multi-particle coalescence behaviors of atomic wave functions, as well as to take relativistic effects into account.</description>
