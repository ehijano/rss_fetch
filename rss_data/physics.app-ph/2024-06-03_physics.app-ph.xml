      <title>Surface roughness-informed fatigue life prediction of L-PBF Hastelloy X at elevated temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing, especially laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), is widely used for fabricating metal parts with intricate geometries. However, parts produced via L-PBF suffer from varied surface roughness which affects the dynamic or fatigue properties. Accurate prediction of fatigue properties as a function of surface roughness is a critical requirement for qualifying L-PBF parts. In this work, an analytical methodology is put forth to predict the fatigue life of L-PBF components having heterogeneous surface roughness. Thirty-six Hastelloy X specimens are printed using L-PBF followed by industry-standard heat treatment procedures. Half of these specimens are built with as-printed gauge sections and the other half is printed as cylinders from which fatigue specimens are extracted via machining. Specimens are printed in a vertical orientation and an orientation 30 degree from the vertical axis. The surface roughness of the specimens is measured using computed tomography and parameters such as the maximum valley depth are used to build an extreme value distribution. Fatigue testing is conducted at an isothermal condition of 500-degree F. It is observed that the rough specimens fail much earlier compared to the machined specimens due to the deep valleys present on the surfaces of the former ones. The valleys act as notches leading to high strain localization. Following this observation, a functional relationship is formulated analytically that considers surface valleys as notches and correlates the strain localization around those notches with fatigue life, using the Coffin-Manson-Basquin and Ramberg-Osgood equation. In conclusion, the proposed analytical model successfully predicts the fatigue life of L-PBF specimens at an elevated temperature undergoing different strain loadings.</description>

      <title>Real-Time State Modulation and Acquisition Circuit in Neuromorphic Memristive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristive neuromorphic systems are designed to emulate human perception and cognition, where the memristor states represent essential historical information to perform both low-level and high-level tasks. However, current systems face challenges with the separation of state modulation and acquisition, leading to undesired time delays that impact real-time performance. To overcome this issue, we introduce a dual-function circuit that concurrently modulates and acquires memristor state information. This is achieved through two key features: 1) a feedback operational amplifier (op-amp) based circuit that ensures precise voltage application on the memristor while converting the passing current into a voltage signal; 2) a division calculation circuit that acquires state information from the modulation voltage and the converted voltage, improving stability by leveraging the intrinsic threshold characteristics of memristors. This circuit has been evaluated in a memristor-based nociceptor and a memristor crossbar, demonstrating exceptional performance. For instance, it achieves mean absolute acquisition errors below 1 {\Omega} during the modulation process in the nociceptor application. These results demonstrate that the proposed circuit can operate at different scales, holding the potential to enhance a wide range of neuromorphic applications.</description>

      <title>Focusing Airborne Ultrasound with Partially Occluded Emission from Rectangular Plate with Flexural Vibration Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a focusing method of intense midair ultrasound out of ultrasonic emission from a single flexurally vibrating square plate partially covered with a purposely designed amplitude mask. Many applications relying on nonlinear acoustic effects, such as radiation force employed in acoustic levitation, have been devised. For those applications, focused intense airborne ultrasound is conventionally formed using phased arrays of transducers or sound sources with specific fabricated shapes. However, the former strategies are considerably costly, and the latter may require minute three-dimensional fabrication processes, which both hinder their utility, especially for the construction of a large ultrasound emitting aperture. Our method offers a possible solution for this, where the amplitude masks are designed in a fashion similar to the Freznel-zone-plate designing, but according to the positions of nodes and antinodes of the vibrating plate that are measured beforehand.
  We experimentally demonstrate the successful formation of midair ultrasound focus at a desired position. Our method only requires a monolithic plate, a driving transducer under the plate, and an amplitude mask fabricated out of laser machining processes of an acrylic plate. Magnification of the spatial scale of ultrasound apertures based on our method is much more readily and affordably achieved than conventional methods, which will lead to new midair ultrasound applications with the whole room workspace.</description>

      <title>Understanding Ion Distribution and Diffusion in Solid Polymer Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid polymer electrolytes exhibit ion conduction and high mechanical properties, thus are promising materials for future energy storage devices. The ion conductivity in an SPE is intricately connected to salt ion distribution in the polymer matrix. The relationship between ion diffusion and ion distribution remains unresolved. Here, we conduct coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations and establish correlations between ion distribution and transport for a phenomenological SPE model. We propose phase diagrams of SPEs as a function of ion pair size, ion concentration and the Bjerrum length of the material. A crossover from a discrete ion aggregate to a percolated ion aggregate is demonstrated as a function of ion pair size in the SPE. Further, we determine ion diffusions for all the phases of the SPE. The work provides important design strategies for controlling ion distribution and enhancing ion conductivity in a polymer matrix.</description>

      <title>For passive radiative cooling, are wavelength-selective emitters the best choice?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For passive cooling via thermal radiation toward the sky, it is known that an ideal selective emitter (SE) with high emissivity only in the 8 - 13 um atmospheric transparency window can reach a lower equilibrium temperature than an ideal broadband emitter (BE) across the mid infrared. Here, we evaluate whether this principle should guide the development of practical passive radiative cooling technologies. We model and compare the cooling performance of SEs and BEs at various locations on Earth, accounting for the distributions of atmospheric temperature and gas composition at specific dates and times. We find that for emitter temperatures at or higher than the ambient temperature, an ideal broadband emitter always provides higher net cooling power, while for sub-ambient cooling, an ideal selective emitter is slightly better: the difference in cooling power is small, at most on the order of ~2% of the incident solar power during daytime. Our conclusion is that large-scale deployment of passive radiative cooling technologies should focus on design and manufacturing of scalable low-cost surfaces with the lowest possible solar absorption without worrying too much whether the emitter is broadband or selective.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field Control of Magnetic Skyrmion Chirality in a Centrosymmetric 2D van der Waals Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals magnets hosting topological magnetic textures, such as skyrmions, show promise for applications in spintronics and quantum computing. Electrical control of these topological spin textures would enable novel devices with enhanced performance and functionality. Here, using electron microscopy combined with in situ electric and magnetic biasing, we show that the skyrmion chirality, whether left-handed or right-handed, in insulating Cr2Ge2Te6, is controlled by external electric field direction applied during magnetic field cooling process. The electric-field-tuned chirality remains stable, even amid variations in magnetic and electric fields. Our theoretical investigation reveals that nonzero Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between the nearest neighbors, induced by the external electric field, change their sign upon reversing the electric field direction, thereby facilitating chirality selection. The electrical control of magnetic chirality demonstrated in this study can be extended to other non-metallic centrosymmetric skyrmion-hosting magnets, opening avenues for future device designs in topological spintronics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Optical heterodyne microscopy of operating spin Hall nano-oscillator arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical heterodyne detection is a powerful technique for characterizing a wide range of physical excitations. Here, we use two types of optical heterodyne detection techniques (fundamental and parametric pumping) to microscopically characterize the high-frequency auto-oscillations of single and multiple nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs). To validate the technique and demonstrate its robustness, we study SHNOs made from two different material stacks, NiFe/Pt and W/CoFeB/MgO, and investigate the influence of both the RF injection power and the laser power on the measurements, comparing the optical results to conventional electrical measurements. To demonstrate the key features of direct, non-invasive, submicron, spatial, and phase-resolved characterization of the SHNO magnetodynamics, we map out the auto-oscillation magnitude and phase of two phase-binarized SHNOs used in Ising Machines. This proof-of-concept platform establishes a strong foundation for further extensions, contributing to the ongoing development of crucial characterization techniques for emerging computing technologies based on spintronics devices</description>

      <title>Evaluating the potential of thermoplastic polymers for cryogenic sealing applications: strain rate and temperature effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic fuels, such as liquid hydrogen and liquid natural gas, emerge as versatile and sustainable energy carriers that are revolutionising various industries including aerospace, automotive, marine, and power generation. Thermoplastic polymers can be a suitable alternative to metal seals in cryogenic fuel systems. However, there is limited study about the behaviours of thermoplastics at cryogenic temperatures, especially at liquid hydrogen temperature of 20 Kelvin (K). This paper measured the tensile properties and coefficient of thermal expansion of three popular thermoplastics: PTFE, PEEK and UHMWPE at room temperature (RT), 77 K and 20 K and at four strain rates. Further microscopic analysis was also conducted to understand the failure mechanisms occurring when combining reduced temperature with varying strain rate. The tensile strength of each polymer increased from RT to 77 K and decreased from 77 K to 20 K. Elastic modulus tended to increase, and the strain recorded at failure decreased when reducing temperature from RT to 20 K. From microscopic observation of PEEK and UHMWPE, a reduction in temperature from 77 K to 20 K resulted in a larger instantaneous fracture, with multi-faceted fracture surfaces containing many small mirror like and opaque or misty sub-regions within the fracture zone. For PTFE, the surface morphology exhibited an insensitivity to the increase in strain rate at cryogenic temperatures, and the microscopy showed how the size of dimples found within the fracture interface became smaller when temperature was reduced from 77 K to 20 K. Finally, PEEK was found to contract much less than PTFE and UHMWPE at 20 K, in agreement to it having the highest glass transition temperature of the three polymers, which is normally a good indicator when attempting to identify polymers that will tend to exhibit smaller contraction at cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>Microwave-multiplexed qubit controller using adiabatic superconductor logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryogenic qubit controllers (QCs) are the key to build large-scale superconducting quantum processors. However, developing scalable QCs is challenging because the cooling power of a dilution refrigerator is too small (~10 $\mu$W at ~10 mK) to operate conventional logic families, such as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor logic and superconducting single-flux-quantum logic, near qubits. Here we report on a scalable QC using an ultra-low-power superconductor logic family, namely adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) logic. The AQFP-based QC, referred to as the AQFP-multiplexed QC (AQFP-mux QC), produces multi-tone microwave signals for qubit control with an extremely small power dissipation of 81.8 pW per qubit. Furthermore, the AQFP-mux QC adopts microwave multiplexing to reduce the number of coaxial cables for operating the entire system. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate an AQFP-mux QC chip that produces microwave signals at two output ports through microwave multiplexing and demultiplexing. Experimental results show an output power of approximately $-$80 dBm and on/off ratio of ~40 dB at each output port. Basic mixing operation is also demonstrated by observing sideband signals.</description>

      <title>AlN Nanowire Based Vertically Integrated Piezoelectric Nanogenerators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, detailed analysis of the direct piezo-response of AlN nanowire-based vertically integrated nanogenerators (VINGs) is undertaken as a function of mechanical excitation frequency. We show that the piezo-charge, piezo-voltage, and impedance measured at the same position of the devices can be directly correlated through an equivalent circuit model, in the whole frequency range of investigation. Our presented results are utilized to determine the performance figures of merit (FoM) of nanowire-based VINGs, namely the piezoelectric voltage constant (g) for sensing, and the product d g for energy harvesting, where d is the piezoelectric charge constant. By comparison of these metrics with those of freestanding single crystal GaN and quartz substrates, as well as sputtered AlN thin films, we suggest that the nanowires can outperform their rigid counterparts in terms of mechanical sensing and energy generation. This work provides experimental guidelines for understanding the direct piezo-characteristics of VINGs and facilitates a quantitative comparison between nanostructured piezoelectric devices fabricated using different materials or architectures.</description>

      <title>Ferri-ionic Coupling in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ Nanoflakes: Polarization States and Controllable Negative Capacitance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$ covered by an ionic surface charge and reveal the appearance of polar states with relatively high polarization ~5 microC/cm$^2$ and stored free charge ~10 microC/cm$%2$, which can mimic "mid-gap" states related with a surface field-induced transfer of Cu and/or In ions in the van der Waals gap. The change in the ionic screening degree and mismatch strains induce a broad range of the transitions between paraelectric phase, antiferroelectric, ferrielectric, and ferri-ionic states in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes. The states' stability and/or metastability is determined by the minimum of the system free energy consisting of electrostatic energy, elastic energy, and a Landau-type four-well potential of the ferrielectric dipole polarization. The possibility to govern the transitions by strain and ionic screening can be useful for controlling the tunneling barrier in thin film devices based on CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes. Also, we predict that the CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes reveal features of the controllable negative capacitance effect, which make them attractive for advanced electronic devices, such as nano-capacitors and gate oxide nanomaterials with reduced heat dissipation.</description>

      <title>Elastic Softening in Synthetic Diamonds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study reveals a novel phenomenon demonstrating the elastic softening of synthetic diamonds when cooled to very low temperatures below 1 K. We present the results of ultrasonic measurements of single-crystalline synthetic diamonds without irradiation, namely type-IIa (colorless) and Ib (yellow) diamonds grown by high-pressure-high-temperature synthesis as well as type-IIa diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition. We observed divergent decreasing of the elastic stiffness constant $C_{44}$ in all samples at low temperatures down to 20 mK. We argue for the existence of electric quadrupolar degrees of freedom with the irreducible representation of T$_2$ in diamond as the origin of this elastic softening and the possible ground state preserves local T$_d$ symmetry down to around absolute zero. Of the ground states of atomic vacancies in diamond proposed thus far, the only relevant one is the positively charged single atomic vacancy V$^+$, which has not been observed in the previous optical measurements in the irradiated diamonds.</description>

Abstract: Determination of refractive index of micro-disks of a calcinated ($1100^\circ$C in air) photo-resist SZ2080$^\mathrm{TM}$ was carried out using transmission and reflection spectroscopy. Interference fringes at specific wavenumbers/wavelengths were selected for determination of the optical thickness, hence, the refractive index when the thickness of micro-disks was measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Refractive index of disks of $\sim 6\pm 1~\mu$m thickness were determined at visible and IR (2.5-13~$\mu$m) spectral ranges and where $2.2\pm 0.2$ at visible and IR wavelengths. Peculiarities of optical characterisation of micro-optical structures are discussed in view of possible uncertainties in the definition of geometric parameters, shape and mass density redistribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple and effective single-shot pump-probe technique is reported for studying the ultrafast dynamic processes in various materials. Using only two commercial gratings, a large time window of ~ 95.58 ps is spatially encoded in a single probe pulse, and single-shot time-resolved measurements are implemented. This time window exceeds the maximum reported values for single-shot pump-probe techniques using the echelon or angle beam encoding strategy. The phase difference problem in the echelon encoding strategies is also eliminated and a customized echelon is not needed in this technique. The ultrafast dynamic processes of ZnSe and indolium squaraine at a wavelength of 650 nm were investigated using this technique.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the ground shaking intensity using social media data and CCTV footage. Employing the Gemini Pro (Reid et al. 2024) model, a multi-modal language model, we demonstrate the ability to extract relevant information from unstructured data utilizing generative AI and natural language processing. The model output, in the form of Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) values, align well with independent observational data. Furthermore, our results suggest that beyond its advanced visual and auditory understanding abilities, Gemini appears to utilize additional sources of knowledge, including a simplified understanding of the general relationship between earthquake magnitude, distance, and MMI intensity, which it presumably acquired during its training, in its reasoning and decision-making processes. These findings raise intriguing questions about the extent of Gemini's general understanding of the physical world and its phenomena. The ability of Gemini to generate results consistent with established scientific knowledge highlights the potential of LLMs like Gemini in augmenting our understanding of complex physical phenomena such as earthquakes. More specifically, the results of this study highlight the potential of LLMs like Gemini to revolutionize citizen seismology by enabling rapid, effective, and flexible analysis of crowdsourced data from eyewitness accounts for assessing earthquake impact and providing crisis situational awareness. This approach holds great promise for improving early warning systems, disaster response, and overall resilience in earthquake-prone regions. This study provides a significant step toward harnessing the power of social media and AI for earthquake disaster mitigation.</description>

      <title>Control of the local and nonlocal electromagnetic response in all-dielectric reconfigurable metasurfaces</title>

Abstract: Reconfigurable metasurfaces are potent platforms to control the propagation properties of light dynamically. Among different reconfiguration mechanisms available at optical frequencies, using non-volatile phase change materials is one of the most prominent. Tuning the refractive index of these materials, and thus changing the electromagnetic response of the device, can be achieved by external modulation that enables the transition between their amorphous and crystalline structural states. In this work, we study a structure that exploits these materials to fully control the electromagnetic response, i.e., electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic coupling. Powered by this controllability, we present how the metasurface can be designed to perform beam steering and switchable one-way absorption applications. In addition, we demonstrate that the same platform can be designed to work in a nonlocal regime to implement a more efficient way of controlling light.</description>
