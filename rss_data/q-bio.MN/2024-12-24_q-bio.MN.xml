      <title>The generic geometry of steady state varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We answer several fundamental geometric questions about reaction networks with power-law kinetics, on topics such as generic finiteness of steady states, robustness, and nondegenerate multistationarity. In particular, we give an ideal-theoretic characterization of generic absolute concentration robustness, as well as conditions under which a network that admits multiple steady states also has the capacity for nondegenerate multistationarity. The key tools underlying our results come from the theory of vertically parametrized systems, and include a linear algebra condition that characterizes when the steady state system has positive nondegenerate zeros.</description>

      <title>A unified model for the origins of spongiform degeneration and other neuropathological features in prion diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decades after their initial observation in prion-infected brain tissues, the identities of virus-like dense particles, varicose tubules, and oval bodies containing parallel bands and fibrils have remained elusive. Our recent work revealed that a phenotype of dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), most notable for the perinuclear space (PNS), contributes to spongiform degeneration. To assess the significance of this phenotype for the etiology of prion diseases, we explored whether it can be functionally linked to other neuropathological hallmarks observed in these diseases, as this would indicate it to be a central event. Having surveyed the neuropathological record and other distant literature niches, we propose a model in which pathogenic forms of the prion protein poison raft domains, including essential Na+, K+-ATPases (NKAs) embedded within them, thereby triggering an ER-centered cellular rescue program coordinated by the unfolded protein response (UPR). The execution of this program stalls general protein synthesis, causing the deterioration of synaptic spines. As the disease progresses, cells selectively increase sterol biosynthesis, along with ribosome and ER biogenesis. These adaptive rescue attempts cause morphological changes to the ER which manifest as ER dilation or ER hypertrophy in a manner that is influenced by Ca2+ influx into the cell. The nuclear-to-cytoplasmic transport of mRNAs and tRNAs interrupts in late stage disease, thereby depriving ribosomes of supplies and inducing them to aggregate into a paracrystalline form. In support of this model, we share previously reported data, whose features are consistent with the interpretation that 1) the phenotype of ER dilation is observed in major prion diseases, 2) varicose tubules and oval bodies represent ER hypertrophy, and 3) virus-like dense particles are paracrystalline aggregates of inactive ribosomes.</description>
