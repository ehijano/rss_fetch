      <title>Land\'e $g$-factors of electrons and holes strongly confined in CsPbI$_3$ perovskite nanocrystals in glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Land\'e $g$-factor of charge carriers is a key parameter in spin physics controlling spin polarization and spin dynamics. In turn, it delivers information of the electronic band structure in vicinity of the band gap and its modification in nanocrystals provided by strong carrier confinement. The coherent spin dynamics of electrons and holes are investigated in CsPbI$_3$ perovskite nanocrystals with sizes varied from 4 to 16 nm by means of time-resolved Faraday ellipticity at the temperature of 6 K. The Land\'e $g$-factors of the charge carriers are evaluated through the Larmor spin precession in magnetic fields up to 430 mT across the spectral range from 1.69 to 2.25 eV, provided by variation of the nanocrystal size. The spectral dependence of the electron $g$-factor follows the model predictions when accounting for the mixing of the electronic bands with increasing confinement resulting from a decrease of the nanocrystal size. The spectral dependence of the hole $g$-factor, changing from $-0.19$ to $+1.69$, is considerably stronger than expected from the model. We analyze several mechanisms and conclude that none of them can be responsible for this difference. The renormalizations of the electron and hole $g$-factors roughly compensate each other, providing spectral independence for the bright exciton $g$-factor with a value of about $+2.2$.</description>

      <title>Stop using Landau gauge for Tight-binding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To analyze the electronic band structure of a two-dimensional (2D) crystal under a commensurate perpendicular magnetic field, tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonians are typically constructed using a magnetic unit cell (MUC), which is composed of several unit cells (UC) to satisfy flux quantization. However, when the vector potential is constrained to the Landau gauge, an additional constraint is imposed on the hopping trajectories, further enlarging the TB Hamiltonian and preventing incommensurate atomic rearrangements. In this paper, we demonstrate that this constraint persists, albeit in a weaker form, for any linear vector potential ($\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r})$ linear in $\mathbf{r}$). This restriction can only be fully lifted by using a nonlinear vector potential. With a general nonlinear vector potential, a TB Hamiltonian can be constructed that matches the minimal size dictated by flux quantization, even when incommensurate atomic rearrangements occur within the MUC, such as moir\'e reconstructions. For example, as the twist angle $\theta$ of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) approaches zero, the size of the TB Hamiltonian scales as $1/\theta^4$ when using linear vector potentials (including the Landau gauge). In contrast, with a nonlinear vector potential, the size scales more favorably, as $1/\theta^2$, making small-angle TBG models more tractable with TB.</description>

      <title>Energy levels and Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in twisted bilayer graphene quantum dots and rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the energy levels of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) quantum dots (QD) and rings (QR) under an external perpendicular magnetic field. The confinement structures are modeled by a circular dot-like- and ring-like-shaped site-dependent staggered potential, which prevents edge effects and leads to an energy gap between the electron and hole states. Results are obtained within the tight-binding model with interlayer hopping parameters defined by the Slater-Koster form for different interlayer twist angles $\theta$. Our findings show that, for $\theta$ around 0$^\circ$ or $60^\circ$, the energy spectra exhibit features resulting from the interplay between characteristics of the AA and AB/BA stacking orders that compose the moir\'e pattern of such tBLG, while the low-energy levels are shown to be nearly independent on the rotation angle for $10^\circ\lesssim \theta\lesssim 50^\circ$. In the absence of a magnetic field, the energy levels of the QR scale with its width $W$ according to a power law $W^{-\alpha}$, whose exponent $1 \lessapprox\alpha\lessapprox 2$ depends on the twist angle. Most interestingly, the lowest energy states of tBLG QRs oscillate as a function of its average radius, with the oscillation period matching half of the moir\'e period. In the presence of an intense magnetic field, the lowest energy levels for the tBLG QDs and QRs match almost perfectly, regardless of whether the external radius of the quantum confinement structure is smaller or on the order of the moir\'e period, which is due to the interplay of the trigonal warping effect and the preferential localization of the eigenstates. Our results reveal relevant information about the moir\'e pattern in tBLG and its role in charge particle confinement.</description>

      <title>Emerging chirality and moir\'e dynamics in twisted layered material heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superstructures arising at twisted 2D interfaces have recently attracted the attention of the scientific community due to exotic quantum states and unique mechanical and tribological behaviors that they exhibit. Here, we predict the emergence of chiral distortions in twisted layered interfaces of finite dimensions. This phenomenon originates in intricate interplay between interfacial interactions and contact boundary constraints. A metric termed the fractional chiral area, is introduced to quantify the overall chirality of the moir\'e superstructure and to characterize its spatial distribution. Despite the equilibrium nature of the discovered energetic and structural chirality effects they are shown to be manifested in the twisting dynamics of layered interfaces, which demonstrates a continuous transition from stick-slip to smooth rotation with no external trigger.</description>

      <title>Exchange-enhanced spin-orbit splitting and its density dependence for electrons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12125v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that spin-orbit splitting (SOS) in monolayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is substantially enhanced by electron-electron interaction. This effect, similar to the exchange-enhancement of the electron g-factor, is most pronounced for conduction band electrons (in particular, in MoS$_2$), and it has a non-monotonic dependence on the carrier sheet density, $n$. That is, the SOS enhancement is peaked at the onset of filling of the higher-energy spin-split band by electrons, $n_*$, which also separates the regimes of slow (at $n&lt;n_*$) and fast (for $n&gt;n_*$) spin and valley relaxation of charge carriers. Moreover, this density itself is determined by the enhanced SOS value, making the account of exchange renormalisation important for the analysis of spintronic performance of field-effect transistors based on two-dimensional TMDs.</description>

      <title>Coherent Driving of a Single Nitrogen Vacancy Center by a Resonant Magnetic Tunnel Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, atomic spin defects in diamond, represent an active contender for advancing transformative quantum information science (QIS) and innovations. One of the major challenges for designing NV-based hybrid systems for QIS applications results from the difficulty of realizing local control of individual NV spin qubits in a scalable and energyefficient way. To address this bottleneck, we introduce magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices to establish coherent driving of an NV center by a resonant MTJ with voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy. We show that the oscillating magnetic stray field produced by a resonant micromagnet can be utilized to effectively modify and drive NV spin rotations when the NV frequency matches the corresponding resonance conditions of the MTJ. Our results present a new pathway to achieve all-electric control of an NV spin qubit with reduced power consumption and improved solid-state scalability for implementing cutting-edge QIS technological applications.</description>

      <title>Intersublattice entanglement entropy of ferrimagnetic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrimagnets are antiparallel-ordered magnetic states in a bipartite lattice with two alternating unequal spins, which exhibit both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic properties. Several theoretical studies have explored the magnetic properties of ferrimagnets, but the entanglement entropy of ferrimagnets with arbitrary spin combinations has not been studied. In this study, we analytically derive the intersublattice entanglement entropy of a ferrimagnetic spin chain using the method that has been applied to the antiferromagnetic case. The analytical results are numerically verified using the density matrix renormalization group. Going beyond the results for antiferromagnets, the entanglement entropy of ferrimagnets for fixed anisotropy is shown to solely depend on the difference of spins relative to its geometric average, and the quantity is shown to be stable against small parameter variations.</description>

      <title>Interedge backscattering in time-reversal symmetric quantum spin Hall Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using standard tight-binding methods, we investigate a novel backscattering mechanism taking place on quantum spin Hall N'SNSN' Josephson junctions in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. This extended geometry allows for the interplay between two types of Andreev bound states (ABS): the usual phase-dependent ABS localized at the edges of the central SNS junction \emph{and} phase-independent ABS localized at the edges of the N'S regions. Crucially, the latter arise at discrete energies $E_n$ and mediate a backscattering process between opposite edges on the SNS junction, yielding gap openings when both types of ABS are at resonance. In this scenario, a 4$\pi$-periodic ABS decouples from the rest of the spectrum, and thus, it can be probed preventing the emission to the quasicontinuum. Interestingly, this backscattering mechanism introduces a new length scale, determining the ratio between $4\pi$- and $2\pi$-periodic supercurrent contributions and distorts the superconducting quantum interference (SQI) pattern. Finally, to proof the participation of these ABS, we propose to use a magnetic flux to tune $E_n$ to zero, resulting in the selective lifting of the fractional Josephson effect.</description>

      <title>A Novel Energy-Efficient Salicide-Enhanced Tunnel Device Technology Based on 300mm Foundry Platform Towards AIoT Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates a novel energy-efficient tunnel FET (TFET)-CMOS hybrid foundry platform for ultralow-power AIoT applications. By utilizing the proposed monolithic integration process, the novel complementary n and p-type Si TFET technology with dopant segregated source junction and self-aligned drain underlap design is successfully integrated into a 300mm CMOS baseline process without CMOS performance penalty and any new materials, experimentally demonstrating the large Ion and record high Ion/Ioff ratio of 10^7 among TFETs by industry-manufacturers. The device performance and variability are also co-optimized for high-volume production. Further circuit-level implementations are presented based on the calibrated compact model. The proposed TFET-CMOS hybrid logic and SRAM topologies show significant energy efficiency improvement with comparable operation speed compared with standard CMOS circuits, indicating its great potential for power-constraint AIoT applications.</description>

      <title>Snell's law in multirefringent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In anisotropic crystals, Maxwell's equations permit only birefringence for the propagation of light. Notwithstanding, multirefringent systems comprising more than two propagating modes exist, such as in electron optics and photonic crystals. It has been demonstrated that in such systems, the propagation of waves in the short wavelength limit results in the formation of anomalous caustics. To calculate these caustic curves, we generalized Snell's law valid for reflection and refraction in multirefringent systems possessing more than one propagating mode. The emergence of anomalous caustics in the wave function patterns obtained from rigorous quantum mechanical calculations in electron-optical systems is confirmed. These calculations were performed on electron scattering from circularly gated potential regions applied to multilayer rhombohedral graphene. Our results may generate further work to explore more complex phenomena in multirefringent systems.</description>

      <title>Approaching the Intrinsic Properties of Moir\'e Structures Using Atomic Force Microscopy Ironing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacking monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has led to the discovery of a plethora of new exotic phenomena, resulting from moir\'e pattern formation. Due to the atomic thickness and high surface-to-volume ratio of heterostructures, the interfaces play a crucial role. Fluctuations in the interlayer distance affect interlayer coupling and moir\'e effects. Therefore, to access the intrinsic properties of the TMD stack, it is essential to obtain a clean and uniform interface between the layers. Here, we show that this is achieved by ironing with the tip of an atomic force microscope. This post-stacking procedure dramatically improves the homogeneity of the interfaces, which is reflected in the optical response of the interlayer exciton. We demonstrate that ironing improves the layer coupling, enhancing moir\'e effects and reducing disorder. This is crucial for the investigation of TMD heterostructure physics, which currently suffers from low reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Determination of Magnetic Symmetries by Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convergent-beam electron diffraction (CBED) is a well-established probe for spatial symmetries of crystalline samples, mainly exploiting the well-defined mapping between the diffraction groups (symmetry group of CBED patterns) and the point-group symmetries of the crystalline sample. In this work, we extend CBED to determine magnetic point groups. We construct all magnetic CBED groups, of which there exist 125. Then, we provide the complete mapping of the 122 magnetic point groups to corresponding magnetic CBED groups for all crystal orientations. In order to verify the group-theoretical considerations, we conduct electron-scattering simulations on antiferromagnetic crystals and provide guidelines for the experimental realization. Based on its feasibility using existing technology, as well as on its accuracy, high spatial resolution, and small required sample size, magnetic CBED promises to be become a valuable alternative method for magnetic structure determination.</description>

      <title>Room temperature Planar Hall effect in nanostructures of trigonal-PtBi2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trigonal-PtBi2 has recently garnered significant interest as it exhibits unique superconducting topological surface states due to electron pairing on Fermi arcs connecting bulk Weyl nodes. Furthermore, topological nodal lines have been predicted in trigonal-PtBi2, and their signature was measured in magnetotransport as a dissipationless, i.e. odd under a magnetic field reversal, anomalous planar Hall effect. Understanding the topological superconducting surface state in trigonal-PtBi2 requires unravelling the intrinsic geometric properties of the normal state electronic wavefunctions and further studies of their hallmarks in charge transport characteristics are needed. In this work, we reveal the presence of a strong dissipative, i.e. even under a magnetic field reversal, planar Hall effect in PtBi2 at low magnetic fields and up to room temperature. This robust response can be attributed to the presence of Weyl nodes close to the Fermi energy. While this effect generally follows the theoretical prediction for a planar Hall effect in a Weyl semimetal, we show that it deviates from theoretical expectations at both low fields and high temperatures. We also discuss the origin of the PHE in our material, and the contributions of both the topological features in PtBi2 and its possible trivial origin. Our results strengthen the topological nature of PtBi2 and the strong influence of quantum geometric effects on the electronic transport properties of the low energy normal state.</description>

      <title>Tuning Electric Polarization via Exchange Striction Interaction in CaMn$_7$O$_{12}$ by Sr-Doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric materials displaying strong magnetically induced polarization have attracted considerable interest due to their potential applications in spintronics and various fast electrically controlled magnetic devices. CaMn$_7$O$_{12}$ (CMO) stands out for its giant spin-induced ferroelectric polarization. However, the origin of the induced electric polarization in CMO remains highly controversial and continues to be a subject of ongoing debate. In this paper, through room temperature X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, and thermally stimulated depolarizing current (TSDC) measurements, we provide experimental evidence for a route to tune the magnetically induced polarization by modifying the exchange-striction in CMO via Sr-doping. Our findings demonstrate that the large and broad current peaks observed near the first magnetic phase transition ($T_N1 \sim 90$ K) indicate polarization contributions from both thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) and intrinsic magnetically induced electric polarization. We suggest that this reduction in induced electric polarization in CMO originates from the increase in the Mn$^{3+}$ -- O -- Mn$^{4+}$ bond angle due to Sr$^{2+}$ doping, weakening the exchange-striction interaction. Meanwhile, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) effect determines the direction of the induced electric polarization. Our result sheds light on understanding the intriguing giant-induced polarization in CMO and similar compounds with complex magnetic structures.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric driven transition between superfluid and incoherent fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between repulsive interaction and superfluidity in flat band system. We consider spatially indirect excitons in the Lieb lattice bilayer as an example. We show that due to the presence of repulsive interaction, the excitons may form an incoherent fluid. By increasing the quantum metric, the exciton fluid experiences a transition into the superfluid phase. Such transition may be captured by a model of Josephson junction array, which is beyond mean field description.</description>

      <title>Highly anisotropic Drude-weight-reduction and enhanced linear-dichroism in van der Waals Weyl semimetal Td-MoTe2 with coherent interlayer electronic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weyl semimetal (WSM) states can be achieved by breaking spatial-inversion symmetry or time reversal symmetry. However, the anisotropy of the energy reduction contributing to the emergence of WSM states has seldom been investigated by experiments. A van der Waals metal MoTe2 exhibits a type-II WSM phase below the monoclinic-to-orthorhombic-phase-transition temperature Tc ~ 250 K. Here, we report a combined linearly-polarized optical-spectroscopy and electrical-transport study of MoTe2 at different temperatures. The Drude components in the a-axis, b-axis and c-axis optical conductivity spectra, together with the metallic out-of-plane and in-plane electrical resistivities, indicate the coherent inter-layer and in-plane charge transports. Moreover, the Drude weight in {\sigma}1a({\omega}), rather than the Drude weights in {\sigma}1b({\omega}) and {\sigma}1c({\omega}), decreases dramatically below Tc, which exhibits a highly anisotropic decrease in its Drude weight and thus suggests a strongly anisotropic reduction of the electronic kinetic energy in the WSM phase. Furthermore, below Tc, due to the in-plane anisotropic spectral-weight transfer from Drude component to high-energy region, the in-plane inter-band-absorption anisotropy increases remarkably around 770 meV, and has the largest value (~ 0.68) of normalized linear dichroism among the reported type-II WSMs. Our work sheds light on seeking new WSMs and developing novel photonic devices based on WSMs.</description>

      <title>Mitigating higher-band heating in Floquet-Hubbard lattices via two-tone driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-photon resonances to high-lying energy levels represent an unavoidable source of Floquet heating in strongly driven quantum systems. In this work, we extend the recently developed two-tone approach of 'cancelling' multi-photon resonances to shaken lattices in the Hubbard regime. Our experiments show that even for strong lattice shaking the inclusion of a weak second drive leads to cancellation of multi-photon heating resonances. Surprisingly, the optimal cancelling amplitude depends on the Hubbard interaction strength $U$, in qualitative agreement with exact diagonalisation calculations. Our results call for novel analytical approaches to capture the physics of strongly-driven-strongly-interacting many-body systems.</description>

      <title>PRefLexOR: Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning and Agentic Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PRefLexOR (Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning) combines preference optimization with concepts from Reinforcement Learning to enable models to self-teach through iterative reasoning improvements. We propose a recursive learning approach that engages the model in multi-step reasoning, revisiting, and refining intermediate steps before producing a final output in training and inference phases. Through multiple training stages, the model first learns to align its reasoning with accurate decision paths by optimizing the log odds between preferred and non-preferred responses. During this process, PRefLexOR builds a dynamic knowledge graph by generating questions from random text chunks and retrieval-augmentation to contextualize relevant details from the entire training corpus. In the second stage, preference optimization enhances model performance by using rejection sampling to fine-tune reasoning quality by continually producing in-situ training data while masking the reasoning steps. Recursive optimization within a thinking token framework introduces iterative feedback loops, where the model refines reasoning, achieving deeper coherence, consistency, and adaptability. Implemented in small language models with only 3 billion parameters, we should that even tiny models can iteratively teach themselves to reason with greater depth and reflectivity. Our implementation is straightforward and can be incorporated into any existing pretrained LLM. We focus our examples on applications in biological materials science and demonstrate the method in a variety of case studies that range from in-domain to cross-domain applications. Using reasoning strategies that include thinking and reflection modalities we build a multi-agent recursive self-improving inference approach to successively improve responses via repeated sampling in inference time.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic Josephson junction: nonreciprocity and sublattice selective transport of Cooper triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Josephson junction under consideration is composed of two s-wave superconducting contacts deposited on the top of a two-dimensional antiferromagnet (AF). Triplet Cooper correlations in AF are provided by thin ferromagnetic spacers between AF and superconducting contacts. The problem is considered in the regime of a weak tunneling of electrons between these contacts and AF. The transport of electron Cooper's pairs under the stationary phase bias in the disordered AF is treated within the formalism of equilibrium Green functions and the Born approximation for electrons which are scattered by nonmagnetic impurities. The system of diffusion equations is derived for three triplet components of Cooper-correlated electron pairs. These spin projections are coupled to each other due to interplay of the spin-orbit interaction and AF order. Moreover, the diffusion equations are sublattice-dependent. It is shown that such a staggered behavior will lead to the nonreciprocal Josephson current, if the tunneling of electrons between contacts and AF is different for different sublattices.</description>

      <title>Self-sustained optomechanical state destruction triggered by the Kerr nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavity optomechanics implements a unique platform where moving objects can be probed by quantum fields, either laser light or microwave signals. With a pump tone driving at a frequency above the cavity resonance, self-sustained oscillations can be triggered at large injected powers. These limit cycle dynamics are particularly rich, presenting hysteretic behaviours, broad comb signals and especially large motion amplitudes. All of these features can be exploited for both fundamental quantum research and engineering. Here we present low temperature microwave experiments performed on a high-Q cavity resonance capacitively coupled to the flexure of a beam resonator. We study the limit cycle dynamics phase space as a function of pump parameters (detuning, power). Unexpectedly, we find that in a region of this phase space the microwave resonance is irremediably destroyed: only a dramatic power-reset can restore the dynamics to its original state. The phenomenon can be understood as an optical instability linked to the Kerr nonlinearity of the cavity. A theory supporting this claim is presented, reproducing almost quantitatively the measurement. This remarkable feature might be further optimized and represents a new resource for quantum microwave circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient heat management at cryogenic temperatures is crucial for superconducting quantum technologies. This study demonstrates the controlled manipulation of the heat flow and heat rectification through an asymmetric superconducting tunnel junction. The system exhibits a non-reciprocal behavior, developing a thermoelectric regime exclusively when the electrode with the larger gap is heated. This feature significantly boosts thermal rectification effectively classifying the device as a heat diode. At the same time when operating as a thermoelectric engine, the same device also functions as a heat pipe, expelling heat from the cryogenic environment, minimizing losses at the cold terminal. This dual functionality is inherently passive, and the performance of the heat pipe and the heat diode can be finely adjusted by modifying the external electrical load.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable spin-wave platform based on interplay between nanodots and waveguide in hybrid magnonic crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a hybrid magnonic crystal composed of a chain of nanodots with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, positioned above a permalloy waveguide. The micromagnetic study examines two different magnetization states in the nanodots: a single-domain state and an egg-shaped skyrmion state. Due to the dipolar coupling between the dot and the waveguide, a strongly bound hybrid magnetization texture is formed in the system. Our results show complex spin-wave spectra, combining the effects of periodicity, magnetization texture, and hybridization of the propagating waves in the waveguide with the dot/skyrmion modes. The dynamics of the systems are characterized by several key features which include differences in band-gap sizes, the presence of flat bands in the skyrmion state that can form both bound and hybridized states, the latter sometimes leading to the presence of additional non-Bragg band gaps, and a broad frequency range of only waveguide-dominated modes in the single-domain state. Thus, the study shows that the proposed hybrid magnonic crystals have many distinct functionalities, highlighting their reconfigurable potential, magnon-magnon couplings, mode localization, and bound states overlapping with the propagating waves. This opens up potential applications in analog and quantum magnonics, spin-wave filtering, and the establishment of magnonic neural networks.</description>

      <title>Terahertz photocurrent probe of quantum geometry and interactions in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials represent strongly interacting electron systems bridging topological and correlated physics. Despite significant advances, decoding wavefunction properties underlying the quantum geometry remains challenging. Here, we utilize polarization-resolved photocurrent measurements to probe magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, leveraging its sensitivity to the Berry connection that encompasses quantum "textures" of electron wavefunctions. Using terahertz light resonant with optical transitions of its flat bands, we observe bulk photocurrents driven by broken symmetries and reveal the interplay between electron interactions and quantum geometry. We observe inversion-breaking gapped states undetectable through quantum transport, sharp changes in the polarization axes caused by interaction-induced band renormalization, and recurring photocurrent patterns at integer fillings of the moir\'e unit cell that track the evolution of quantum geometry through the cascade of phase transitions. The large and tunable terahertz response intrinsic to flat-band systems offers direct insights into the quantum geometry of interacting electrons and paves the way for innovative terahertz quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) is trained to reproduce the evolution of the spinodal decomposition process in three dimensions as described by the Cahn-Hilliard equation. A specialized, physics-inspired architecture is proven to provide close accordance between the predicted evolutions and the ground truth ones obtained via conventional integration schemes. The method can accurately reproduce the evolution of microstructures not represented in the training set at a fraction of the computational costs. Extremely long-time extrapolation capabilities are achieved, up to reaching the theoretically expected equilibrium state of the system, consisting of a layered, phase-separated morphology, despite the training set containing only relatively-short, initial phases of the evolution. Quantitative accordance with the decay rate of the Free energy is also demonstrated up to the late coarsening stages, proving that this class of Machine Learning approaches can become a new and powerful tool for the long timescale and high throughput simulation of materials, while retaining thermodynamic consistency and high-accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We show that the static structure factor of general many-body systems with $U(1)$ symmetry has a lower bound determined only by the ground state Chern number. Our bound relies only on causality and non-negative energy dissipation, and holds for a wide range of systems. We apply our theory to (fractional) Chern insulators, (fractional) quantum spin Hall insulators, topological superconductors, and chiral spin liquids. Our results uncover a universal feature of topological phases beyond the quantized response.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of transparent SNS weak links decreases sharply with length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.</description>
