      <title>Organ Dose Conversion Factors for Murine Galactic Cosmic Ray Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic cosmic rays (GCR) are a principal source of ionizing radiation exposure for astronauts during deep space missions. Given the ambition to expand manned space exploration to distant destinations like Mars, it is essential to accurately predict the radiation doses astronauts are likely to encounter and the consequent biological impacts. Accurate dose predictions are important for operational radiation safety, ensuring risk assessments and protective measures are properly calibrated to challenges of deep space travel. The GCRsim facility at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory enables small animal radiobiology studies of GCR exposure, offering a controlled setting to mimic the complex radiation conditions in deep space. This manuscript introduces Dose Conversion Factors (DCFs) enabling rigorous absorbed dose calculations for mice irradiated at the GCRsim. A formalism was introduced for calculating organ-level and voxel-level radiation dose to a representative mouse phantom, based on DCFs quantifying absorbed dose per unit fluence of different GCRsim species for various irradiation orientations. The PHITS Monte Carlo code was employed to compute the DCFs in units of Gy m^2 ion^-1. A library of murine DCFs was derived using the PHITS Monte Carlo code for six irradiation orientations: right-left, anterior-posterior, superior-inferior, and their opposed variations. Absorbed doses to the murine total body were calculated and compared with ion chamber measurements, which agreed within 10%. A library of dose conversion factors for mouse irradiation at GCRsim was developed and validated against measurements. These DCFs account for organ-specific variations in radiation dose from different GCR species, enabling improved assessments of potential radiogenic effects and enhancing astronaut safety for future deep space missions.</description>

      <title>Assessment of 7T task fMRI value over 3T task fMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high field 7T fMRI offers notable advantages over 3T fMRI, including higher signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios, enabling finer spatial and temporal resolution. This study explores the differences in activation maps from Human Connectome Project datasets between 7T and 3T field strengths, focusing on visual identified using the Glasser atlas. Functional tasks for each scanner were designed to include visual stimuli, with data processed uniformly to ensure comparability. Results showed significantly higher beta coefficients for common regions of activation, such as V3A and V3B, in 7T compared to 3T datasets. This suggests that 7T fMRI data more accurately reflect the idealized time course of task-related conditions, likely due to improved sensitivity to blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, variations in experimental design and acquisition parameters between scanners complicate the direct comparison of beta coefficients.</description>

      <title>From Offline to Inline Without Pain: A Practical Framework for Translating Offline MR Reconstructions to Inline Deployment Using the Gadgetron Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and validate a practical framework to overcome common issues in inline deployment of established offline MR reconstruction, including (1) delay from lengthy reconstructions, (2) limited support for multi-scan input reconstructions, (3) the need to adapt scripts for different raw formats, and (4) limited guidance and experience in retaining scanner reconstructions and applying scanner-based post-processing to custom outputs. Methods: The framework builds upon the Gadgetron platform and includes: (1) an input converter to transform ISMRMRD format raw into a Siemens format raw structure, facilitating reuse of existing code; (2) an asynchronous trigger-and-retrieve mechanism enabling long reconstructions without delaying scanner processes; (3) resource-aware scheduling for parallel execution; (4) integrated file management to support multi-scan inputs; and (5) preservation of scanner-based reconstructions and post-processing. The framework was validated on 2 Siemens scanners for SENSE, AlignedSENSE, and NUFFT reconstructions, and in a large-cohort study. Results: Minimum code modification for inline deployment has been shown, and all reconstructions were successfully executed inline without disrupting scanner workflows. Images were retrieved via automated or retro-reconstruction, with scanner-based post-processing applied to custom outputs. Multi-scan input reconstructions were executed using GPU-aware scheduling, confirming feasibility for routine and large-scale applications. In 480 consecutive examinations, inline reconstructions were retrieved in 99% of cases without disruptions. Conclusion: The framework lowers the technical barrier to inline deployment of offline reconstructions, enabling robust, scalable, and post-processing-compatible integration. It is openly available with documentation and demonstration cases to support reproducibility and community adoption.</description>

      <title>Deformation Driven Suction Cups: A Mechanics-Based Approach to Wearable Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wearable electronics are emerging as essential tools for health monitoring, haptic feedback, and human-computer interactions. While stable contact at the device-body interface is critical for these applications, it remains challenging due to the skin's softness, roughness, and mechanical variability. Existing methods, such as grounding structures or adhesive tapes, often suffer from contact loss, limited repeatability, and restrictions on the types of electronics they can support. Suction-based adhesives offer a promising alternative by generating negative pressure without requiring tight bands or chemical adhesives. However, most existing cup designs rely on rigid-surface assumptions and overlook mechanical interactions between suction cups and skin. Inspired by traditional cupping therapies, we present a suction-based adhesive system that attaches through elastic deformation and recovery. Using analytical modeling, numerical simulations, and experiments, we present a mechanics-based framework showing how suction performance depends on cup geometry, substrate compliance, and interfacial adhesion. We show that cup geometry should be tailored to substrate stiffness. Wide, flat suction cups perform well on rigid surfaces but fail on soft ones like skin due to substrate intrusion into the chamber. Narrow and tall domes better preserve recoverable volume and generate stronger suction. To improve sealing on rough, dry skin, we introduce a soft, tacky interfacial layer informed by a contact mechanics model. Using our design principles for skin suction adhesives, we demonstrate secure attachment of rigid and flexible components including motion sensors, haptic actuators, and electrophysiological electrodes across diverse anatomical regions. These findings provide a fundamental basis for designing the next generation of skin-friendly adhesives for wearable electronics.</description>

      <title>A Fourier finite volume approach for the optical inverse problem of quantitative photoacoustic tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new approach for solving the optical inverse problem of quantitative photoacoustic tomography is introduced, which interpolates between the well-known diffusion approximation and a radiative transfer equation based model. The proposed formulation combines a spatial finite volume scheme with a truncated Fourier expansion in the direction variable for the radiative transfer equation. The finite volume scheme provides a natural and simple approach for representing piecewise constant image data modelled using transport equations. The truncated Fourier expansion in the direction variable facilitates the interpolation between the diffusion approximation at low order, and the full radiative transfer model as the truncation limit $N\rightarrow\infty$. It is therefore possible to tune the precision of the model to the demands of the imaging application, taking $N=1$ for cases when the diffusion approximation would suffice and increasing the number of terms otherwise. We will then utilise the non-linear optimisation functionality of Matlab to address the corresponding large-scale nonlinear inverse problem using gradient based quasi-Newton minimisation via the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Numerical experiments for two test-cases of increasing complexity and resolution will be presented, and the effect of logarithmically rescaling the problem data on the accuracy of the reconstructed solutions will be investigated. We will focus on cases where the diffusion approximation is not sufficient to demonstrate that our approach can provide significant accuracy gains with only a modest increase in the number of Fourier terms included.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Delivered Spill Structure of Medical Proton and Carbon-Ion Beams at MedAustron using a High Frequency Silicon Carbide Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical synchrotrons are often used for testing instrumentation in high-energy physics or non-clinical research in medical physics. In many applications of medical synchrotrons, such as microdosimetry and ion imaging, precise knowledge of the spill structure and instantaneous particle rate is crucial. Conventional ionization chambers, while omnipresent in clinical settings, suffer from limitations in charge resolution and integration time, making single-particle detection at high dose rates unfeasible. To address these limitations, we present a beam detection setup based on a silicon carbide (SiC) sensor and a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC), capable of detecting single particles with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) pulse duration of 500 ps. At the MedAustron ion therapy center, we characterized the spill structure of proton and carbon-ion beams delivered to the irradiation room beyond the timescale of the maximum ion revolution frequency in the synchrotron. The resulting data offer valuable insights into the beam intensity at small time scales and demonstrate the capabilities of SiC-based systems for high-flux beam monitoring.</description>
