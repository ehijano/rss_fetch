      <title>On the characterization of uniqueness polynomials: both complex and p-adic versions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem "A general characterization of uniqueness polynomial for non-critically injective polynomials" has been remained open since the last two decades. In this paper, we explore this open problem. To this end, we initiate a new approach that also includes critically injective polynomials. We provide this characterization for both the complex and p-adic cases. We also provide various examples as an application of our results along with the verification of the existing examples. Consequently, we find examples of unique range sets generated by non-critically injective polynomials with least cardinalities achieved so far and one of these results is sharp with respect to all the available formulas in the literature. Furthermore, we cover the part of least degree uniqueness polynomials. In this part, we also provide some sharp bounds.</description>

      <title>On the dynamics of Stirling's iterative root-finding method for rational functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of Stirling's iterative root-finding method $St_f(z)$ for rational and polynomial functions. It is seen that the Scaling theorem is not satisfied by Stirling's iterative root-finding method. We prove that for a rational function $R(z)$ with simple zeroes, the zeroes are the superattracting fixed points of $St_{R}(z)$ and all the extraneous fixed points of $St_{R}(z)$ are rationally indifferent. For a polynomial $p(z)$ with simple zeroes, we show that the Julia set of $St_p(z)$ is connected. Also, the symmetry of the dynamical plane and free critical orbits of Stirling's iterative method for quadratic unicritical polynomials are discussed. The dynamics of this root-finding method applied to M\"{o}bius map is investigated here. We have shown that the possible number of Herman rings of this method for M\"{o}bius map is at most $2$.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of tangent currents for positive closed currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a complex manifold $X$ of dimension $k,$ and let $V\subset X$ be a K\"ahler submanifold of dimension $l,$ and let $B\subset V$ be a piecewise $\mathcal{C}^2$-smooth domain. Let $T$ be a positive closed currents of bidegree $(p,p)$ in $X$ such that $T$ satisfies a mild reasonable assumption in a neighborhood of $\partial B$ in $X$ and that the $j$-th average mean $\nu_j(T,B,r)$ for every $j$ with $\max(0,l-p)\leq j\leq\min(l,k-p)$ converges sufficiently fast to the $j$-th generalized Lelong number $\nu_j(T,B)$ as $r$ tends to $0$ so that $r^{-1}(\nu_j(T, B,r)-\nu_j( T,B))$ is locally integrable near $r=0.$ Then we show that $T$ admits a unique tangent current along $B.$ A local version where we replace the condition of $T$ near $B$ by the conditions on a finite cover of $B$ by piecewise $\mathcal{C}^2$-smooth domains in $V$ is also given. When $T$ is a current of integration over a complex analytic set, we show that $\nu_j(T,B,r)-\nu_j(T,B)=O(r^\rho)$ for some $\rho&gt;0,$ and hence this condition is satisfied. Our result may be viewed as a natural generalization of Blel-Demailly-Mouzali's criterion from the case $l=0$ to the case $l&gt;0.$ The result has applications in the intersection theory of positive closed currents.</description>

      <title>Compactness and related properties of weighted composition operators on weighted BMOA spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that a large class of properties coincide for weighted composition operators on a large class of weighted VMOA spaces, including the ones with logarithmic weights and the ones with standard weights $(1-|z|)^{-c}, \ 0\leq c&lt; 1/2$. Some of these properties are compactness, weak compactness, complete continuity and strict singularity. A function-theoretic characterization for these properties is also given. Similar results are also proved for many weighted composition operators on similarly weighted BMOA spaces. The main results extend the theorems given in [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 151 (2023), 1195--1207], and new test functions that are suitable for the weighted setting are developed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of a bounded ideal triangulation of an infinite Riemann surface and parametrize Teichm\"uller spaces of infinite surfaces which allow bounded triangulations. We prove that our parametrization is real-analytic. Riemann surfaces with bounded geometry and countably many punctures belong to the class of surfaces with bounded ideal triangulations. In comparison, the Fenchel-Nielsen parametrization for surfaces with bounded geometry is not known, while the Fenchel-Nielsen parametrization for surfaces with bounded pants decompositions is known as a homeomorphism but it is not known whether it is real-analytic</description>

      <title>Bi-Lipschitz triviality of function-germs on singular varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the bi-Lipschitz triviality of deformations of an analytic function germ $f$ defined on a germ of an analytic variety $(X, 0)$ in $\mathbb C^n$. We introduce the notion of strongly rational $\mathscr R_X$-bi-Lipschitz trivial families and give an infinitesimal criterion which is a sufficient condition for the bi-Lipschitz triviality of deformations of $f$ on $(X,0).$ As a corollary it follows that when $X$ and $f$ are homogeneous of the same degree, all deformation of $f$ of the same or higher degrees are bi-Lipschitz trivial. We then prove a rigidity result for deformations of $f$ on $X$ when both are weighted homogeneous with respect to the same set of weights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Results providing conditions on a family of integro-differential operators to determine a formal automorphism are established. Equivalently, the problem can be read in terms of existence and uniqueness of formal solutions of Cauchy problems in different settings.
  The main achievements provide a three-statement result not only in the framework of general formal power series, but also on subspaces appearing in applications such as Gevrey settings and moment differential operators.</description>

      <title>On the Shapes of Rational Lemniscates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rational lemniscate is a level set of $|r|$ where $r: \hat{\mathbb{C}} \rightarrow \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ is rational. We prove that any planar Euler graph can be approximated, in a strong sense, by a homeomorphic rational lemniscate. This generalizes Hilbert's lemniscate theorem; he proved that any Jordan curve can be approximated (in the same strong sense) by a polynomial lemniscate that is also a Jordan curve. As consequences, we obtain a sharp quantitative version of the classical Runge's theorem on rational approximation, and we give a new result on the approximation of planar continua by Julia sets of rational maps.</description>

      <title>Frequently hypercyclic meromorphic curves with slow growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08048v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct entire curves in projective spaces that are simultaneously frequently hypercyclic for translations along countably many specified directions, while preserving optimal slow growth rates. Moreover, we demonstrate that there do not exist entire curves that are frequently hypercyclic for translations along uncountably many directions while still exhibiting optimal slow growth. This result contrasts with the phenomenon observed for hypercyclic entire functions, which can be hypercyclic for translations along uncountably many directions while maintaining slow growth. Our approach is fundamentally grounded in Nevanlinna theory, and the construction is heuristically guided by the Oka principle. This work provides a new perspective on the intricate interplay between the dynamical properties and growth rates of entire curves in projective spaces.</description>

      <title>Separated determinantal point processes and generalized Fock spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study conditions so that the determinantal point process $\Lambda_\phi$ associated to a generalized Fock space defined by a doubling subharmonic weight $\phi$ is almost surely a separated sequence in $\mathbb C$. Under a natural assumption on $\phi$, we provide a characterization of such processes. Additionally, we emphasize the role of intrinsic repulsion in determinantal processes by comparing $\Lambda_\phi$ with the Poisson process of the same first intensity. As an application, we show that the determinantal process $\Lambda_\alpha$ associated to the canonical weight $\phi_\alpha(z)=|z|^\alpha$, $\alpha&gt;0$, is almost surely separated if and only if $\alpha&lt;4/3$. In contrast, the Poisson process $\Lambda_\alpha^P$ having the same first intensity as $\Lambda_\alpha$ is almost surely separated if and only if $\alpha&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>The dimension-free Gehring-Hayman inequality for quasigeodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known theorem of J. Heinonen and S. Rohde in 1993 states that if $D\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is quasiconformally equivalently to an uniform domain, then the Gehring-Hayman inequality holds in $D$: quasihyperbolic geodesics in $D$ minimizes the Euclidean length among all curves in $D$ with the same end points, up to a universal dimension-dependent multiplicative constant.
  In this paper, we develop a new approach to strengthen the above result in the following three aspects: 1) obtain a dimension-free multiplicative constant in the Gehring-Hayman inequality; 2) relax the class of quasihyperbolic geodesics to more general quasigeodesics; 3) relax the quasiconformal equivalence to more general coarsely quasihyperbolic equivalence.
  As a byproduct of our general approach, we are able to prove that the above improved Gehring-Hayman inequality indeed holds in Banach spaces. This answers affirmatively an open problem raised by J. Heinonen and S. Rohde in 1993 and reformulated by J. V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} in 2005.</description>

      <title>General theory of balayage on locally compact spaces. Applications to weighted minimum energy problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under suitable requirements on a kernel on a locally compact space, we develop a theory of inner (outer) balayage of quite general Radon measures $\omega$ (not necessarily of finite energy) onto quite general sets (not necessarily closed). We prove the existence and the uniqueness of inner (outer) swept measures, analyze their properties, and provide a number of alternative characterizations. In spite of being in agreement with Cartan's theory of Newtonian balayage, the results obtained require essentially new methods and approaches, since in the case in question, useful specific features of Newtonian potentials may fail to hold. The theory thereby established extends considerably that by Fuglede (Anal. Math., 2016) and that by the author (Anal. Math., 2022), these two dealing with $\omega$ of finite energy. Such a generalization enables us to improve substantially our recent results on the Gauss variational problem (Constr. Approx., 2024), by strengthening their formulations and/or by extending the area of their validity. This study covers many interesting kernels in classical and modern potential theory, which also looks promising for other applications.</description>
