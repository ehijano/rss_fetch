      <title>Uni-3DAR: Unified 3D Generation and Understanding via Autoregression on Compressed Spatial Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models and their multi-modal extensions have demonstrated the effectiveness of unifying generation and understanding through autoregressive next-token prediction. However, despite the critical role of 3D structural generation and understanding ({3D GU}) in AI for science, these tasks have largely evolved independently, with autoregressive methods remaining underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-3DAR, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates {3D GU} tasks via autoregressive prediction. At its core, Uni-3DAR employs a novel hierarchical tokenization that compresses 3D space using an octree, leveraging the inherent sparsity of 3D structures. It then applies an additional tokenization for fine-grained structural details, capturing key attributes such as atom types and precise spatial coordinates in microscopic 3D structures. We further propose two optimizations to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The first is a two-level subtree compression strategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x. The second is a masked next-token prediction mechanism tailored for dynamically varying token positions, significantly boosting model performance. By combining these strategies, Uni-3DAR successfully unifies diverse {3D GU} tasks within a single autoregressive framework. Extensive experiments across multiple microscopic {3D GU} tasks, including molecules, proteins, polymers, and crystals, validate its effectiveness and versatility. Notably, Uni-3DAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art diffusion models by a substantial margin, achieving up to 256\% relative improvement while delivering inference speeds up to 21.8x faster. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-3DAR.</description>

      <title>GraphXForm: Graph transformer for computer-aided molecular design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative deep learning has become pivotal in molecular design for drug discovery, materials science, and chemical engineering. A widely used paradigm is to pretrain neural networks on string representations of molecules and fine-tune them using reinforcement learning on specific objectives. However, string-based models face challenges in ensuring chemical validity and enforcing structural constraints like the presence of specific substructures. We propose to instead combine graph-based molecular representations, which can naturally ensure chemical validity, with transformer architectures, which are highly expressive and capable of modeling long-range dependencies between atoms. Our approach iteratively modifies a molecular graph by adding atoms and bonds, which ensures chemical validity and facilitates the incorporation of structural constraints. We present GraphXForm, a decoder-only graph transformer architecture, which is pretrained on existing compounds and then fine-tuned using a new training algorithm that combines elements of the deep cross-entropy method and self-improvement learning. We evaluate GraphXForm on various drug design tasks, demonstrating superior objective scores compared to state-of-the-art molecular design approaches. Furthermore, we apply GraphXForm to two solvent design tasks for liquid-liquid extraction, again outperforming alternative methods while flexibly enforcing structural constraints or initiating design from existing molecular structures.</description>
