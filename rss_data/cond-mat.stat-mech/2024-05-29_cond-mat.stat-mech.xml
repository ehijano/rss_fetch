      <title>Classical and quantum thermodynamics in a non-equilibrium regime: Application to Stirling engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a thermodynamic theory in the non-equilibrium regime by extending a theory based on the dimensionless (DL) minimum work principle previously developed for a thermodynamic system-bath model [S.Koyanagi and Y.Tanimura,J.Chem.Phys.160,(2024)]. Our results are described by non-equilibrium thermodynamic potentials expressed in time-derivative form in terms of extensive and intensive variables. This is made possible through the incorporation of waste heat, which is equivalent to the loss work consumed by the bath, into the definitions of thermodynamic potentials in a non-equilibrium regime. These potentials can be evaluated from the DL non-equilibrium-to-equilibrium minimum work principle, which is derived from the principle of DL minimum work and is equivalent to the second law of thermodynamics. We thus obtain the non-equilibrium Massieu-Planck potentials as entropic potentials and the non-equilibrium Helmholtz-Gibbs potentials as free energies. Our results are verified numerically by simulating a Stirling engine consisting of two isothermal and two thermostatic processes using the quantum Fokker-Planck equations and the classical Kramers equation derived from the thermodynamic system-bath model. We then show that any thermodynamic process can be analyzed using a non-equilibrium work diagram analogous to the equilibrium one for given time-dependent intensive variables. The results can be used to develop efficient heat machines in non-equilibrium regimes.</description>

      <title>Memory-induced absolute negative mobility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Markovian systems form a broad area of physics that remains greatly unexplored despite years of intensive investigations. The spotlight is on memory as a source of effects that are absent in their Markovian counterparts. In this work we dive into this problem and analyze a driven Brownian particle moving in a spatially periodic potential and exposed to correlated thermal noise. We show that the absolute negative mobility effect, in which the net movement of the particle is in direction opposite to the average force acting on it, may be induced by the memory of the setup. To explain the origin of this phenomenon we resort to the recently developed effective mass approach to dynamics of non-Markovian systems.</description>

      <title>Sampling metastable systems using collective variables and Jarzynski-Crooks paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling a high dimensional multimodal target probability measure. We assume that a good proposal kernel to move only a subset of the degrees of freedoms (also known as collective variables) is known a priori. This proposal kernel can for example be built using normalizing flows. We show how to extend the move from the collective variable space to the full space and how to implement an accept-reject step in order to get a reversible chain with respect to a target probability measure. The accept-reject step does not require to know the marginal of the original measure in the collective variable (namely to know the free energy). The obtained algorithm admits several variants, some of them being very close to methods which have been proposed previously in the literature. We show how the obtained acceptance ratio can be expressed in terms of the work which appears in the Jarzynski-Crooks equality, at least for some variants. Numerical illustrations demonstrate the efficiency of the approach on various simple test cases, and allow us to compare the variants of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Importance Sampling for counting statistics in one-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of numerical investigation of the counting statistics for a class of one-dimensional systems. Importance sampling, the cornerstone technique usually implemented for such problems, critically hinges on selecting an appropriate biased distribution. While exponential tilt in the observable stands as the conventional choice for various problems, its efficiency in the context of counting statistics may be significantly hindered by the genuine discreteness of the observable. To address this challenge, we propose an alternative strategy which we call importance sampling with the local tilt. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach through the analysis of three prototypical examples: a set of independent Gaussian random variables, Dyson gas, and Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (SSEP) with a steplike initial condition.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the where and when of coarse-grained entropy production: General theory meets single-molecule experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The laws of thermodynamics apply to biophysical systems on the nanoscale as described by the framework of stochastic thermodynamics. This theory provides universal, exact relations for quantities like work, which have been verified in experiments where a fully resolved description allows direct access to such quantities. Complementary studies consider partially hidden, coarse-grained descriptions, in which the mean entropy production typically is not directly accessible but can be bounded in terms of observable quantities. Going beyond the mean, we introduce a fluctuating entropy production that applies to individual trajectories in a coarse-grained description under time-dependent driving. Thus, this concept is applicable to the broad and experimentally significant class of driven systems in which not all relevant states can be resolved. We provide a paradigmatic example by studying an experimentally verified protein unfolding process. As a consequence, the entire distribution of the coarse-grained entropy production rather than merely its mean retains spatial and temporal information about the microscopic process. In particular, we obtain a bound on the distribution of the physical entropy production of individual unfolding events.</description>

      <title>Short-time Fokker-Planck propagator beyond the Gaussian approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a perturbation approach to calculate the short-time propagator, or transition density, of the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation, to in principle arbitrary order in the time increment. Our approach preserves probability exactly and allows us to evaluate expectation values of analytical observables to in principle arbitrary accuracy; to showcase this, we derive perturbation expansions for the moments of the spatial increment, the finite-time Kramers-Moyal coefficients, and the mean medium entropy production rate. For an explicit multiplicative-noise system with available analytical solution, we validate all our perturbative results. Throughout, we compare our perturbative results to those obtained from the widely used Gaussian approximation of the short-time propagator; we demonstrate that this Gaussian propagator leads to errors that can be many orders of magnitude larger than those resulting from our perturbation approach. Potential applications of our results include parametrizing diffusive stochastic dynamics from observed time series, and sampling path spaces of stochastic trajectories numerically.</description>

      <title>Dataset-learning duality and emergent criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In artificial neural networks, the activation dynamics of non-trainable variables is strongly coupled to the learning dynamics of trainable variables. During the activation pass, the boundary neurons (e.g., input neurons) are mapped to the bulk neurons (e.g., hidden neurons), and during the learning pass, both bulk and boundary neurons are mapped to changes in trainable variables (e.g., weights and biases). For example, in feed-forward neural networks, forward propagation is the activation pass and backward propagation is the learning pass. We show that a composition of the two maps establishes a duality map between a subspace of non-trainable boundary variables (e.g., dataset) and a tangent subspace of trainable variables (i.e., learning). In general, the dataset-learning duality is a complex non-linear map between high-dimensional spaces, but in a learning equilibrium, the problem can be linearized and reduced to many weakly coupled one-dimensional problems. We use the duality to study the emergence of criticality, or the power-law distributions of fluctuations of the trainable variables. In particular, we show that criticality can emerge in the learning system even from the dataset in a non-critical state, and that the power-law distribution can be modified by changing either the activation function or the loss function.</description>

      <title>Molecular Structure and Rotational Dynamics in the Acetonitrile:Acetylene (1:2) Plastic Co-Crystal at Titan Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface of Saturn's moon Titan is coated with small molecule organic solids termed cryominerals. Cryominerals play an analogous role to minerals on Earth in Titan's surface geology and geochemistry. To develop a predictive understanding of Titan's surface geochemistry, we need to characterize the structure and dynamics of cryominerals at the molecular scale. We use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to quantify the structure and dynamics of the acetonitrile:acetylene (1:2) co-crystal at Titan surface conditions. We suggest that acetonitrile:acetylene is in a plastic phase, in which acetonitrile molecules are dynamically disordered about the N-C-C axis on sub-picosecond timescales, and that this rotational, plastic disorder persists at least to temperatures of 30 K. We anticipate that many cryominerals may have plastic phases at or near Titan surface conditions, and understanding this disorder will be crucial to predicting chemistry on Titan's surface.</description>

      <title>Elementary Flux Modes as CRN Gears for Free Energy Transduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, for a chemical reaction network (CRN) engaged in energy transduction, its optimal operation from a thermodynamic efficiency standpoint is contingent upon its working conditions. Analogously to the bicycle gear system, CRNs have at their disposal several transducing mechanisms characterized by different yields. We highlight the critical role of the CRN's elementary flux modes in determining this "gearing" and their impact on maximizing energy transduction efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce an enzymatically regulated CRN, engineered to autonomously adjust its "gear", thereby optimizing its efficiency under different external conditions.</description>

      <title>Water at negative pressure: Nuclear quantum effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various condensed phases of water, spanning from the liquid state to multiple ice phases, have been systematically investigated under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature to delineate their stability boundaries. This study focuses on probing the mechanical stability of liquid water through path-integral molecular dynamics simulations, employing the q-TIP4P/F potential to model interatomic interactions in flexible water molecules. Temperature and pressure conditions ranging from 250 to 375 K and -0.3 to 1 GPa, respectively, are considered. This comprehensive approach enables a thorough exploration of nuclear quantum effects on various physical properties of water through direct comparisons with classical molecular dynamics results employing the same potential model. Key properties such as molar volume, intramolecular bond length, H--O--H angle, internal and kinetic energy are analyzed, with a specific focus on the effect of tensile stress. Particular attention is devoted to the liquid-gas spinodal pressure, representing the limit of mechanical stability for the liquid phase, at several temperatures. The quantum simulations reveal a spinodal pressure for water of -286 and -236 MPa at temperatures of 250 and 300 K, respectively. At these temperatures, the discernible shifts induced by nuclear quantum motion are quantified at 15 and 10 MPa, respectively. These findings contribute valuable insights into the interplay of quantum effects on the stability of liquid water under diverse thermodynamic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the static entanglement structure in (1+1)-dimensional free Dirac-fermion theory with Lifshitz symmetry and arbitrary integer dynamical critical exponent. This model is different from the one introduced in [Hartmann et al., SciPost Phys. 11, no.2, 031 (2021)] due to a proper treatment of the square Laplace operator. Dirac fermion Lifshitz theory is local as opposed to its scalar counterpart which strongly affects its entanglement structure. We show that there is quantum entanglement across arbitrary subregions in various pure (including the vacuum) and mixed states of this theory for arbitrary integer values of the dynamical critical exponent. Our numerical investigations show that quantum entanglement in this theory is tightly bounded from above. Such a bound and other physical properties of quantum entanglement are carefully explained from the correlation structure in these theories. A generalization to (2+1)-dimensions where the entanglement structure is seriously different is addressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct Narain conformal field theories (CFTs) from quantum subsystem codes, a more comprehensive class of quantum error-correcting codes than quantum stabilizer codes, for qudit systems of prime dimensions. The resulting code CFTs exhibit a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, enabling us to perform the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging to derive their orbifolded and fermionized theories when the symmetry is non-anomalous. We classify a subset of these subsystem code CFTs using weighted oriented graphs and enumerate those with small central charges. Consequently, we identify several bosonic code CFTs self-dual under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold, new supersymmetric code CFTs, and a few fermionic code CFTs with spontaneously broken supersymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sleep is characterized by non-rapid eye movement (nREM) sleep, originating from widespread neuronal synchrony, and REM sleep, with neuronal desynchronization akin to waking behavior. While these were thought to be global brain states, recent research suggests otherwise. Using time-frequency analysis of mesoscopic voltage-sensitive dye recordings of mice in a urethane-anesthetized model of sleep, we find transient neural desynchronization occurring heterogeneously across the cortex within a background of synchronized neural activity, in a manner reminiscent of a critical spreading process and indicative of an "edge-of-synchronization phase" transition.</description>

      <title>Lattice ultrasensitivity produces large gain in E. coli chemosensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: E. coli use a regular lattice of receptors and attached kinases to detect and amplify faint chemical signals. Kinase output is characterized by precise adaptation to a wide range of background ligand levels and large gain in response to small relative changes in ligand concentration. These characteristics are well described by models which achieve their gain through equilibrium cooperativity. But these models are challenged by two experimental results. First, neither adaptation nor large gain are present in receptor binding assays. Second, in cells lacking adaptation machinery, fluctuations can sometimes be enormous, with essentially all kinases transitioning together. Here we introduce a far-from equilibrium model in which receptors gate the spread of activity between neighboring kinases. This model achieves large gain through a mechanism we term lattice ultrasensitivity (LU). In our LU model, kinase and receptor states are separate degrees of freedom, and kinase kinetics are dominated by chemical rates far-from-equilibrium rather than by equilibrium allostery. The model recapitulates the successes of past models, but also matches the challenging experimental findings. Importantly, unlike past lattice critical models, our LU model does not require parameters to be fine tuned for function.</description>

      <title>Canonical Nonlinearity for Coupled Linear Systems</title>

Abstract: For classical discrete system under constant composition, typically reffered to as substitutional alloys, correspondence between interatomic many-body interactions and structure in thermodynamic equilibrium exhibit profound, complicated nonlinearity (canonical nonlinearity). Our recent studies clarify that the nonlinearity can be reasonablly described both by specially-introduced vector field on configuration space and by corresponding diverngence on statistical manifold. While these studies shown that the correlation between vector field and local contribution to the divergence can be well characterized by coordination number for a set of selected structural degree of freedoms (SDFs), it is unclear whether the correlations between different set of SDFs purely comes from the difference in covariance matrix of CDOS (determined by coordination number) or additional information such as the shape of CP should be further required. To clarify the problem, we here propose simplified model of the so-called Coupled Linear System (CLS), which consists of the m-mixture of the configurational density of states for linear systems. We demonstrate that the CLS can reasonablly capture the changes in the local nonlinearity w.r.t. the changes in coordination number. Through the dynamic mode decomposition on CLS, we elucidate that there exists two dominant modes to capture the changes in the nonlinearity, where the one uniformly evolves from random to ordered configuration, and the another individually evolves around random, partially ordered and ordered configuration.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17675v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological insulators have been studied intensively over the last decades. Earlier research focused on Hermitian Hamiltonians, but recently, peculiar and interesting properties were found by introducing non-Hermiticity. In this work, we apply a quantum geometric approach to various Hermitian and non-Hermitian versions of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. We find that this method allows one to correctly identify different topological phases and topological phase transitions for all SSH models, but only when using the metric tensor containing both left and right eigenvectors. Whereas the quantum geometry of Hermitian systems is Riemannian, introducing non-Hermiticity leads to pseudo-Riemannian and complex geometries, thus significantly generalizing from the quantum geometries studied thus far. One remarkable example of this is the mathematical agreement between topological phase transition curves and lightlike paths in general relativity, suggesting a possibility of simulating space-times in non-Hermitian systems. We find that the metric in non-Hermitian phases degenerates in such a way that it effectively reduces the dimensionality of the quantum geometry by one. This implies that within linear response theory, one can perturb the system by a particular change of parameters while maintaining a zero excitation rate.</description>

      <title>Wehrl Entropy and Entanglement Complexity of Quantum Spin Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wehrl entropy of a quantum state is the entropy of the coherent-state distribution function (Husimi function), and is non-zero even for pure states. We investigate the Wehrl entropy for $N$ spin-1/2 particles with respect to SU(2)$^{\otimes N}$ coherent states (i.e., the direct products of spin coherent states of each particle). We focus on: (1) The statistical interpretation of this Wehrl entropy. (2) The relationship between the Wehrl entropy and quantum entanglement. For (1), despite the coherent states not forming a group of orthonormal bases, we prove that the Wehrl entropy can still be interpreted as the entropy of a probability distribution with clear physical meaning. For (2), we numerically calculate the Wehrl entropy of various entangled pure states with particle number $2\leq N\leq 20$. Our results show that for the large-$N$ ($N\gtrsim 10$) systems the Wehrl entropy of the highly chaotic entangled states are much larger than that of the regular ones (e.g., the GHZ state). These results, together with the fact that the Wehrl entropy is invariant under local unitary transformations, indicate that the Wehrl entropy can reflect the complexity of the quantum entanglement (entanglement complexity) of many-body pure states, as A. Sugita proposed directly from the definitions of the Husimi function and Wehrl entropy (Jour. Phys. A 36, 9081 (2003)). Furthermore, the Wehrl entropy per particle can serve as a quantitative description of this complexity. We further show that the many-body pure entangled states can be classified into three types, according to the behaviors of the Wehrl entropy per particle in the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$, with the states of each type having very different entanglement complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spreading of quantum information in a recently introduced family of brickwork quantum circuits that generalises the dual-unitary class. These circuits are unitary in time, while their spatial dynamics is unitary only in a restricted subspace. First, we show that local operators spread at the speed of light as in dual-unitary circuits, i.e., the butterfly velocity takes the maximal value allowed by the geometry of the circuit. Then, we prove that the entanglement spreading can still be characterised exactly for a family of compatible initial states (in fact, for an extension of the compatible family of dual-unitary circuits) and that the asymptotic entanglement slope is again independent on the R\'enyi index. Remarkably, however, we find that the entanglement velocity is generically smaller than one. We use these properties to find a closed-form expression for the entanglement membrane in these circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling, hyperscaling and finite-size scaling were long considered problematic in theories of critical phenomena in high dimensions. The scaling relations themselves form a model-independent structure that any model-specific theory must adhere to, and they are accounted for by the simple principle of homogeneity. Finite-size scaling is similarly founded on the fundamental idea that only two length scales enter the game -- namely system length and correlation length. While all scaling relations are quite satisfactory for multitudes of physical systems in low dimensions, one fails in high dimensions...</description>

      <title>On the Definition of Velocity in Discrete-Time, Stochastic Langevin Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically develop beneficial and practical velocity measures for accurate and efficient statistical simulations of the Langevin equation with direct applications to computational statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics sampling. Recognizing that the existing velocity measures for the most statistically accurate discrete-time Verlet-type algorithms are inconsistent with the simulated configurational coordinate, we seek to create and analyze new velocity companions that both improve existing methods as well as offer practical options for implementation in existing computer codes. The work is based on the set of GJ methods that, of all methods, for all time steps within the stability criteria correctly reproduces the most basic statistical features of a Langevin system; namely correct Boltzmann distribution for harmonic potentials and correct transport in the form of drift and diffusion for linear potentials. Several new accompanying velocities exhibiting correct drift are identified, and we expand on an earlier conclusion that only half-step velocities can exhibit correct, time-step independent Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions. Specific practical and efficient algorithms are given in familiar forms, and these are used to numerically validate the analytically derived expectations.</description>

      <title>Heat-based circuits using quantum rectification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With increased power consumption of modern computer components, heat-based circuitry has become ever more relevant due to a lower power expense to process logic bits of information. In heat-based circuits, computations are performed by driving heat currents through a circuit using a temperature difference. Utilizing harmonic oscillators and three-level quantum rectifiers as base components, we study three different heat-based circuits: a series configuration of diodes, a parallel configuration of diodes, and a diode bridge rectifier. We demonstrate the required functionality of each circuit for use as heat-based analogues of standard electronic components. Furthermore, the diode bridge rectifier is found to give consistent sign of the output bias independent of the input bias thus rectifying the input. Our results prove the theoretical feasibility of combining heat current components into heat-based circuits. The three circuits should be realizable using several of the current quantum technology platforms.</description>

      <title>Short-time expansion of one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations with heterogeneous diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a short-time expansion for one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations with spatially dependent diffusion coefficients, derived from stochastic processes with Gaussian white noise, for general values of the discretization parameter $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$ of the stochastic integral. The kernel of the Fokker-Planck equation (the propagator) can be expressed as a product of a singular and a regular term. While the singular term can be given in closed form, the regular term can be computed from a Taylor expansion whose coefficients obey simple ordinary differential equations. We illustrate the application of our approach with examples taken from statistical physics and biophysics. Further, we show how our formalism allows to define a class of stochastic equations which can be treated exactly. The convergence of the expansion cannot be guaranteed independently from the discretization parameter $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture concerning the Fisher--Widom line and the line of vanishing excess isothermal compressibility in simple fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the statistical mechanics approach to liquid-state theory, understanding the role of the intermolecular potential in determining thermodynamic and structural properties is crucial. The Fisher--Widom (FW) line, which separates regions in the temperature vs density plane where the decay of the total correlation function is monotonic or oscillatory, provides insights into the dominance of the attractive or repulsive part of the interactions. Stopper et al. have recently conjectured [J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{151}, 014501 (2019)] that the line of vanishing excess isothermal compressibility approximates the FW line in simple fluids. Here, we investigate this conjecture using the Jagla potential and also explore the line of vanishing excess pressure. We employ theoretical approximations and Monte Carlo simulations to study one-dimensional and three-dimensional systems. While exact results for the one-dimensional case do not support the conjecture, our Monte Carlo simulations for the three-dimensional fluid validate it. Our findings not only contribute to the understanding of the relationship between the three transition lines but also provide valuable insights into the thermodynamic and structural behaviour of simple fluids.</description>

      <title>Generating-functional analysis of random Lotka-Volterra systems: A step-by-step guide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides what is hopefully a self-contained set of notes describing the detailed steps of a generating-functional analysis of systems of generalised Lotka-Volterra equations with random interaction coefficients. Nothing in these notes is original, instead the generating-functional method (also known as the Martin-Siggia-Rose-DeDominic-Janssen formalism) and the resulting dynamic mean field theories have been used for the study of disordered systems and spin glasses for decades. But it is hard to find unifying sources which would allow a beginner to learn step-by-step how these methods can be used. My aim is to provide such a source. Most of the calculations are specific to generalised Lotka-Volterra systems, but much can be transferred to disordered systems in more general.</description>

      <title>Electronic thermal resistivity and quasi-particle collision cross-section in semi-metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron-electron collisions lead to a T-square component in the electrical resistivity of Fermi liquids. The case of liquid $^3$He illustrates that the \textit{thermal} resitivity of a Fermi liquid has a T-square term, expressed in m$\cdot$W$^{-1}$. Its natural units are $\hbar/k_FE_F^2$. Here, we present a high-resolution study of the thermal conductivity in bismuth, employing magnetic field to extract the tiny electronic component of the total thermal conductivity and resolving signals as small as $\approx 60 \mu$K. We find that the electronic thermal resistivity follows a T-square temperature dependence with a prefactor twice larger than the electric T-square prefactor. Adding this information to what has been known for other semi-metals, we find that the prefactor of the T-square thermal resistivity scales with the square of the inverse of the Fermi temperature, implying that the dimensionless fermion-fermion collision cross-section is roughly proportional to the Fermi wavelength, indicating that it is not simply set by the strength of the Coulomb interaction.</description>
