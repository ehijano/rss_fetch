      <title>$L_\textrm{dT}$: An ionospheric activity index based on distributions in GNSS-derived TEC rates of change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many aspects of our societies now depend upon satellite telecommunications, such as those requiring Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). GNSS is based on radio waves that propagate through the ionosphere and experience complicated propagation effects caused by inhomogeneities in its electron density. The Earth's ionosphere forms part of the solar-terrestrial environment, and its state is determined by the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of its electron density. It varies in response to the "space weather" combination of solar activity and geomagnetic conditions. Notably, the radio waves used in satellite telecommunications suffer due to the dispersive nature of the ionospheric plasma.
  Scales and indices that summarise the state of the solar-terrestrial environment due to solar activity and geomagnetic conditions already exist. However, the response of the ionosphere to active geomagnetic conditions, its geoeffectiveness, and its likely impact on systems and services are not encapsulated by these. This is due to the ionosphere's intrinsic day-to-day variability, persistent seasonal patterns, and because radio wave measurements of the ionosphere depend upon many factors.
  Here we develop a novel index that describes the state of the ionosphere during specific space weather conditions. It is based on propagation disturbances in GNSS signals, and is able to characterise the spatio-temporal evolution of ionospheric disturbances in near real time. This new scale encapsulates day-to-day variability, seasonal patterns, and the geo-effective response of the ionosphere to disturbed space weather conditions; and can be applied to data from any GNSS network. It is intended that this new scale will be utilised by agencies providing space weather services, as well as by service operators to appreciate the current conditions in the ionosphere, thus informing their operations.</description>

      <title>Topological ignition of the stealth coronal mass ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of hot topics in the solar physics are the so-called 'stealth' coronal mass ejections (CME), which are not associated with any appreciable energy release events in the lower corona, such as the solar flares. It is sometimes assumed that these phenomena might be produced by some specific physical mechanism, but no particular suggestions were put forward. It is the aim of the present paper to show that a promising explanation of the stealth CMEs can be based on the so-called 'topological' ignition of the magnetic reconnection. As a theoretical basis, we employ the Gorbachev-Kel'ner-Somov-Shvarts (GKSS) model of formation of the magnetic null point, which is produced by a specific superposition of the remote sources (sunspots) rather than by the local current systems. As follows from our numerical simulations, the topological model explains very well all basic features of the stealth CMEs: (i) the plasma eruption develops without an appreciable heat release from the spot of reconnection, i.e., without the solar flare; (ii) the spot of reconnection (magnetic null point) can be formed far away from the location of the magnetic field sources; (iii) the trajectories of eruption are strongly curved, which can explain observability of CMEs generated behind the solar limb. Therefore, the topological ignition of magnetic reconnection should be interesting both by itself, as a novel physical phenomenon, and as a prognostic tool for forecasting the stealth CMEs and the resulting unexpected geomagnetic storms.</description>

      <title>A Self-Supervised Framework for Space Object Behaviour Characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation Models, pre-trained on large unlabelled datasets before task-specific fine-tuning, are increasingly being applied to specialised domains. Recent examples include ClimaX for climate and Clay for satellite Earth observation, but a Foundation Model for Space Object Behavioural Analysis has not yet been developed. As orbital populations grow, automated methods for characterising space object behaviour are crucial for space safety. We present a Space Safety and Sustainability Foundation Model focusing on space object behavioural analysis using light curves (LCs). We implemented a Perceiver-Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, pre-trained with self-supervised reconstruction and masked reconstruction on 227,000 LCs from the MMT-9 observatory. The VAE enables anomaly detection, motion prediction, and LC generation. We fine-tuned the model for anomaly detection &amp; motion prediction using two independent LC simulators (CASSANDRA and GRIAL respectively), using CAD models of boxwing, Sentinel-3, SMOS, and Starlink platforms. Our pre-trained model achieved a reconstruction error of 0.01%, identifying potentially anomalous light curves through reconstruction difficulty. After fine-tuning, the model scored 88% and 82% accuracy, with 0.90 and 0.95 ROC AUC scores respectively in both anomaly detection and motion mode prediction (sun-pointing, spin, etc.). Analysis of high-confidence anomaly predictions on real data revealed distinct patterns including characteristic object profiles and satellite glinting. Here, we demonstrate how self-supervised learning can simultaneously enable anomaly detection, motion prediction, and synthetic data generation from rich representations learned in pre-training. Our work therefore supports space safety and sustainability through automated monitoring and simulation capabilities.</description>
