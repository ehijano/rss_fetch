      <title>Communications Performance Analysis of Wireless Multiple Access Channel with Specially Correlated Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From both practical and theoretical viewpoints, performance analysis of communication systems using information-theoretic results is very important. In this study, first, we obtain a general achievable rate for a two-user wireless multiple access channel (MAC) with specially correlated sources as a more general version for continuous alphabet MACs, by extending the known discrete alphabet results to the wireless continuous alphabet version. Next, the impact of wireless channel coefficients correlation on the performance metrics using Copula theory, as the most convenient way for describing the dependence between several variables, is investigated. By applying the Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM) Copula function, we obtain closed-form expressions for the outage probability (OP) under positive/negative dependence conditions. It is shown that the fading correlation improves the OP for a negative dependence structure. Specifically, whenever the dependence structure tends to negative values, the OP decreases and the efficiency of the channel increases. Finally, the efficiency of the analytical results is illustrated numerically.</description>

      <title>Information Limits of Joint Community Detection and Finite Group Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging problem of joint community detection and group synchronization, with applications in signal processing and machine learning, has been extensively studied in recent years. Previous research has predominantly focused on a statistical model that extends the stochastic block model~(SBM) by incorporating additional group transformations. In its simplest form, the model randomly generates a network of size $n$ that consists of two equal-sized communities, where each node $i$ is associated with an unknown group element $g_i^* \in G_M$ for some finite group $G_M$ of order $M$. The connectivity between nodes follows a probability $p$ if they belong to the same community, and a probability $q$ otherwise. Moreover, a group transformation $g_{ij} \in G_M$ is observed on each edge $(i,j)$, where $g_{ij} = g_i^* - g_j^*$ if nodes $i$ and $j$ are within the same community, and $g_{ij} \sim \text{Uniform}(G_M)$ otherwise. The goal of the problem is to recover both the underlying communities and group elements. Under this setting, when $p = a\log n /n$ and $q = b\log n /n $ with $a, b &gt; 0$, we establish the following sharp information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery by maximum likelihood estimation~(MLE): $$ (i):\enspace \frac{a + b}{2} -\sqrt{\frac{ab}{M}} &gt; 1 \quad \text{and} \quad (ii):\enspace a &gt; 2$$ where the exact recovery of communities is possible only if $(i)$ is satisfied, and the recovery of group elements is achieved only if both $(i)$ and $(ii)$ are satisfied. Our theory indicates the recovery of communities greatly benefits from the extra group transformations. Also, it demonstrates a significant performance gap exists between the MLE and all the existing approaches, including algorithms based on semidefinite programming and spectral methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable code is an error-correcting code such that, for each coordinate $c_i$ of a codeword, there exists a set of at most $r+ \delta -1$ coordinates containing $c_i$ which allow us to correct any $\delta -1$ erasures in that set. These codes are useful for avoiding loss of information in large scale distributed and cloud storage systems.
  In this paper, we introduce quantum $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes and give a necessary and sufficient condition for a quantum stabilizer code $Q(C)$ to be $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable. Our condition depends only on the puncturing and shortening at suitable sets of both the symplectic self-orthogonal code $C$ used for constructing $Q(C)$ and its symplectic dual $C^{\perp_s}$.
  When a quantum stabilizer code comes from a Hermitian or Euclidean dual-containing code, and under an extra condition, we show that there is an equivalence between the classical and quantum concepts of $(r,\delta)$-local recoverability. A Singleton-like bound is stated in this case and examples of optimal stabilizer $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes are given.</description>

      <title>Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks: Their Channel Model and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given their extensive geographic coverage, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are envisioned to find their way into next-generation (6G) wireless communications. This paper explores space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) leveraging LEOs to support terrestrial and non-terrestrial users. We first propose a practical satellite-ground channel model that incorporates five key aspects: 1) the small-scale fading characterized by the Shadowed-Rician distribution in terms of the Rician factor K, 2) the path loss effect of bending rays due to atmospheric refraction, 3) the molecular absorption modelled by the Beer-Lambert law, 4) the Doppler effects including the Earth's rotation, and 5) the impact of weather conditions according to the International Telecommunication Union Recommendations (ITU-R). Harnessing the proposed model, we analyze the long-term performance of the SAGIN considered. Explicitly, the closed-form expressions of both the outage probability and of the ergodic rates are derived. Additionally, the upper bounds of bit-error rates and of the Goodput are investigated. The numerical results yield the following insights: 1) The shadowing effect and the ratio between the line-of-sight and scattering components can be conveniently modeled by the factors of K and m in the proposed Shadowed-Rician small-scale fading model. 2) The atmospheric refraction has a modest effect on the path loss. 3) When calculating the transmission distance of waves, Earth's curvature and its geometric relationship with the satellites must be considered, particularly at small elevation angles. 3) High-frequency carriers suffer from substantial path loss, and 4) the Goodput metric is eminently suitable for characterizing the performance of different coding as well as modulation methods and of the estimation error of the Doppler effects.</description>

      <title>Optimal Error Analysis of Channel Estimation for IRS-assisted MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a new and promising technology capable of configuring the wireless environment favorably, channel estimation for IRS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems has garnered extensive attention in recent years. While various algorithms have been proposed to address this challenge, there is a lack of rigorous theoretical error analysis. This paper aims to address this gap by providing theoretical guarantees in terms of stable recovery of channel matrices for noisy measurements. We begin by establishing the equivalence between IRS-assisted MIMO systems and a compact tensor train (TT)-based tensor-on-tensor (ToT) regression. Building on this equivalence, we then investigate the restricted isometry property (RIP) for complex-valued subgaussian measurements. Our analysis reveals that successful recovery hinges on the relationship between the number of user terminals (in the uplink scenario) or base stations (in the downlink scenario) and the number of time slots during which channel matrices remain invariant. Utilizing the RIP condition, we analyze the theoretical recovery error for the solution to a constrained least-squares optimization problem, including upper error bound and minimax lower bound, demonstrating that the error decreases inversely with the number of time slots and increases proportionally with the number of unknown elements in the channel matrices. In addition, we extend our error analysis to two more specialized IRS-assisted MIMO systems, incorporating low-rank channel matrices or an unknown IRS. Furthermore, we explore a multi-hop IRS scheme and analyze the corresponding recovery errors. Finally, we introduce and implement two nonconvex optimization algorithms--alternating least squares and alternating gradient descent--to validate our conclusions through simulations.</description>

      <title>Anonymous Shamir's Secret Sharing via Reed-Solomon Codes Against Permutations, Insertions, and Deletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the performance of Reed-Solomon codes against an adversary that first permutes the symbols of the codeword and then performs insertions and deletions. This adversarial model is motivated by the recent interest in fully anonymous secret-sharing schemes [EBG+24],[BGI+24]. A fully anonymous secret-sharing scheme has two key properties: (1) the identities of the participants are not revealed before the secret is reconstructed, and (2) the shares of any unauthorized set of participants are uniform and independent. In particular, the shares of any unauthorized subset reveal no information about the identity of the participants who hold them.
  In this work, we first make the following observation: Reed-Solomon codes that are robust against an adversary that permutes the codeword and then deletes symbols from the permuted codeword can be used to construct ramp threshold secret-sharing schemes that are fully anonymous. Then, we show that over large enough fields of size, there are $[n,k]$ Reed-Solomon codes that are robust against an adversary that arbitrary permutes the codeword and then performs $n-2k+1$ insertions and deletions to the permuted codeword. This implies the existence of a $(k-1, 2k-1, n)$ ramp secret sharing scheme that is fully anonymous. That is, any $k-1$ shares reveal nothing about the secret, and, moreover, this set of shares reveals no information about the identities of the players who hold them. On the other hand, any $2k-1$ shares can reconstruct the secret without revealing their identities. We also provide explicit constructions of such schemes based on previous works on Reed-Solomon codes correcting insertions and deletions. The constructions in this paper give the first gap threshold secret-sharing schemes that satisfy the strongest notion of anonymity together with perfect reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming Design for RSMA-enabled Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enable high data rates and sensing resolutions, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks leverage extremely large antenna arrays and high frequencies, extending the Rayleigh distance and making near-field (NF) spherical wave propagation dominant. This unlocks numerous spatial degrees of freedom, raising the challenge of optimizing them for communication and sensing tradeoffs. To this end, we propose a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-based NF-ISAC transmit scheme utilizing hybrid digital-analog antennas. RSMA enhances interference management, while a variable number of dedicated sensing beams adds beamforming flexibility. The objective is to maximize the minimum communication rate while ensuring multi-target sensing performance by jointly optimizing receive filters, analog and digital beamformers, common rate allocation, and the sensing beam count. To address uncertainty in sensing beam allocation, a rank-zero solution reconstruction method demonstrates that dedicated sensing beams are unnecessary for NF multi-target detection. A penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based double-loop algorithm is introduced, employing weighted minimum mean-squared error (WMMSE) and quadratic transforms to reformulate communication and sensing rates. Simulations reveal that the proposed scheme: 1) Achieves performance comparable to fully digital beamforming with fewer RF chains, (2) Maintains NF multi-target detection without compromising communication rates, and 3) Significantly outperforms space division multiple access (SDMA) and far-field ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Circular-shift-based Vector Linear Network Coding and Its Application to Array Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular-shift linear network coding (LNC) is a class of vector LNC with local encoding kernels selected from cyclic permutation matrices, so that it has low coding complexities. However, it is insufficient to exactly achieve the capacity of a multicast network, so the data units transmitted along the network need to contain redundant symbols, which affects the transmission efficiency. In this paper, as a variation of circular-shift LNC, we introduce a new class of vector LNC over arbitrary GF($p$), called circular-shift-based vector LNC, which is shown to be able to exactly achieve the capacity of a multicast network. The set of local encoding kernels in circular-shift-based vector LNC is nontrivially designed such that it is closed under multiplication by elements in itself. It turns out that the coding complexity of circular-shift-based vector LNC is comparable to and, in some cases, lower than that of circular-shift LNC.
  The new results in circular-shift-based vector LNC further facilitates us to characterize and design Vandermonde circulant maximum distance separable (MDS) array codes, which are built upon the structure of Vandermonde matrices and circular-shift operations. We prove that for $r \geq 2$, the largest possible $k$ for an $L$-dimensional $(k+r, k)$ Vandermonde circulant $p$-ary MDS array code is $p^{m_L}-1$, where $L$ is an integer co-prime with $p$, and $m_L$ represents the multiplicative order of $p$ modulo $L$. For $r = 2, 3$, we introduce two new types of $(k+r, k)$ $p$-ary array codes that achieves the largest $k = p^{m_L}-1$. For the special case that $p = 2$, we propose scheduling encoding algorithms for the 2 new codes, so that the encoding complexity not only asymptotically approaches the optimal $2$ XORs per original data bit, but also slightly outperforms the encoding complexity of other known Vandermonde circulant MDS array codes with $k = p^{m_L}-1$.</description>

      <title>Deep Joint Source Channel Coding for Secure End-to-End Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN)-based joint source and channel coding is proposed for end-to-end secure image transmission against multiple eavesdroppers. Both scenarios of colluding and non-colluding eavesdroppers are considered. Instead of idealistic assumptions of perfectly known and i.i.d. source and channel distributions, the proposed scheme assumes unknown source and channel statistics. The goal is to transmit images with minimum distortion, while simultaneously preventing eavesdroppers from inferring private attributes of images. Simultaneously generalizing the ideas of privacy funnel and wiretap coding, a multi-objective optimization framework is expressed that characterizes the trade-off between image reconstruction quality and information leakage to eavesdroppers, taking into account the structural similarity index (SSIM) for improving the perceptual quality of image reconstruction. Extensive experiments over CIFAR-10 and CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) datasets, together with ablation studies are provided to highlight the performance gain in terms of SSIM, adversarial accuracy, and cross-entropy metric compared with benchmarks. Experiments show that the proposed scheme restrains the adversarially-trained eavesdroppers from intercepting privatized data for both cases of eavesdropping a common secret, as well as the case in which eavesdroppers are interested in different secrets. Furthermore, useful insights on the privacy-utility trade-off are also provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Revolutionary sixth-generation wireless communications technologies and applications, notably digital twin networks (DTN), connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), zero-touch networks, industry 5.0, and healthcare 5.0, are driving next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs). These technologies generate massive data, requiring swift transmission and trillions of device connections, fueling the need for sophisticated next-generation multiple access (NGMA) schemes. NGMA enables massive connectivity in the 6G era, optimizing NGWN operations beyond current multiple access (MA) schemes. This survey showcases non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) as NGMA's frontrunner, exploring What has NOMA delivered?, What is NOMA providing?, and What lies ahead?. We present NOMA variants, fundamental operations, and applicability in multi-antenna systems, machine learning, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), cognitive radio networks (CRN), integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), terahertz networks, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Additionally, we explore NOMA's interplay with state-of-the-art wireless technologies, highlighting its advantages and technical challenges. Finally, we unveil NOMA research trends in the 6G era and provide design recommendations and future perspectives for NOMA as the leading NGMA solution for NGWNs.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS Assisted SWIPT Systems: Active or Passive?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system is investigated. Both active and passive STAR-RISs are considered. Passive STAR-RISs can be cost-efficiently fabricated to large aperture sizes with significant near-field regions, but the design flexibility is limited by the coupled phase-shifts. Active STAR-RISs can further amplify signals and have independent phase-shifts, but their aperture sizes are relatively small due to the high cost. To characterize and compare their performance, a power consumption minimization problem is formulated by jointly designing the beamforming at the access point (AP) and the STAR-RIS, subject to both the power and information quality-of-service requirements. To solve the resulting highly-coupled non-convex problem, the original problem is first decomposed into simpler subproblems and then an alternating optimization framework is proposed. For the passive STAR-RIS, the coupled phase-shift constraint is tackled by employing a vector-driven weight penalty method. While for the active STAR-RIS, the independent phase-shift is optimized with AP beamforming via matrix-driven semidefinite programming, and the amplitude matrix is updated using convex optimization techniques in each iteration. Numerical results show that: 1) given the same aperture sizes, the active STAR-RIS exhibits superior performance over the passive one when the aperture size is small, but the performance gap decreases with the increase in aperture size; and 2) given identical power budgets, the passive STAR-RIS is generally preferred, whereas the active STAR-RIS typically suffers performance loss for balancing between the hardware power and the amplification power.</description>

      <title>Optimal Multi-Level ASK Modulations for RIS-Assisted Communications with Energy-Based Noncoherent Reception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of one- and two-sided amplitude shift keying (ASK) modulations in noncoherent single-input single-output (SISO) wireless communication systems assisted by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Novel noncoherent receiver structures are proposed based on the energy of the received symbol and the choice of the modulation scheme for data transmission. The system's performance is assessed in terms of the symbol error rate (SER) and an optimization framework is proposed to determine the most effective one- and two-sided ASKs to minimize the SER, while adhering to average a transmit power constraint. Two scenarios based on the availability of the statistical characteristics of the wireless channel are explored: a) the transceiver pair has complete knowledge of the channel statistics, and b) both end nodes possess knowledge of the statistics of the channel gain up to its fourth moment, and novel algorithms are developed to obtain optimal ASKs for both of them. Extensive numerical evaluations are presented showcasing that there exists a threshold signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) above which the optimal ASKs outperform the traditional equispaced ASKs. The dependencies of the SER performance and the SNR threshold on various system parameters are assessed, providing design guidelines for RIS-assisted noncoherent wireless communication systems with multi-level ASK modulations.</description>

      <title>Growth-Optimal E-Variables and an extension to the multivariate Csisz\'ar-Sanov-Chernoff Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider growth-optimal e-variables with maximal e-power, both in an absolute and relative sense, for simple null hypotheses for a $d$-dimensional random vector, and multivariate composite alternatives represented as a set of $d$-dimensional means $\meanspace_1$. These include, among others, the set of all distributions with mean in $\meanspace_1$, and the exponential family generated by the null restricted to means in $\meanspace_1$. We show how these optimal e-variables are related to Csisz\'ar-Sanov-Chernoff bounds, first for the case that $\meanspace_1$ is convex (these results are not new; we merely reformulate them) and then for the case that $\meanspace_1$ `surrounds' the null hypothesis (these results are new).</description>

      <title>Private Semantic Communications with Separate Blind Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a semantic communication problem with a privacy constraint where an encoder consists of two separate parts, e.g., encoder 1 and encoder 2. The first encoder has access to information source $X=(X_1,\ldots,X_N)$ which is arbitrarily correlated with private data $S$. The private data is not accessible by encoder 1, however, the second encoder has access to it and the output of encoder 1. A user asks for a task $h(X)$ and the first encoder designs the semantic of the information source $f(X)$ to disclose. Due to the privacy constraints $f(X)$ can not be revealed directly to the user and the second encoder applies a statistical privacy mechanism to produce disclosed data $U$. Here, we assume that encoder 2 has no access to the task and the design of the disclosed data is based on the semantic and the private data.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach where $U$ is produced by solving a privacy-utility trade-off based on the semantic and the private data. We design $U$ utilizing different methods such as using extended versions of the Functional Representation Lemma and the Strong Functional Representation Lemma. We evaluate our design by computing the utility attained by the user. Finally, we study and compare the obtained bounds in a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Group Testing with General Correlation Using Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group testing, a problem with diverse applications across multiple disciplines, traditionally assumes independence across nodes' states. Recent research, however, focuses on real-world scenarios that often involve correlations among nodes, challenging the simplifying assumptions made in existing models. In this work, we consider a comprehensive model for arbitrary statistical correlation among nodes' states. To capture and leverage these correlations effectively, we model the problem by hypergraphs, inspired by [GLS22], augmented by a probability mass function on the hyper-edges.
  Using this model, we first design a novel greedy adaptive algorithm capable of conducting informative tests and dynamically updating the distribution. Performance analysis provides upper bounds on the number of tests required, which depend solely on the entropy of the underlying probability distribution and the average number of infections. We demonstrate that the algorithm recovers or improves upon all previously known results for group testing settings with correlation. Additionally, we provide families of graphs where the algorithm is order-wise optimal and give examples where the algorithm or its analysis is not tight. We then generalize the proposed framework of group testing with general correlation in two directions, namely noisy group testing and semi-non-adaptive group testing. In both settings, we provide novel theoretical bounds on the number of tests required.</description>

      <title>Wireless communications with user equipment mounted Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In traditional Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) systems, the RIS is mounted on stationary structures like buildings, walls, or posts. They have shown promising results in enhancing the performance of wireless systems like capacity and MSE in poor channel conditions. The traditional RIS is a monolithic structure containing a large number of reflecting elements (passive or active). In this paper, we propose the idea of mounting a small number of RIS elements (usually between 2 to 4 ) on user equipment (UEs) like mobile phones, laptops, and tablets, to name a few. A joint coordinated optimization of phase shifts of all the passive RIS elements on the participating UEs is envisioned to enhance the performance of wireless communication between an intended transmitter and receiver in the MSE sense. Given that the RIS elements are mounted on the UEs, the challenging channel estimation problem with RIS is significantly simplified. For the case when there is a line-of-sight (LOS) channel and with a large number of participating RIS-mounted UEs, the LOS is converted into a multipath-rich-scattering channel even for millimeter wave and Terahertz operating ranges that enable higher spatial multiplexing gains, thereby significantly improving the MSE performance compared to traditional RIS channels. We support the above claims using simulations.</description>

      <title>A generalisation of bent vectors for Butson Hadamard matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An $n\times n$ complex matrix $M$ with entries in the $k^{\textrm{th}}$ roots of unity which satisfies $MM^{\ast} = nI_{n}$ is called a Butson Hadamard matrix. While a matrix with entries in the $k^{\textrm{th}}$ roots typically does not have an eigenvector with entries in the same set, such vectors and their generalisations turn out to have multiple applications. A bent vector for $M$ satisfies $M{\bf x} = \lambda {\bf y}$ where ${\bf x}$ and ${\bf y}$ have entries in the $k^{\textrm{th}}$ roots of unity. In this paper we study in particular the special case that ${\bf y} = \overline{\bf x}$, which we call a conjugate self-dual bent vector for $M$.
  Using techniques from algebraic number theory, we prove some order conditions and non-existence results for self-dual and conjugate self-dual bent vectors; using tensor constructions and Bush-type matrices we give explicit examples. We conclude with an application to the covering radius of certain non-linear codes generalising the Reed Muller codes.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Non-Terrestrial Networks: Towards Global and Ubiquitous 6G Connectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT)-2030 framework recently adopted by the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) envisions 6G networks to deliver intelligent, seamless connectivity that supports reliable, sustainable, and resilient communications. Recent developments in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Releases 17-19, particularly within the Radio Access Network (RAN)4 working group addressing satellite and cellular spectrum sharing and RAN2 enhancing New Radio (NR)/IoT for NTN, highlight the critical role NTN is set to play in the evolution of 6G standards. The integration of advanced signal processing, edge and cloud computing, and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and aerial platforms, such as Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and high-, medium-, and low-altitude platform stations, has revolutionized the convergence of space, aerial, and Terrestrial Networks (TN). Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered deployments for NTN and NTN-IoT, combined with Next Generation Multiple Access (NGMA) technologies, have dramatically reshaped global connectivity. This tutorial paper provides a comprehensive exploration of emerging NTN-based 6G wireless networks, covering vision, alignment with 5G-Advanced and 6G standards, key principles, trends, challenges, real-world applications, and novel problem solving frameworks. It examines essential enabling technologies like AI for NTN (LEO satellites and aerial platforms), DRL, edge computing for NTN, AI for NTN trajectory optimization, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)-enhanced NTN, and robust Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) beamforming. Furthermore, it addresses interference management through NGMA, including Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) for NTN, and the use of aerial platforms for access, relay, and fronthaul/backhaul connectivity.</description>

      <title>L3TC: Leveraging RWKV for Learned Lossless Low-Complexity Text Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16642v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based probabilistic models can be combined with an entropy coder for data compression. However, due to the high complexity of learning-based models, their practical application as text compressors has been largely overlooked. To address this issue, our work focuses on a low-complexity design while maintaining compression performance. We introduce a novel Learned Lossless Low-complexity Text Compression method (L3TC). Specifically, we conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that RWKV models achieve the fastest decoding speed with a moderate compression ratio, making it the most suitable backbone for our method. Second, we propose an outlier-aware tokenizer that uses a limited vocabulary to cover frequent tokens while allowing outliers to bypass the prediction and encoding. Third, we propose a novel high-rank reparameterization strategy that enhances the learning capability during training without increasing complexity during inference. Experimental results validate that our method achieves 48% bit saving compared to gzip compressor. Besides, L3TC offers compression performance comparable to other learned compressors, with a 50x reduction in model parameters. More importantly, L3TC is the fastest among all learned compressors, providing real-time decoding speeds up to megabytes per second. Our code is available at https://github.com/alipay/L3TC-leveraging-rwkv-for-learned-lossless-low-complexity-text-compression.git.</description>

      <title>Empirical Coordination of Separable Quantum Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of empirical coordination for quantum correlations. Quantum mechanics enables the calculation of probabilities for experimental outcomes, emphasizing statistical averages rather than detailed descriptions of individual events. Empirical coordination is thus a natural framework for quantum systems. Focusing on the cascade network, the optimal coordination rates are established, indicating the minimal resources required to simulate on average a quantum state. As we consider a network with classical communication links, superposition cannot be maintained, hence the quantum correlations are separable (i.e., a convex combination of product states). This precludes entanglement. Providing the users with shared randomness, before communication begins, does not affect the optimal rates for empirical coordination. We begin with a rate characterization for a basic two-node network, and then generalize to a cascade network. The special case of a network with an isolated node is considered as well. The results can be further generalized to other networks as our analysis includes a generic achievability scheme. The optimal rate formula involves optimization over a collection of state extensions. This is a unique feature of the quantum setting, as the classical parallel does not include optimization. As demonstrated through examples, the performance depends heavily on the choice of decomposition. We further discuss the consequences of our results for quantum cooperative games.</description>

      <title>FedMeld: A Model-dispersal Federated Learning Framework for Space-ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To bridge the digital divide, the space-ground integrated networks (SGINs), which will be a key component of the six-generation (6G) mobile networks, are expected to deliver artificial intelligence (AI) services to every corner of the world. One mission of SGINs is to support federated learning (FL) at a global scale. However, existing space-ground integrated FL frameworks involve ground stations or costly inter-satellite links, entailing excessive training latency and communication costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose an infrastructure-free federated learning framework based on a model dispersal (FedMeld) strategy, which exploits periodic movement patterns and store-carry-forward capabilities of satellites to enable parameter mixing across large-scale geographical regions. We theoretically show that FedMeld leads to global model convergence and quantify the effects of round interval and mixing ratio between adjacent areas on its learning performance. Based on the theoretical results, we formulate a joint optimization problem to design the staleness control and mixing ratio (SC-MR) for minimizing the training loss. By decomposing the problem into sequential SC and MR subproblems without compromising the optimality, we derive the round interval solution in a closed form and the mixing ratio in a semi-closed form to achieve the \textit{optimal} latency-accuracy tradeoff. Experiments using various datasets demonstrate that FedMeld achieves superior model accuracy while significantly reducing communication costs as compared with traditional FL schemes for SGINs.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Electromagnetic Kernel Learning for Channel Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate channel prediction is essential for addressing channel aging caused by user mobility. However, the actual channel variations over time are highly complex in high-mobility scenarios, which makes it difficult for existing predictors to obtain future channels accurately. The low accuracy of channel predictors leads to difficulties in supporting reliable communication. To overcome this challenge, we propose a channel predictor based on spatio-temporal electromagnetic (EM) kernel learning (STEM-KL). Specifically, inspired by recent advancements in EM information theory (EIT), the STEM kernel function is derived. The velocity and the concentration kernel parameters are designed to reflect the time-varying propagation of the wireless signal. We obtain the parameters through kernel learning. Then, the future channels are predicted by computing their Bayesian posterior, with the STEM kernel acting as the prior. To further improve the stability and model expressibility, we propose a grid-based EM mixed kernel learning (GEM-KL) scheme. We design the mixed kernel to be a convex combination of multiple sub-kernels, where each of the sub-kernel corresponds to a grid point in the set of pre-selected parameters. This approach transforms non-convex STEM kernel learning problem into a convex grid-based problem that can be easily solved by weight optimization. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed STEM-KL and GEM-KL schemes can achieve more accurate channel prediction. This indicates that EIT can improve the performance of wireless system efficiently.</description>

      <title>Rate of Model Collapse in Recursive Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the ease of creating synthetic data from machine learning models, new models can be potentially trained on synthetic data generated by previous models. This recursive training process raises concerns about the long-term impact on model quality. As models are recursively trained on generated data from previous rounds, their ability to capture the nuances of the original human-generated data may degrade. This is often referred to as \emph{model collapse}. In this work, we ask how fast model collapse occurs for some well-studied distribution families under maximum likelihood (ML or near ML) estimation during recursive training. Surprisingly, even for fundamental distributions such as discrete and Gaussian distributions, the exact rate of model collapse is unknown. In this work, we theoretically characterize the rate of collapse in these fundamental settings and complement it with experimental evaluations. Our results show that for discrete distributions, the time to forget a word is approximately linearly dependent on the number of times it occurred in the original corpus, and for Gaussian models, the standard deviation reduces to zero roughly at $n$ iterations, where $n$ is the number of samples at each iteration. Both of these findings imply that model forgetting, at least in these simple distributions under near ML estimation with many samples, takes a long time.</description>

Abstract: We generalize staircase codes and tiled diagonal zipper codes, preserving their key properties while allowing each coded symbol to be protected by arbitrarily many component codewords rather than only two. This generalization which we term "higher-order staircase codes" arises from the marriage of two distinct combinatorial objects: difference triangle sets and finite-geometric nets, which have typically been applied separately to code design. We demonstrate one possible realization of these codes, obtaining powerful, high-rate, low-error-floor, and low-complexity coding schemes based on simple iterative syndrome-domain decoding of coupled Hamming component codes. We anticipate that the proposed codes could improve performance--complexity--latency tradeoffs in high-throughput communications applications, most notably fiber-optic, in which classical staircase codes and zipper codes have been applied. We consider the construction of difference triangle sets having minimum scope and sum-of-lengths, which lead to memory-optimal realizations of higher-order staircase codes. These results also enable memory reductions for early families of convolutional codes constructed from difference triangle sets.</description>

Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of double and four circulant codes, which are quasi-cyclic codes of index two and four respectively. Exact enumeration results are derived for these families of codes with the prescribed hull dimension. These formulas, in turn, are the most used tools to prove the good behavior of double circulant and four circulant codes asymptotically. Computational results on the code families in consideration are provided as well.</description>

      <title>On the Spectral Efficiency of Indoor Wireless Networks with a Rotary Uniform Linear Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contemporary wireless communication systems rely on Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) techniques. In such systems, each Access Point (AP) is equipped with multiple antenna elements and serves multiple devices simultaneously. Notably, traditional systems utilize fixed antennas, i.e., antennas without any movement capabilities, while the idea of movable antennas has recently gained traction among the research community. By moving in a confined region, movable antennas are able to exploit the wireless channel variation in the continuous domain. This additional degree of freedom may enhance the quality of the wireless links, and consequently the communication performance. However, movable antennas for MU-MIMO proposed in the literature are complex, bulky, expensive and present a high power consumption. In this paper, we propose an alternative to such systems that has lower complexity and lower cost. More specifically, we propose the incorporation of rotation capabilities to APs equipped with Uniform Linear Arrays (ULAs) of antennas. We consider the uplink of an indoor scenario where the AP serves multiple devices simultaneously. The optimal rotation of the ULA is computed based on estimates of the positions of the active devices and aiming at maximizing the per-user mean achievable Spectral Efficiency (SE). Adopting a spatially correlated Rician channel model, our numerical results show that the rotation capabilities of the AP can bring substantial improvements in the SE in scenarios where the line-of-sight component of the channel vectors is strong. Moreover, our proposed system is robust against imperfect positioning estimates.</description>

      <title>Covert Communication Over Additive-Noise Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fundamental limits of covert communications over general memoryless additive-noise channels. We assume that the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper share the same channel and therefore see the same outputs. Under mild integrability assumptions, we find a general upper bound on the square-root scaling constant, which only involves the variance of the logarithm of the probability density function of the noise. Furthermore, we show that, under some additional assumptions, this upper bound is tight. We also provide upper bounds on the length of the secret key required to achieve the optimal scaling.</description>

      <title>Inter-Satellite Link-Enhanced Transmission Scheme Towards Aviation IoT in SAGIN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of the aviation Internet of Things (IoT) has positioned in-flight connectivity (IFC) as one of its critical applications. Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) are essential for ensuring the performance of IFC by enabling seamless and reliable connectivity. However, most existing research treats satellites merely as transparent forwarding nodes and overlooks their potential caching capabilities to enhance IFC data rates. In this article, we explore an IFC-oriented SAGIN where satellites and ground stations (GSs) work together to transmit content to airborne passengers, thereby facilitating airborne communication. By categorizing files into cached (instantly accessible via satellites) and non-cached files (available only through GSs), this article pioneers the integration of multiple inter-satellite links (ISLs) into the IFC framework, thus innovating the content delivery process for both types of files. To minimize the average delay of content delivery, we formulate the corresponding optimization problems: 1) For cached files, we propose an exact penalty-based method to determine the satellite association scheme. 2) For non-cached files, we present an efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization to jointly optimize satellite association and GS bandwidth allocation. Our proposed framework is low in complexity, paving the way for high-speed Internet connectivity for aviation passengers. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed IFC framework for SAGIN.</description>

      <title>The Generating Idempotent Is a Minimum-Weight Codeword for Some Binary BCH Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a paper from 2015, Ding et al. (IEEE Trans. IT, May 2015) conjectured that for odd $m$, the minimum distance of the binary BCH code of length $2^m-1$ and designed distance $2^{m-2}+1$ is equal to the Bose distance calculated in the same paper.
  In this paper, we prove the conjecture. In fact, we prove a stronger result suggested by Ding et al.: the weight of the generating idempotent is equal to the Bose distance for both odd and even $m$. Our main tools are some new properties of the so-called fibbinary integers, in particular, the splitting field of related polynomials, and the relation of these polynomials to the idempotent of the BCH code.</description>

      <title>Soft-Output Fast Successive-Cancellation List Decoder for Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The soft-output successive cancellation list (SOSCL) decoder provides a methodology for estimating the a-posteriori probability log-likelihood ratios by only leveraging the conventional SCL decoder for polar codes. However, the sequential nature of SCL decoding leads to a high decoding latency for the SO-SCL decoder. In this paper, we propose a soft-output fast SCL (SO-FSCL) decoder by incorporating node-based fast decoding into the SO-SCL framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SO-FSCL decoder significantly reduces the decoding latency without loss of performance compared with the SO-SCL decoder.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Estimation by Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07008v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a signal recovery algorithm, compressed sensing is particularly useful when the data has low-complexity and samples are rare, which matches perfectly with the task of quantum phase estimation (QPE). In this work we present a new Heisenberg-limited QPE algorithm for early quantum computers based on compressed sensing. More specifically, given many copies of a proper initial state and queries to some unitary operators, our algorithm is able to recover the frequency with a total runtime $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1}\text{poly}\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$, where $\epsilon$ is the accuracy. Moreover, the maximal runtime satisfies $T_{\max}\epsilon \ll \pi$, which is comparable to the state of art algorithms, and our algorithm is also robust against certain amount of noise from sampling. We also consider the more general quantum eigenvalue estimation problem (QEEP) and show numerically that the off-grid compressed sensing can be a strong candidate for solving the QEEP.</description>
