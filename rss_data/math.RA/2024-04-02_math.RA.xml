      <title>Rota-Baxter operators of weight zero on upper-triangular matrices of order three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe all Rota-Baxter operators $R$ of weight zero on the algebra $U_3(F)$ of upper-triangular matrices of order three over a field of characteristic 0. For this, we apply the following three ingredients: properties of $R(1)$, conjugation with suitable (anti)automorphisms of $U_3(F)$, and computation with the help of \texttt{Singular} of the Gr\"{o}bner basis for the system of the equations arisen on the coefficients of $R$.</description>

      <title>A cohomological study of modified Rota-Baxter associative algebras with derivations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a cohomological study of modified Rota-Baxter associative algebras in the presence of derivations. The Modified Rota-Baxter operator, which is a modified version and closely related to the classical Rota-Baxter operator, has garnered significant attention due to its applications in various mathematical and physical contexts. In this study, we define a cohomology theory and also investigate a one-parameter formal deformation theory and abelian extensions of modified Rota-Baxter associative algebras under the influence of derivations.</description>

      <title>Classification of three-dimensional anti-dendriform algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the classification of anti-dendriform algebras that are associated with associativity. They are characterized as algebras with two operations whose sum is associative. In particular, the paper is devoted to classifying anti-dendriform algebras associated with null-filiform associative algebras and three-dimensional algebras. It is known that any finite-dimensional associative algebra without a non-zero idempotent element is nilpotent. If an associative algebra has a non-zero idempotent element, then there does not exist a compatible anti-dendriform algebra structure associated with associative algebras.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we give a geometrization of semicanonical bases of quantum groups via Grothendieck groups of the derived categories of Lusztig's nilpotent varieties.

      <title>A simplified proof of the CSP Dichotomy Conjecture and XY-symmetric operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new theory of strong subalgebras and linear congruences that are defined globally. Using this theory we provide a new proof of the correctness of Zhuk's algorithm for all tractable CSPs on a finite domain, and therefore a new simplified proof of the CSP Dichotomy Conjecture. Additionally, using the new theory we prove that composing a weak near-unanimity operation of an odd arity $n$ we can derive an $n$-ary operation that is symmetric on all two-element sets. Thus, CSP over a constraint language $\Gamma$ on a finite domain is tractable if and only if there exist infinitely many polymorphisms of $\Gamma$ that are symmetric on all two-element sets.</description>

      <title>Properties of the cone of polynomials of fixed degree that preserve nonnegative matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As was detailed by Loewy and London in [Linear and Multilinear Algebra 6 (1978/79), no.~1, 83--90], the cone of polynomials that preserve the nonnegativity of matrices may play an important role in the solution to the nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem. In this paper, we start by showing the cone generated by polynomials of degree greater than or equal to $2n$ that preserve nonnegative matrices of order $n$ is non-polyhedral. Then it is shown, that a polynomial that preserves nonnegative matrices of order $n$ can have all the center terms be negative. These polynomials can also have the largest term, in absolute value, be arbitrarily negative with the remaining coefficients being one. We explore properties of the measure of the cone when restricted to the unit sphere and prove some initial bounds of that volume.</description>

      <title>Topological actions of Temperley-Lieb algebras and Representation Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.09636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Temperley-Lieb algebras $\textrm{TL}_n(\delta)$ at $\delta = 1$. Since $\delta = 1$, we can consider the multiplicative monoid structure and ask how this monoid acts on topological spaces. Given a monoid action on a topological space, we get an algebra action on each homology group. The main theorem of this paper explicitly deduces the representation structure of the homology groups in terms of a natural filtration associated with our $\textrm{TL}_n$-space. As a corollary of this result, we are able to study stability phenomena. There is a natural way to define representation stability in the context of $\textrm{TL}_n(1)$, and the presence of filtrations enables us to define a notion of topological stability. We are able to deduce that a filtration-stable sequence of $\textrm{TL}_n$-spaces results in representation-stable sequence of homology groups. This can be thought of as the analogue of the statement that the homology of configuration spaces forms a finitely generated $\textrm{FI}$-module.</description>

      <title>Twisting Manin's universal quantum groups and comodule algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of quantum-symmetric equivalence of two connected graded algebras, based on Morita-Takeuchi equivalences of their universal quantum groups, in the sense of Manin. We study homological and algebraic invariants of quantum-symmetric equivalence classes, and prove that numerical $\mathrm{Tor}$-regularity, Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, Artin-Schelter regularity, and the Frobenius property are invariant under any Morita-Takeuchi equivalence. In particular, by combining our results with the work of Raedschelders and Van den Bergh, we prove that Koszul Artin-Schelter regular algebras of a fixed global dimension form a single quantum-symmetric equivalence class. Moreover, we characterize 2-cocycle twists (which arise as a special case of quantum-symmetric equivalence) of Koszul duals, of superpotentials, of superpotential algebras, of Nakayama automorphisms of twisted Frobenius algebras, and of Artin-Schelter regular algebras. We also show that finite generation of Hochschild cohomology rings is preserved under certain 2-cocycle twists.</description>

      <title>Key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano threefolds defined by Freudenthal triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we concern with the classification of complex prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds of anti-canonical codimension 4 which are produced, as weighted complete intersections of appropriate weighted projectivizations of certain affine varieties related with $\mathbb{P}^{1}\times\mathbb{P}^{1}\times\mathbb{P}^{1}$-fibrations. Such affine varieties or their appropriate weighted projectivizations are called key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds. We realize that the equations of the key varieties can be described conceptually by Freudenthal triple systems (FTS, for short). The paper consists of two parts. In Part 1, we revisit the general theory of FTS; the main purpose of Part 1 is to derive the conditions of so called strictly regular elements in FTS so as to fit with our description of key varieties. Then, in Part 2, we define several key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds from the conditions of strictly regular elements in FTS. Among other things obtained in Part 2, we show that there exists a $14$-dimensional factorial affine variety $\mathfrak{U}_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ of codimension $4$ in an affine $18$-space with only Gorenstein terminal singularities, and we construct examples of prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds of No.20544 in [GRDB] as weighted complete intersections of the weighted projectivization of $\mathfrak{U}_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ in the weighted projective space $\mathbb{P}(1^{15},2^{2},3)$. We also clarify in Part 2 a relation between $\mathfrak{U}_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ and the $G_{2}^{(4)}$-cluster variety, which is a key variety for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds constructed in [CD].</description>

      <title>Conditions for matchability in groups and field extensions II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present sufficient conditions for the existence of matchings in abelian groups and their linear counterparts. These conditions lead to extensions of existing results in matching theory. Additionally, we classify subsets within abelian groups that cannot be matched. We introduce the concept of Chowla subspaces and formulate and conjecture a linear analogue of a result originally attributed to Y. O. Hamidoune [20] concerning Chowla sets. If proven true, this result would extend matchings in primitive subspaces. Throughout the paper, we emphasize the analogy between matchings in abelian groups and field extensions. We also pose numerous open questions for future research. Our approach relies on classical theorems in group theory, additive number theory and linear algebra. As the title of the paper suggests, this work is the second sequel to a previous paper [5] with a similar theme. This paper is self-contained and can be read independently.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues of Dual Hermitian Matrices with Application in Formation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a supplement matrix method for computing eigenvalues of a dual Hermitian matrix, and discuss its application in multi-agent formation control. Suppose we have a ring, which can be the real field, the complex field, or the quaternion ring. We study dual number symmetric matrices, dual complex Hermitian matrices and dual quaternion Hermitian matrices in a unified frame of dual Hermitian matrices. An $n \times n$ dual Hermitian matrix has $n$ dual number eigenvalues. We define determinant, characteristic polynomial and supplement matrices for a dual Hermitian matrix. Supplement matrices are Hermitian matrices in the original ring. The standard parts of the eigenvalues of that dual Hermitian matrix are the eigenvalues of the standard part Hermitian matrix in the original ring, while the dual parts of the eigenvalues of that dual Hermitian matrix are the eigenvalues of those supplement matrices. Hence, by applying any practical method for computing eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices in the original ring, we have a practical method for computing eigenvalues of a dual Hermitian matrix. We call this method the supplement matrix method. In multi-agent formation control, a desired relative configuration scheme may be given. People need to know if this scheme is reasonable such that a feasible solution of configurations of these multi-agents exists. By exploring the eigenvalue problem of dual Hermitian matrices, and its link with the unit gain graph theory, we open a cross-disciplinary approach to solve the relative configuration problem. Numerical experiments are reported.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a commutative Gorenstein Noetherian ring $R$, we construct an affine scheme $X$ solely from DG singularity category $S_{dg}(R)$ of $R$ such that there is a finite surjective morphism $X \rightarrow \mathrm{Spec}(R /I)$, where $\mathrm{Spec}(R /I)$ is the singular locus in $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$. As an application, for two such rings with equivalent DG singularity categories, we prove that the singular loci in their affine schemes have the same dimension.</description>

Abstract: Every $n$-tuple in $\mathbb{F}^{n}$ has a first non-zero entry and a last non-zero entry. What do the positions of such entries in the elements of a subspace W of $\mathbb{F}^{n}$ reveal about W? It turns out, a great deal! This insight offers a beeline to the fundamental results on general bases and dimension (including dimensions of complements, rank of a transpose, Rank-Nullity Theorem, Full Rank Factorization, and existence/uniqueness of RREF), bypassing some of the traditional stumbling blocks and time sinks.</description>

      <title>Key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano threefolds defined by Jordan algebras of cubic forms. Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first aim of this paper is to construct a $13$-dimensional affine variety $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ related with $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$-fibration. It is well-known that the affine cone of the Segre embedded $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$ is defined as the null loci of the so called $\sharp$-mapping of a 9-dimensional nondegenerate quadratic Jordan algebra $J$ of a cubic form. Inspired with this fact, we construct $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ in the same way coordinatizing $J$ with 8 parameters. We derive such a coordinatization of $J$ using fixed three complementary primitive idempotents and the associated Peirce decomposition of $J$.
  The second aim of this paper is to construct complex prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds of anti-canonical codimension 4 as weighted complete intersections of appropriate weighted projectivizations of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ or its subvarieties (possibly allowing some coordinates with weight $0$). The affine variety $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ and such weighted projectivizations of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ are called key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds. We show that a prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-fold of genus $3$ with three $\frac{1}{2}(1,1,1)$-singularities belonging to the class of No.5.4 as in [Tak1] is constructed from one weighted projectivization of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ such that all the coordinates have positive weights. Conversely, we also show that any such a prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-fold is obtained in this way. Moreover, relating $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ with the $C_{2}$-cluster variety constructed by Coughlan and Ducat [CD1], we show that weighted projectivizations of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ or its subvarieties are key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds belonging to 108 classes in the online database [GRDB].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subsequent to the previous paper [Tak5], we are concerned with the classification of complex prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds of anti-canonical codimension 4 which are produced, as weighted complete intersections of appropriate weighted projectivizations of certain affine varieties related with $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$-fibrations. Such affine varieties or their appropriate weighted projectivizations (possibly allowing some coordinates have weights $0$) are called key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds.
  The purpose of this paper is to give new constructions of a $14$-dimensional affine variety $\Upsilon_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ and a $15$-dimensional affine variety $\Pi_{\mathbb{A}}^{15}$ related with $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$-fibration, which were constructed and were shown to be key varieties in the papers [Tak3,Tak4] and [Tay]. It is well-known that the affine cone of the Segre embedded $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$ is defined as the null loci of the so called $\sharp$-mapping of a 9-dimensional nondegenerate quadratic Jordan algebra $J$ of a cubic form. Inspired with this fact, we construct $\Upsilon_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ and $\Pi_{\mathbb{A}}^{15}$ in the same way coordinatizing $J$ with 9 and 10 parameters, respectively. The coordinatization with $9$ parameters is derived by using a fixed primitive idempotent, and the associated Peirce decomposition. The coordinatization with $10$ parameters is derived from the construction of a quadratic Jordan subalgebra generated by $\sharp$-products of two elements due to Petersson [Pe1].</description>
