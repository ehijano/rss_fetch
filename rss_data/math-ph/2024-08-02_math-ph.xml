      <title>Affine Connection Approach to the Realization of Nonholonomic Constraints by Strong Friction Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an affine connection approach to realizing nonholonomic mechanical systems mediated by viscous friction forces with large coefficients, viewed as a singular perturbation of the nonholonomic system. We show that the associated slow manifold is represented coordinate-free as the image of a section over the nonholonomic distribution. We propose a novel invariance condition based on covariant derivatives and prove that this condition is equivalent to the classical invariance condition based on time derivatives. Accordingly, we propose a novel recursive procedure to approximate the slow manifold based on the covariant derivatives of a formal power series expansion of the section. Using this recurrence relation, we derive, up to second order, approximations of the slip velocities residing in the slow manifold, as well as the associated approximated dynamics up to first order. Lastly, we illustrate our approach with a case study of a vertical rolling disk.</description>

      <title>Capacities of quantum Markovian noise for large times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a quantum Markovian noise model, we study the maximum dimension of a classical or quantum system that can be stored for arbitrarily large time. We show that, unlike the fixed time setting, in the limit of infinite time, the classical and quantum capacities are characterized by efficiently computable properties of the peripheral spectrum of the quantum channel. In addition, the capacities are additive under tensor product, which implies in the language of Shannon theory that the one-shot and the asymptotic i.i.d. capacities are the same. We also provide an improved algorithm for computing the structure of the peripheral subspace of a quantum channel, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Half-sided translations broken to pieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We dissect the half-sided translations for 1+1 D massless scalar in Minkowski spacetime, generated by $\mathcal{G}$, into non-commutative operations built using the entanglement Hamiltonians of the underlying algebras. Explicitly, we define $G, G'$ such that $\mathcal{G} = G + G'$ with $[G, G']\neq 0$. This non-commutativity prevents a clean split of $\exp(is \mathcal{G})$, and requires the Zassenhaus product formula. We compute all the infinite terms in the product explicitly, and show $\exp(is \mathcal{G}) = \exp( i s G ) \exp( i s G' ) \exp( f(s) [G, G'] )$ for a real function $f(s)$. We study the consequences of this result through flow of local operators under $G$ and $G'$, and show that while in regions where $G'$ has no causal influence, the action of $G$ is indistinguishable from that of $\mathcal{G}$; in the region where both $G$ and $G'$ together create $\mathcal{G}$, the action of $G$ is remarkably different. We conclude by discussing how our results can be applied to the island paradigm.</description>

      <title>Rotational influence on fermions within negative curvature wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, we examine relativistic fermions within the rotating frame of negative curvature wormholes. Initially, as is typical in our context, we introduce the wormholes by embedding a curved surface into a higher dimensional flat Minkowski spacetime. Subsequently, we derive the spacetime metric that characterizes the rotating frame of these wormholes. We then investigate analytical solutions of the generalized Dirac equation within this framework. Through exploring a second-order nonperturbative wave equation, we seek exact solutions for fermions within the rotating frame of hyperbolic and elliptic wormholes, also known as negative curvature wormholes. Our analysis provides closed-form energy expressions, and we generalize our findings to Weyl fermions. By considering the impact of the rotating frame and curvature radius of wormholes, we discuss how these factors affect the evolution of fermionic fields, offering valuable insights into their behavior.</description>

      <title>Solutions of generalized constrained discrete KP hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solutions of a generalized constrained discrete KP (gcdKP) hierarchy with constraint on Lax operator $L^k=(L^k)_{\geq m}+\sum_{i=1}^lq_i\Delta^{-1}\Lambda^mr_i$, are invesitigated by Darboux transformations $T_D(f)=f^{[1]}\cdot\Delta\cdot f^{-1}$ and $T_I(g)=(g^{[-1]})^{-1}\cdot\Delta^{-1}\cdot g$. Due to this special constraint on Lax operator, it is showed that the generating functions $f$ and $g$ of the corresponding Darboux transformations, can only be chosen from (adjoint) wave functions or $(L^k)_{&lt;m}=\sum_{i=1}^lq_i\Delta^{-1}\Lambda^mr_i$. Then successive applications of Darboux transformations for gcdKP hierarchy are discussed. Finally based upon above, solutions of gcdKP hierarchy are obtained from $L^{\{0\}}=\Lambda$ by Darboux transformations.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal 2-braidings from 2-shifted Poisson structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that every $2$-shifted Poisson structure on a finitely generated semi-free commutative differential graded algebra $A$ defines a very explicit infinitesimal $2$-braiding on the homotopy $2$-category of the symmetric monoidal dg-category of finitely generated semi-free $A$-dg-modules. This provides a concrete realization, to first order in the deformation parameter $\hbar$, of the abstract deformation quantization results in derived algebraic geometry due to Calaque, Pantev, To\"en, Vaqui\'e and Vezzosi. Of particular interest is the case when $A$ is the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of a higher Lie algebra, where the braided monoidal deformations developed in this paper may be interpreted as candidates for representation categories of `higher quantum groups'.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct functors between the category of vertex algebras and that of Costello-Gwilliam factorization algebras on the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$, without analytic structures such as differentiable vector spaces, nuclear spaces, and bornological vector spaces. We prove that this pair of functors is an adjoint pair and that the functor from vertex algebras to factorization algebras is fully faithful. Also, we identify the class of factorization algebras that are categorically equivalent to vertex algebras. To illustrate, we check the compatibility with the commutative structures and the factorization algebras constructed as factorization envelopes, including the Kac-Moody factorization algebra, the quantum observables of the $\beta\gamma$ system, and the Virasoro factorization algebra.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic windings, surface helicity and their applications in plasma physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [J. Cantarella, J. Parsley, J. Geom. Phys. 60:1127 (2010)] Cantarella and Parsley introduced the notion of submanifold helicity. In the present paper we investigate properties of surface helicity and in particular answer two open questions posed in the aforementioned work: (i) We give a precise mathematically rigorous physical interpretation of surface helicity in terms of linking of distinct field lines. (ii) We prove that surface helicity is non-trivial if and only if the underlying surface has non-trivial topology (i.e. at least one hole).
  We then focus on toroidal surfaces which are of relevance in plasma physics and express surface helicity in terms of average poloidal and toroidal windings of the individual field lines of the underlying vector field which enables us to provide a connection between surface helicity and rotational transform. Further, we show how some of our results may be utilised in the context of coil designs for plasma fusion confinement devices in order to obtain coil configurations of particular "simple" shape.
  Lastly, we consider the problem of optimising surface helicity among toroidal surfaces of fixed area and show that toroidal surfaces admitting a symmetry constitute global minimisers.</description>

      <title>An explicit formula for free multiplicative Brownian motions via spherical functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After some normalization, the logarithms of the ordered singular values of Brownian motions on $GL(N,\mathbb F)$ with $\mathbb F=\mathbb R, \mathbb C$ form Weyl-group invariant Heckman-Opdam processes on $\mathbb R^N$ of type $A_{N-1}$. We use classical elementary formulas for the spherical functions of $GL(N,\mathbb C)/SU(N)$ and the associated Euclidean spaces $H(N,\mathbb C)$ of Hermitian matrices, and show that in the $GL(N,\mathbb C)$-case, these processes can be also interpreted as ordered eigenvalues of Brownian motions on $H(N,\mathbb C)$ with particular drifts. This leads to an explicit description for the free limits for the associated empirical processes for $N\to\infty$ where these limits are independent from the parameter $k$ of the Heckman-Opdam processes. In particular we get new formulas for the distributions of the free multiplicative Browniam motion of Biane. We also show how this approach works for the root systems $B_N, C_N, D_N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that holomorphic twists of supersymmetric field theories naturally come with a symmetry $L_\infty$-algebra that nontrivially extends holomorphic symmetry. This symmetry acts on spacetime fields only up to homotopy, and the extension is only visible at the level of higher components of the action. We explicitly compute this for the holomorphic twist of ten-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, which produces a nontrivial action of a higher $L_\infty$-algebra on (a graded version) of five-dimensional affine space.</description>

      <title>ISDE with logarithmic interaction and characteristic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider certain random matrix eigenvalue dynamics, akin to Dyson Brownian motion, introduced by Rider and Valko. We show that from every initial condition, including ones involving coinciding coordinates, the dynamics, enhanced with more information, converge on path-space to an infinite-dimensional Feller-continuous diffusion process. We show that the limiting diffusion solves an infinite-dimensional system of stochastic differential equations (ISDE) with logarithmic interaction. Moreover, we show convergence in the long-time limit of the infinite-dimensional dynamics starting from any initial condition to the equilibrium measure, given by the inverse points of the Bessel determinantal point process. As far as we can tell, this is: (a) the first path-space convergence result of random matrix dynamics starting from every initial condition to an infinite-dimensional Feller diffusion, (b) the first construction of solutions to an ISDE with logarithmic interaction from every initial condition for which the singular drift term can be defined at time $0$, (c) the first convergence to equilibrium result from every initial condition for an ISDE of this kind. The argument splits into two parts. The first part builds on the method of intertwiners introduced and developed by Borodin and Olshanski. The main new ingredients are a uniform, in a certain sense, approximation theorem of the spectrum of a family of random matrices indexed by an infinite-dimensional space and an extension of the method of intertwiners to deal with convergence to equilibrium. The second part introduces a new approach towards convergence of the singular drift term in the dynamics and for showing non-intersection of the limiting paths via certain ``characteristic polynomials" associated to the process. We believe variations of it will be applicable to other infinite-dimensional dynamics coming from random matrices.</description>

      <title>Perfect Wave Transfer in Continuous Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the perfect transfer of information in 1+1D continuous quantum systems. This includes effective descriptions of inhomogeneous spin chains, for which the notion of perfect state transfer in quantum information was introduced, and here phrased in terms of waves. We show that reflection symmetry is necessary for perfect wave transfer (PWT) in any inhomogeneous conformal field theory, and even sufficient when restricted to one-particle excitations. To determine if or when it is sufficient more generally, we first break conformal invariance and study a broad class of 1+1D bosonic theories. We show that the question can then be posed as an inverse Sturm-Liouville problem that determines when the bosonic theory exhibits PWT. We demonstrate how to uniquely solve this problem, which also shows that reflection symmetry is sufficient for the special case with conformal invariance. Using bosonization, our continuum results extend these notions to interacting quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>The dynamical alpha-R\'enyi entropies of local Hamiltonians grow at most linearly in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a generic one dimensional spin system of length L, arbitrarily large, with strictly local interactions, for example nearest neighbor, and prove that the dynamical alpha-R\'enyi entropies, 0 &lt; alpha &lt; 1, of an initial product state grow at most linearly in time. We extend our bound on the dynamical generation of entropy to systems with exponential decay of interactions, for values of alpha close enough to 1. We provide a non rigorous argument to extend our results to initial low-entangled, meaning O(log L) states. This class of states includes many examples of spin systems ground states, and also critical states. This implies that low entanglement states have an efficient MPS representation that persists at least up to times of order log L. The main technical tools are the Lieb-Robinson bounds, to locally approximate the dynamics of the spin chain, a strict upper bound of Audenaert on alpha-R\'enyi entropies and a bound on their concavity. Such a bound, that we provide in an appendix, can be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work we present a general framework which guarantees the existence of optimal domains for isoperimetric problems within the class of $C^{1,1}$-regular domains satisfying a uniform ball condition as long as the desired objective function satisfies certain properties. We then verify that the helicity isoperimetric problem studied in [J. Cantarella, D. DeTurck, H. Gluck and M. Teytel, J. Math. Phys. 41, 5615 (2000)] satisfies the conditions of our framework and hence establish the existence of optimal domains within the given class of domains. We additionally use the same framework to prove the existence of optimal domains among uniform $C^{1,1}$-domains for a first curl eigenvalue problem which has been studied recently for other classes of domains in [A. Enciso, W. Gerner and D. Peralta-Salas, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 377, 4519-4540 (2024)].</description>

Abstract: This work investigates the intricate relationship between the q-boson model, a quantum integrable system, and classical integrable systems such as the Toda and KP hierarchies. Initially, we analyze scalar products of off-shell Bethe states and explore their connections to tau functions of integrable hierarchies. Furthermore, we discuss correlation functions within this formalism, examining their representations in terms of tau functions, as well as their Schur polynomial expansions.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Emulations in Classical Spin Models: Modularity and Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of spin models intersects with condensed matter physics, complex systems, graph theory, combinatorial optimization, computational complexity and neural networks. Many ensuing applications rely on the fact that complicated spin models can be transformed to simpler ones. What is the structure of such transformations? Here, we provide a framework to study and construct emulations between spin models. A spin model is a set of spin systems, and emulations are efficiently computable simulations with arbitrary energy cut-off, where a source spin system simulates a target system if, below the cut-off, the target Hamiltonian is encoded in the source Hamiltonian. We prove that emulations preserve important properties, as they induce reductions between computational problems such as computing ground states, approximating partition functions and approximate sampling from Boltzmann distributions. Emulations are modular (they can be added, scaled and composed), and allow for universality, i.e. certain spin models have maximal reach. We prove that a spin model is universal if and only if it is scalable, closed and functional complete. Because the characterization is constructive, it provides a step-by-step guide to construct emulations. We prove that the 2d Ising model with fields is universal, for which we also provide two new crossing gadgets. Finally, we show that simulations can be computed by linear programs. While some ideas of this work are contained in [1], we provide new definitions and theorems. This framework provides a toolbox for applications involving emulations of spin models.</description>

      <title>Coherence as entropy increment for Tsallis and Renyi entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy of coherence can be written as an entropy difference of the original state and the incoherent state closest to it when measured by relative entropy. The natural question is, if we generalize this situation to Tsallis or R\'enyi entropies, would it define good coherence measures? In other words, we define a difference between Tsallis entropies of the original state and the incoherent state closest to it when measured by Tsallis relative entropy. Taking R\'enyi entropy instead of the Tsallis entropy, leads to the well-known distance-based R\'enyi coherence, which means this expression defined a good coherence measure. Interestingly, we show that Tsallis entropy does not generate even a genuine coherence monotone, unless it is under a very restrictive class of operations. Additionally, we provide continuity estimates for both Tsallis and R\'enyi coherence expressions. Furthermore, we present two coherence measures based on the closest incoherent state when measures by Tsallis or R\'enyi relative entropy.</description>

      <title>3D Tensor Renormalisation Group at High Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon previous $2D$ studies, this research focuses on describing $3D$ tensor renormalisation group (RG) flows for lattice spin systems, such as the Ising model. We present a novel RG map, which operates on tensors with infinite-dimensional legs and does not involve truncations, in contrast to numerical tensor RG maps. To construct this map, we developed new techniques for analysing tensor networks. Our analysis shows that the constructed RG map contracts the region around the tensor $A_*$, corresponding to the high-temperature phase of the $3D$ Ising model. This leads to the iterated RG map convergence in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm to $A_*$ when initialised in the vicinity of $A_*$. This work provides the first steps towards the rigorous understanding of tensor RG maps in $3D$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the large-time behavior of global energy class solutions of the one dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a general localized potential term and a defocusing nonlinear term. By using a new type of interaction Morawetz estimate localized to an exterior region, we prove that these solutions decompose into a free wave and a weakly localized part which is asymptotically orthogonal to any fixed free wave. We further show that the $L^2$ norm of this weakly localized part is concentrated in the region $|x| \leq t^{1/2+}$, and that the energy ($\dot{H}^1$) norm is concentrated in $|x| \leq t^{1/3+}$.</description>

Abstract: An explicit description of the multiplicity space that describes occurrences of irreducible representations in a splitting of a tensor product of two irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ is given. Using this description an explicit formula for an arbitrary $6j$-symbol for the algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ is derived. The $6j$-symbol is expressed through a value of a generalized hypergeometric function.</description>

      <title>Some Lower Dimensional Quantum Field Theories Reduced from Chern-Simons Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study symmetry reductions in the context of Euclidean Chern-Simons gauge theories to obtain lower dimensional field theories. Symmetry reduction in certain gauge theories is a common tool for obtaining explicit soliton solutions. Although pure Chern-Simons theories do not admit solitonic solutions, symmetry reduction still leads to interesting results. We establish relations at the semiclassical regime between pure Chern-Simons theories on $S^3$ and the reduced Quantum Field Theories, based on actions obtained by the symmetry reduction of the Chern-Simons action, spherical symmetry being the prominent one. We also discuss symmetry reductions of Chern-Simons theories on the disk, yielding $BF$-theory in two dimensions, which signals a curious relationship between symmetry reductions and the boundary conformal field theories. Finally, we study the Chern-Simons-Higgs instantons and show that under certain circumstances, the reduced action can formally be viewed as the action of a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. We discuss the extent to which the reduced actions have a fermionic nature at the level of the partition function.</description>

      <title>Wind-wave interaction in finite depth: linear and nonlinear approaches, blow-up and soliton breaking in finite time, integrability perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is an analytical investigation of the evolution of surface water waves in Miles and Jeffreys theories of wind wave interaction in water of finite depth. The present review is divided into two major parts. The first corresponds to the surface water waves in a linear regime and its nonlinear extensions. In this part, Miles theory of wave amplification by wind is extended to the case of finite depth. The dispersion relation provides a wave growth rate depending on depth. Our theoretical results are in good agreement with the data from the Australian Shallow Water Experiment and the data from the Lake George experiment. In the second part of this study, Jeffreys theory of wave amplification by wind is extended to the case of finite depth, where the Serre-Green-Naghdi is derived. We find the solitary wave solution of the system, with an increasing amplitude under the action of the wind. This continuous increase in amplitude leads to the soliton breaking and blow-up of the surface wave in finite time. The theoretical blow-up time is calculated based on actual experimental data. By applying an appropriate perturbation method, the SGN equation yields Korteweg de Vries Burger equation (KdVB). We show that the continuous transfer of energy from wind to water results in the growth of the KdVB soliton amplitude, velocity, acceleration, and energy over time while its effective wavelength decreases. This phenomenon differs from the classical results of Jeffreys approach due to finite depth. Again, blow-up and breaking occur in finite time. These times are calculated and expressed for soliton- and wind-appropriate parameters and values. These values are measurable in usual experimental facilities. The kinematics of the breaking is studied, and a detailed analysis of the breaking time is conducted using various criteria. Finally, some integrability perspectives are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to establish a scalable scheme for characterising diagonal non-Clifford gates for single- and multi-qudit systems; \(d\) is a prime-power integer. By employing cyclic operators and a qudit T gate, we generalise the dihedral benchmarking scheme for single- and multi-qudit circuits. Our results establish a path for experimentally benchmarking qudit systems and are of theoretical and experimental interest because our scheme is optimal insofar as it does not require preparation of the full qudit Clifford gate set to characterise a non-Clifford gate. Moreover, combined with Clifford randomised benchmarking, our scheme is useful to characterise the generators of a universal gate set.</description>

      <title>The Existence and Distribution of Photon Spheres Near Spherically Symmetric Black Holes -- A Geometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photon sphere has attracted significant attention since the discovery of black hole shadow images by Event Horizon Telescope. Recently, a number of studies have highlighted that the number of photon spheres and their distributions near black holes are strongly constrained by black hole properties. Specifically, for black holes with event horizons and proper asymptotic behaviors, the number of stable and unstable photon spheres satisfies the relation $n_{\text{stable}} - n_{\text{unstable}} = -1$. In this study, we provide a novel proof on this relation using a completely new geometric approach, in which the stable and unstable photon spheres are determined by Gaussian curvature and geodesic curvature in the optical geometry of black hole spacetimes. Firstly, we demonstrated the existence of photon spheres near black holes with proper asymptotic behaviors (asymptotically flat black holes, asymptotically de-Sitter and anti-de-Sitter black holes). Subsequently, we proved that the stable and unstable photon spheres near black holes must be one-to-one alternatively separated from each other, such that each unstable photon sphere is sandwiched between two stable photon spheres (and each stable photon sphere is sandwiched between two unstable photon spheres). Our analysis in this study is limited to the spherically symmetric black hole spacetime (with the spacetime metric $ds^{2}=g_{tt}dt^{2}+g_{rr}dr^{2}+g_{\theta\theta}d\theta^{2}+g_{\phi\phi}d\phi^{2}$).</description>

      <title>Rapidly convergent series expansions for a class of resolvents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following advances in the abstract theory of composites, we develop rapidly converging series expansions about $z=\infty$ for the resolvent ${\bf R}(z)=[z{\bf I}-{\bf P}^\dagger{\bf Q}{\bf P}]^{-1}$ where ${\bf Q}$ is an orthogonal projection and ${\bf P}$ is such that ${\bf P}{\bf P}^\dagger$ is an orthogonal projection. It is assumed that the spectrum of ${\bf P}^\dagger{\bf Q}{\bf P}$ lies within the interval $[z^-,z^+]$ for some known $z^+\leq 1$ and $z^-\geq 0$ and that the actions of the projections ${\bf Q}$ and ${\bf P}{\bf P}^\dagger$ are easy to compute. The series converges in the entire $z$-plane excluding the cut $[z^-,z^+]$. It is obtained using subspace substitution, where the desired resolvent is tied to a resolvent in a larger space and ${\bf Q}$ gets replaced by a projection $\underline{{\bf Q}}$ that is no longer orthogonal. When $z$ is real the rate of convergence of the new method matches that of the conjugate gradient method.</description>

      <title>The Ground State of the S=1 Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Chain is Topologically Nontrivial if Gapped</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under the widely accepted but unproven assumption that the one-dimensional $S=1$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model has a unique gapped ground state, we prove that the model belongs to a nontrivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase. In other words, we rigorously rule out the possibility that the model has a unique gapped ground state that is topologically trivial. To be precise, we assume that the models on open finite chains with boundary magnetic field have unique ground states with a uniform gap and prove that the ground state of the infinite chain has a nontrivial topological index. This implies the presence of a gapless edge excitation in the model on the half-infinite chain and the existence of a topological phase transition in the model (9).</description>

Abstract: The Maxwell-Bloch system of equations with inhomogeneous broadening is studied, and the local and global well-posedness of the corresponding initial-boundary value problem is established by taking advantage of the integrability of the system and making use of the corresponding inverse scattering transform. A key ingredient in the analysis is the $L^2$-Sobolev bijectivity of the direct and inverse scattering transform established by Xin Zhou for the focusing Zakharov-Shabat problem.</description>
