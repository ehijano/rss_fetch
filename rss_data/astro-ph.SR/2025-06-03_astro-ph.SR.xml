      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): Pipeline-Determined Physical Properties of OB Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to determine the physical properties of OB stars from the multi-epoch VLT/FLAMES BLOeM spectroscopic survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud. We apply a pipeline designed to analyse large spectroscopic samples of OB stars to the co-added, initial 9 epochs of the BLOeM survey, utilising grids of synthetic model spectra computed with the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND. 69 OB stars are excluded from the analysis owing to disk emission or significant contamination by secondaries in SB2 binaries. We determine physical properties of 778 OB stars, including Teff, log g, log L/Lsun and v_e sin i. There appears to be a bimodality in v_e sin i of single O stars, while v_e sin i distributions of OB stars are strikingly different for single (median 78 km/s) and binary (median 200 km/s) systems. Inferred temperatures are broadly in agreement with literature results for stars in common, plus results from a grid-based automization tool for a subset of O and early B stars, although uncertainties are larger for surface gravities. Rotational velocities are broadly in line with an independent tool applied to the same subset. We recover the anticipated lower mass cutoff at 8 Msun from the survey design using a Bayesian inference method coupled with SMC metallicity evolutionary models, with median masses of 12.6 Msun (19.8 Msun) for B-type (O-type) stars. Spectroscopic masses exceed evolutionary masses, albeit with large uncertainties in surface gravities. We also provide an updated catalogue of O stars in the SMC since half of the 159 BLOeM O stars are newly classified as O-type stars.</description>

      <title>HelioIndex: A Directory of Active Researchers in Solar and Heliospheric Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HelioIndex is a directory of authors who are active in solar and heliospheric physics (SHP). It is available at the webpage HelioIndex.org, and it includes several derived products such as publication lists, country and institute data, journal data, and lists of the most cited articles in the field. HelioIndex is built from ORCID identifiers and publication data obtained from the Astrophysics Data System and ORCID. Selection criteria have been chosen to approximately correspond to a researcher having completed a PhD and published original research in a refereed journal. HelioIndex is intended to be a comprehensive directory of SHP authors that is generated and maintained through software procedures, with minimal human intervention. At the time of writing, 1910 SHP researchers are listed in HelioIndex and they belong to 55 countries. The countries with the largest numbers of researchers are the US, China and the UK, with 29%, 15%, and 8% of the total, respectively. HelioIndex authors average 0.69 first author papers per year over their careers, and the median citations for a paper is 15. Based on journal keyword data, it is estimated that 57% and 28% of HelioIndex authors belong to solar physics and heliospheric physics, respectively, with the remainder overlapping both disciplines.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of the G8 subgiant beta Aquilae with SONG-Tenerife, SONG-Australia and TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present radial velocities of the G8 subgiant star beta Aql obtained in 2022 and 2023 using SONG-Tenerife and SONG-Australia. We also analysed a sector of TESS photometry that overlapped with the 2022 SONG data. We processed the time series to assign weights and to remove bad data points. The power spectrum clearly shows solar-like oscillations centred at 430 muHz. The TESS data show the oscillations at lower signal-to-noise because photometric measurements are much more affected by the granulation background than are radial velocities. The simultaneous observations in velocity and photometry represent the best such measurements for any star apart from the Sun. They allowed us to measure the ratio between the two to be 26.6+/-3.1 ppm/(m/s). We measured this ratio for the Sun from published SOHO data to be 19.5+/-0.7 ppm/(m/s) and, after accounting for the difference in effective temperatures of the beta Aql and the Sun, these values align with expectations. In both the Sun and beta Aql, the photometry-to-velocity ratio appears to be a function of frequency. We also measured the phase shift of the oscillations in beta Aql between SONG velocities and TESS photometry to be -113+/-7 deg, which agrees within uncertainties with the value for the Sun and also with a 3-D simulation of a star with similar properties to beta Aql. Importantly for exoplanet searches, we argue that simultaneous photometry can be used to predict the contribution of oscillations to radial velocities. We identified and measured frequencies for 22 oscillation modes in beta Aql with angular degrees of l=0, 1 and 2. Asteroseismic modelling yielded an excellent fit to the frequencies, giving accurate values for mass and age, placing quite strong constraints on the mixing-length parameter. Finally, the oscillation properties of beta Aql are very similar to subgiants and low-luminosity RGB stars in the open cluster M67.</description>

      <title>Huntsman may need to be irradiated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars, and it is now widely accepted that their extremely short rotation periods result from the accretion of material from a companion star. Binary evolution theory predicts that millisecond pulsars can have various types of companion stars. However, in observations, binary pulsars with giant companions, referred to as ``huntsman pulsars'', are extremely rare. Following the initial discovery of the first huntsman pulsar, 1FGL J1417.7-4407, a second huntsman millisecond pulsar binary, PSR J1947-1120, has been recently reported approximately a decade later. In this paper, we model the formation and evolution of two huntsman pulsars. Our model with the irradiation effect can explain the observed properties of huntsman pulsar binaries and suggests that if the irradiation effect is considered, the companion star may be a normal red giant star, rather than just a red bump star.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical modelling of Type IIb SNe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present HYDE, a new one-dimensional hydrodynamical code, and use it to construct a grid of supernova (SN) models based on solar-metallicity bare helium-core models evolved to the verge of core-collapse with MESA STAR. This grid is suited to model Type IIb SNe, which progenitor stars are thought to have lost all but a tiny fraction of their hydrogen envelopes. Using an automated procedure we fit the bolometric lightcurves and photospheric velocities for a large sample of (17) Type IIb SNe to the grid of SN models. We find that the distribution of initial masses for the sample can be reasonably well described by a standard Salpeter IMF, although there is an under-population in the &gt;25 M$_\odot$ range. The fractions of SNe with initial masses &lt;15 M$_\odot$ and &lt;20 M$_\odot$ are 56 and 81 percent, respectively, suggesting either the binary channel to dominate the production of Type IIb SNe or a flaw in our understanding of single-star mass-loss. We find correlations between the explosion energy, initial mass and mass of $^{56}$Ni; the explosion energy increases with initial mass and the mass of $^{56}$Ni increases with explosion energy. The method used allows us to determine the errors in the model parameters arising from the observed quantities and the degeneracy of the solution. We find that an error in the distance and extinction propagates mainly to the derived mass of $^{56}$Ni, whereas an error in the photospheric velocity propagates mainly to the derived helium-core mass and explosion energy. Fits using the bolometric lightcurve alone are completely degenerate along the M$_{\mathrm{ej}}^{2}$/E$_{\mathrm{ej}}$=const curve, whereas fits using also the photospheric velocities are quite robust for well-sampled SNe. Finally, we provide a description and tests of the HYDE code, and a discussion of the limitations of the method used.</description>

      <title>Population Synthesis Study on the Binary Origin of Type Ibn Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ibn supernovae (SNe) are a class of SN explosions whose progenitors are surrounded by dense helium-rich circumstellar matter (CSM). Some models have been proposed for how to form the dense CSM, with promising scenarios involving either binaries with a low-mass ($\lesssim 3~M_\odot$) helium (He) star, or mergers following common envelope phases between a He star and a compact object. Using rapid binary population synthesis calculations, we estimate the event rate of these channels and compare it with the observed SN Ibn rate. We find that exploding low-mass He stars in close binaries (of separations $\lesssim$ a few 100 $R_\odot$) can be sufficiently produced to account for the observed event rate of SN Ibn, while the merger scenario can likely account for only a fraction of these SNe. We discuss the types of companions expected in the low-mass He star scenario, finding massive main sequence stars ($10$--$20\ M_\odot$) to be typical, with a potentially non-negligible fraction ($&lt;10\%$) of binaries with WD companions that have long delay times of up to $100$ Myrs.</description>

      <title>Shaping core dynamos in A-type stars: The role of dipolar fossil fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale magnetic fields of Ap/Bp stars are stable over long timescales and have typically simple dipolar geometries, leading to the idea of a fossil origin. These stars are also expected to have convective cores that can host strong dynamo action. We aim to study the interaction between the magnetic fields generated by the convective core dynamo of the star, and a dipolar fossil field reminiscent of observed magnetic topologies of Ap/Bp stars. We use numerical 3D star-in-a-box simulations of a $2.2M_\odot$ A-type star, where the core encompasses $20\%$ of the stellar radius. As an initial condition, we impose two purely poloidal configurations, both with a surface dipolar strength of 6 kG, and we explore different obliquity angles $\beta$ (the angle between the magnetic and rotational axes), ranging from $0^\circ$ to $90^\circ$. The inclusion of a poloidal field where none of the magnetic field lines are closed inside the star, does not affect the core dynamo in a significant way. Dipolar configurations where all the field lines are closed inside the star can enhance the dynamo, producing a superequipartition quasi-stationary solution, where the magnetic energy is 5 times stronger than the kinetic energy. The enhanced core dynamos have typical magnetic field strengths between 105 and 172 kG, where the strength has an inverse relation with $\beta$. The strong magnetic fields produce an almost rigid rotation in the radiative envelope, and change the differential rotation of the core from solar-like to anti-solar. The only cases where the imposed dipoles are unstable and decay are those with $\beta = 90^\circ$. In the rest of cases, the core dynamos are enhanced and the surface magnetic field survives keeping simple topologies like in the observations.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Forbidden Neon Emission lines in HAeBe Stars using Spitzer IRS spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed high-resolution mid-infrared spectra of 78 well-known Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars using Spitzer InfraRed Spectrograph data, focusing on the detection of [Ne {\sc II}] and [Ne {\sc III}] emission lines as indicators of ionized outflows or disk winds. Emission from [Ne {\sc II}] at 12.81 $\mu$m or [Ne {\sc III}] at 15.55 $\mu$m was identified in 25 sources, constituting the largest sample of HAeBe stars with these detected lines. Our analysis revealed a higher detection frequency of [Ne {\sc II}] in sources with lower relative accretion luminosity (L$_{acc}$/L$_*$ $&lt;$ 0.1), suggesting a connection to the disk dispersal phase. We examined correlations between neon lines and various spectral features and investigated [Ne {\sc III}]-to-[Ne {\sc II}] line flux ratios to explore potential emission mechanisms. Neon emission is predominantly observed in Group I sources (75\%), where their flared disk geometry likely contributes to the observed emission, potentially originating from the irradiated disk atmosphere. Interestingly, we also find that Group II sources exhibit a higher median relative [Ne\,\textsc{ii}] line luminosity (L$_\mathrm{[Ne\,II]}$/L$_*$), suggesting enhanced photoevaporation rates possibly associated with their more settled disk structures. However, larger samples and higher-resolution spectra are required to confirm this trend definitively. The high detection rate of the [Fe {\sc II}] and [S {\sc III}] lines, commonly associated with EUV-dominated regions, alongside a [Ne {\sc III}]-to-[Ne {\sc II}] emission ratio greater than 0.1 in sources where both lines detected, suggests that EUV radiation is the primary driver of neon emission in our sample.</description>

      <title>Solar Surface Magnetic Field Simulation from 2010 to 2024 and Anomalous Southern Poleward Flux Transport in Cycle 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar surface magnetic field is fundamental for modeling the coronal magnetic field, studying the solar dynamo, and predicting solar cycle strength. We perform a continuous simulation of the surface magnetic field from 2010 to 2024, covering solar cycle 24 and the ongoing cycle 25, using the surface flux transport model with assimilated observed active regions (ARs) as the source. The simulation reproduces the evolution of the axial dipole strength, polar field reversal timing, and magnetic butterfly diagram in good agreement with SDO/HMI observations. Notably, these results are achieved without incorporating radial diffusion or cyclic variations in meridional flow speed, suggesting their limited impact. Poleward surges of the following polarity typically dominate throughout the cycle, but in the southern hemisphere during cycle 24, they are limited to a short period from 2011 to 2016. This anomalous pattern arises from intermittent AR emergence, with about 46% of total unsigned flux contributed by ARs emerging during Carrington Rotations 2141-2160 (September 2013 - February 2015). These ARs show a strong active longitude at Carrington longitudes 200-260 degree and a weaker one at 80-100 degree. After 2016, poleward migrations of leading-polarity flux become dominant, despite most ARs following Joy's and Hale's laws. This reversal is likely due to prolonged intervals between AR emergences, which allow leading-polarity flux to distribute across a broad latitude range before cancellation by subsequent ARs. These findings highlight the importance of the temporal interval of AR emergence in driving the flux transport pattern.</description>

      <title>RS Sagittarii: Revealing the component spectra and the mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of high-resolution (R ~ 48000) spectroscopic and photometric data of RS Sgr, a short-period Algol-type binary system. For the first time, precise spectroscopic and absolute parameters of the system have been determined. The primary component is identified as a B3 main-sequence star with an effective temperature of 19000K, while the secondary is classified as an A0-type star with a temperature of 9700 K. The secondary appears to have recently evolved off the main sequence and currently fills its Roche lobe, transferring material through the inner Lagrangian point (L1) to the hotter primary component. The H{\alpha} emission and absorption features observed in the spectra are attributed to a combination of a low-density circumprimary disk, a gas stream originating from the secondary, and a hot spot formed at the impact site on the primary. The combined analysis of spectroscopic and photometric data yields a system distance of approximately 418 pc, which is consistent with the value derived from GAIA DR3 within the uncertainty limits.</description>

      <title>Probing the Turbulent Corona and Heliosphere Using Radio Spectral Imaging Observation during the Solar Conjunction of Crab Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring plasma parameters in the upper solar corona and inner heliosphere is challenging because of the region's weakly emissive nature and inaccessibility for most in situ observations. Radio imaging of broadened and distorted background astronomical radio sources during solar conjunction can provide unique constraints for the coronal material along the line of sight. In this study, we present radio spectral imaging observations of the Crab Nebula (Tau A) from June 9 to June 22, 2024 when it was near the Sun with a projected heliocentric distance of 5 to 27 solar radii, using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory's Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) at multiple frequencies in the 30--80 MHz range. The imaging data reveal frequency-dependent broadening and distortion effects caused by anisotropic wave propagation through the turbulent solar corona at different distances. We analyze the brightness, size, and anisotropy of the broadened images. Our results provide detailed observations showing that the eccentricity of the unresolved source increases as the line of sight approaches the Sun, suggesting a higher anisotropic ratio of the plasma turbulence closer to the Sun. In addition, the major axis of the elongated source is consistently oriented in the direction perpendicular to the radial direction, suggesting that the turbulence-induced scattering effect is more pronounced in the direction transverse to the coronal magnetic field. Lastly, when the source undergoes large-scale refraction as the line of sight passes through a streamer, the apparent source exhibits substructures at lower frequencies. This study demonstrates that observations of celestial radio sources with lines of sight near the Sun provide a promising method for measuring turbulence parameters in the inner heliosphere.</description>

Four of the diameters ranged from 1.2 mas to 1.9 mas, while the two others were much smaller at approximately 0.5 mas to 0.7 mas, which are the two smallest angular diameters measured to date with the NPOI. There is a larger spread in the measurements than data obtained with 3- or 4- or 5-element modes, which can be attributed in part to the flux imbalance due to the combination of more than 2 siderostats in a single spectrograph, and also to cross talk between multiple baselines related to non-linearities in the fast delay line dither strokes. We plan to address this in the future by using the VISION beam combiner.</description>

      <title>Power density spectra morphologies of seismically unresolved red-giant asteroseismic binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismic binaries are two oscillating stars detected in a single light curve. These systems provide robust constraints on stellar models from the combination of dynamical and asteroseismical stellar parameters. Predictions suggested that approximately 200 asteroseismic binaries may exist among the Kepler long-cadence data, and the majority of them consist of two red-clump stars. However, detecting these systems is challenging when the binary components exhibit oscillations at similar frequencies that are indistinguishable. In this study, we predict the morphologies of power density spectra (PDS) of seismically unresolved red-giant asteroseismic binaries to provide examples that can be used to identify among observed stars. We created 5,000 artificial asteroseismic binary (AAB) systems by combining the KASOC light curves of red giants with oscillations at similar frequency ranges. To quantify the complexity of the oscillation patterns, we used the maximum signal-to-noise ratio of the background-normalized PDS and Shannon entropy. Additionally, we identified the radial and quadrupole mode pairs for the individual binary components and determined their impact on the PDS morphologies of AABs. Our results reveal that the majority of AABs consist of the two red-clump stars. The PDS of AABs generally exhibits increased entropy and decreased oscillation power compared to individual components. We focused on the AABs whose stellar components have similar brightness and classified them into four distinct morphologies: single star-like PDS, aligned, partially aligned, and misaligned. Most AABs with detectable oscillations from both components show complex oscillation patterns. Therefore, unresolved asteroseismic binaries with low oscillation power and complex oscillation patterns as characterized by high entropy offer a potential explanation to understand the observed stars with complex PDS.</description>

      <title>Critical Metallicity of Cool Supergiant Formation. II. Physical Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the physical origin of the critical metallicity ($Z_{\rm c}\sim 0.001$) required for the formation of cool supergiants, as revealed by stellar evolution models. Using model grids that vary in mass, metallicity, opacity, and nuclear reaction rates, we identify a threshold terminal-age main-sequence (TAMS) radius ($R_{\rm T}$) that determines whether a star of a given mass can evolve into the red supergiant (RSG) phase. Through stellar models and homology relations, we show that metallicity affects the TAMS radius via its influence on opacity and nuclear energy generation. By classifying the evolutionary pathways of supergiants, we demonstrate how TAMS radius, shaped by metallicity, decisively governs the post-main-sequence outcome: Stars with metallicities $Z &lt; Z_{\rm c}$ exhibit TAMS radii smaller than $R_{\rm T}$ and proceed to advanced core helium or carbon burning while retaining compact envelopes, thereby preventing further expansion into the RSG regime. In contrast, stars with $Z &gt; Z_{\rm c}$ have TAMS radii larger than $R_{\rm T}$ and expand into the stable RSG phase during core helium burning. The envelope radius at the onset of core helium burning is the key factor determining whether a star becomes a red or blue supergiant. Our results explain the origin of the critical metallicity and offer insight into the evolution of metal-poor massive stars in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Complete survey of r-process conditions: the (un-)robustness of the r-process(-es)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy elements are synthesized by the r-process in neutron star mergers and potentially in rare supernovae linked to strong magnetic fields. Expensive hydrodynamic simulations of these extreme environments are usually post-processed to calculate the nucleosynthesis. In contrast, here we follow a site-independent approach based on three key parameters: electron fraction, entropy, and expansion timescale. Our model reproduces the results based on hydrodynamic simulations. Moreover, the 120 000 astrophysical conditions analyzed allow us to systematically and generally explore the astrophysical conditions of the r-process, also beyond those found in current simulations. Our results show that a wide range of conditions produce very similar abundance patterns explaining the observed robustness of the r-process between the second and third peak. Furthermore, we cannot find a single condition that produces the full r-process from first to third peak. Instead, a superposition of at least two or three conditions or components is required to reproduce the typical r-process pattern as observed in the solar system and very old stars. The different final abundances are grouped into eight nucleosynthesis clusters, which can be used to select representative conditions for comparisons to observations and investigations of the nuclear physics input.</description>

      <title>Stellar populations in STARFORGE II: Comparison with observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that most star-forming regions in our Galaxy form stellar associations rather than bound clusters. We analyse models from the STARFORGE simulation suite, a set of magneto-hydrodynamical simulations that include all key stellar feedback and radiative processes following star formation through cloud dispersal. We create synthetic observations by introducing observational biases such as random spurious measurements, unresolved binaries, and photometric sensitivity. These biases affect the measurement of the group mass, size, and velocity dispersion, introducing uncertainties of up to 100%, with accuracy improving as the number of system members increases. Furthermore, models favouring the formation of groups around massive stars were the most affected by observational biases, as massive stars contribute a larger fraction of the group mass and are often missing from astrometric surveys like Gaia. We compare the simulations to the Cepheus Far North (CFN) region, and show that CFN groups may have formed in a low-density environment similar to those modelled in STARFORGE but with massive stars not located preferentially in groups. We also question the effectiveness of the kinematic traceback method, showing that it is accurate within 20% only for certain associations with actual virial parameters above 2. However, observational biases can artificially raise the virial parameter by up to a factor ten, making it difficult to evaluate the reliability of the traceback age. Additionally, since stars continue to form during the dispersal of the parent cloud, we find no relation between the stellar-dynamical age difference and the length of the embedded phase.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Gaia Enceladus experiencing at least two passages around the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the major recent breakthroughs has been the discovery of the last Major Merger to happen in the history of the Milky Way. Around 10 Gyr ago the galaxy Gaia Enceladus, with estimated ~10% of the Milky Way mass, fell into its potential, bringing a large amount of stars which can be identified through their unique chemical and kinematic signatures. Simulations have long predicted that a galaxy of this size should experience several passages through the disk of the Milky Way before eventually being fully dispersed. For the first time, we present observational evidence to support this. We identify two subpopulations accreted from Gaia Enceladus: 1) stars which today have large kinematic energy, which originate from the outskirts of Gaia Enceladus and were accreted during early passages; 2) stars with low kinetic energy accreted at later passages, originating from the inner parts of Gaia Enceladus. Through the use of high-precision chemical abundances, crucially including new aluminum measurements, we show that in all observed abundance ratios ([Fe/H], [Al/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and [Mg/Ba]), stars with high energy show evidence of coming from a less chemically evolved outer region of Gaia Enceladus, compared to the stars with low energy. We therefore conclude that Gaia Enceladus experienced several passages before merging with the main body of our Galaxy. This discovery has wide implications for our understanding of this event, and consolidates Gaia Enceladus as a benchmark for studying galaxy mergers and hierarchical galaxy formation in extraordinary details.</description>

      <title>Star-Planet Interactions: A Computational View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are several physical processes that mediate the interaction between an exoplanet and its host star, with the four main ones being due to magnetic, particle (stellar outflow), radiative and tidal interactions. These interactions can be observed at different wavelengths, from X-ray to radio. Their strengths depend on the architecture of planetary systems, as well as the age and activity level of the host stars. In particular, exoplanets in close-in orbits and/or orbiting active host stars can experience strong physical interactions, some of which are negligible or absent in the present-day Solar System planets. Here, I present an overview of star-planet interactions through the lens of three-dimensional (3D) numerical models. The main conclusions are:
  * Models are fundamental to interpret and guide observations. The powerful combination of observations and models allows us to extract important physical parameters of the system, such as, planetary magnetic fields, stellar wind properties, etc.
  * The non-axisymmetric forces of the interactions generate spatially asymmetric features (e.g., planetary material trailing the orbit, shock formation), thus requiring the use of 3D models.
  * Star-planet interactions vary in different timescales (from hours to giga-years) that are related to both planetary (orbital motion, rotation) and stellar (flares, cycles, and long-term evolution) properties. Understanding these variations require time-dependent models.
  I advocate that future 3D models should be informed by multi-wavelength, (near-)simultaneous observations. The use of observations is twofold: some generate inputs for models (eg stellar magnetic field maps), whereas others are fitted by models (eg spectroscopic transits). This combination of observations and models provides a powerful tool to derive physical properties of the system that would otherwise remain unknown.</description>

      <title>Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program (CCHP) A Multi-Wavelength Search for the Effects of Metallicity on the Cepheid Distance Scale. Part II: Theoretical Models and Synthetic Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second of two papers exploring the effects of metallicity on the multi-wavelength properties of Cepheids in terms of their multi-wavelength period-luminosity (PL) relations, impacting their use as extragalactic distance indicators, underpinning one of the most popular paths to estimating of the expansion rate of the Universe, Ho. In Paper I (Madore &amp; Freedman 2024) we presented five tests for the influence of metallicity on galactic and extragalactic Cepheid PL relations, spanning nearly 2 dex in metallicity, and inspecting PL relations from the optical (BVI), through the near-infrared (JHK) and into mid-infrared (at 3.4 and 4.5 microns). And,in no case were any statistically significant results forthcoming. Here we interrogate published spectral energy distributions constructed from theoretical (static) stellar atmospheres, covering the surface gravity and temperature ranges attributed to classical (supergiant, F and K spectral type) Cepheid variables, and explore the differential effects of changing the atmospheric metallicity, down by 2 dex from solar (a factor of 100 below the average Milky Way value) and then up from solar by 0.5 dex (i.e., factor of 3x above the Milky Way value). The theoretical models clearly show that metallicity systematically impacts each of the bandpasses differentially: the level of this effect is largest in the ultraviolet (where line blanketing is most intense), reversing sign in the optical (due to flux redistribution from the UV), and then asymptotically falling back to zero from the red to the far infrared. The discovered effects of metallicity are systematic, but they are small; and as such they do not contradict the findings of Paper I, but they do explain why the problem has been so hard to resolve given the low level of precision of the photometry for all but the very nearest and apparently brightest Cepheids.</description>

Abstract: This is a summary of an invited talk given at the Moriond Gravitation meeting on March 31, 2025. I touch on some of the practical challenges of measuring the mass spectrum of merging binary black holes through their gravitational-wave signatures. I then describe my take on the current state of interpreting the observed binary black hole mass spectrum from the perspective of models for the formation of these sources. I conclude that meaningful progress must rely on the combination of gravitational-wave observations and a broad range of electromagnetic observations of massive stellar binaries at earlier stages of their evolution. This is my very personal and necessarily brief take on the current state of the field and does not aspire to the balance or completeness of a review.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Polarization Survey. V. Galactic magnetic field tomography in the spiral arms using optical and near-infrared starlight polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar linear polarization occurs when starlight passes through elongated dust grains aligned by interstellar magnetic fields. The observed polarization can come from different dust structures along the line of sight (LOS). By combining polarization measurements with stellar distances, we can study the plane-of-sky Galactic magnetic field (GMF) between the observer and the star and separate the contributions of clouds with different GMF properties. We used optical and near-infrared (NIR) polarization data from three regions in the Galactic plane ($|b|&lt;1^{\circ}$ and $19.\!\!^{\circ}8&lt;l&lt;25.\!\!^{\circ}5$) to perform a polarization decomposition across the Galactic arms. A comparison between optical and NIR data showed an optical-to-NIR polarization ratio of 2 to 3 along the LOS and a consistent polarization angle across both wavelengths in all studied regions, within measurement uncertainties. We applied the Bayesian Inference of Starlight Polarization in one dimension and the Gaussian Mixture Model methods to decompose the polarization in the three regions. Optical and NIR observations complemented each other, consistently identifying nearby ($d\lesssim143$ pc), intermediate ($0.47$ kpc $&lt; d &lt; 1.2$ kpc), and distant ($1.5$ kpc $&lt; d &lt; 2.5$ kpc) polarizing clouds, in agreement with previous findings in the Local Bubble wall, the Local arm, and the Sagittarius arm dust structures. The results from both polarization decomposition methods agree and complement each other. Polarization tomography revealed significant LOS variations in the plane-of-sky magnetic field orientation in two of the three regions. The relative alignment between the magnetic fields traced by starlight polarization and Planck's polarized thermal dust emission at 353 GHz reaffirmed these variations.</description>

      <title>Finding White Dwarfs' Hidden Companions using an Unsupervised Machine Learning Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WD) with main-sequence (MS) companions are crucial probes of stellar evolution. However, due to the significant difference in their luminosities, the WD is often outshined by the MS star. The aim of this work is to find hidden companions in Gaia's sample of WD candidates. Our methodology involves applying an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for dimensionality reduction and clustering, known as Self-Organizing Map (SOM), to Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra. This strategy allows us to naturally separate WDMS binaries from single WDs from the detection of subtle red flux excesses in the XP spectra that are indicative of low-mass MS companions. We validate our approach using confirmed WDMS binaries from the SDSS and LAMOST surveys, achieving a precision of $\sim 90\%$. We demonstrated that the luminosity of the faint companions in the missed systems is $\sim 50$ times lower than that of their WD primaries. Applying our SOM to 90,667 sources, we identify 993 WDMS candidates, 506 of which have not been previously reported in the literature. If confirmed, our sample will increase the known WDMS binaries by $20\%$. Additionally, we use the Virtual Observatory Spectral Energy Distribution Analyzer (VOSA) tool to refine and parameterize a ``golden sample'' of 136 WDMS binaries through multi-wavelength photometry and a two-body Spectral Energy Distribution fitting. These high-confidence WDMS binaries are composed by low-mass WDs ($\sim 0.42 M_{\odot}$), with cool MS companions ($\sim 2800$ K). Finally, 13 systems exhibit periodic variability consistent with eclipsing binaries, making them prime targets for further follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>A 1.48-2.48 $\mathrm{\mu}$m R=28000 spectroscopic atlas of the L7.5 and T0.5 components of the nearest pair of brown dwarfs: Luhman 16AB</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a high signal-to-noise (SNR $\sim$ 450), high-dispersion ($R \equiv \lambda / \Delta \lambda \sim 28\,000$) H- and K-band spectroscopic atlas of the L7.5 and T0.5 components of the Luhman 16AB binary (WISE J104915.57$-$531906.1AB): the closest pair of brown dwarfs, and one of the best substellar benchmarks. The spectra were combined from a 70-day spectroscopic monitoring campaign of the binary with IGRINS on Gemini South. We fit model photospheres to the combined high-quality spectra to estimate atmospheric parameters. The model is based on the Sonora model atmosphere further incorporating the effects of clouds and disequilibrium. We detect ammonia (NH3) lines in both binary components, making Luhman 16A the warmest object where individual NH3 lines were identified. We discover hydrogen (H2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and hydrogen fluoride (HF) lines in both components, following recent reports of these species in either cooler (H2, H2S in a T6 dwarf) or warmer (HF in young late-M or mid-L dwarfs) objects. Methane (CH4) shows a small contribution, with lines sensitive to the slight temperature difference spanning the L/T transition. Against model expectations, we do not detect FeH lines, implying more efficient iron rainout than incorporated in the models. We find various unidentified features in water-dominated regions, likely the result of residual inaccuracies in the water line lists. We searched for planetary-mass companions by periodogram analysis of radial velocities over 70 days but detected no significant signal. The upper limits of projected planetary mass are $M\sin{i}=$ 0.2 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ and 0.3 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ at P $\sim$ 1 day, and 0.4 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ and 0.7 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ at P $\sim$ 10 days for Luhman 16A and B, respectively.</description>

      <title>Methods to Test the Source of the Extreme Gas Motions in WS 35</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present theoretical arguments toward the plausibility of a stellar wind to explain the 16000 km s$^{-1}$ line broadening in the optical spectra of WS 35, the central star in the Pa 30 nebula. The wind model is discussed in the context of super-Eddington flows. We argue that WS 35 potentially occupies a new regime of wind driving theory as the first metal-only wind. While this framework provides a promising avenue for explaining the high speed flow, questions remain about the source's true nature. We further describe how future radio observations can provide an independent test of the spherical wind scenario. A magnetically channeled wind would likely produce a relatively flat and bright radio spectral energy distributions. By contrast a spherical wind should result in a thermal radio spectrum with a canonical continuum slope of $\nu^{0.6}$, and a brightness level consistent with the currently predicted mass-loss rate.</description>

      <title>Flavor composition of supernova neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the flavor composition of neutrinos from supernovae is a challenging task, primarily due to the high neutrino densities at their core. In such an environment, neutrino self-interactions give rise to collective effects that have dramatic yet poorly understood consequences for their flavor evolution. In this paper, however, we show that standard matter effects in the outer layers of supernovae can significantly constrain the flavor composition of the neutrino flux. We assume that, since a large number of neutrinos undergo different evolutions within the core, their state upon entering the MSW-dominated region is affected by decoherence. This assumption simplifies the problem and suggests that the fraction of neutrinos with electron flavor reaching Earth, denoted as $f_{\nu_e}$, is constrained to be less than $0.5$ for all energies throughout the emission phase in the case of normal mass ordering. In contrast, for inverted mass ordering, we anticipate neutrinos arriving in near flavor equipartition ($f_{\nu_e} \approx 1/3$). These predictions, and consequently their underlying assumptions, could be tested by future observations and may provide valuable insights into the properties of neutrino fluxes emerging from supernovae.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric retrieval of Subaru/IRD high-resolution spectrum of the archetype T-type brown dwarf Gl 229 B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs provide a unique opportunity to study atmospheres and their physical and chemical processes with high precision, especially in temperature ranges relevant to exoplanets. In this study, we performed high-resolution ($R \sim 70,000$) spectroscopy using Subaru/IRD ($Y$, $J$, $H$-bands) of the T7.0p-type object Gl 229 B, the first discovered T-type brown dwarf, which orbits an M1V host star at a separation of 33 au. We conducted atmospheric retrieval on the reduced $H$-band spectrum using the high-resolution spectrum model compatible with automatic differentiation and GPU, ExoJAX. In contrast to previous retrieval studies on medium-resolution spectra, we obtained a C/O ratio consistent with that of the host star, aligning with the expected formation process for such a massive brown dwarf. Additionally, based on the strong constraint on temperature from the high-resolution spectrum and previously measured photometric magnitude, our analysis indicates that Gl 229 B is a binary, which was also proposed by Brandt et al. (2021) and recently confirmed by Xuan et al. (2024). Finally, we validated current molecular line lists by leveraging the obtained high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum of this warm ($\sim 900$ K) atmosphere. This study highlights the importance of observing companion brown dwarfs as benchmark objects for establishing characterization techniques for low-mass objects and enhancing our understanding of their atmospheres, given the wealth of available information and the relative ease of observation.</description>

      <title>Radiative Capture Reaction $d(\alpha,\gamma)^{6}\mathrm{Li} $ in Cluster Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on the radiative capture process of the deuteron on alpha particle leading to the formation of $^6{\textrm{Li}}$ in the two-body formalism through the cluster effective field theory~(CEFT). It was the primitive nuclear reaction to produce ${^6 \textrm{Li}}$ in a few minutes after the Big Bang. In detail, we outline the calculation of the dominant $E1$ and $E2$ electromagnetic transition amplitudes of $d(\alpha,\gamma ){^6\textrm{Li}}$. Then, we obtain the astrophysical S-factor by fitting it to the experimental data. Finally, we compare the obtained CEFT results for the astrophysical S-factor with the other theoretical results.</description>

      <title>The JWST EXCELS survey: an extremely metal-poor galaxy at $z=8.271$ hosting an unusual population of massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11099v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical ($\lambda \simeq 3100-5600 \,$\r{A}) spectrum of a $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}) = 8.6$ star-forming galaxy at $z=8.271$ from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. The galaxy (EXCELS-63107) is compact, with a size consistent with the size of local star-forming cluster complexes ($r_e &lt; 200 \, \rm{pc}$) and has an extremely steep UV continuum measured from JWST/NIRCam photometry ($\beta=-3.3\pm0.3$). The JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectrum of EXCELS-63107 is notable for its strong [OIII]$\lambda4363$ auroral-line emission relative to the [OIII]$\lambda5007$ forbidden line. Via a detailed emission-line and photoionization-modelling analysis, we find that the the observed properties of EXCELS-63107 are consistent with the presence of an ionizing source with an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff} \gtrsim 80 \, 000\,\rm{K}$ heating ionized gas with a density of $n_e &lt; 10^4 \, \rm{cm}^{-3}$ to a volume-averaged electron temperature of $T_e \simeq 34 \, 000\,\rm{K}$. Crucially, we find that stellar population models assuming a standard IMF are not capable of producing the required heating. We determine an oxygen abundance of ${12+\mathrm{log(O/H)}= 6.89^{+0.26}_{-0.21}}$ which is one of the lowest directly constrained oxygen abundances measured in any galaxy to date, and $\simeq 10 \times$ lower than is typical for $z\simeq8$ galaxies with the same stellar mass. The extremely low metallicity of EXCELS-63107 places it in a regime in which theoretical models expect a transition to a top-heavy IMF, and we speculate that a $\simeq 10-30 \, \times$ excess of $M &gt; 50 \, \rm{M}_{\odot}$ stars is one plausible explanation for its observed properties. However, more exotic scenarios, such as Pop III star formation within a mildly enriched halo, are also consistent with the observations.</description>

      <title>The Gaia spectroscopic catalogue of exoplanets and host stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complete, accurate, and precise catalogues of exoplanet host star (EHS) properties are essential to deriving high-quality exoplanet parameters. This paper aims at homogeneously parameterising EHS and their exoplanets, using Gaia and GSP-spec data. For 2573 EHS, we computed their L*, R*, and M*, with no prior assumption from stellar evolution models. Their Galactic positions, kinematic and orbital properties were derived. We re-scaled Mp and Rp of 3556 exoplanets, fully consistently with the stellar data. These new stellar Teff, L*, and R* are in rather good agreement with literature values but are more precise. In particular, R* are derived with typically less than 3% uncertainty; this reduces the uncertainty on Rp significantly and allows for a finer analysis of the decrease in the number of planets around the evaporation valley. Larger differences, however, were found for M*. We note that the EHS population is rather diverse in terms of the chemical and Galactic properties, although they are all found in the Solar vicinity, close to the Local spiral arm. Most EHS belong to the thin disc, but some older thick disc and halo members have also been identified. For the less massive planets, the average Rp increases with the metallicity of the host star. For giant planets, a dichotomy between dense and inflated planets is found. Denser planets tend to be more massive as the metallicity of the host star increases, while inflated planets are more massive for less metallic hosts. If confirmed, this bimodality implies that the diversity of giant exoplanets depends on their Galactic birth locus, with dense giant planets being more numerous than inflated ones when [M/H]&gt;~1.5 times Solar, as in the central Milky Way regions. The Gaia spectroscopic catalogue of exoplanets and their host stars is large, homogeneous, and precise. It would be a useful added-value for planetary studies.</description>
