      <title>"All You Need" is Not All You Need for a Paper Title: On the Origins of a Scientific Meme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2017 paper ''Attention Is All You Need'' introduced the Transformer architecture-and inadvertently spawned one of machine learning's most persistent naming conventions. We analyze 717 arXiv preprints containing ''All You Need'' in their titles (2009-2025), finding exponential growth ($R^2$ &gt; 0.994) following the original paper, with 200 titles in 2025 alone. Among papers following the canonical ''X [Is] All You Need'' structure, ''Attention'' remains the most frequently claimed necessity (28 occurrences). Situating this phenomenon within memetic theory, we argue the pattern's success reflects competitive pressures in scientific communication that increasingly favor memorability over precision. Whether this trend represents harmless academic whimsy or symptomatic sensationalism, we leave-with appropriate self-awareness-to the reader.</description>

      <title>CS-Guide: Leveraging LLMs and Student Reflections to Provide Frequent, Scalable Academic Monitoring Feedback to Computer Science Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer Science (CS) departments often serve large student populations, making timely academic monitoring and personalized feedback difficult. While the recommended counselor-to-student ratio is 250:1, it often exceeds 350:1 in practice, leading to delays in support and interventions. We present CS-Guide, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver scalable, frequent academic feedback. Weekly, students interact with CS-Guide through self-reported grades and reflective journal entries, from which CS-Guide extracts quantitative and qualitative features and triggers tailored interventions (e.g., academic support, health and wellness referrals). Thus, CS-Guide uniquely integrates learning analytics, LLMs, and actionable interventions using both structured and unstructured student-generated data.
  We evaluated CS-Guide on a four-year, ~20K-entry longitudinal dataset, and it achieved up to a 97% F1 score in recommending interventions for first-year students. This shows that CS-Guide can enhance advising systems with scalable, consistent, timely, and domain-specific feedback.</description>

      <title>Prediction Air Temperature in Geothermal Heat Exchangers Using Pseudorandom Numbers: The New DARL Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of Earth-Air-Water Heat Exchangers (EAWHE) for sustainable air conditioning has not been widely studied. Due to their experimental nature, methods of characterizing internal thermal air distribution impose high dependence on instrumentation by sensors and entail data acquisition and computational costs. This document presents an alternative method that estimates air temperature distribution while minimizing the need for a dense network of sensors in the experimental system. The proposed model, DARL (Data of Air and Random Length), can predict the temperature of air circulating inside EAWHEs. DARL is a significant methodological advance that integrates experimental data from boundary conditions with simulations based on pseudo-random numbers (PRNs). These PRNs are generated using Fermat's prime numbers as seeds to initialize the generator. Ordinary linear regressions and robust statistical validations, including the Shapiro-Wilk test and root mean square error, have demonstrated that the model can estimate the thermal distribution of air at different lengths with a relative error of less than 6.2%. These results demonstrate the model's efficiency, predictive capacity, and potential to reduce dependence on sensors.</description>

      <title>Leveraging High-Fidelity Digital Models and Reinforcement Learning for Mission Engineering: A Case Study of Aerial Firefighting Under Perfect Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As systems engineering (SE) objectives evolve from design and operation of monolithic systems to complex System of Systems (SoS), the discipline of Mission Engineering (ME) has emerged which is increasingly being accepted as a new line of thinking for the SE community. Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance. Thus, this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that DE-enabled mission simulations combined with advanced analytical tools offer a mission-agnostic framework for improving ME practice; which can be extended to more complicated fleet design and selection problems in the future from a mission-first perspective.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual LLM-based Framework for Measuring Rhetorical Style</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of AI has fueled growing concerns about ``hype'' in machine learning papers, yet a reliable way to quantify rhetorical style independently of substantive content has remained elusive. Because bold language can stem from either strong empirical results or mere rhetorical style, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two. To disentangle rhetorical style from substantive content, we introduce a counterfactual, LLM-based framework: multiple LLM rhetorical personas generate counterfactual writings from the same substantive content, an LLM judge compares them through pairwise evaluations, and the outcomes are aggregated using a Bradley--Terry model. Applying this method to 8,485 ICLR submissions sampled from 2017 to 2025, we generate more than 250,000 counterfactual writings and provide a large-scale quantification of rhetorical style in ML papers. We find that visionary framing significantly predicts downstream attention, including citations and media attention, even after controlling for peer-review evaluations. We also observe a sharp rise in rhetorical strength after 2023, and provide empirical evidence showing that this increase is largely driven by the adoption of LLM-based writing assistance. The reliability of our framework is validated by its robustness to the choice of personas and the high correlation between LLM judgments and human annotations. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can serve as instruments to measure and improve scientific evaluation.</description>

      <title>S$^3$IT: A Benchmark for Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of embodied agents into human environments demands embodied social intelligence: reasoning over both social norms and physical constraints. However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.</description>

      <title>Patterns vs. Patients: Evaluating LLMs against Mental Health Professionals on Personality Disorder Diagnosis through First-Person Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing reliance on LLMs for psychiatric self-assessment raises questions about their ability to interpret qualitative patient narratives. We present the first direct comparison between state-of-the-art LLMs and mental health professionals in diagnosing Borderline (BPD) and Narcissistic (NPD) Personality Disorders utilizing Polish-language first-person autobiographical accounts. We show that the top-performing Gemini Pro models surpassed human professionals in overall diagnostic accuracy by 21.91 percentage points (65.48% vs. 43.57%). While both models and human experts excelled at identifying BPD (F1 = 83.4 &amp; F1 = 80.0, respectively), models severely underdiagnosed NPD (F1 = 6.7 vs. 50.0), showing a reluctance toward the value-laden term "narcissism." Qualitatively, models provided confident, elaborate justifications focused on patterns and formal categories, while human experts remained concise and cautious, emphasizing the patient's sense of self and temporal experience. Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs are highly competent at interpreting complex first-person clinical data, they remain subject to critical reliability and bias issues.</description>

      <title>Understanding Human-AI Trust in Education</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09160v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As AI chatbots become integrated in education, students are turning to these systems for guidance, feedback, and information. However, the anthropomorphic characteristics of these chatbots create ambiguity over whether students develop trust in them in ways similar to trusting a human peer or instructor (human-like trust, often linked to interpersonal trust models) or in ways similar to trusting a conventional technology (system-like trust, often linked to technology trust models). This ambiguity presents theoretical challenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human intentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed for non-social systems, leaving their applicability to conversational, human-like agents unclear. To address this gap, we examine how these two forms of trust, human-like and system-like, comparatively influence students' perceptions of an AI chatbot, specifically perceived enjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived usefulness. Using partial least squares structural equation modeling, we found that both forms of trust significantly influenced student perceptions, though with varied effects. Human-like trust was the stronger predictor of trusting intention, whereas system-like trust more strongly influenced behavioral intention and perceived usefulness; both had similar effects on perceived enjoyment. The results suggest that interactions with AI chatbots give rise to a distinct form of trust, human-AI trust, that differs from human-human and human-technology models, highlighting the need for new theoretical frameworks in this domain. In addition, the study offers practical insights for fostering appropriately calibrated trust, which is critical for the effective adoption and pedagogical impact of AI in education.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Develop Novel Social Biases Through Adaptive Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are adopted into frameworks that grant them the capacity to make real decisions, it is increasingly important to ensure that they are unbiased. In this paper, we argue that the predominant approach of simply removing existing biases from models is not enough. Using a paradigm from the psychology literature, we demonstrate that LLMs can spontaneously develop novel social biases about artificial demographic groups even when no inherent differences exist. These biases result in highly stratified task allocations, which are less fair than assignments by human participants and are exacerbated by newer and larger models. In social science, emergent biases like these have been shown to result from exploration-exploitation trade-offs, where the decision-maker explores too little, allowing early observations to strongly influence impressions about entire demographic groups. To alleviate this effect, we examine a series of interventions targeting model inputs, problem structure, and explicit steering. We find that explicitly incentivizing exploration most robustly reduces stratification, highlighting the need for better multifaceted objectives to mitigate bias. These results reveal that LLMs are not merely passive mirrors of human social biases, but can actively create new ones from experience, raising urgent questions about how these systems will shape societies over time.</description>

      <title>Psychometric Validation of the Sophotechnic Mediation Scale and a New Understanding of the Development of GenAI Mastery: Lessons from 3,932 Adult Brazilian Workers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid diffusion of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems has introduced new forms of human-technology interaction, raising the question of whether sustained engagement gives rise to stable, internalized modes of cognition rather than merely transient efficiency gains. Grounded in the Cognitive Mediation Networks Theory, this study investigates Sophotechnic Mediation, a mode of thinking and acting associated with prolonged interaction with GenAI, and presents a comprehensive psychometric validation of the Sophotechnic Mediation Scale. Data were collected between 2023 and 2025 from independent cross-sectional samples totaling 3,932 adult workers from public and private organizations in the Metropolitan Region of Pernambuco, Brazil. Results indicate excellent internal consistency, a robust unidimensional structure, and measurement invariance across cohorts. Ordinal-robust confirmatory factor analyses and residual diagnostics show that elevated absolute fit indices reflect minor local dependencies rather than incorrect dimensionality. Distributional analyses reveal a time-evolving pattern characterized by a declining mass of non-adopters and convergence toward approximate Gaussianity among adopters, with model comparisons favoring a two-process hurdle model over a censored Gaussian specification. Sophotechnic Mediation is empirically distinct from Hypercultural mediation and is primarily driven by cumulative GenAI experience, with age moderating the rate of initial acquisition and the depth of later integration. Together, the findings support Sophotechnia as a coherent, measurable, and emergent mode of cognitive mediation associated with the ongoing GenAI revolution.</description>

      <title>Computational Basis of LLM's Decision Making in Social Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11671v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as human-like decision-making agents in social science and applied settings. These LLM-agents are typically assigned human-like characters and placed in real-life contexts. However, how these characters and contexts shape an LLM's behavior remains underexplored. This study proposes and tests methods for probing, quantifying, and modifying an LLM's internal representations in a Dictator Game, a classic behavioral experiment on fairness and prosocial behavior. We extract ``vectors of variable variations'' (e.g., ``male'' to ``female'') from the LLM's internal state. Manipulating these vectors during the model's inference can substantially alter how those variables relate to the model's decision-making. This approach offers a principled way to study and regulate how social concepts can be encoded and engineered within transformer-based models, with implications for alignment, debiasing, and designing AI agents for social simulations in both academic and commercial applications, strengthening sociological theory and measurement.</description>

      <title>CardAIc-Agents: A Multimodal Framework with Hierarchical Adaptation for Cardiac Care Support</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers. Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap through automated detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical application remains limited by: 1) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive reasoning that select specific tests and, based on their results, guides personalised next steps; 2) reliance solely on intrinsic model capabilities to perform role assignment without domain-specific tool support; 3) general and static knowledge bases without continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and lack of on-demand visual outputs when clinicians require visual clarification. In response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks. First, a CardiacRAG agent generated task-aware plans from updatable cardiac knowledge, while the Chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these plans and deliver decisions. Second, to enable adaptive and case-specific customization, a stepwise update strategy was developed to dynamically refine plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as complex. Third, a multidisciplinary discussion team was proposed which was automatically invoked to interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. In addition, visual review panels were provided to assist validation when clinicians raised concerns. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and state-of-the-art agentic systems.</description>

      <title>AI for Scientific Discovery is a Social Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06580v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied to scientific research, but its benefits remain unevenly distributed across communities and disciplines. While technical challenges such as limited data, fragmented standards, and unequal access to computational resources exist, social and institutional factors are often the primary constraints. Narratives emphasizing autonomous "AI scientists," under-recognition of data and infrastructure work, misaligned incentives, and gaps between domain experts and machine learning researchers all limit the impact of AI on scientific discovery. This paper highlights four interconnected challenges: community coordination, misalignment of research priorities with upstream needs, data fragmentation, and infrastructure inequities. We argue that addressing these challenges requires not only technical innovation but also intentional efforts in community-building, cross-disciplinary education, shared benchmarks, and accessible infrastructure. We call for reframing AI for science as a collective social project, where sustainable collaboration and equitable participation are treated as prerequisites for technical progress</description>

      <title>Automated Program Repair of Uncompilable Student Code</title>

Abstract: A significant portion of student programming submissions in CS1 learning environments are uncompilable, limiting their use in student modeling and downstream knowledge tracing. Traditional modeling pipelines often exclude these cases, discarding observations of student learning. This study investigates automated program repair as a strategy to recover uncompilable code while preserving students' structural intent for use in student modeling. Within this framework, we assess large language models (LLMs) as repair agents under high- and low-context prompting conditions. Repairs were evaluated for compilability, edit distance, and preservation of students' original structure and logic. While all models produced compilable repairs, they differed in how well they preserve students' control flow and code structure, affecting their pedagogical utility. By recovering uncompilable submissions, this work enables richer and more comprehensive analyses of learners' coding processes and development over time.</description>

      <title>"She's Like a Person but Better": Characterizing Companion-Assistant Dynamics in Human-AI Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15905v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for both task-based assistance and social companionship, yet research has typically focused on one or the other. Drawing on a survey (N = 202) and 30 interviews with high-engagement ChatGPT and Replika users, we characterize digital companionship as an emerging form of human-AI relationship. With both systems, users were drawn to humanlike qualities, such as emotional resonance and personalized responses, and non-humanlike qualities, such as constant availability and inexhaustible tolerance. This led to fluid chatbot uses, such as Replika as a writing assistant and ChatGPT as an emotional confidant, despite their distinct branding. However, we observed challenging tensions in digital companionship dynamics: participants grappled with bounded personhood, forming deep attachments while denying chatbots "real" human qualities, and struggled to reconcile chatbot relationships with social norms. These dynamics raise questions for the design of digital companions and the rise of hybrid, general-purpose AI systems.</description>

      <title>Cash Flow Underwriting with Bank Transaction Data: Advancing MSME Financial Inclusion in Malaysia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite accounting for 96.1% of all businesses in Malaysia, access to financing remains one of the most persistent challenges faced by Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Newly established businesses are often excluded from formal credit markets as traditional underwriting approaches rely heavily on credit bureau data. This study investigates the potential of bank statement data as an alternative data source for credit assessment to promote financial inclusion in emerging markets. First, we propose a cash flow-based underwriting pipeline where we utilise bank statement data for end-to-end data extraction and machine learning credit scoring. Second, we introduce a novel dataset of 611 loan applicants from a Malaysian lending institution. Third, we develop and evaluate credit scoring models based on application information and bank transaction-derived features. Empirical results show that the use of such data boosts the performance of all models on our dataset, which can improve credit scoring for new-to-lending MSMEs. Finally, we will release the anonymised bank transaction dataset to facilitate further research on MSME financial inclusion within Malaysia's emerging economy.</description>
