      <title>Quantum phase transition of (1+1)-dimensional O(3) nonlinear sigma model at finite density with tensor renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum phase transition of the (1+1)-dimensional O(3) nonlinear sigma model at finite density using the tensor renormalization group method. This model suffers from the sign problem, which has prevented us from investigating the properties of the phase transition. We investigate the properties of the phase transition by changing the chemical potential $\mu$ at a fixed coupling of $\beta$. We determine the transition point $\mu_{\rm c}$ and the critical exponent $\nu$ from the $\mu$ dependence of the number density in the thermodynamic limit. The dynamical critical exponent $z$ is also extracted from the scaling behavior of the temporal correlation length as a function of $\mu$.</description>

      <title>QCD constraints on isospin-dense matter and the nuclear equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of dense hadronic matter is a central goal in nuclear physics as it governs the nature and dynamics of astrophysical objects such as supernovae and neutron stars. Because of the non-perturbative nature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), little is known rigorously about hadronic matter in these extreme conditions. Here, lattice QCD calculations are used to compute thermodynamic quantities and the equation of state of QCD over a wide range of isospin chemical potentials. Agreement is seen with chiral perturbation theory predictions when the chemical potential is small. Comparison to perturbative QCD calculations at large chemical potential allows for an estimate of the gap in the superconducting phase, and this quantity is seen to agree with perturbative determinations. Since the partition function for an isospin chemical potential, $\mu_I$, bounds the partition function for a baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=3/2\mu_I$, these calculations also provide rigorous non-perturbative QCD bounds on the nuclear equation of state over a wide range of baryon densities for the first time.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative determination of the ${\cal N} = 1$ SUSY Yang-Mills gluino condensate at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first non-perturbative large-$N$ calculation of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric (SUSY) $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills gluino condensate, obtained by means of numerical simulations of the lattice-discretized theory, and exploiting large-$N$ twisted volume reduction. We present two different determinations based, respectively, on the Banks-Casher formula and on the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation, both giving perfectly consistent results. By matching the lattice and the Novikov-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (NSVZ) regularization schemes, we are able for the first time to compare numerical and analytic computations. Our most accurate determination gives $\Sigma_{\rm RGI} /\Lambda_{\rm NSVZ}^3 = 1.55(57)$, in very good agreement with the $N$-dependence and the value predicted by the weak coupling instanton-based approach $\Sigma_{\rm RGI} /\Lambda_{\rm NSVZ}^3 = 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of a single-qubit parametrized circuit as an Ansatz for the variational wave function in the calculation of the ground state energy of a quantum many-body system is demonstrated using the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. Comparison is made to calculations where a classic neural network is used to generate the variational wave function. Computations carried out on IBM Quantum hardware are also presented.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Isovector Axial Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results for the isovector axial vector form factors obtained using thirteen 2+1+1-flavor highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration. The calculation of nucleon two- and three-point correlation functions has been done using Wilson-clover fermions. In the analysis of these data, we quantify the sensitivity of the results to strategies used for removing excited state contamination and invoke the partially conserved axial current relation between the form factors to choose between them. Our data driven analysis includes removing contributions from multihadron $N \pi$ states that make significant contributions. Our final results are: $g_A = 1.292 (53)_\text{stat}\,(24)_\text{sys}$ for the axial charge; $g_S = 1.085 (50)_\text{stat}\, (103)_\text{sys}$ and $g_T = 0.991 (21)_\text{stat}\, (10)_\text{sys}$ for the scalar and tensor charges; $\langle r_A^2 \rangle = 0.439 (56)_\text{stat} (34)_\text{sys}$ fm${}^2$ for the mean squared axial charge radius, $g_P^\ast = 9.03(47)_\text{stat}(42)_\text{sys} $ for the induced pseudoscalar charge; and $g_{\pi NN} = 14.14(81)_\text{stat}(85)_\text{sys}$ for the pion-nucleon coupling. We also provide a parameterization of the axial form factor $G_A(Q^2)$ over the range $0 \le Q^2 \le 1$ GeV${}^2$ for use in phenomenology and a comparison with other lattice determinations. We find that the various lattice data agree within 10\% but are significantly different from the extraction of $G_A(Q^2)$ from the $\nu$-deuterium scattering data.</description>

      <title>Exact lattice chiral symmetry in 2d gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct symmetry-preserving lattice regularizations of 2d QED with one and two flavors of Dirac fermions, as well as the `3450' chiral gauge theory, by leveraging bosonization and recently-proposed modifications of Villain-type lattice actions. The internal global symmetries act just as locally on the lattice as they do in the continuum, the anomalies are reproduced at finite lattice spacing, and in each case we find a sign-problem-free dual formulation.</description>

      <title>Wave function matching transformation for solving the quantum many-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for solving quantum many-body systems called wave function matching. Wave function matching transforms the interaction between particles so that the wave functions up to some finite range match that of an easily computable interaction. This allows for calculations of systems that would otherwise be impossible due to problems such as Monte Carlo sign cancelations. We apply the method to lattice Monte Carlo simulations of light nuclei, medium-mass nuclei, neutron matter, and nuclear matter. We use high-fidelity chiral effective field theory interactions and find good agreement with empirical data. These results are accompanied by new insights on the nuclear interactions that may help to resolve long-standing challenges in accurately reproducing nuclear binding energies, charge radii, and nuclear matter saturation in ab initio calculations.</description>

      <title>A bridge between trace anomaly and deconfinement phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the fact that both the dilaton potential encoding the trace anomalies of QCD and the Polyakov loop potential measuring the deconfinement phase transition can be expressed in the logarithmic forms, as well as the fact that the scale symmetry is expected to be restoring and colors are deconfined in extreme conditions such as high temperatures and/or densities, we conjecture a relation between the dilaton potential and the Polyakov loop potential. Explicitly, we start from the Coleman--Weinberg type potential of a real scalar field -- a dilaton or conformal compensator -- and make an ansatz of the relation between this scalar field and the Polyakov loop to obtain the Polyakov loop potential, which can be parameterized in Lattice QCD (LQCD) in the pure glue sector. We find that the coefficients of Polyakov potential fitted from Lattice data are automatically satisfied in this ansatz, the locations of deconfinement and scale restoration are locked to each other, and the first-order phase transition can be realized. Extensions to the low-energy effective quark models are also discussed. The conjectured relation may deepen our understanding of the evolution of the universe, the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking, the phase diagram of QCD matter, and the properties of neutron~stars.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum eigensolver with embedded entanglement using a tensor-network ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a tensor network (TN) scheme into the entanglement augmentation process of the synergistic optimization framework by Rudolph et al. [arXiv:2208.13673] to build its process systematically for inhomogeneous systems. Our synergistic approach first embeds the variational optimal solution of the TN state with the entropic area law, which can be perfectly optimized in conventional (classical) computers, in a quantum variational circuit ansatz inspired by the TN state with the entropic volume law. Next, the framework performs a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) process with embedded states as the initial state. We applied the synergistic to the ground-state analysis of the all-to-all coupled random transverse-field Ising, XYZ, Heisenberg model, employing the binary multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) state and branching MERA states as TN states with entropic area law and volume law, respectively. We then show that the synergistic accelerates VQE calculations in the three models without an initial parameter guess of the branching-MERA-inspired ansatz and can avoid a local solution trapped by a standard VQE with the ansatz in the Ising model. The improvement of optimizers for MERA in all-to-all coupled inhomogeneous systems, enhancement, and potential synergistic applications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Exploring thermal equilibria of the Fermi-Hubbard model with variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the thermal properties of the repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model with chemical potential using variational quantum algorithms, crucial in comprehending particle behaviour within lattices at high temperatures in condensed matter systems. Conventional computational methods encounter challenges, especially in managing chemical potential, prompting exploration into Hamiltonian approaches. Despite the promise of quantum algorithms, their efficacy is hampered by coherence limitations when simulating extended imaginary time evolution sequences. To overcome such constraints, this research focuses on optimising variational quantum algorithms to probe the thermal properties of the Fermi-Hubbard model. Physics-inspired circuit designs are tailored to alleviate coherence constraints, facilitating a more comprehensive exploration of materials at elevated temperatures. Our study demonstrates the potential of variational algorithms in simulating the thermal properties of the Fermi-Hubbard model while acknowledging limitations stemming from error sources in quantum devices and encountering barren plateaus.</description>
