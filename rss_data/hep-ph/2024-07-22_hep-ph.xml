      <title>TMD factorization bridging large and small x</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QCD factorization takes different forms in the large-x and small-x regimes. At large-x, collinear factorization leads to the DGLAP evolution equation, while at small-x, rapidity factorization results in the BFKL equation. To unify these different regimes, a new TMD factorization based on the background field method is proposed. This factorization not only reduces to CSS and DGLAP in the large-x limit and BFKL in the small-x limit, but also defines a general evolution away from these regimes.</description>

      <title>Scaling properties of elastic pp cross-section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the elastic differential $pp$ cross-section has a unique universal property that the ratio of bump-to-dip position is constant from the energies of the ISR to the LHC. We explore this property to compare Geometric Scaling present at the ISR with the recently proposed scaling law at the LHC. We argue that at the LHC, within present experimental uncertainties, there is fact a family of scaling laws.</description>

      <title>First order electroweak radiative corrections to the decay of the polarised $W$ boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytic results for the next-to-leading order electroweak radiative corrections to the decay of the polarised $W$ boson into a pair of heavy quarks are presented. Finite fermion masses are taken into account throughout this calculation, and in performing the collinear limit for the final quark states and all light fermions taking part in this process, the importance of mass effects is demonstrated. This gives hints for the deviation of the total decay rate and the branching ratios into massive fermions between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the discovery potential of Z branching ratios due to contributions induced by the MSSM electroweak sector, assuming that the squarks and gluinos are heavy. Precision measurements at a future Z factory would yield sensitivity to MSSM that is complementary to direct searches at the LHC, provided that the systematic uncertainties can be reduced to a level comparable to the expected statistical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Dark photon distortions of NO$\nu$A and T2K neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark photons coupling to $L_\mu-L_\tau$ lepton number difference are a highly studied light dark matter candidate, with potential to be discovered through their impact on terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments. We re-examine this in the light of claimed tensions between the NO$\nu$A and T2K long baseline experiments, also taking into account data from the MINOS experiment. We obtain leading limits on the $L_\mu-L_\tau$ gauge coupling $g'$ versus dark photon mass $m_{A'}$, and find no statistically significant alleviation of the tension from inclusion of the new physics effect.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Wakes of Jets with Energy-Energy-Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the partons in a jet propagate through the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in a heavy-ion collision, they lose energy to, kick, and are kicked by the medium. The resulting modifications to the parton shower encode information about the microscopic nature of QGP. The momentum and energy lost by the parton shower are gained by the medium and, since QGP is a strongly coupled liquid, this means that the jet excites a wake in the droplet of QGP. After freezeout, this wake becomes soft hadrons with net momentum in the jet direction meaning that reconstructed jets include hadrons originating from both the modified parton shower and its wake. This makes it challenging to find an unambiguous experimental view of the response of a droplet of QGP to a jet. Recent years have seen significant advances in the understanding of the substructure of jets using correlation functions of the energy flux operator. So far, such studies have focused primarily on the two-point correlator, which serves to identify the angular scale of the underlying dynamics. Higher-point correlators hold the promise of mapping out the dynamics themselves. We perform the first study of the shape-dependent three-point energy-energy-energy correlator in heavy-ion collisions. Using the Hybrid Model to simulate the interactions of high energy jets with QGP, we show that hadrons originating from wakes are the dominant contribution to the three-point correlator in the regime where the three points are well-separated in angle, forming a roughly equilateral triangle. This equilateral region of the correlator is far from the region populated by collinear vacuum emissions, making it a canvas on which jet wakes can be imaged. Our work is a key step towards the systematic use of energy correlators to image and unravel the dynamical response of a droplet of QGP to a passing jet, and motivates many experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic charge transport in strongly magnetized relativistic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate electrical charge transport in hot magnetized plasma using first-principles quantum field theoretical methods. By employing Kubo's linear response theory, we express the electrical conductivity tensor in terms of the fermion damping rate in the Landau-level representation. Utilizing leading-order results for the damping rates from a recent study within a gauge theory, we derive the transverse and longitudinal conductivities for a strongly magnetized plasma. The analytical expressions reveal drastically different mechanisms that explain the high anisotropy of charge transport in a magnetized plasma. Specifically, the transverse conductivity is suppressed, while the longitudinal conductivity is enhanced by a strong magnetic field. As in the case of zero magnetic field, longitudinal conduction is determined by the probability of charge carriers to remain in their quantum states without damping. In contrast, transverse conduction critically relies on quantum transitions between Landau levels, effectively lifting charge trapping in localized Landau orbits. We examine the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the transverse and longitudinal electrical conductivities over a wide range of parameters and investigate the effects of a nonzero chemical potential. Additionally, we extend our analysis to strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma and study the impact of the coupling constant on the anisotropy of electrical charge transport.</description>

      <title>A model for Axial Non-Standard Interactions of neutrinos with quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutrino oscillation experiments are setting increasingly strong upper bounds on the vectorial effective Non-Standard neutrino Interactions (NSI) with matter fields. However, the bounds on the axial NSI are more relaxed, raising the hope that studying the neutral current events at an experiment such as DUNE can give a glimpse of new physics. We build a model that gives rise to axial NSI with large couplings leading to observable deviation from the standard prediction at DUNE. The model is based on a $U(1)$ gauge symmetry with a gauge boson of mass $\sim 30$~GeV which can be discovered at the high luminosity LHC. Combining the LHC and DUNE discoveries, we can unravel the axial form of interaction. The cancellation of anomalies of the gauge group suggests new heavy quarks as well as a dark matter candidate. The new quarks mixed with the first generation quarks can also be discovered at the LHC. Moreover, they provide a seesaw mechanism that explains the smallness of the $u$ and $d$ quark masses. The dark matter has an axial coupling to the quarks which makes its discovery via spin dependent direct dark matter search experiments possible.</description>

      <title>Vector Dark Matter from the 5-Dimensional Representation of $SU(2)_{L}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of electroweak multiplets that transform under any representation of the standard $SU(2)_L$ gauge group suggests the existence of electrically neutral stable particles capable of serving as cold dark matter in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. This paradigm, known as \textit{minimal dark matter}, has primarily focused on spin-$0$ and spin-$1/2$ particles. We extend this study to the spin-1 case using the 5-dimensional real representation. We address unitarity concerns arising from the model's interactions with electroweak and Higgs fields of the Standard Model, investigating implications for dark matter relic density, direct and indirect detection, including non-perturbative Sommerfeld enhancement for the latter. Collider signatures of the proposed model are also examined. Our findings suggest that the model remains consistent with experimental constraints, particularly for dark matter masses on the order of dozens of TeV, and could potentially be tested using $\gamma$-ray observatories such as CTA.</description>

      <title>Domain wall constraints on the doublet left-right symmetric model from pulsar timing array data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent evidence of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background found by NANOGrav and other pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations has inspired many studies looking for possible sources. We consider the hypothesis that the GW signature is produced by domain walls (DWs) arising in the doublet left-right symmetric model (DLRSM) due to the spontaneous breaking of the discrete parity symmetry. The DW network consists of two types of DWs, namely $Z_2$ and $LR$ DWs, which have different surface tensions. We find kink solutions for both types of DWs and obtain the parametric dependence of the surface tension. Considering the GW signal from the DLRSM DW model with and without the contribution from supermassive black hole binaries, we perform a Bayesian analysis using the PTA data to estimate the posterior distribution and identify best-fit parameter ranges. The PTA data favors a parity-breaking scale of $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$\,GeV, and a biased potential $V_{\rm{bias}}\sim (\mathcal{O}(100)\,\rm{MeV})^4$. The model with only DLRSM DWs is slightly favored over the model where additional SMBHB contribution is considered.</description>

      <title>QCD corrections of $e^+e^- \to J/\psi+c+\bar{c}$ using the principle of maximum conformality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the total and differential cross sections for $e^+e^- \to J/\psi+c+\bar{c}$ at the $B$ factories up to next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections within the framework of nonrelativistic QCD factorization theory. We then obtain an improved pQCD prediction for this process by using the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC). We show the first time that the PMC can be applied for any pQCD calculable observable at the total or differential levels via a self-consistent way in perturbation theory. By the recursive use of renormalization group equation, the resultant PMC series satisfies all the requirements of renormalization group, which is free of conventional renormalization scheme-and-scale ambiguities at any fixed-order level. We thus obtain a more precise prompt total cross section at the NLO level, e.g. $\sigma|_{\rm prompt}^{\rm PMC}= 0.565^{+0.144}_{-0.125}~\text{pb}$. Here the uncertainty is the squared average of those from the $\alpha_s$ fixed-point uncertainty $\Delta\alpha_s(M_Z)$, the uncertainty of charm quark mass $\Delta m_c$, and an estimated contribution of the uncalculated NNLO-terms as predicted by the Pad\'{e} approximation approach. The differential cross sections $d\sigma/dP_{J/\psi}$, $d\sigma/d|\cos \theta|$, and $d\sigma/dz$ for $e^+e^- \to J/\psi+c+\bar{c}$ are further examined. Those results show that by further considering the feed-down contributions, the PMC predictions show better agreement with the Belle measurements.</description>

Abstract: We have studied transverse momentum ($p_{\rm{T}}$) spectra of charged hadrons in various pseudo-rapidity ranges for p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The medium effects such as collective flow and energy loss resulting from heavy-ion collisions have also been investigated using modified Tsallis distribution function over a wide range of $p_{\rm{T}}$ that indicates the transverse collective flow at low and intermediate $p_{\rm{T}}$ range and in-medium energy loss in high $p_{\rm{T}}$ range.</description>

      <title>PineAPPL Grids of Open Heavy-Flavor Production in the GM-VFNS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many next-to-leading order QCD predictions are available through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Usually, multiple CPU hours are needed to calculate predictions at a required precision, which is unfeasible for global PDF analyses. This problem is solved by a process known as gridding: The values of the hard-scattering cross-section are calculated only once with the MC program, and then interpolated and stored in look-up tables (grids) of the kinematical variables. To obtain the physical predictions, they are convolved with the PDFs (e.g. during the fitting stage in a PDF global analysis), which takes a tiny fraction of the time needed to calculate the MC results. This is possible with PineAPPL, a library tackling the aforementioned process of grid creation and convolution. In this work, we use PineAPPL to grid the predictions for open heavy-flavor production in the general-mass variable-flavor-number scheme (GM-VFNS). In the GM-VFNS, the differential cross-section interpolates between the fixed-flavor-number scheme (FFNS) and the zero-mass variable-flavor-number scheme (ZM-VFNS). These are each only valid in different kinematical regions, in which the GM-VFNS cross-section reproduces the FFNS and ZM-VFNS as the limiting cases of high energies and small masses, respectively. Better than permille agreement is achieved between the grids and the MC predictions, while at the same time not substantially increasing the time of the MC calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin tensor is fundamental to relativistic spin hydrodynamics, but its definition is ambiguous due to the pseudogauge symmetry. We show that in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with spin-spin interactions this ambiguity is resolved. We prove that the mean field limit of this theory is equivalent to the non-dissipative spin hydrodynamics with a canonical spin tensor. Finally, we propose to detect the spin potential by performing experiments with collisions of polarized ions.</description>

      <title>Dark matter for Majorana neutrinos in a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the minimal Scotogenic model with fermionic dark matter, the neutrino Yukawa matrix is fine-tuned to satisfy current bounds on $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ while producing dark matter through thermal freezeout. One way to avoid this bound is to open a new annihilation channel for DM with a scalar field that breaks the lepton number spontaneously. This introduces a physical Goldstone boson $a$, which can constitute a light relic and opens up the lepton flavor violating channel $\mu\rightarrow e a$. In this work, we introduce a model that contains the new annihilation channel for fermionic dark matter but avoids the introduction of the Goldstone by using a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_4$ instead of a continuous symmetry. In this way, cosmological constraints on the light relic and experimental limits on lepton flavor violating decays to the Goldstone are avoided. We analyze the experimental viability of the model, identifying the region of parameter space where lepton flavor violating constraints are not saturated, DM has the correct relic density, and DM direct detection experiments are sensitive to the DM candidate.</description>

      <title>QCD phase diagram in the $T-eB$ plane for varying pion mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of a varying pion mass on the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram in the presence of an external magnetic field, aiming to understand it using Nambu\textendash Jona-Lasinio like effective models. We compare results from both its local and nonlocal versions. In both cases, we find that the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) near the crossover is eliminated with increasing pion mass, while the decreasing trend of crossover temperature with increasing magnetic field persists for pion mass values at least up to $440$ MeV. Thus, the models are capable of capturing qualitatively the results found by lattice QCD (LQCD) for heavy (unphysical) pions. The key feature in the models is the incorporation of the effect of a reduction in the coupling constant with increasing energy. Along with reproducing the IMC effect, it enables models to describe the effects of heavier current quark masses without introducing additional parameters. For the local NJL model, this agreement depends on how the parameters of the model are fit at the physical point. In this respect, the nonlocal version, which, due to its formulation, automatically exhibits the IMC effect around the crossover region, captures the physics more naturally.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Symmetry Restoration in the N2HDM via Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain walls are a type of topological defects that can arise in the early universe after the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry. They can form in several beyond the Standard Model theories with an extended Higgs sector such as the Next to-Two-Higgs-Doublet model (N2HDM). In this work, we discuss the domain wall solution related to the singlet scalar of the N2HDM and demonstrate the possibility of restoring the electroweak symmetry inside and in the vicinity of the domain wall. Such symmetry restoration can have profound implications on early universe cosmology as the weak sphaleron rate inside the domain wall would, in principle, be unsuppressed compared to the rate outside the wall. We also discuss the possibility of generating CP-violating vacua localized in the vicinity of the domain wall. Our work is a first step towards the realization of electroweak baryogenesis mediated by domain walls in the N2HDM.</description>

      <title>Modular Invariant Starobinsky Inflation and the Species Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potentials in cosmological inflation often involve scalars with trans-Planckian ranges. As a result, towers of states become massless and their presence pushes the fundamental scale not to coincide with $M_{\rm P}$ but rather with the $species\, scale$, $\Lambda$. This scale transforms as an automorphic form of the theory's duality symmetries. We propose that the inflaton potential should be 1) an automorphic invariant form, non-singular over all moduli space, 2) depending only on $\Lambda$ and its field derivatives, and 3) approaching constant values in the large moduli to ensure a long period of inflation. These conditions lead to the proposal $V \sim \lambda(\phi, \phi^*)$, with $\lambda = G^{i\bar{j}} (\partial_i \Lambda)(\partial_{\bar{j}} \Lambda) / \Lambda^2$, determining the 'species scale convex hull'. For a single elliptic complex modulus with $SL(2, Z)$ symmetry, this results in an inflaton potential $V \simeq (\text{Im} \tau)^2 |\tilde{G}_2|^2 / N^2$, with $N \simeq -\log(\text{Im} \tau |\eta(\tau)|^4)$, where $\eta$ is the Dedekind function and $\tilde{G}_2$ the Eisenstein modular form of weight 2. Surprisingly, this potential at large modulus resembles that of the Starobinsky model. We compute inflation parameters yielding results similar to Starobinsky's, but extended to modular invariant expressions. Interestingly, the number of e-folds is proportional to the number of species in the tower, $N_e \simeq N$, and $\epsilon \simeq \Lambda^4$ at large moduli, suggesting that the tower of states plays an important role in the inflation process.</description>

      <title>Bounding elastic photon-photon scattering at $\sqrt s \approx 1\,$MeV using a laser-plasma platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a direct search for elastic photon-photon scattering using x-ray and $\gamma$ photons from a laser-plasma based experiment. A gamma photon beam produced by a laser wakefield accelerator provided a broadband gamma spectrum extending to above $E_\gamma = 200$ MeV. These were collided with a dense x-ray field produced by the emission from a laser heated germanium foil at $E_x \approx 1.4$ keV, corresponding to an invariant mass of $\sqrt{s} = 1.22 \pm 0.22$ MeV. In these asymmetric collisions elastic scattering removes one x-ray and one high-energy $\gamma$ photon and outputs two lower energy $\gamma$ photons. No changes in the $\gamma$ photon spectrum were observed as a result of the collisions allowing us to place a 95% upper bound on the cross section of $1.5 \times 10^{15}\,\mu$b. Although far from the QED prediction, this represents the lowest upper limit obtained so far for $\sqrt{s} \lesssim 1$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Schwinger vs Coleman: Magnetic Charge Renormalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kinetic mixing of two U(1) gauge theories can result in a massless photon that has perturbative couplings to both electric and magnetic charges. This framework can be used to perturbatively calculate in a quantum field theory with both kinds of charge. Here we re-examine the running of the magnetic charge, where the calculations of Schwinger and Coleman sharply disagree. We calculate the running of both electric and magnetic couplings and show that the disagreement between Schwinger and Coleman is due to an incomplete summation of topological terms in the perturbation series. We present a momentum space prescription for calculating the loop corrections in which the topological terms can be systematically separated for resummation. Somewhat in the spirit of modern amplitude methods we avoid using a vector potential and use the field strength itself, thereby trading gauge redundancy for the geometric redundancy of Stokes surfaces. The resulting running of the couplings demonstrates that Dirac charge quantization is independent of renormalization scale, as Coleman predicted. As a simple application we also bound the parameter space of magnetically charged states through the experimental measurement of the running of electromagnetic coupling.</description>

      <title>Living at the Edge: A Critical Look at the Cosmological Neutrino Mass Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological neutrino mass bounds are becoming increasingly stringent. The latest limit within $\Lambda$CDM from Planck 2018+ACT lensing+DESI is $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.072\,{\rm eV}$ at 95% CL, very close to the minimum possible sum of neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu &gt; 0.06\,{\rm eV}$), hinting at vanishing or even ''negative'' cosmological neutrino masses. In this context, it is urgent to carefully evaluate the origin of these cosmological constraints. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of these results in three ways: i) we check the role of potential anomalies in Planck CMB and DESI BAO data; ii) we compare the results for frequentist and Bayesian techniques, as very close to physical boundaries subtleties in the derivation and interpretation of constraints can arise; iii) we investigate how deviations from $\Lambda$CDM, potentially alleviating these anomalies, can alter the constraints. From a profile likelihood analysis, we derive constraints in agreement at the $\sim 10\%$ level with Bayesian posteriors. We find that the weak preference for negative neutrino masses is mostly present for Planck 18 data, affected by the well-known `lensing anomaly'. It disappears when the new Planck 2020 HiLLiPoP is used, leading to significantly weaker constraints. Additionally, the pull towards negative masses in DESI data stems from the $z=0.7$ bin, which is in $\sim 3\sigma$ tension with Planck expectations. Without these outliers, and in combination with HiLLiPoP, the bound relaxes to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.11\,{\rm eV}$ at 95% CL. The recent preference for dynamical dark energy alleviates this tension and further weakens the bound. As we are at the dawn of a neutrino mass discovery from cosmology, it will be very exciting to see if this trend is confirmed by future data.</description>

Abstract: Calabi--Yau compactifications of the $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string provide a promising route to recovering the four-dimensional particle physics described by the Standard Model. While the topology of the Calabi--Yau space determines the overall matter content in the low-energy effective field theory, further details of the compactification geometry are needed to calculate the normalized physical couplings and masses of elementary particles. In this work, we present numerical computations of physical Yukawa couplings in a number of heterotic models in the standard embedding and demonstrate the existence of natural hierarchies, a coveted feature in string model building.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the utility of qutrits and qubits for simulating the flavor dynamics of dense neutrino systems. The evolution of such systems impacts some important astrophysical processes, such as core-collapse supernovae and the nucleosynthesis of heavy nuclei. Many-body simulations require classical resources beyond current computing capabilities for physically relevant system sizes. Quantum computers are therefore a promising candidate to efficiently simulate the many-body dynamics of collective neutrino oscillations. Previous quantum simulation efforts have primarily focused on properties of the two-flavor approximation due to their direct mapping to qubits. Here, we present new quantum circuits for simulating three-flavor neutrino systems on qutrit- and qubit-based platforms, and demonstrate their feasibility by simulating systems of two, four and eight neutrinos on IBM and Quantinuum quantum computers.</description>

      <title>EggNet: An Evolving Graph-based Graph Attention Network for Particle Track Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Track reconstruction is a crucial task in particle experiments and is traditionally very computationally expensive due to its combinatorial nature. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach that can improve scalability. Most of these GNN-based methods, including the edge classification (EC) and the object condensation (OC) approach, require an input graph that needs to be constructed beforehand. In this work, we consider a one-shot OC approach that reconstructs particle tracks directly from a set of hits (point cloud) by recursively applying graph attention networks with an evolving graph structure. This approach iteratively updates the graphs and can better facilitate the message passing across each graph. Preliminary studies on the TrackML dataset show better track performance compared to the methods that require a fixed input graph.</description>

      <title>On gauge amplitudes first appearing at two loops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study scattering amplitudes in massless non-abelian gauge theory where all outgoing gluons have positive helicity. It has been argued recently by Costello that for a particular fermion representation (8 fundamentals plus one antisymmetric-tensor representation in $SU(N)$) the one-loop amplitudes vanish identically. We show that this vanishing leads to previously-observed identities among one-loop color-ordered partial amplitudes. We then turn to two loops, where Costello has computed the all-plus amplitudes for this theory, as rational functions of the kinematics for any number of gluons using the celestial chiral algebra (CCA) bootstrap. We show that in dimensional regularization, these two-loop amplitudes are not rational, and they are not even finite as $\epsilon\to0$. However, the finite remainder for four gluons agrees with the formula by Costello. In addition, we provide a mass regulator for the infrared-divergent loop integrals; with this regulator, the CCA bootstrap formula is recovered exactly. Finally, we use the CCA bootstrap to compute the double-trace terms in the theory at two loops for an arbitrary number of gluons.</description>

      <title>Isotropic cosmic birefringence from an oscillating axion-like field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism for isotropic cosmic birefringence with an axion-like field that rapidly oscillates during the recombination epoch. In conventional models, the field oscillation during the recombination epoch leads to a cancellation of the birefringence effect and significantly suppresses the EB spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. By introducing an asymmetric potential to the axion, this cancellation becomes incomplete, and a substantial EB spectrum can be produced. This mechanism also results in a washout of the EE spectrum, which can be probed in future CMB observations. Our findings suggest the possibility that an axion-like field responsible for isotropic cosmic birefringence can also account for a significant fraction of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-driven likelihood-free parameter inference for 21-cm forest observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hyperfine structure absorption lines of neutral hydrogen in spectra of high-redshift radio sources, known collectively as the 21-cm forest, have been demonstrated as a sensitive probe to the small-scale structures governed by the dark matter (DM) properties, as well as the thermal history of the intergalactic medium regulated by the first galaxies during the epoch of reionization. By statistically analyzing these spectral features, the one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest can effectively break the parameter degeneracies and constrain the properties of both DM and the first galaxies. However, conventional parameter inference methods face challenges due to computationally expensive simulations for 21-cm forest and the non-Gaussian signal characteristics. To address these issues, we introduce generative normalizing flows for data augmentation and inference normalizing flows for parameters estimation. This approach efficiently estimates parameters from minimally simulated datasets with non-Gaussian signals. Using simulated data from the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA), we demonstrate the ability of the deep learning-driven likelihood-free approach to generate accurate posterior distributions, providing a robust and efficient tool for probing DM and the cosmic heating history using the 1D power spectrum of 21-cm forest in the era of SKA. This methodology is adaptable for scientific analyses with other unevenly distributed data.</description>

Abstract: We study the dependence of beta-function on running coupling constant in holographic models supported by Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell action for light and heavy quarks. Although, in the previous paper [arXiv:2402.14512], we considered different types of the dilaton boundary conditions, but since the behavior of $\beta$-function as a function of running coupling does not depend significantly on the boundary condition, we chose one. The corresponding $\beta$-functions are negative and monotonically decreasing functions, and have jumps on the 1-st order phase transitions for both light and heavy quarks. In addition, we compare our holographic results for $\beta$-function as a function of running coupling with perturbation results that obtained within 2-loop calculations.</description>

      <title>Signatures of composite dark matter in the Cosmic Microwave Background spectral distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the spectral distortions of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) created by an exotic process that extracts or injects photons of a particular frequency into the CMB. Such signatures are a natural prediction of a class of composite dark matter models characterized by electrically neutral states but with non-zero higher order electromagnetic moments. We consider a simplified model where dark matter exists as a two state system separated by a fixed transition frequency, which can range from radio waves to gamma rays. The electromagnetic transitions between the two states due to CMB photons give rise to thermal distortions, namely, the $\mu$-type distortion in the redshift range $10^5\lesssim z \lesssim 2\times 10^6$ and the $y$-type distortion as well as non-thermal distortions at redshifts $z \lesssim 10^5$. The nature of spectral distortions depends sensitively on the dark matter transition frequency and the strength of couplings of dark matter with visible sector particles as well as its self-interactions, thus opening a new window to probe the nature of dark matter. Non-thermal distortions have unique spectral shapes making them distinguishable from the standard $\mu$ and $y$-type distortions and potentially detectable in the next-generation experiments such as Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE). We also find that the spectral distortion limits from the COsmic Background Explorer/Far-Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (COBE/FIRAS) already give a constraint on the electromagnetic coupling of dark matter which is three orders of magnitude stronger compared to the current direct detection limits for $\sim$ MeV mass dark matter with transition energy in $\sim 1$-$10$ eV range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.08326v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the framework of Standard Model Effective Field Theory, we performed a few global fits, each containing a subset of dimension-6 operators, for the measurements that are expected at future colliders. The fit for the Higgs and electroweak sector improves what has been done for the European Strategy Update in 2020 on both EFT treatments and experimental inputs. A new comprehensive fit is performed focusing on 4-fermion interactions at future colliders. Top-quark sector is studied in a dedicated fit which restricts the operators and measurements to be directly related to top-quark. A small subset of CP-violating operators involving bosonic fields alone are also investigated. Various running scenarios for future e+e- and Muon Colliders that are suggested in the Snowmass 2021 discussion are considered in the global fits. The outcomes from each fit are expressed in terms of either direct constraint on Wilson Coefficients or precision on Higgs and electroweak effective couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the power spectrum of super-horizon curvature perturbations generated during a late period of thermal inflation, taking into account fluctuation-dissipation effects resulting from the scalar flaton field's interactions with the ambient radiation bath. We find that, at the onset of thermal inflation, the flaton field may reach an equilibrium with the radiation bath even for relatively small coupling constants, maintaining a spectrum of thermal fluctuations until the critical temperature $T_c$, below which thermal effects stop holding the field at the false potential minimum. This enhances the field variance compared to purely quantum fluctuations, therefore increasing the average energy density during thermal inflation and damping the induced curvature perturbations. In particular, we find that this inhibits the later formation of primordial black holes, at least on scales that leave the horizon for $T&gt;T_c$. The larger thermal field variance also reduces the duration of a period of fast-roll inflation below $T_c$, as the field rolls to the true potential minimum, which should also affect the generation of (large) curvature perturbations on even smaller scales.</description>

Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations are a crucial component when analysing the Standard Model and New physics processes at the Large Hadron Collider. This paper aims to explore the performance of generative models for complementing the statistics of classical Monte Carlo simulations in the final stage of data analysis by generating additional synthetic data that follows the same kinematic distributions for a limited set of analysis-specific observables to a high precision. Several deep generative models are adapted for this task and their performance is systematically evaluated using a well-known benchmark sample containing the Higgs boson production beyond the Standard Model and the corresponding irreducible background. The paper evaluates the autoregressive models and normalizing flows and the applicability of these models using different model configurations is investigated. The best performing model is chosen for a further evaluation using a set of statistical procedures and a simplified physics analysis. By implementing and performing a series of statistical tests and evaluations we show that a machine-learning-based generative procedure can be used to generate synthetic data that matches the original samples closely enough and that it can therefore be incorporated in the final stage of a physics analysis with some given systematic uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Baryon number violation accompanied by CP-violation as a quantum tunneling effect induced by superfluid pairing interactions</title>

Abstract: In this work, we explore a new picture of baryon number ($\mathcal{B}$) violation inspired by the formal analogies between the Brout-Englert-Higgs model and the Ginzburg-Landau model. A possible manifestation of this new picture could be the transition between a pair of neutrons and a pair of antineutrons (i.e. $nn \rightarrow \bar{n}\bar{n}$), which violates $\mathcal{B}$ by 4 units. In the presence of the superfluid pairing interactions, two neutrons can form a Cooper pair and can be modeled by a semi-classical complex scalar field, which carries two units of $\mathcal{B}$. In the presence of the $\mathcal{B}$-violating terms, the system does not possess a continuous $U(1)$ symmetry but instead it respect a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry. Before the spontaneous breaking of the $Z_2$ symmetry, the ground state (vacuum) of the neutron Cooper field and that of the antineutron Cooper field should have degenerate energy levels. After the spontaneous breaking of the $Z_2$ symmetry, the degeneracy of the ground states would be removed and a domain wall that interpolates between the two inequavalent ground states can emerge. If the vacuum energy of the neutron Cooper field is higher than that of the antineutron Cooper field, the false vacuum ($nn$) would decay into the true vacuum ($\bar{n}\bar{n}$) through a quantum tunneling process across the domain wall. Therefore, The $nn \rightarrow \bar{n}\bar{n}$ transition process can be considered as a false vacuum decay through a quantum tunneling process induced by the superfluid pairing interactions. Both the $\mathcal{B}$-violating and CP-violating effects can be quite naturally accommodated in the $nn \rightarrow \bar{n}\bar{n}$ transition process. The $\mathcal{B}$-violating process accompanied by CP-violation would open a promising avenue for exploring new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Off-lightcone Wilson-line operators in gradient flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Off-lightcone Wilson-line operators are constructed using local operators connected by time-like or space-like Wilson lines, which ensure gauge invariance. Off-lightcone Wilson-line operators have broad applications in various contexts. For instance, space-like Wilson-line operators play a crucial role in determining quasi-distribution functions (quasi-PDFs), while time-like Wilson-line operators are essential for understanding quarkonium decay and production within the potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD) framework. In this work, we establish a systematic approach for calculating the matching from the gradient-flow scheme to the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme in the limit of small flow time for off-lightcone Wilson-line operators. By employing the one-dimensional auxiliary-field formalism, we simplify the matching procedure, reducing it to the matching of local current operators. We provide one-loop level matching coefficients for these local current operators. For the case of hadronic matrix element related to the quark quasi-PDFs, we show at one-loop level that the finite flow time effect is very small as long as the flow radius is smaller than the physical distance $z$, which is usually satisfied in lattice gradient flow computations. Applications include lattice gradient flow computations of quark/gluon quasi-PDFs, gluonic correlators related to quarkonium decay and production in pNRQCD, and spin-dependent potentials in terms of chromoelectric and chromomagnetic field insertions into a Wilson loop.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate multi-Higgs boson production at proton colliders, in a framework involving anomalous interactions, focusing on triple Higgs boson production. We consider modifications to the Higgs boson self-couplings, to the Yukawa interactions, as well as new contact interactions of Higgs bosons with either quarks or gluons. To this end, we have developed a MadGraph5_aMC@NLO loop model, publicly available at https://gitlab.com/apapaefs/multihiggs_loop_sm, designed to incorporate the relevant operators in the production of multiple Higgs bosons (and beyond). We have performed cross section fits at various energies over the anomalous interactions, and have derived constraints on the most relevant anomalous coefficients, through detailed phenomenological analyses at proton-proton collision energies of 13.6 TeV and 100 TeV, through the 6 $b$-jet final state.</description>

      <title>Masses of magnetized pseudoscalar and vector mesons in an extended NJL model: the role of axial vector mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mass spectrum of light pseudoscalar and vector mesons in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field $\vec B$, considering the effects of the mixing with the axial vector meson sector. The analysis is performed within a two-flavor NJL-like model which includes isoscalar and isovector couplings together with a flavor mixing 't Hooft-like term. The effect of the magnetic field on charged particles is taken into account by retaining the Schwinger phases carried by quark propagators, and expanding the corresponding meson fields in proper Ritus-like bases. The spin-isospin and spin-flavor decomposition of meson mass states is also analyzed. For neutral pion masses it is shown that the mixing with axial vector mesons improves previous theoretical results, leading to a monotonic decreasing behavior with $B$ that is in good qualitative agreement with LQCD calculations, both for the case of constant or $B$-dependent couplings. Regarding charged pions, it is seen that the mixing softens the enhancement of their mass with $B$. As a consequence, the energy becomes lower than the one corresponding to a pointlike pion, improving the agreement with LQCD results. The agreement is also improved for the magnetic behavior of the lowest $\rho^+$ energy state, which does not vanish for the considered range of values of $B$ -- a fact that can be relevant in connection with the occurrence of meson condensation for strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Constraints on cosmic-ray boosted dark matter with realistic cross section</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sub-MeV cold dark-matter particles are unable to produce electronic recoil in conventional dark-matter direct detection experiments such as XENONnT and LUX-ZEPLIN above the detector threshold. The mechanism of boosted dark matter comes into picture to constrain the parameter space of such low mass dark matter from direct detection experiments. We consider the effect of the leading components of cosmic rays to boost the cold dark matter, which results in significant improvements on the exclusion limits compared to the existing ones. To present concrete study results, we choose to work on models consisting of a dark-matter particle $\chi$ with an additional $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry including the secluded dark photon, $U(1)_{B-L}$, and $U(1)_{L_e-L_\mu}$. We find that the energy dependence of the scattering cross section plays a crucial role in improving the constraints. In addition, we systematically estimate the Earth shielding effect on boosted dark matter in losing energy while traveling to the underground detector through the Earth.</description>

      <title>Optimised observables and new physics prospects in the penguin-mediated decays $B_{d(s)}\to K^{(*)0}\phi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study penguin-mediated $\bar{B}_{d(s)}\to\bar{K}^{*0}(K^{*0})\phi$ transitions, proposing a new optimised observable $L_{K^*\phi}$ from the ratio of the corresponding branching ratios of these decays, with limited hadronic uncertainties and enhanced New Physics sensitivity. It deviates by $1.48\sigma$ between its experimental value and SM determination within QCD factorisation. This can be accommodated together with significant deviations found in the $K^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ modes in our earlier works if New Physics affects either the QCD penguin operator $Q_4$ or the chromomagnetic dipole operator $Q_{8g}$ for both $b\to d$ and $b\to s$ transitions. The allowed range for the Wilson coefficients $C_{4s,8gs}$ is narrower than $C_{4d,8gd}$ since the $b\to s$ transition channel $\bar{B}_d\to\bar{K}^{*0}\phi$ is in better agreement with the SM. However, if we add the measured $\bar{B}_{d}\to \bar{K}^{0}\phi$ branching ratio, simultaneous explanation of all experimental data for $K^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ and $K^*(\bar{K}^{(*)})\phi$ channels in terms of New Physics in $C_{4d,s}$ or $C_{8gd,s}$ only, is not possible. They can be explained more easily if we assume New Physics in both $f=d,s$ sectors. The addition of the branching ratios of the charged modes $B^-\to K^{(*)-}\phi$ to the above mix of observables results in a reduction of the parameter space for the $(C_{4f},C_{6f})$ scenario, while discarding the $(C_{6f},C_{8gf})$ scenario completely. This is because of the discrepancy of more than 1 $\sigma$ between the experimental measurements of the branching ratios of the $\bar{B}_{d}(B^-)\to\bar{K}^0(K^-)\phi$ transitions. This provides a strong incentive for the LHCb/Belle II experiments to measure the branching ratios of $\bar{B}_{d}\to\bar{K}^{(*)0}\phi$, $\bar{B}_s\to K^{*0}\phi$ and particularly $B^-\to K^-\phi$ to confirm or dismiss the conclusions hinted at by present data.</description>

Abstract: We present a class of supersymmetric (SUSY) GUT models that can explain the apparent discrepancy between the SM predictions and experimental values of muon g-2 while providing testable signals for lepton flavor violation in charged lepton decays. Moreover, these models predict LSP neutralino abundance that is compatible with the Planck dark matter bounds. We find that scenarios in the framework of $SU(4)_c\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ unification, with additional symmetries to explain fermion masses and neutrino oscillations, provide interesting benchmarks for the search of SUSY by correlating a possible manifestation of it in dark matter, rare lepton decays and LHC signals.</description>

      <title>Minimal complete tri-hypercharge theories of flavour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tri-hypercharge proposal introduces a separate gauged weak hypercharge assigned to each fermion family as the origin of flavour. This is arguably one of the simplest setups for building "gauge non-universal theories of flavour" or "flavour deconstructed theories". In this paper we propose and study two minimal but ultraviolet complete and renormalisable tri-hypercharge models. We show that both models, which differ only by the heavy messengers that complete the effective theory, are able to explain the observed patterns of fermion masses and mixings (including neutrinos) with all fundamental coefficients being of $\mathcal{O}(1)$. In fact, both models translate the complicated flavour structure of the Standard Model into three simple physical scales above electroweak symmetry breaking, completely correlated with each other, that carry meaningful phenomenology. In particular, the heavy messenger sector determines the origin and size of fermion mixing, which controls the size and nature of the flavour-violating currents mediated by the two heavy $Z'$ gauge bosons of the theory. The phenomenological implications of the two minimal models are compared. In both models the lightest $Z'$ remains discoverable in dilepton searches at the LHC Run 3.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the exclusive two-body nonleptonic decays of $B_s$ meson to ground as well as radially excited $2S$ charmonium state with a light meson $K_s$, induced by the $b\to c\bar{c}d$ transition. Within the framework of relativistic independent quark (RIQ) model based on a flavor-independent interaction potential in scalar-vector harmonic form, we calculate the weak form factors from the overlapping integrals of meson wave function obtained in this model. Using the factorization approximation, we predict the branching fractions for the $B_s \to \psi(1S,2S) K_s$ and $B_s \to \eta_c(1S,2S) K_s$, which can be compared with future theoretical predictions. Branching fraction for $B_s\to J/\psi K_s$ decay is found to be in good agreement with the data from LHCb Collaboration, whereas for $B_s\to \psi(2S) K_s$, it is found to be within the detection ability of the CMS Collaboration. We also predict the ratios of branching fractions $(\cal{R})$, which are in broad agreement with the data from LHCb Collaboration. These results indicate that the present approach works well in the description of exclusive nonleptonic $B_s$ decays within the framework of the RIQ model.</description>

      <title>Heavy Dark Matter in White Dwarfs: Multiple-Scattering Capture and Thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an improved treatment for the scattering of heavy dark matter from the ion constituents of a white dwarf. In the heavy dark matter regime, multiple collisions are required for the dark matter to become gravitationally captured. Our treatment incorporates all relevant physical effects including the dark matter trajectories, nuclear form factors, and radial profiles for the white dwarf escape velocity and target number densities. Our capture rates differ by orders of magnitude from previous estimates, which have typically used approximations developed for dark matter scattering in the Earth. We also compute the time for the dark matter to thermalize in the center of the white dwarf, including in-medium effects such as phonon emission and absorption from the ionic lattice in the case where the star has a crystallized core. We find much shorter thermalization timescales than previously estimated, especially if the white dwarf core has crystallized. We illustrate the importance of our improved approach by determining the cross section required for accumulated asymmetric dark matter to self-gravitate.</description>

Abstract: We describe the application of effective field theories for quantum chromodynamics (QCD) to two bound states involving heavy quarks: the $T_{cc}^+$ exotic meson and the $J/\psi$. We study the decay of the $T_{cc}^+$ in an effective theory for hadronic molecules, and find agreement with experiment. We also use the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization formalism to derive the leading-order transverse momentum dependent fragmentation functions (FFs) for quarks and gluons fragmenting to $J/\psi$. We then make use of these TMD FFs to compare the $J/\psi$ production mechanisms of light quark fragmentation and photon-gluon fusion, where the conclusions we draw can motivate future experiments at the Electron Ion Collider, shedding light on the inner structure of nucleons and testing ideas from NRQCD factorization. These results showcase the utility of effective field theories in explaining experiments and testing key concepts in nuclear/particle physics.</description>

      <title>Small Instanton Effects on Composite Axion Mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of small instanton effects on the axion mass in composite axion models. In particular, we focus on the Composite Accidental Axion (CAA) models, which are designed to address the axion quality problem, and where the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry emerges accidentally. In the CAA models, the QCD gauge symmetry is embedded in a larger gauge group at high energy. These models contain small instantons not included in low-energy QCD, which could enhance the axion mass significantly. However, in the CAA models, our analysis reveals that these effects on the axion mass are non-vanishing but are negligible compared to the QCD effects. The suppression of the small instanton effects originates from the global chiral U(1) symmetries which are not broken spontaneously and play a crucial role in eliminating $\theta$-terms in the hidden sectors through anomalies. We find these U(1) symmetries restrict the impact of small instantons in hidden sectors on the axion mass. Our study provides crucial insights into the dynamics within the CAA models and suggests broader implications for understanding small instanton effects in other composite axion models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the vacuum structure of an eight-dimensional non-abelian gauge theory with a compactified four-dimensional torus as the extra dimensions. As a non-trivial background configuration of the gauge field of an $SU(n)$ gauge group, we suppose a magnetic flux in two extra dimensions, and continuous Wilson line phases are also involved. We introduce matter fields and calculate the mass spectrum of low-energy modes appearing in a four-dimensional effective theory in an $SU(3)$ model as an explicit example. As expected, potentially tachyonic states in four-dimensional modes appear from extra-dimensional gauge fields that couple to the flux background since the gauge group is simply connected. The Wilson line phases give a non-vanishing contribution to their masses, and we have a low-energy mass spectrum without tachyonic states, given that these phases take an appropriate value. To verify the validity of the values of the Wilson line phases, we examine the one-loop effective potential for these phases and explicitly show the contribution from each type of field present in our model. It is clarified that, although there seems to be no local minimum in the potential for the Wilson line phases in the pure Yang-Mills case, by including matter fields, we could find a vacuum configuration where tachyonic states disappear.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryon number violation is our most sensitive probe of physics beyond the Standard Model, especially through the study of nucleon decays. Angular momentum conservation requires a lepton in the final state of such decays, kinematically restricted to electrons, muons, or neutrinos. We show that operators involving taus, which are at first sight too heavy to play a role in nucleon decays, still lead to clean nucleon decay channels with tau neutrinos. While many of them are already constrained from existing two-body searches such as $p\to \pi^+\nu$, other operators induce many-body decays such as $p \to \eta \pi^{+} \bar\nu_\tau$ and $n\to K^+ \pi^-\nu_\tau$ that have never been searched for.</description>

      <title>Non-holomorphic modular flavor symmetry</title>

Abstract: The formalism of non-holomorphic modular flavor symmetry is developed, and the Yukawa couplings are level $N$ polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms satisfying the Laplacian condition. We find that the integer (even) weight polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms of level $N$ can be decomposed into multiplets of the finite modular group $\Gamma'_N$ ($\Gamma_N$). The original modular invariance approach is extended by the presence of negative weight polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms. The non-holomorphic modular flavor symmetry can be consistently combined with the generalized CP symmetry. We present three example models for lepton sector based on the $\Gamma_3\cong A_4$ modular symmetry, the charged lepton masses and the neutrino oscillation data can be accommodated very well, and the predictions for the leptonic CP violation phases and the effective Majorana neutrino mass are studied.</description>

      <title>A quark core-gluon model for heavy hybrid baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Besides the ordinary hadrons, QCD allows the existence of states in which excitations of the gluonic field can play the role of valence particles, either alone in a glueball, or coupled to quarks in a hybrid. So, hybrid baryons, made of three quarks and a gluon, can a priori exist. Till now, there is no experimental evidence for such exotic hadrons but experimental efforts are being made to search for them at CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer. In this work, a hybrid baryon is considered as a two-body system composed of a color octet three-quark core and a gluon, interacting via a QCD-inspired interaction. A semirelativistic potential model is built in which the dominant interaction is a potential simulating the flux tube confinement, and the Casimir scaling is assumed to link interactions between triplet and octet color sources. This picture is similar to the quark-diquark description for baryons. It is chosen in order to take properly into account the helicity of the gluon. Only $cccg$ and $bbbg$ states are considered because the strong mass asymmetry between the quark core and the gluon is expected to favor the formation of the core. As the results for heavy hybrid baryons seem relevant, we consider this paper as a proof of concept which can be extended for the study of light hybrid baryons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Different ways exist to obtain the elements of the $\{\beta \}$-expansion for renormgroup invariant quantities. Here we consider independent confirmation within the standard QCD of a number of our results [1] for the values of elements of this expansion for the nonsinglet Adler $D_A$-function, Bjorken polarized sum rules $S^{Bjp}$ up to the order N$^4$LO. We suggest an approach to estimate the results of high order QCD calculations using a smaller number of diagrams of the specific type. This type is based on a proposed generalization of Naive NonAbelianization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that measurements of single transverse-spin asymmetries at an $e^+e^-$ collider can enhance the sensitivity to the electron Yukawa coupling, possibly enabling observation of the Standard Model value for this quantity. We demonstrate that the significance in both the $b\bar{b}$ and semi-leptonic $WW$ final states can be enhanced by factors of up to three compared to inclusive cross section determinations of this coupling for transversely-polarized electrons. If the positrons can be simultaneously longitudinally polarized, even at the level of 30\%, the significance can be enhanced by a factor of five or more. The method utilizes quantum interference between the Higgs signal and the continuum background and is also applicable in other $WW$ and $ZZ$ final states.</description>

Abstract: We present a recent calculation of the quark and gluon contributions to the angular momentum of a composite spin -$1/2$ state in QCD. The state we consider is a quark dressed with a gluon, and we use the two-component framework in light-front Hamiltonian QCD. We compare the results from different decompositions available in the literature. We also present the angular momentum distributions.</description>

      <title>{\gamma}-Ray and ultra-high energy neutrino background suppression due to solar radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03807v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sun emits copious amounts of photons and neutrinos in an approximately spatially isotropic distribution. Diffuse $\gamma$-rays and ultra-high energy (UHE) neutrinos from extragalactic sources may subsequently interact and annihilate with the emitted solar photons and neutrinos respectively. This will in turn induce an anisotropy in the cosmic ray (CR) background due to attenuation of the $\gamma$-ray and UHE neutrino flux by the solar radiation. Measuring this reduction, therefore, presents a simple and powerful astrophysical probe of electroweak interactions. In this letter we compute such anisotropies for TeV $\gamma$-rays, which at the Earth (Sun) can be at least $\simeq 10^{-4},(10^{-2})$. The optical depth at Earth for elongation angles more focused around the Sun ($\lesssim 10^\circ$), can be around $10^{-3}$ and larger. Neutrino attenuation is extremely tiny for for PeV scale UHE neutrinos. We briefly discuss observational prospects for experiments such as the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope Large Area Telescope (Fermi LAT), High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) detector, The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and IceCube. The potential for measuring $\gamma$-ray attenuation at orbital locations of other active satellites such as the Parker Solar Probe and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is also explored.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies by LHAASO have shown the presence of high-luminosity PeVatrons in our Galaxy. We examine two notable sources, each consisting of two pulsars, detected by LHAASO. We study gamma and cosmic-ray emissions from the surroundings of these pulsars. We used the Gammapy software to perform gamma-ray measurements from these sources in anticipation of future analyses to be carried out with the CTAO, which is now under development. Furthermore, the particle propagation throughout the Galaxy was simulated using the GALPROP software, accounting for emission from energy losses due to spin-down. As a result, we present the particle spectra generated during this propagation phase along with the corresponding gamma-ray emission. The findings suggest that CTAO may have the capability to detect these sources and show that the data can be explained by gamma rays coming from a leptonic model.</description>

      <title>Development of generic no-scale inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop generalized no-scale supergravity models of inflation, and then study the corresponding cosmological predictions as well as the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) and scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). With a new parameter $0&lt;a\leq 1$, the generalized no-scale supergravity provides the continuous connections among the generic no-scale supergravity from string theory compactifications. The resulting prediction of the CMB, spectrum index $n_s$, and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ can be highly consistent with the latest Planck/BICEP/Keck Array observations. Notably, the models with $a\neq 1$ give a smaller ratio $r\leq 10^{-3}$, which is flexible even under the anticipated tighter observational constraints at the future experiments. Additionally, these models have the potential to generate a broad-band stochastic gravitational wave background, and thus explain the NANOGrav 15yr signal. Furthermore, they predict the formation of PBHs with various mass scales, which could account for a significant portion of dark matter relic density in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Yukawa Couplings at Infinite Distance and Swampland Towers in Chiral Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study limits of vanishing Yukawa couplings of 4d chiral matter fields in Quantum Gravity, using as a laboratory type IIA orientifolds with D6-branes. In these theories chiral fermions arise at brane intersections, where an infinite tower of charged particles dubbed gonions are localised. We show that in the limit $Y\rightarrow 0$ some of these towers become asymptotically massless, while at the same time the kinetic term of some chiral fields becomes singular and at least two extra dimensions decompactify. For limits parametrised by a large complex structure saxion $u$, Yukawa couplings have a behaviour of the form $Y \, \sim \, {1}/{u^r}$, with $r$ some positive rational number. Moreover, in this limit some of the gauge couplings associated to the Yukawa vanish. The lightest gonion scales are of order $m_{\rm gon} \sim g^s M_{\rm P}$ with $s&gt;1$, verifying the magnetic WGC with room to spare and with no need of its tower/sublattice versions. We also show how this behaviour can be understood in the context of the emergence of kinetic terms in Quantum Gravity. All these results may be very relevant for phenomenology, given the fact that some of the Yukawa couplings in the Standard Model are very small.</description>

Abstract: We analyze particle number fluctuations in the crossover region near the critical endpoint of a first-order phase transition by utilizing molecular dynamics simulations of the classical Lennard-Jones fluid. We extend our previous study [V.A. Kuznietsov et al., Phys. Rev. C 105, 044903 (2022)] by incorporating longitudinal collective flow. The scaled variance of particle number distribution inside different coordinate and momentum space acceptances is computed through ensemble averaging and found to agree with earlier results obtained using time averaging, validating the ergodic hypothesis for fluctuation observables. Presence of a sizable collective flow is found to be essential for observing large fluctuations from the critical point in momentum space acceptances. We discuss our findings in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reconstruct the cosmological background evolution under the scenario of dynamical dark energy through the Gaussian process approach, using the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) combined with other observations. Our results reveal that the reconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameter $w(z)$ exhibits the so-called quintom-B behavior, crossing $-1$ from phantom to quintessence regime as the universe expands. We investigate under what situation this type of evolution could be achieved from the perspectives of field theories and modified gravity. In particular, we reconstruct the corresponding actions for $f(R)$, $f(T)$, and $f(Q)$ gravity, respectively. We explicitly show that, certain modified gravity can exhibit the quintom dynamics and fit the recent DESI data efficiently, and for all cases the quadratic deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM scenario is mildly favored.</description>

      <title>On small Dirac Neutrino Masses in String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how tiny Dirac neutrino masses consistent with experimental constraints can arise in string theory SM-like vacua. We use as a laboratory 4d ${\cal N}=1$ type IIA Calabi--Yau orientifold compactifications, and in particular recent results on Yukawa couplings at infinite field-space distance. In this regime we find Dirac neutrino masses of the form $m_\nu \simeq g_\nu\langle H\rangle$, with $g_{\nu}$ the gauge coupling of the massive $U(1)$ under which the right-handed neutrinos $\nu_R$ are charged, and which should be in the range $g_{\nu}\simeq 10^{-14}-10^{-12}$ to reproduce neutrino data. The neutrino mass suppression occurs because the right-handed neutrino kinetic term behaves as $K_{\nu\nu} \simeq 1 /g_{\nu}^2 $. At the same time a tower of $\nu_R$-like states appears with characteristic scale $m_0\simeq g_{\nu}^2M_{\rm P}\simeq 0.1-500$ eV, in agreement with Swampland expectations. Two large hidden dimensions only felt by the $\nu_R$ sector arise at the same scale, while the string scale is around $M_s\simeq g_\nu M_{\rm P}\simeq 10-700$ TeV. Some phenomenological implications and model building challenges are described. As a byproduct, independently of the neutrino issue, we argue that a single large dimension in the context of SM-like type IIA Calabi--Yau orientifolds leads to too small Yukawa couplings for quarks and charged leptons.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking neutrino interaction models via a comparative analysis of kinematic imbalance measurements from the T2K, MicroBooNE and MINERvA experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent neutrino-nucleus cross-section measurements of observables characterising kinematic imbalance from the T2K, MicroBooNE and MINERvA experiments are used to benchmark predictions from widely used neutrino interaction event generators. Given the different neutrino energy spectra and nuclear targets employed by the three experiments, comparisons of model predictions to their measurements breaks degeneracies that would be present in any single measurement. In particular, the comparison of T2K and MINERvA measurements offers a probe of energy dependence, whilst a comparison of T2K and MicroBooNE investigates scaling with nuclear target. In order to isolate the impact of individual nuclear effects, model comparisons are made following systematic alterations to: the nuclear ground state; final state interactions and multi-nucleon interaction strength. The measurements are further compared to the generators used as an input to DUNE/SBN and T2K/Hyper-K analyses. Whilst no model is able to quantitatively describe all the measurements, evidence is found for mis-modelling of A-scaling in multi-nucleon interactions and it is found that tight control over how energy is distributed among hadrons following final state interactions is likely to be crucial to achieving improved agreement. Overall, this work provides a novel characterisation of neutrino interactions whilst offering guidance for refining existing generator predictions.</description>
