      <title>Random Gabidulin Codes Achieve List Decoding Capacity in the Rank Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gabidulin codes, serving as the rank-metric counterpart of Reed-Solomon codes, constitute an important class of maximum rank distance (MRD) codes. However, unlike the fruitful positive results about the list decoding of Reed-Solomon codes, results concerning the list decodability of Gabidulin codes in the rank metric are all negative so far. For example, in contrast to Reed-Solomon codes, which are always list decodable up to the Johnson bound in the Hamming metric, Raviv and Wachter-Zeh (IEEE TIT, 2016 and 2017) constructed a class of Gabidulin codes that are not even combinatorially list decodable beyond the unique decoding radius in the rank metric. Proving the existence of Gabidulin codes with good combinatorial list decodability in the rank metric has remained a long-standing open problem.
  In this paper, we resolve the aforementioned open problem by showing that, with high probability, random Gabidulin codes over sufficiently large alphabets attain the optimal generalized Singleton bound for list decoding in the rank metric. In particular, they achieve list decoding capacity in the rank metric.
  Our work is significantly influenced by the recent breakthroughs in the combinatorial list decodability of Reed-Solomon codes, especially the work by Brakensiek, Gopi, and Makam (STOC 2023). Our major technical contributions, which may hold independent interest, consist of the following: (1) We initiate the study of ``higher order MRD codes'' and provide a novel unified theory, which runs parallel to the theory of ``higher order MDS codes'' developed by BGM. (2) We prove a natural analog of the GM-MDS theorem, proven by Lovett (FOCS 2018) and Yildiz and Hassibi (IEEE TIT, 2019), which we call the GM-MRD theorem. In particular, our GM-MRD theorem for Gabidulin codes are strictly stronger than the GM-MDS theorem for Gabidulin codes, proven by Yildiz and Hassibi (IEEE TIT, 2019).</description>

      <title>Additive Complementary Pairs of Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An additive code is an $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear subspace of $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}^n$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$, which is not a linear subspace over $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$. Linear complementary pairs(LCP) of codes have important roles in cryptography, such as increasing the speed and capacity of digital communication and strengthening security by improving the encryption necessities to resist cryptanalytic attacks. This paper studies an algebraic structure of additive complementary pairs (ACP) of codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$. Further, we characterize an ACP of codes in analogous generator matrices and parity check matrices. Additionally, we identify a necessary condition for an ACP of codes. Besides, we present some constructions of an ACP of codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ from LCP codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ and also from an LCP of codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Finally, we study the constacyclic ACP of codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ and the counting of the constacyclic ACP of codes. As an application of our study, we consider a class of quantum codes called Entanglement Assisted Quantum Error Correcting Code (EAQEC codes). As a consequence, we derive some EAQEC codes.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Integrated Sensing and Communications Using Uplink-Downlink Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel optimization framework for beamforming design in integrated sensing and communication systems where a base station seeks to minimize the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound of a sensing problem while satisfying quality of service constraints for the communication users. Prior approaches formulate the design problem as a semidefinite program for which acquiring a beamforming solution is computationally expensive. In this work, we show that the computational burden can be considerably alleviated. To achieve this, we transform the design problem to a tractable form that not only provides a new understanding of Cram\'er-Rao bound optimization, but also allows for an uplink-downlink duality relation to be developed. Such a duality result gives rise to an efficient algorithm that enables the beamforming design problem to be solved at a much lower complexity as compared to the-state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of RIS-Assisted Spectrum Sharing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted underlay spectrum sharing system, in which a RIS-assisted secondary network shares the spectrum licensed for a primary network. The secondary network consists of a secondary source (SS), an RIS, and a secondary destination (SD), operating in a Rician fading environment. We study the performance of the secondary network while considering a peak power constraint at the SS and an interference power constraint at the primary receiver (PR). Initially, we characterize the statistics of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the RIS-assisted secondary network by deriving novel analytical expressions for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) in terms of the incomplete H-function. Building upon the SNR statistics, we analyze the outage probability, ergodic capacity, and average bit error rate, subsequently deriving novel exact expressions for these performance measures. Furthermore, we obtain novel asymptotic expressions for the performance measures of interest when the peak power of the SS is high. Finally, we conduct exhaustive Monte-Carlo simulations to confirm the correctness of our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit and Reflective Beamforming for Multi-Active-IRS-Assisted Cooperative Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies multi-active intelligent-reflecting-surface (IRS) cooperative sensing, in which multiple active IRSs are deployed in a distributed manner to help the base station (BS) provide multi-view sensing. We focus on the scenario where the sensing target is located in the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) area of the BS. Based on the received echo signal, the BS aims to estimate the target's direction-of-arrival (DoA) with respect to each IRS. In addition, we leverage active IRSs to overcome the severe path loss induced by multi-hop reflections. Under this setup, we minimize the maximum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) among all IRSs by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the BS and the reflective beamforming at the multiple IRSs, subject to the constraints on the maximum transmit power at the BS, as well as the maximum transmit power and the maximum power amplification gain at individual IRSs. To tackle the resulting highly non-convex max-CRB minimization problem, we propose an efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization, successive convex approximation, and semi-definite relaxation, to obtain a high-quality solution. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of our proposed design and the benefits of active IRS-assisted sensing compared to the counterpart with passive IRSs.</description>

      <title>Beyond MMSE: Rank-1 Subspace Channel Estimator for Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To glean the benefits offered by massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, channel state information must be accurately acquired. Despite the high accuracy, the computational complexity of classical linear minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator becomes prohibitively high in the context of massive MIMO, while the other low-complexity methods degrade the estimation accuracy seriously. In this paper, we develop a novel rank-1 subspace channel estimator to approximate the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, which outperforms the linear MMSE estimator, but incurs a surprisingly low computational complexity. Our method first acquires the highly accurate angle-of-arrival (AoA) information via a constructed space-embedding matrix and the rank-1 subspace method. Then, it adopts the post-reception beamforming to acquire the unbiased estimate of channel gains. Furthermore, a fast method is designed to implement our new estimator. Theoretical analysis shows that the extra gain achieved by our method over the linear MMSE estimator grows according to the rule of O($\log_{10}M$), while its computational complexity is linearly scalable to the number of antennas $M$. Numerical simulations also validate the theoretical results. Our new method substantially extends the accuracy-complexity region and constitutes a promising channel estimation solution to the emerging massive MIMO communications.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Capacity-Achieving Private Information Retrieval with Non-Colluding and Colluding Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Private Information Retrieval (PIR) is a mechanism for efficiently downloading messages while keeping the index secret. Here, PIRs in which servers do not communicate with each other are called standard PIRs, and PIRs in which some servers communicate with each other are called colluding PIRs. The information-theoretic upper bound on efficiency has been given in previous studies. However, the conditions for PIRs to keep privacy, to decode the desired message, and to achieve that upper bound have not been clarified. In this paper, we prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving the capacity in standard PIRs and colluding PIRs.</description>

      <title>On de Bruijn Covering Sequences and Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $(m,n,R)$-de Bruijn covering array (dBCA) is a doubly periodic $M \times N$ array over an alphabet of size $q$ such that the set of all its $m \times n$ windows form a covering code with radius $R$. An upper bound of the smallest array area of an $(m,n,R)$-dBCA is provided using a probabilistic technique which is similar to the one that was used for an upper bound on the length of a de Bruijn covering sequence. A folding technique to construct a dBCA from a de Bruijn covering sequence or de Bruijn covering sequences code is presented. Several new constructions that yield shorter de Bruijn covering sequences and $(m,n,R)$-dBCAs with smaller areas are also provided. These constructions are mainly based on sequences derived from cyclic codes, self-dual sequences, primitive polynomials, an interleaving technique, folding, and mutual shifts of sequences with the same covering radius. Finally, constructions of de Bruijn covering sequences codes are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Identification Capacity of AWGN Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the second-order randomized identification capacity (RID capacity) of the Additive White Gaussian Noise Channel (AWGNC). On the one hand, we obtain a refined version of Hayashi's theorem to prove the achievability part. On the other, we investigate the relationship between identification and channel resolvability, then we propose a finer quantization method to prove the converse part. Consequently, the second-order RID capacity of the AWGNC has the same form as the second-order transmission capacity. The only difference is that the maximum number of messages in RID \emph{scales double exponentially} in the blocklength.</description>

Abstract: This letter considers an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multi-user uplink massive multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) system with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The letter derives the closedform approximate expression for the sum achievable rate (AR), where the maximum ratio combination (MRC) processing and low-resolution ADCs are applied at the base station. The system performance is analyzed, and a genetic algorithm (GA)-based method is proposed to optimize the RIS's phase shifts for enhancing the system performance. Numerical results verify the accuracy of the derivations, and demonstrate that the active RIS has an evident performance gain over the passive RIS.</description>

      <title>Optimal Structure of Receive Beamforming for Over-the-Air Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fast data aggregation via over-the-air computation (AirComp) over wireless networks. In this scenario, an access point (AP) with multiple antennas aims to recover the arithmetic mean of sensory data from multiple wireless devices. To minimize estimation distortion, we formulate a mean-squared-error (MSE) minimization problem that considers joint optimization of transmit scalars at wireless devices, denoising factor, and receive beamforming vector at the AP. We derive closed-form expressions for the transmit scalars and denoising factor, resulting in a non-convex quadratic constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem concerning the receive beamforming vector. To tackle the computational complexity of the beamforming design, particularly relevant in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) AirComp systems, we explore the optimal structure of receive beamforming using successive convex approximation (SCA) and Lagrange duality. By leveraging the proposed optimal beamforming structure, we develop two efficient algorithms based on SCA and semi-definite relaxation (SDR). These algorithms enable fast wireless aggregation with low computational complexity and yield almost identical mean square error (MSE) performance compared to baseline algorithms. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Covert Multi-Access Communication with a Non-Covert User</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize the fundamental limits of a communication system with three users (i.e., three transmitters) and a single receiver where communication from two covert users must remain undetectable to an external warden. Our results show a tradeoff between the highest rates that are simultaneously achievable for the three users. They further show that the presence of a non-covert user in the system can enhance the capacities of the covert users under stringent secret-key constraints. To derive our fundamental limits, we provide an information-theoretic converse proof and present a coding scheme that achieves the performance of our converse result. Our coding scheme is based on multiplexing different code phases, which seems to be essential to exhaust the entire tradeoff region between the rates at the covert and the two non-covert users. This property is reminiscent of the setup with multiple non-covert users, where multiplexing is also required to exhaust the entire rate-region.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning-based Joint Precoding and Phase Shift Optimization for RIS-aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a promising technique for achieving high spectral efficiency (SE) using multiple distributed access points (APs). However, harsh propagation environments often lead to significant communication performance degradation due to high penetration loss. To overcome this issue, we introduce the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into the CF mMIMO system as a low-cost and power-efficient solution. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the joint precoding design of the RIS-aided CF mMIMO system to maximize the sum SE. This involves optimizing the precoding matrix at the APs and the reflection coefficients at the RIS. To tackle this problem, we propose a fully distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that incorporates fuzzy logic (FL). Unlike conventional approaches that rely on alternating optimization techniques, our FL-based MARL algorithm only requires local channel state information, which reduces the need for high backhaul capacity. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed FL-MARL algorithm effectively reduces computational complexity while achieving similar performance as conventional MARL methods.</description>

      <title>Sliding window-aided ordered statistics decoding for short LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach to the design of efficient decoders that meet the rigorous requirements of modern communication systems, particularly in terms of ultra-reliability and low latency. We enhance an established hybrid decoding framework by proposing an ordered statistical decoding scheme augmented with a sliding window technique. This novel component replaces a key element of the current architecture, significantly reducing average complexity. A critical aspect of our scheme is the integration of a pre-trained neural network model that dynamically determines the progression or halt of the sliding window process. Furthermore, we present a user-defined soft margin mechanism that adeptly balances the trade-off between decoding accuracy and complexity. Empirical results, supported by a thorough complexity analysis, demonstrate that the proposed scheme holds a competitive advantage over existing state-of-the-art decoders, notably in addressing the decoding failures prevalent in neural min-sum decoders. Additionally, our research uncovers that short LDPC codes can deliver performance comparable to that of short classical linear codes within the critical waterfall region of the SNR, highlighting their potential for practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work considers the $N$-server distributed computing scenario with $K$ users requesting functions that are linearly-decomposable over an arbitrary basis of $L$ real (potentially non-linear) subfunctions. In our problem, the aim is for each user to receive their function outputs, allowing for reduced reconstruction error (distortion) $\epsilon$, reduced computing cost ($\gamma$; the fraction of subfunctions each server must compute), and reduced communication cost ($\delta$; the fraction of users each server must connect to). For any given set of $K$ requested functions -- which is here represented by a coefficient matrix $\mathbf {F} \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times L}$ -- our problem is made equivalent to the open problem of sparse matrix factorization that seeks -- for a given parameter $T$, representing the number of shots for each server -- to minimize the reconstruction distortion $\frac{1}{KL}\|\mathbf {F} - \mathbf{D}\mathbf{E}\|^2_{F}$ overall $\delta$-sparse and $\gamma$-sparse matrices $\mathbf{D}\in \mathbb{R}^{K \times NT}$ and $\mathbf{E} \in \mathbb{R}^{NT \times L}$. With these matrices respectively defining which servers compute each subfunction, and which users connect to each server, we here design our $\mathbf{D},\mathbf{E}$ by designing tessellated-based and SVD-based fixed support matrix factorization methods that first split $\mathbf{F}$ into properly sized and carefully positioned submatrices, which we then approximate and then decompose into properly designed submatrices of $\mathbf{D}$ and $\mathbf{E}$.</description>

      <title>Sequential Outlier Hypothesis Testing under Universality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit sequential outlier hypothesis testing and derive bounds on the achievable exponents. Specifically, the task of outlier hypothesis testing is to identify the set of outliers that are generated from an anomalous distribution among all observed sequences where most are generated from a nominal distribution. In the sequential setting, one obtains a sample from each sequence per unit time until a reliable decision could be made. We assume that the number of outliers is known while both the nominal and anomalous distributions are unknown. For the case of exactly one outlier, our bounds on the achievable exponents are tight, providing exact large deviations characterization of sequential tests and strengthening a previous result of Li, Nitinawarat and Veeravalli (2017). In particular, we propose a sequential test that has bounded average sample size and better theoretical performance than the fixed-length test, which could not be guaranteed by the corresponding sequential test of Li, Nitinawarat and Veeravalli (2017). Our results are also generalized to the case of multiple outliers.</description>

      <title>Function Computation and Identification over Locally Homomorphic Multiple-Access Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the notion of a locally homomorphic channel and prove an approximate equivalence between those and codes for computing functions. Further, we derive decomposition properties of locally homomorphic channels which we use to analyze and construct codes where two messages must be encoded independently. This leads to new results for identification and K-identification when all messages are sent over multiple-access channels, which yield surprising rate improvements compared to naive code constructions. In particular, we demonstrate that for the example of identification with deterministic encoders, both encoders can be constructed independently.</description>

Abstract: The semantics of content is one of the essential constituents of models of innovative educational systems. It is gradually built based on normative efforts carried out by different actors in the fields of the technological industry, telecommunications, IT, linguistic engineering, information sciences documentation, etc. Semantics in networks and digital information systems represent, in fact, an advanced link in a long process of processing digital information in which terminological work occupies an important part. This process is also very consolidated by a wide range of norms and standards which ensure very high levels of technical, organizational, and semantic interoperability.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Filtering Based on Diffusion Models: Unveiling the Potential of High-Order Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent study has shown that diffusion models are well-suited for modeling the generative process of user-item interactions in recommender systems due to their denoising nature. However, existing diffusion model-based recommender systems do not explicitly leverage high-order connectivities that contain crucial collaborative signals for accurate recommendations. Addressing this gap, we propose CF-Diff, a new diffusion model-based collaborative filtering (CF) method, which is capable of making full use of collaborative signals along with multi-hop neighbors. Specifically, the forward-diffusion process adds random noise to user-item interactions, while the reverse-denoising process accommodates our own learning model, named cross-attention-guided multi-hop autoencoder (CAM-AE), to gradually recover the original user-item interactions. CAM-AE consists of two core modules: 1) the attention-aided AE module, responsible for precisely learning latent representations of user-item interactions while preserving the model's complexity at manageable levels, and 2) the multi-hop cross-attention module, which judiciously harnesses high-order connectivity information to capture enhanced collaborative signals. Through comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that CF-Diff is (a) Superior: outperforming benchmark recommendation methods, achieving remarkable gains up to 7.29% compared to the best competitor, (b) Theoretically-validated: reducing computations while ensuring that the embeddings generated by our model closely approximate those from the original cross-attention, and (c) Scalable: proving the computational efficiency that scales linearly with the number of users or items.</description>

      <title>Turbo-CF: Matrix Decomposition-Free Graph Filtering for Fast Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A series of graph filtering (GF)-based collaborative filtering (CF) showcases state-of-the-art performance on the recommendation accuracy by using a low-pass filter (LPF) without a training process. However, conventional GF-based CF approaches mostly perform matrix decomposition on the item-item similarity graph to realize the ideal LPF, which results in a non-trivial computational cost and thus makes them less practical in scenarios where rapid recommendations are essential. In this paper, we propose Turbo-CF, a GF-based CF method that is both training-free and matrix decomposition-free. Turbo-CF employs a polynomial graph filter to circumvent the issue of expensive matrix decompositions, enabling us to make full use of modern computer hardware components (i.e., GPU). Specifically, Turbo-CF first constructs an item-item similarity graph whose edge weights are effectively regulated. Then, our own polynomial LPFs are designed to retain only low-frequency signals without explicit matrix decompositions. We demonstrate that Turbo-CF is extremely fast yet accurate, achieving a runtime of less than 1 second on real-world benchmark datasets while achieving recommendation accuracies comparable to best competitors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence and Distinguishability: A Resource-Theoretic Perspective on Wave-Particle Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave-particle duality, the cornerstone of quantum mechanics, illustrates essential trade-offs between two complementary aspects of quantum systems. Captured by Bohr's complementarity principle, the wave-particle duality relation indicates that perfect path discrimination in a multipath interferometer obliterates interference patterns and vice versa. In this work, from the perspective of coherence resource manipulation, we uncover a novel duality relation between quantum coherence and distinguishability in ensembles of mutually orthogonal pure states. We demonstrate the sum of `co-bits', coherence preserved after discrimination, and classical bits, distinguishability extracted through perfect discrimination is bounded. One cannot simultaneously extract all classical information and preserve coherence. Such duality relation exposes an inherent trade-off between quantum coherence and classical distinguishability resources. Our findings offer a fresh perspective and advance our understanding of the intrinsic complementary relationship between quantum and classical resources.</description>

      <title>Decoding Error Probability of the Random Matrix Ensemble over the Erasure Channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.09989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using tools developed in a recent work by Shen and the second author, in this paper we carry out an in-depth study on the average decoding error probability of the random matrix ensemble over the erasure channel under three decoding principles, namely unambiguous decoding, maximum likelihood decoding and list decoding. We obtain explicit formulas for the average decoding error probabilities of the random matrix ensemble under these three decoding principles and compute the error exponents. Moreover, for unambiguous decoding, we compute the variance of the decoding error probability of the random matrix ensemble and the error exponent of the variance, which imply a strong concentration result, that is, roughly speaking, the ratio of the decoding error probability of a random code in the ensemble and the average decoding error probability of the ensemble converges to 1 with high probability when the code length goes to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A primary objective of the forthcoming sixth generation (6G) of wireless networking is to support demanding applications, while ensuring energy efficiency. Programmable wireless environments (PWEs) have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), to control wireless propagation and deliver exceptional quality-ofservice. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a network supported by zero-energy RISs (zeRISs), which harvest energy for their operation and contribute to the realization of PWEs. Specifically, we investigate joint energy-data rate outage probability and the energy efficiency of a zeRIS-assisted communication system by employing three harvest-and-reflect (HaR) methods, i) power splitting, ii) time switching, and iii) element splitting. Furthermore, we consider two zeRIS deployment strategies, namely BS-side zeRIS and UE-side zeRIS. Simulation results validate the provided analysis and examine which HaR method performs better depending on the zeRIS placement. Finally, valuable insights and conclusions for the performance of zeRISassisted wireless networks are drawn from the presented results.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bounds for Neural Belief Propagation Decoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning based approaches are being increasingly used for designing decoders for next generation communication systems. One widely used framework is neural belief propagation (NBP), which unfolds the belief propagation (BP) iterations into a deep neural network and the parameters are trained in a data-driven manner. NBP decoders have been shown to improve upon classical decoding algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the generalization capabilities of NBP decoders. Specifically, the generalization gap of a decoder is the difference between empirical and expected bit-error-rate(s). We present new theoretical results which bound this gap and show the dependence on the decoder complexity, in terms of code parameters (blocklength, message length, variable/check node degrees), decoding iterations, and the training dataset size. Results are presented for both regular and irregular parity-check matrices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first set of theoretical results on generalization performance of neural network based decoders. We present experimental results to show the dependence of generalization gap on the training dataset size, and decoding iterations for different codes.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of OTSM under Hardware Impairments and Imperfect CSI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal time sequency multiplexing (OTSM) has been recently proposed as a single-carrier waveform offering similar bit error rate to orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and outperforms orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in doubly-spread channels (DSCs); however, with a much lower complexity making it a potential candidate for 6G wireless networks. In this paper, the performance of OTSM is explored by considering the joint effects of multiple hardware impairments (HWIs) such as in-phase and quadrature imbalance (IQI), direct current offset (DCO), phase noise, power amplifier non-linearity, carrier frequency offset, and synchronization timing offset for the first time in the area. First, the discrete-time baseband signal model is obtained in vector form under all mentioned HWIs. Second, the system input-output relations are derived in time, delay-time, and delay-sequency (DS) domains in which the parameters of all mentioned HWIs are incorporated. Third, analytical expressions are derived for the pairwise and average bit error probability under imperfect channel state information (CSI) as a function of the parameters of all mentioned HWIs. Analytical results demonstrate that under all mentioned HWIs, noise stays additive white Gaussian, effective channel matrix is sparse, DCO appears as a DC signal at the receiver interfering with only the zero sequency, and IQI redounds to self-conjugated sequency interference in the DS domain. Simulation results reveal the fact that by considering the joint effects of all mentioned HWIs and imperfect CSI not only OTSM outperforms OFDM by 29% in terms of energy of bit per noise but it performs same as OTFS in high mobility DSCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Different from \emph{data-oriented} communication systems primarily focusing on how to accurately transmit every bit of data, \emph{task-oriented} semantic communication systems \iffalse, which are capturing widespread research attention recently,\fi only transmit the specific semantic information required by downstream tasks, striving to minimize the communication overhead and maintain competitive tasks execution performance in the presence of channel noise. However, it is worth noting that in many scenarios, the transmitted semantic information needs to be dynamically modified according to the users' preferences and few existing works take this into consideration. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel cross-modal editable semantic communication system, named \emph{Editable-DeepSC}, to tackle this challenge. By utilizing inversion methods based on StyleGAN priors, \emph{Editable-DeepSC} takes cross-modal text-image pairs as inputs and transmits the edited information of images based on textual instructions. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that our proposed \emph{Editable-DeepSC} can achieve remarkable editing effects under the perturbations of channel noise, outperforming existing \emph{data-oriented} communication methods.</description>

      <title>PAC Learnability for Reliable Communication over Discrete Memoryless Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In practical communication systems, knowledge of channel models is often absent, and consequently, transceivers need be designed based on empirical data. In this work, we study data-driven approaches to reliably choosing decoding metrics and code rates that facilitate reliable communication over unknown discrete memoryless channels (DMCs). Our analysis is inspired by the PAC (probably approximately correct) learning theory and does not rely on any assumptions on the statistical characteristics of DMCs. We show that a naive plug-in algorithm for choosing decoding metrics is likely to fail for finite training sets. We propose an alternative algorithm called the virtual sample algorithm and establish a non-asymptotic lower bound on its performance. The virtual sample algorithm is then used as a building block for constructing a learning algorithm that chooses a decoding metric and a code rate using which a transmitter and a receiver can reliably communicate at a rate arbitrarily close to the channel mutual information. Therefore, we conclude that DMCs are PAC learnable.</description>

      <title>Holographic Phase Retrieval via Wirtinger Flow: Cartesian Form with Auxiliary Amplitude</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new gradient method for holography, where a phase-only hologram is parameterized by not only the phase but also amplitude. The key idea of our approach is the formulation of a phase-only hologram using an auxiliary amplitude. We optimize the parameters using the so-called Wirtinger flow algorithm in the Cartesian domain, which is a gradient method defined on the basis of the Wirtinger calculus. At the early stage of optimization, each element of the hologram exists inside a complex circle, and it can take a large gradient while diverging from the origin. This characteristic contributes to accelerating the gradient descent. Meanwhile, at the final stage of optimization, each element evolves along a complex circle, similar to previous state-of-the-art gradient methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods, primarily due to the optimization of the amplitude.</description>

      <title>Towards a Theory of Pragmatic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard information theory says nothing about how much meaning is conveyed by the information. We fill this gap with a rigorously justifiable, quantitative definition of ``pragmatic information'' as the amount of meaning in a message that is relevant to a particular decision (as opposed to the {\it value} that the decision maker places on that message). We posit that such a message updates a ``state of the world'' random variable, $\omega$, that informs the decision. The pragmatic information of a single message is then defined as the Kulbach-Leibler divergence between the {\it a priori} and updated probability distributions of $\omega$; the pragmatic information of a message ensemble is defined as the expected value of the pragmatic information values of the ensemble's component messages. We then show, first, that the pragmatic information of a single message is the expected difference between the shortest binary encoding of $\omega$ under the {\it a priori} and updated distributions, and, second, that the average of the pragmatic values of individual messages, when sampled a large number of times from the ensemble, approaches its expected value.
  Pragmatic information thus defined has many hoped-for properties, such as non-negativity and additivity for independent decisions and ``pragmatically independent'' messages. We also sketch three applications: The first is the single play of a slot machine, a.k.a. ``one armed bandit'', with an unknown payout probability; the second being a characterization of the rate of biological evolution in a simple model of reproduction with mutation (the so-called ``quasi-species'' model); the third being a reformulation of the efficient market hypothesis of financial economics. We conclude by noting the importance of the computational capacity of the receiver in processing pragmatic information.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the cumulative past information generating function (CPIG) and relative cumulative past information generating function (RCPIG). We study its properties. We establish its relation with generalized cumulative past entropy (GCPE). We defined CPIG stochastic order and its relation with dispersive order. We provide the results for the CPIG measure of the convoluted random variables in terms of the measures of its components. We found some inequality relating to Shannon entropy, CPIG and GCPE. Some characterization and estimation results are also discussed regarding CPIG. We defined divergence measures between two random variables, Jensen-cumulative past information generating function(JCPIG), Jensen fractional cumulative past entropy measure, cumulative past Taneja entropy, and Jensen cumulative past Taneja entropy information measure.</description>

Abstract: In Pliable Private Information Retrieval (PPIR) with a single server, messages are partitioned into $\Gamma$ non-overlapping classes. The user wants to retrieve a message from its desired class without revealing the identity of the desired class to the server. In S. A. Obead, H. Y. Lin and E. Rosnes, Single-Server Pliable Private Information Retrieval With Side Information, arXiv:2305.06857, authors consider the problem of PPIR with Side Information (PPIR-SI), where the user now has side information. The user wants to retrieve any new message (not included in the side information) from its desired class without revealing the identity of the desired class and its side information. A scheme for the PPIR-SI is given by Obead et al. for the case when the users side information is unidentified, and this case is referred to as PPIR with Unidentifiable SI (PPIR-USI). In this paper, we study the problem of PPIR for the single server case when the side information is partially identifiable, and we term this case as PPIR with Identifiable Side Information (PPIR-ISI). The user is well aware of the identity of the side information belonging to $\eta$ number of classes, where $1\leq \eta \leq \Gamma$. In this problem, The user wants to retrieve a message from its desired class without revealing the identity of the desired class to the server. We give a scheme for PPIR-ISI, and we prove that having identifiable side information is advantageous by comparing the rate of the proposed scheme to the rate of the PPIR-USI scheme given by Obead et al. for some cases. Further, we extend the problem of PPIR-ISI for multi-user case, where users can collaborately generate the query sets, and we give a scheme for this problem.</description>

      <title>Smooth Actual EIRP Control for EMF Compliance with Minimum Traffic Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To mitigate Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) human exposure from base stations, international standards bodies define EMF emission requirements that can be translated into limits on the "actual" Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP), i.e., averaged over a sliding time window. We aim to enable base stations to adhere to these constraints while mitigating any impact on user performance. Specifically, our objectives are to: i) ensure compliance with actual EIRP control methods defined in IEC 62232:2022, ii) guarantee a minimum EIRP level, and iii) prevent resource shortages at all times. Initially, we present exact and conservative algorithms to compute the set of feasible EIRP consumption values that fulfill constraints i) and ii) at any given time, referred to as the actual EIRP "budget". Subsequently, we design a control method based on Drift-Plus-Penalty theory that preemptively curbs EIRP consumption only when needed to avoid future resource shortages.</description>

      <title>How to Evaluate Semantic Communications for Images with ViTScore Metric?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic communications (SC) have been expected to be a new paradigm shifting to catalyze the next generation communication, whose main concerns shift from accurate bit transmission to effective semantic information exchange in communications. However, the previous and widely-used metrics for images are not applicable to evaluate the image semantic similarity in SC. Classical metrics to measure the similarity between two images usually rely on the pixel level or the structural level, such as the PSNR and the MS-SSIM. Straightforwardly using some tailored metrics based on deep-learning methods in CV community, such as the LPIPS, is infeasible for SC. To tackle this, inspired by BERTScore in NLP community, we propose a novel metric for evaluating image semantic similarity, named Vision Transformer Score (ViTScore). We prove theoretically that ViTScore has 3 important properties, including symmetry, boundedness, and normalization, which make ViTScore convenient and intuitive for image measurement. To evaluate the performance of ViTScore, we compare ViTScore with 3 typical metrics (PSNR, MS-SSIM, and LPIPS) through 4 classes of experiments: (i) correlation with BERTScore through evaluation of image caption downstream CV task, (ii) evaluation in classical image communications, (iii) evaluation in image semantic communication systems, and (iv) evaluation in image semantic communication systems with semantic attack. Experimental results demonstrate that ViTScore is robust and efficient in evaluating the semantic similarity of images. Particularly, ViTScore outperforms the other 3 typical metrics in evaluating the image semantic changes by semantic attack, such as image inverse with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This indicates that ViTScore is an effective performance metric when deployed in SC scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimal, and approximately optimal, quantum strategies for $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$ and $\mathrm{FFL}$ games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze optimal, and approximately optimal, quantum strategies for a variety of non-local XOR games. Building upon previous arguments due to Ostrev in 2016, which characterized approximately optimal, and optimal, strategies that players Alice and Bob can adopt for maximizing a linear functional to win non-local games after a Referee party examines each answer to a question drawn from some probability distribution, we identify additional applications of the framework for analyzing the performance of a broader class of quantum strategies in which it is possible for Alice and Bob to realize quantum advantage if the two players adopt strategies relying upon quantum entanglement, two-dimensional resource systems, and reversible transformations. For the Fortnow-Feige-Lovasz (FFL) game, the 2016 framework is directly applicable, which consists of five steps, including: (1) constructing a suitable, nonzero, linear transformation for the intertwining operations, (2) demonstrating that the operator has unit Frobenius norm, (3) constructing error bounds, and corresponding approximate operations, for $\big( A_k \otimes \textbf{I} \big) \ket{\psi}$, and $\big( \textbf{I} \otimes \big( \frac{\pm B_{kl} + B_{lk}}{\sqrt{2}} \big) \big) \ket{\psi}$, (4) constructing additional bounds for permuting the order in which $A^{j_i}_i$ operators are applied, (5) obtaining Frobenius norm upper bounds for Alice and Bob's strategies. We draw the attention of the reader to applications of this framework in other games with less regular structure.</description>

      <title>Random Walk in Random Permutation Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random walk is an explainable approach for modeling natural processes at the molecular level. The Random Permutation Set Theory (RPST) serves as a framework for uncertainty reasoning, extending the applicability of Dempster-Shafer Theory. Recent explorations indicate a promising link between RPST and random walk. In this study, we conduct an analysis and construct a random walk model based on the properties of RPST, with Monte Carlo simulations of such random walk. Our findings reveal that the random walk generated through RPST exhibits characteristics similar to those of a Gaussian random walk and can be transformed into a Wiener process through a specific limiting scaling procedure. This investigation establishes a novel connection between RPST and random walk theory, thereby not only expanding the applicability of RPST, but also demonstrating the potential for combining the strengths of both approaches to improve problem-solving abilities.</description>
