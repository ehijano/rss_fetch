      <title>OTFS-ISAC System with Sub-Nyquist ADC Sampling Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a pivotal technology for next-generation wireless communication and radar systems, enabling high-resolution sensing and high-throughput communication with shared spectrum and hardware. However, achieving a fine radar resolution often requires high-rate analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and substantial storage, making it both expensive and impractical for many commercial applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)-based ISAC architecture that operates at reduced ADC sampling rates, yet preserves accurate radar estimation and supports simultaneous communication. The proposed architecture introduces pilot symbols directly in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain to leverage the transformation mapping between the DD and time-frequency (TF) domains to keep selected subcarriers active while others are inactive, allowing the radar receiver to exploit under-sampling aliasing and recover the original DD signal at much lower sampling rates. To further enhance the radar accuracy, we develop an iterative interference estimation and cancellation algorithm that mitigates data symbol interference. We propose a code-based spreading technique that distributes data across the DD domain to preserve the maximum unambiguous radar sensing range. For communication, we implement a complete transceiver pipeline optimized for reduced sampling rate system, including synchronization, channel estimation, and iterative data detection. Experimental results from a software-defined radio (SDR)-based testbed confirm that our method substantially lowers the required sampling rate without sacrificing radar sensing performance and ensures reliable communication.</description>

      <title>Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing: Extending OFDM for Scenario-Flexibility and Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks are conceived to provide reliable and high-data-rate communication services for diverse scenarios, such as vehicle-to-vehicle, unmanned aerial vehicles, and satellite networks. The severe Doppler spreads in the underlying time-varying channels induce destructive inter-carrier interference (ICI) in the extensively adopted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform, leading to severe performance degradation. This calls for a new air interface design that can accommodate the severe delay-Doppler spreads in highly dynamic channels while possessing sufficient flexibility to cater to various applications. This article provides a comprehensive overview of a promising chirp-based waveform named affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). It is featured with two tunable parameters and achieves optimal diversity order in doubly dispersive channels (DDC). We study the fundamental principle of AFDM, illustrating its intrinsic suitability for DDC. Based on that, several potential applications of AFDM are explored. Furthermore, the major challenges and the corresponding solutions of AFDM are presented, followed by several future research directions. Finally, we draw some instructive conclusions about AFDM, hoping to provide useful inspiration for its development.</description>

      <title>DULRTC-RME: A Deep Unrolled Low-rank Tensor Completion Network for Radio Map Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio maps enrich radio propagation and spectrum occupancy information, which provides fundamental support for the operation and optimization of wireless communication systems. Traditional radio maps are mainly achieved by extensive manual channel measurements, which is time-consuming and inefficient. To reduce the complexity of channel measurements, radio map estimation (RME) through novel artificial intelligence techniques has emerged to attain higher resolution radio maps from sparse measurements or few observations. However, black box problems and strong dependency on training data make learning-based methods less explainable, while model-based methods offer strong theoretical grounding but perform inferior to the learning-based methods. In this paper, we develop a deep unrolled low-rank tensor completion network (DULRTC-RME) for radio map estimation, which integrates theoretical interpretability and learning ability by unrolling the tedious low-rank tensor completion optimization into a deep network. It is the first time that algorithm unrolling technology has been used in the RME field. Experimental results demonstrate that DULRTC-RME outperforms existing RME methods.</description>

      <title>The Wideband Analysis of the Impact of I/Q Imbalance on THz Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The terahertz (THz) band is a promising solution to the increasing data traffic demands of future wireless networks. However, developing transceivers for THz communication is a complex and toilsome task due to the difficulty in designing devices that operate at this frequency and the impact of hardware impairments on performance. This paper investigates the impact of radio frequency (RF) impairment, in-phase/quadrature imbalance (IQI). To this end, we express an IQI model for the THzspecific array-of-subarrays (AoSA) architecture considering the unique features of THz communication; vast bandwidth, severe power drawdown, and pencil-like beams. We further model the impact of IQI in the power limited regime in order to investigate the power and ultra-wideband trade-off. To achieve this, we express the spectral efficiency in terms of wideband slope and bit energy to noise ratio which are the two important information theoretic metrics that reveals the performance of the ultrawideband systems as in THz communication. Our results show that THz systems with IQI have a strict limit in achievable rate although they provide immense spectrum. We also demonstrate with our simulation results that compared to low frequencies, IQI is a more serious concern in THz links.</description>

      <title>UAV-Based Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Joint Placement and Power Optimization under Fronthaul Capacity Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) network, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multiple antennas serve as distributed UAV-access points (UAV-APs). These UAV-APs provide seamless coverage by jointly serving user equipments (UEs) with out predefined cell boundaries. However, high-capacity wireless networks face significant challenges due to fronthaul limitations in UAV-assisted architectures. This letter proposes a novel UAV-based cell-free mMIMO framework that leverages distributed UAV-APs to serve UEs while addressing the capacity constraints of wireless fronthaul links. We evaluate functional split Options 7.2 and 8 for the fronthaul links, aiming to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among the UEs and minimize the power consumption by optimizing the transmit powers of UAV-APs and selectively activating them. Our analysis compares sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave (mmWave) bands for the fronthaul, showing that mmWave achieves superior SINR with lower power consumption, particularly under Option 8. Additionally, we determine the minimum fronthaul bandwidth required to activate a single UAV-AP under different split options.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Integrated Sensing and Communication-Empowered UAVs in 6G: A Transceiver Design Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their high maneuverability, flexible deployment, and low cost, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to play a pivotal role in not only communication, but also sensing. Especially by exploiting the ultra-wide bandwidth of terahertz (THz) bands, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-empowered UAV has been a promising technology of 6G space-air-ground integrated networks. In this article, we systematically investigate the key techniques and essential obstacles for THz-ISAC-empowered UAV from a transceiver design perspective, with the highlight of its major challenges and key technologies. Specifically, we discuss the THz-ISAC-UAV wireless propagation environment, based on which several channel characteristics for communication and sensing are revealed. We point out the transceiver payload design peculiarities for THz-ISAC-UAV from the perspective of antenna design, radio frequency front-end, and baseband signal processing. To deal with the specificities faced by the payload, we shed light on three key technologies, i.e., hybrid beamforming for ultra-massive MIMO-ISAC, power-efficient THz-ISAC waveform design, as well as communication and sensing channel state information acquisition, and extensively elaborate their concepts and key issues. More importantly, future research directions and associated open problems are presented, which may unleash the full potential of THz-ISAC-UAV for 6G wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Explainable and externally validated machine learning for neuropsychiatric diagnosis via electrocardiograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has emerged as a promising tool for identifying physiological changes associated with neuropsychiatric conditions. The relationship between cardiovascular health and neuropsychiatric disorders suggests that ECG abnormalities could serve as valuable biomarkers for more efficient detection, therapy monitoring, and risk stratification. However, the potential of the ECG to accurately distinguish neuropsychiatric conditions, particularly among diverse patient populations, remains underexplored. This study utilized ECG markers and basic demographic data to predict neuropsychiatric conditions using machine learning models, with targets defined through ICD-10 codes. Both internal and external validation were performed using the MIMIC-IV and ECG-View datasets respectively. Performance was assessed using AUROC scores. To enhance model interpretability, Shapley values were applied to provide insights into the contributions of individual ECG features to the predictions. Significant predictive performance was observed for conditions within the neurological and psychiatric groups. For the neurological group, Alzheimer's disease (G30) achieved an internal AUROC of 0.813 (0.812-0.814) and an external AUROC of 0.868 (0.867-0.868). In the psychiatric group, unspecified dementia (F03) showed an internal AUROC of 0.849 (0.848-0.849) and an external AUROC of 0.862 (0.861-0.863). Discriminative features align with known ECG markers but also provide hints on potentially new markers. ECG offers significant promise for diagnosing and monitoring neuropsychiatric conditions, with robust predictive performance across internal and external cohorts. Future work should focus on addressing potential confounders, such as therapy-related cardiotoxicity, and expanding the scope of ECG applications, including personalized care and early intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>Towards Smarter Sensing: 2D Clutter Mitigation in RL-Driven Cognitive MIMO Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in integrated sensing and communication for 6th generation (6G) networks, this paper presents a cognitive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar system enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL) for robust multitarget detection in dynamic environments. The system employs a planar array configuration and adapts its transmitted waveforms and beamforming patterns to optimize detection performance in the presence of unknown two-dimensional (2D) disturbances. A robust Wald-type detector is integrated with a SARSA-based RL algorithm, enabling the radar to learn and adapt to complex clutter environments modeled by a 2D autoregressive process. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in detection probability compared to omnidirectional methods, particularly for low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) targets masked by clutter.</description>

      <title>Impact of Model Mismatch on DOA Estimation with MUSIC: Near-Field and Far-Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been substantial work on developing variants of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithms that take advantage of the information present in the near-field propagation regime. However, it is not always easy to determine the correct propagation regime, which opens the possibility of incorrectly applying simpler algorithms (meant for far-field) in the near-field regime. Inspired by this, we use simulation results to investigate the performance drop when there is a mismatch between the signal model in the MUSIC algorithm and the propagation regime. For direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, we consider the cases when the receiver is in the near-field region but uses i) the near-field model, ii) the approximate near-field model (ANM) model, and iii) the far-field model to design the beamforming matrix in the MUSIC algorithm. We also consider the case when the receiver is in the far-field region, and we use the correct far-field model to design the beamforming matrix in the MUSIC algorithm. One contribution is that in the near-field, we have quantified the loss in performance when the ANM and the far-field model are used to create the beamforming matrix for the MUSIC algorithm, causing a reduction in estimation accuracy compared to the case when the correct near-field model is used to design the beamforming matrix. Another result is that in the near-field, when we incorrectly assume that the receiver is in the far-field and subsequently use the far-field beamforming matrix, we underestimate the DOA estimation error. Finally, we show that the MUSIC algorithm can provide very accurate range estimates for distances less than the Fraunhofer distance. This estimate gradually becomes inaccurate as the distances exceed the Fraunhofer distance.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Throughput GRAND with FIFO Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) is a code-agnostic decoding method that iteratively guesses the noise pattern affecting the received codeword. The number of noise sequences to test depends on the noise realization. Thus, GRAND exhibits random runtime which results in nondeterministic throughput. However, real-time systems must process the incoming data at a fixed rate, necessitating a fixed-throughput decoder in order to avoid losing data. We propose a first-in first-out (FIFO) scheduling architecture that enables a fixed throughput while improving the block error rate (BLER) compared to the common approach of imposing a maximum runtime constraint per received codeword. Moreover, we demonstrate that the average throughput metric of GRAND-based hardware implementations typically provided in the literature can be misleading as one needs to operate at approximately one order of magnitude lower throughput to achieve the BLER of an unconstrained decoder.</description>

      <title>Uplink Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Mobile Edge Computing with Short-Packet Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) scheme is proposed to assist a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system where local computation tasks from two users are offloaded to the MEC server, facilitated by uplink RSMA for processing. The efficiency of the MEC service is hence primarily influenced by the RSMA-aided task offloading phase and the subsequent task computation phase, where reliable and low-latency communication is required. For this practical consideration, short-packet communication in the Finite Blocklength (FBL) regime is introduced. In this context, we propose a novel uplink RSMA-aided MEC framework and derive the overall Successful Computation Probability (SCP) with FBL consideration. To maximize the SCP of our proposed RSMA-aided MEC, we strategically optimize: (1) the task offloading factor which determines the number of tasks to be offloaded and processed by the MEC server; (2) the transmit power allocation between different RSMA streams; and (3) the task-splitting factor which decides how many tasks are allocated to splitting streams, while adhering to FBL constraints. To address the strong coupling between these variables in the SCP expression, we apply the Alternative Optimization method, which formulates tractable subproblems to optimize each variable iteratively. The resultant non-convex subproblems are then tackled by Successive Convex Approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that applying uplink RSMA in the MEC system with FBL constraints can not only improve the SCP performance but also provide lower latency in comparison to conventional transmission scheme such as Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA).</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Models for Physical Layer Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increased availability of data and computing resources has enabled researchers to successfully adopt machine learning (ML) techniques and make significant contributions in several engineering areas. ML and in particular deep learning (DL) algorithms have shown to perform better in tasks where a physical bottom-up description of the phenomenon is lacking and/or is mathematically intractable. Indeed, they take advantage of the observations of natural phenomena to automatically acquire knowledge and learn internal relations. Despite the historical model-based mindset, communications engineering recently started shifting the focus towards top-down data-driven learning models, especially in domains such as channel modeling and physical layer design, where in most of the cases no general optimal strategies are known.
  In this thesis, we aim at solving some fundamental open challenges in physical layer communications exploiting new DL paradigms. In particular, we mathematically formulate, under ML terms, classic problems such as channel capacity and optimal coding-decoding schemes, for any arbitrary communication medium. We design and develop the architecture, algorithm and code necessary to train the equivalent DL model, and finally, we propose novel solutions to long-standing problems in the field.</description>

      <title>Stability and performance guarantees for misspecified multivariate score-driven filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of tracking latent time-varying parameter vectors under model misspecification. We analyze implicit and explicit score-driven (ISD and ESD) filters, which update a prediction of the parameters using the gradient of the logarithmic observation density (i.e., the score). In the ESD filter, the score is computed using the predicted parameter values, whereas in the ISD filter, the score is evaluated using the new, updated parameter values. For both filter types, we derive novel sufficient conditions for the exponential stability (i.e., invertibility) of the filtered parameter path and existence of a finite mean squared error (MSE) bound with respect to the pseudo-true parameter path. In addition, we present expressions for finite-sample and asymptotic MSE bounds. Our performance guarantees rely on mild moment conditions on the data-generating process, while our stability result is entirely agnostic about the true process. As a result, our primary conditions depend only on the characteristics of the filter; hence, they are verifiable in practice. Concavity of the postulated log density combined with simple parameter restrictions is sufficient (but not necessary) for ISD-filter stability, whereas ESD-filter stability additionally requires the score to be Lipschitz continuous. Extensive simulation studies validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the enhanced stability and improved performance of ISD over ESD filters. An empirical application to U.S. Treasury-bill rates confirms the practical relevance of our contribution.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate joint unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation and resource allocation optimization for communication-assisted three-dimensional (3D) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensing. We consider a system consisting of two UAVs that perform bistatic interferometric SAR (InSAR) sensing for generation of a digital elevation model (DEM) and transmit the radar raw data to a ground station (GS) in real time. To account for practical 3D sensing requirements, we use non-conventional sensing performance metrics, such as the SAR interferometric coherence, i.e., the local cross-correlation between the two co-registered UAV SAR images, the point-to-point InSAR relative height error, and the height of ambiguity, which together characterize the accuracy with which the InSAR system can determine the height of ground targets. Our objective is to jointly optimize the UAV formation, speed, and communication power allocation for maximization of the InSAR coverage while satisfying energy, communication, and InSAR-specific sensing constraints. To solve the formulated non-smooth and non-convex optimization problem, we divide it into three sub-problems and propose a novel alternating optimization (AO) framework that is based on classical, monotonic, and stochastic optimization techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through extensive simulations and compared to several benchmark schemes. Furthermore, our simulation results highlight the impact of the UAV-GS communication link on the flying formation and sensing performance and show that the DEM of a large area of interest can be mapped and offloaded to ground successfully, while the ground topography can be estimated with centimeter-scale precision. Lastly, we demonstrate that a low UAV velocity is preferable for InSAR applications as it leads to better sensing accuracy.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom of Holographic MIMO in Multi-user Near-field Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) is an emerging technology for 6G communications, in which numerous antenna units are integrated in a limited space. As the HMIMO array aperture expands, the near-field region of the array is dramatically enlarged, resulting in more users being located in the near-field region. This creates new opportunities for wireless communications. In this context, the evaluation of the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) of HMIMO multi-user systems in near-field channels is an open problem, as the analytical methods utilized for evaluating the DoF in far-field channels cannnot be directly applied. In this paper, we propose a novel method to calculate the DoF of HMIMO in multi-user near-field channels. We first derive the DoF for a single user in the near field, and then extend the analysis to multi-user scenarios. In this latter scenario, we focus on the impact of spatial blocking between HMIMO users. The derived analytical framework reveals that the DoF of HMIMO in multi-user near-field channels is not in general given by the sum of the DoF of the HMIMO single-user setting because of spatial blocking. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In the considered setup, the DoF may be reduced by 6.7 dB on average due to spatial blocking.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Transform on Graphs: Let There Be Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past years, many signal processing operations have been successfully adapted to the graph setting. One elegant and effective approach is to exploit the eigendecomposition of a graph shift operator (GSO), such as the adjacency or Laplacian operator, to define a graph Fourier transform when projecting graph signals on the corresponding basis. However, the extension of this scheme to directed graphs is challenging since the associated GSO is non-symmetric and, in general, not diagonalizable. Here, we build upon a recent framework that adds a minimal number of edges to allow diagonalization of the GSO and thus provide a proper graph Fourier transform. Furthermore, we show that such minimal addition of edges creates a cycle cover and that it is essential for the phase analysis of a signal throughout the graph. Concurrently, we propose a generalization of the Hilbert transform interpreted over the newfound cycle cover, which re-establishes intuitions from traditional Hilbert Transform, equivalent to the generalized Hilbert Transform on a single cycle. This generalization leads to a number of simple and elegant recipes to effectively exploit the phase information of graph signals provided by the graph Fourier transform. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated on several examples.</description>

      <title>LLM4WM: Adapting LLM for Wireless Multi-Tasking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The wireless channel is fundamental to communication, encompassing numerous tasks collectively referred to as channel-associated tasks. These tasks can leverage joint learning based on channel characteristics to share representations and enhance system design. To capitalize on this advantage, LLM4WM is proposed--a large language model (LLM) multi-task fine-tuning framework specifically tailored for channel-associated tasks. This framework utilizes a Mixture of Experts with Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) approach for multi-task fine-tuning, enabling the transfer of the pre-trained LLM's general knowledge to these tasks. Given the unique characteristics of wireless channel data, preprocessing modules, adapter modules, and multi-task output layers are designed to align the channel data with the LLM's semantic feature space. Experiments on a channel-associated multi-task dataset demonstrate that LLM4WM outperforms existing methodologies in both full-sample and few-shot evaluations, owing to its robust multi-task joint modeling and transfer learning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Crystal Oscillators in OSNMA-Enabled Receivers: An Implementation View for Automotive Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To ensure the authenticity of navigation data, Galileo Open Service navigation message authentication (OSNMA) requires loose synchronization between the receiver clock and the system time. This means that during the period between clock calibrations, the receiver clock error needs to be smaller than a pre-defined threshold, currently up to 165s for OSNMA. On the other hand, relying on the PVT solution to steer the receiver clock or correct its bias may not be possible since this would depend on the very same signals we intend to authenticate. This work aims to investigate the causes of the frequency accuracy loss leading to clock errors and to build a model that, from the datasheet of a real-time clock (RTC) device, allows to bound the error clock during a certain period. The model's main contributors are temperature changes, long-term aging, and offset at calibration, but it includes other factors. We then apply the model to several RTCs from different manufacturers and bound the maximum error for certain periods, with a focus on the two-year between-calibration period expected for the smart tachograph, an automotive application that will integrate OSNMA.</description>

      <title>A Hodge-FAST Framework for High-Resolution Dynamic Functional Connectivity Analysis of Higher Order Interactions in EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Hodge decomposition with Filtered Average Short-Term (FAST) functional connectivity to analyze dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) in EEG signals. This method leverages graph-based topology and simplicial analysis to explore transient connectivity patterns at multiple scales, addressing noise, sparsity, and computational efficiency. The temporal EEG data are first sparsified by keeping only the most globally important connections, instantaneous connectivity at these connections is then filtered by global long-term stable correlations. This tensor is then decomposed into three orthogonal components to study signal flows over higher-order structures such as triangle and loop structures. Our analysis of Alzheimer-related MCI patients show significant temporal differences related to higher-order interactions that a pairwise analysis on its own does not implicate. This allows us for the first time to capture higher-dimensional interactions at high temporal resolution in noisy EEG signal recordings.</description>

      <title>Optimal No-Fly Zone Design for the Coexistence of Drone and Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constructing a no-fly zone (NFZ) is a straightforward and effective way to facilitate the coexistence of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) and existing systems (typically satellite systems). However, there has been little work on understanding the optimal design of such NFZs. In the absence of this design, one invariably ends up overestimating this region, hence significantly limiting the allowed airspace for the drones. To optimize the volume of the NFZ, we formulate this task as a variational problem and utilize the calculus of variations to rigorously obtain the NFZ as a function of the antenna pattern of victim receivers and the spatial distribution of drones. This approach parallels the matched filter design in the sense that the NFZ extends in directions where the antenna gain and/or the density of drones is high. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimal design compared to the known baselines in reducing the volume of the NFZ without compromising the protective performance.</description>

      <title>Decoding Human Attentive States from Spatial-temporal EEG Patches Using Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning the spatial topology of electroencephalogram (EEG) channels and their temporal dynamics is crucial for decoding attention states. This paper introduces EEG-PatchFormer, a transformer-based deep learning framework designed specifically for EEG attention classification in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. By integrating a Temporal CNN for frequency-based EEG feature extraction, a pointwise CNN for feature enhancement, and Spatial and Temporal Patching modules for organizing features into spatial-temporal patches, EEG-PatchFormer jointly learns spatial-temporal information from EEG data. Leveraging the global learning capabilities of the self-attention mechanism, it captures essential features across brain regions over time, thereby enhancing EEG data decoding performance. Demonstrating superior performance, EEG-PatchFormer surpasses existing benchmarks in accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and macro-F1 score on a public cognitive attention dataset.

Abstract: Non-destructive testing is an important technique for detecting defects in multi-layer materials, enabling the evaluation of structural integrity without causing damage on test materials. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) offers unique capabilities for this purpose due to its sensitivity and resolution. Inspired by room geometry estimation methods in acoustic signal processing, this work proposes a novel approach for defect detection in multi-layer composite materials using THz-TDS, enhanced by high-power sources. The proposed method utilizes Euclidean distance matrices to reduce problem complexity compared to state-of-the-art approaches, and effectively distinguishes and maps higher-order reflections from sublayers, enabling precise defect localization in composite materials without artifacts.</description>

Abstract: Probability density estimation from observed data constitutes a central task in statistics. Recent advancements in machine learning offer new tools but also pose new challenges. The big data era demands analysis of long-range spatial and long-term temporal dependencies in large collections of raw data, rendering neural networks an attractive solution for density estimation. In this paper, we exploit the concept of copula to explicitly build an estimate of the probability density function associated to any observed data. In particular, we separate univariate marginal distributions from the joint dependence structure in the data, the copula itself, and we model the latter with a neural network-based method referred to as copula density neural estimation (CODINE). Results show that the novel learning approach is capable of modeling complex distributions and it can be applied for mutual information estimation and data generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space-division multiple access (SDMA) plays an important role in modern wireless communications. Its performance depends on the channel properties, which can be improved by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In this work, we jointly optimize SDMA precoding at the base station (BS) and RIS configuration. We tackle difficulties of mutual coupling between RIS elements, scalability to more than 1000 RIS elements, and high requirement for channel estimation. We first derive an RIS-assisted channel model considering mutual coupling, then propose an unsupervised machine learning (ML) approach to optimize the RIS with a dedicated neural network (NN) architecture RISnet, which has good scalability, desired permutation-invariance, and a low requirement for channel estimation. Moreover, we leverage existing high-performance analytical precoding scheme to propose a hybrid solution of ML-enabled RIS configuration and analytical precoding at BS. More generally, this work is an early contribution to combine ML technique and domain knowledge in communication for NN architecture design. Compared to generic ML, the problem-specific ML can achieve higher performance, lower complexity and permutation-invariance.</description>

Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA) play a critical role in enabling the functionalities of next generation wireless communication systems. However, as the number of antennas increases, ELAA systems face significant bottlenecks, such as excessive interconnection costs and high computational complexity. Efficient distributed signal processing (SP) algorithms show great promise in overcoming these challenges. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of distributed SP algorithms for ELAA systems, tailored to address these bottlenecks. We start by presenting three representative forms of ELAA systems: single-base station ELAA systems, coordinated distributed antenna systems, and ELAA systems integrated with emerging technologies. For each form, we review the associated distributed SP algorithms in the literature. Additionally, we outline several important future research directions that are essential for improving the performance and practicality of ELAA systems.</description>

      <title>The inverse obstacle problem for nonlinear inclusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Monotonocity Principle states a monotonic relationship between a possibly non-linear material property and a proper corresponding boundary operator. The Monotonicity Principle (MP) has attracted great interest in the field of inverse problems, because of its fundamental role in developing real time imaging methods.
  Together with the introduction of a MP and a related imaging method to treat the inverse obstacle problem in the presence of nonlinear anomalies, arose a set of fundamental questions regarding the performances of the method in the presence of noise.
  The main contribution of this work is focused on theoretical aspects and consists in proving that (i) the imaging method is stable and robust with respect to the noise, (ii) the reconstruction approaches monotonically to a well-defined limit, as the noise level approaches to zero, and that (iii) the limit contains the unknown set and is contained in the outer boundary of the unknown set.
  Results (i) and (ii) come directly from the Monotonicity Principle, while results (iii) requires to prove the so-called Converse of the Monotonicity Principle, a theoretical results of fundamental relevance to evaluate the ideal (noise-free) performances of the imaging method.
  The results are provided in a quite general setting for Calder\'on problem, and proved for three wide classes where the nonlinearity of the anomaly can be either bounded from infinity and zero, or bounded from zero only, or bounded by infinity only. These classes of constitutive relationships cover the wide majority of cases encountered in applications.
  To be concrete, the PDE considered in this study is the one that governs Electrical Resistance Tomography.</description>

Abstract: We present a new ensemble framework for boosting the performance of overparameterized unfolding networks solving the compressed sensing problem. We combine a state-of-the-art overparameterized unfolding network with a continuation technique, to warm-start a crucial quantity of the said network's architecture; we coin the resulting continued network C-DEC. Moreover, for training and evaluating C-DEC, we incorporate the log-cosh loss function, which enjoys both linear and quadratic behavior. Finally, we numerically assess C-DEC's performance on real-world images. Results showcase that the combination of continuation with the overparameterized unfolded architecture, trained and evaluated with the chosen loss function, yields smoother loss landscapes and improved reconstruction and generalization performance of C-DEC, consistently for all datasets.</description>
