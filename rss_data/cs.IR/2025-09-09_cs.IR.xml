      <title>Knowledge-Augmented Relation Learning for Complementary Recommendation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complementary recommendations play a crucial role in e-commerce by enhancing user experience through suggestions of compatible items. Accurate classification of complementary item relationships requires reliable labels, but their creation presents a dilemma. Behavior-based labels are widely used because they can be easily generated from interaction logs; however, they often contain significant noise and lack reliability. While function-based labels (FBLs) provide high-quality definitions of complementary relationships by carefully articulating them based on item functions, their reliance on costly manual annotation severely limits a model's ability to generalize to diverse items. To resolve this trade-off, we propose Knowledge-Augmented Relation Learning (KARL), a framework that strategically fuses active learning with large language models (LLMs). KARL efficiently expands a high-quality FBL dataset at a low cost by selectively sampling data points that the classifier finds the most difficult and uses the label extension of the LLM. Our experiments showed that in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, an unexplored item feature space, KARL improved the baseline accuracy by up to 37%. In contrast, in in-distribution (ID) settings, the learned item feature space, the improvement was less than 0.5%, with prolonged learning could degrade accuracy. These contrasting results are due to the data diversity driven by KARL's knowledge expansion, suggesting the need for a dynamic sampling strategy that adjusts diversity based on the prediction context (ID or OOD).</description>

      <title>LESER: Learning to Expand via Search Engine-feedback Reinforcement in e-Commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User queries in e-commerce search are often vague, short, and underspecified, making it difficult for retrieval systems to match them accurately against structured product catalogs. This challenge is amplified by the one-to-many nature of user intent, where a single query can imply diverse and competing needs. Existing methods, including neural query expansion and prompting-based LLM approaches, fall short in real-world settings: they struggle to capture nuanced user intent, often generate outputs that violate platform constraints, and rely on workflows that are difficult to scale in production. We propose Learning to Expand via Search Engine-feedback Reinforcement (LESER), a novel framework that fine-tunes a context-aware LLM using real-time search engine feedback as supervision. LESER formulates query expansion as a retrieval optimization task and leverages Group Relative Policy Optimization to learn directly from relevance and coverage metrics. LESER is trained to reason over search results and produce high quality query expansions that align with platform rules and retrieval objectives. We evaluate LESER on large-scale, real-world e-commerce datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in both offline and online settings. Our results show that LESER not only enhances semantic coverage and retrieval relevance but also delivers measurable gains in user engagement, making it a practical and scalable solution for modern search systems.</description>

      <title>Toward Efficient and Scalable Design of In-Memory Graph-Based Vector Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector data is prevalent across business and scientific applications, and its popularity is growing with the proliferation of learned embeddings. Vector data collections often reach billions of vectors with thousands of dimensions, thus, increasing the complexity of their analysis. Vector search is the backbone of many critical analytical tasks, and graph-based methods have become the best choice for analytical tasks that do not require guarantees on the quality of the answers. Although several paradigms (seed selection, incremental insertion, neighborhood propagation, neighborhood diversification, and divide-and-conquer) have been employed to design in-memory graph-based vector search algorithms, a systematic comparison of the key algorithmic advances is still missing. We conduct an exhaustive experimental evaluation of twelve state-of-the-art methods on seven real data collections, with sizes up to 1 billion vectors. We share key insights about the strengths and limitations of these methods; e.g., the best approaches are typically based on incremental insertion and neighborhood diversification, and the choice of the base graph can hurt scalability. Finally, we discuss open research directions, such as the importance of devising more sophisticated data adaptive seed selection and diversification strategies.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Real-World Recommender Systems: Challenges, Constraints, and Industrial Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems have generated tremendous value for both users and businesses, drawing significant attention from academia and industry alike. However, due to practical constraints, academic research remains largely confined to offline dataset optimizations, lacking access to real user data and large-scale recommendation platforms. This limitation reduces practical relevance, slows technological progress, and hampers a full understanding of the key challenges in recommender systems. In this survey, we provide a systematic review of industrial recommender systems and contrast them with their academic counterparts. We highlight key differences in data scale, real-time requirements, and evaluation methodologies, and we summarize major real-world recommendation scenarios along with their associated challenges. We then examine how industry practitioners address these challenges in Transaction-Oriented Recommender Systems and Content-Oriented Recommender Systems, a new classification grounded in item characteristics and recommendation objectives. Finally, we outline promising research directions, including the often-overlooked role of user decision-making, the integration of economic and psychological theories, and concrete suggestions for advancing academic research. Our goal is to enhance academia's understanding of practical recommender systems, bridge the growing development gap, and foster stronger collaboration between industry and academia.</description>

      <title>Modeling shopper interest broadness with entropy-driven dialogue policy in the context of arbitrarily large product catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational recommender systems promise rich interactions for e-commerce, but balancing exploration (clarifying user needs) and exploitation (making recommendations) remains challenging, especially when deploying large language models (LLMs) with vast product catalogs. We address this challenge by modeling the breadth of user interest via the entropy of retrieval score distributions. Our method uses a neural retriever to fetch relevant items for a user query and computes the entropy of the re-ranked scores to dynamically route the dialogue policy: low-entropy (specific) queries trigger direct recommendations, whereas high-entropy (ambiguous) queries prompt exploratory questions. This simple yet effective strategy allows an LLM-driven agent to remain aware of an arbitrarily large catalog in real-time without bloating its context window.</description>

      <title>Language Bias in Information Retrieval: The Nature of the Beast and Mitigation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language fairness in multilingual information retrieval (MLIR) systems is crucial for ensuring equitable access to information across diverse languages. This paper sheds light on the issue, based on the assumption that queries in different languages, but with identical semantics, should yield equivalent ranking lists when retrieving on the same multilingual documents. We evaluate the degree of fairness using both traditional retrieval methods, and a DPR neural ranker based on mBERT and XLM-R. Additionally, we introduce `LaKDA', a novel loss designed to mitigate language biases in neural MLIR approaches. Our analysis exposes intrinsic language biases in current MLIR technologies, with notable disparities across the retrieval methods, and the effectiveness of LaKDA in enhancing language fairness.</description>

      <title>AudioBoost: Increasing Audiobook Retrievability in Spotify Search with Synthetic Query Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spotify has recently introduced audiobooks as part of its catalog, complementing its music and podcast offering. Search is often the first entry point for users to access new items, and an important goal for Spotify is to support users in the exploration of the audiobook catalog. More specifically, we would like to enable users without a specific item in mind to broadly search by topic, genre, story tropes, decade, and discover audiobooks, authors and publishers they may like. To do this, we need to 1) inspire users to type more exploratory queries for audiobooks and 2) augment our retrieval systems to better deal with exploratory audiobook queries. This is challenging in a cold-start scenario, where we have a retrievabiliy bias due to the little amount of user interactions with audiobooks compared to previously available items such as music and podcast content. To address this, we propose AudioBoost, a system to boost audiobook retrievability in Spotify's Search via synthetic query generation. AudioBoost leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic queries conditioned on audiobook metadata. The synthetic queries are indexed both in the Query AutoComplete (QAC) and in the Search Retrieval engine to improve query formulation and retrieval at the same time. We show through offline evaluation that synthetic queries increase retrievability and are of high quality. Moreover, results from an online A/B test show that AudioBoost leads to a +0.7% in audiobook impressions, +1.22% in audiobook clicks, and +1.82% in audiobook exploratory query completions.</description>

      <title>Rethinking LLM Parametric Knowledge as Post-retrieval Confidence for Dynamic Retrieval and Reranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate responses (hallucinations) when faced with questions beyond their knowledge scope. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by leveraging external knowledge, but a critical challenge remains: determining whether retrieved contexts effectively enhance the model`s ability to answer specific queries. This challenge underscores the importance of knowledge boundary awareness, which current methods-relying on discrete labels or limited signals-fail to address adequately, as they overlook the rich information in LLMs` continuous internal hidden states. To tackle this, we propose a novel post-retrieval knowledge filtering approach. First, we construct a confidence detection model based on LLMs` internal hidden states to quantify how retrieved contexts enhance the model`s confidence. Using this model, we build a preference dataset (NQ_Rerank) to fine-tune a reranker, enabling it to prioritize contexts preferred by the downstream LLM during reranking. Additionally, we introduce Confidence-Based Dynamic Retrieval (CBDR), which adaptively triggers retrieval based on the LLM`s initial confidence in the original question, reducing knowledge conflicts and improving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy for context screening and end-to-end RAG performance, along with a notable reduction in retrieval costs while maintaining competitive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Reasoning-enhanced Query Understanding through Decomposition and Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate inference of user intent is crucial for enhancing document retrieval in modern search engines. While large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in this area, their effectiveness has predominantly been assessed with short, keyword-based queries. As AI-driven search evolves, long-form queries with intricate intents are becoming more prevalent, yet they remain underexplored in the context of LLM-based query understanding (QU). To bridge this gap, we introduce ReDI: a Reasoning-enhanced approach for query understanding through Decomposition and Interpretation. ReDI leverages the reasoning and comprehension capabilities of LLMs in a three-stage pipeline: (i) it breaks down complex queries into targeted sub-queries to accurately capture user intent; (ii) it enriches each sub-query with detailed semantic interpretations to improve the query-document matching; and (iii) it independently retrieves documents for each sub-query and employs a fusion strategy to aggregate the results for the final ranking. We compiled a large-scale dataset of real-world complex queries from a major search engine and distilled the query understanding capabilities of teacher models into smaller models for practical application. Experiments on BRIGHT and BEIR demonstrate that ReDI consistently surpasses strong baselines in both sparse and dense retrieval paradigms, affirming its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>UniSearch: Rethinking Search System with a Unified Generative Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern search systems play a crucial role in facilitating information acquisition. Traditional search engines typically rely on a cascaded architecture, where results are retrieved through recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages. The complexity of designing and maintaining multiple modules makes it difficult to achieve holistic performance gains. Recent advances in generative recommendation have motivated the exploration of unified generative search as an alternative. However, existing approaches are not genuinely end-to-end: they typically train an item encoder to tokenize candidates first and then optimize a generator separately, leading to objective inconsistency and limited generalization. To address these limitations, we propose UniSearch, a unified generative search framework for Kuaishou Search. UniSearch replaces the cascaded pipeline with an end-to-end architecture that integrates a Search Generator and a Video Encoder. The Generator produces semantic identifiers of relevant items given a user query, while the Video Encoder learns latent item embeddings and provides their tokenized representations. A unified training framework jointly optimizes both components, enabling mutual enhancement and improving representation quality and generation accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce Search Preference Optimization (SPO), which leverages a reward model and real user feedback to better align generation with user preferences. Extensive experiments on industrial-scale datasets, together with online A/B testing in both short-video and live search scenarios, demonstrate the strong effectiveness and deployment potential of UniSearch. Notably, its deployment in live search yields the largest single-experiment improvement in recent years of our product's history, highlighting its practical value for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Recommendations with Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spotify's Home page features a variety of content types, including music, podcasts, and audiobooks. However, historical data is heavily skewed toward music, making it challenging to deliver a balanced and personalized content mix. Moreover, users' preference towards different content types may vary depending on the time of day, the day of week, or even the device they use. We propose a calibration method that leverages contextual bandits to dynamically learn each user's optimal content type distribution based on their context and preferences. Unlike traditional calibration methods that rely on historical averages, our approach boosts engagement by adapting to how users interests in different content types varies across contexts. Both offline and online results demonstrate improved precision and user engagement with the Spotify Home page, in particular with under-represented content types such as podcasts.</description>

      <title>RED: Robust Event-Guided Motion Deblurring with Modality-Specific Disentangled Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Query Intent Detection via Relation-Aware Prompt Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intent detection is a crucial component of modern conversational systems, since accurately identifying user intent at the beginning of a conversation is essential for generating effective responses. Recent efforts have focused on studying this problem under a challenging few-shot scenario. These approaches primarily leverage large-scale unlabeled dialogue text corpora to pretrain language models through various pretext tasks, followed by fine-tuning for intent detection with very limited annotations. Despite the improvements achieved, existing methods have predominantly focused on textual data, neglecting to effectively capture the crucial structural information inherent in conversational systems, such as the query-query relation and query-answer relation. To address this gap, we propose SAID, a novel framework that integrates both textual and relational structure information in a unified manner for model pretraining for the first time. Building on this framework, we further propose a novel mechanism, the query-adaptive attention network (QueryAdapt), which operates at the relation token level by generating intent-specific relation tokens from well-learned query-query and query-answer relations explicitly, enabling more fine-grained knowledge transfer. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that SAID significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marine mammal vocalization analysis depends on interpreting bioacoustic spectrograms. Vision Language Models (VLMs) are not trained on these domain-specific visualizations. We investigate whether VLMs can extract meaningful patterns from spectrograms visually. Our framework integrates VLM interpretation with LLM-based validation to build domain knowledge. This enables adaptation to acoustic data without manual annotation or model retraining.</description>

      <title>Learning to Construct Knowledge through Sparse Reference Selection with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of scientific literature makes it increasingly difficult to acquire new knowledge, particularly in specialized domains where reasoning is complex, full-text access is restricted, and target references are sparse among a large set of candidates. We present a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for sparse reference selection that emulates human knowledge construction, prioritizing which papers to read under limited time and cost. Evaluated on drug--gene relation discovery with access restricted to titles and abstracts, our approach demonstrates that both humans and machines can construct knowledge effectively from partial information.</description>

      <title>DISTRIBUTEDANN: Efficient Scaling of a Single DISKANN Graph Across Thousands of Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present DISTRIBUTEDANN, a distributed vector search service that makes it possible to search over a single 50 billion vector graph index spread across over a thousand machines that offers 26ms median query latency and processes over 100,000 queries per second. This is 6x more efficient than existing partitioning and routing strategies that route the vector query to a subset of partitions in a scale out vector search system. DISTRIBUTEDANN is built using two well-understood components: a distributed key-value store and an in-memory ANN index. DISTRIBUTEDANN has replaced conventional scale-out architectures for serving the Bing search engine, and we share our experience from making this transition.</description>

      <title>Compare: A Framework for Scientific Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating the vast and rapidly increasing sea of academic publications to identify institutional synergies, benchmark research contributions and pinpoint key research contributions has become an increasingly daunting task, especially with the current exponential increase in new publications. Existing tools provide useful overviews or single-document insights, but none supports structured, qualitative comparisons across institutions or publications.
  To address this, we demonstrate Compare, a novel framework that tackles this challenge by enabling sophisticated long-context comparisons of scientific contributions. Compare empowers users to explore and analyze research overlaps and differences at both the institutional and publication granularity, all driven by user-defined questions and automatic retrieval over online resources. For this we leverage on Retrieval-Augmented Generation over evolving data sources to foster long context knowledge synthesis. Unlike traditional scientometric tools, Compare goes beyond quantitative indicators by providing qualitative, citation-supported comparisons.</description>

      <title>Tackling Device Data Distribution Real-time Shift via Prototype-based Parameter Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The on-device real-time data distribution shift on devices challenges the generalization of lightweight on-device models. This critical issue is often overlooked in current research, which predominantly relies on data-intensive and computationally expensive fine-tuning approaches. To tackle this, we introduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based, backpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model generalization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural adapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time device data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data distributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The prototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix, facilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer knowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter changes and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and recommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and generality.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Listener Structure Underlying K-pop's Global Success: A Large-Scale Listening Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the mid-2000s to the 2010s, K-pop moved beyond its status as a regionally popular genre in Asia and established itself as a global music genre with enthusiastic fans around the world. However, little is known about how the vast number of music listeners across the globe have listened to and perceived K-pop. This study addresses this question by analyzing a large-scale listening dataset from Last.fm. An analysis of the distribution of play counts reveals that K-pop experienced a significant increase in plays between 2005 and 2019, largely supported by a small group of heavy listeners. The Gini coefficient in play counts is notably greater than that of existing mainstream genres and other growing niche genres. Furthermore, an analysis based on user-assigned genre tags quantitatively demonstrates that between 2005 and 2010, K-pop shed its status as a local Asian genre and established itself as a distinct music genre in its own right.</description>

      <title>Domain-Aware RAG: MoL-Enhanced RL for Efficient Training and Scalable Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on the retrieval stage, particularly the coarse-ranking process. Existing coarse-ranking optimization approaches often struggle to balance domain-specific knowledge learning with query enhencement, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this challenge, we propose MoLER, a domain-aware RAG method that uses MoL-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning to optimize retrieval. MoLER has a two-stage pipeline: a continual pre-training (CPT) phase using a Mixture of Losses (MoL) to balance domain-specific knowledge with general language capabilities, and a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leveraging Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize query and passage generation for maximizing document recall. A key innovation is our Multi-query Single-passage Late Fusion (MSLF) strategy, which reduces computational overhead during RL training while maintaining scalable inference via Multi-query Multi-passage Late Fusion (MMLF). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MoLER achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline methods. MoLER bridges the knowledge gap in RAG systems, enabling robust and scalable retrieval in specialized domains.</description>

Abstract: We participate in CheckThat! Task 2 English and explore various methods of prompting and in-context learning, including few-shot prompting and fine-tuning with different LLM families, with the goal of extracting check-worthy claims from social media passages. Our best METEOR score is achieved by fine-tuning a FLAN-T5 model. However, we observe that higher-quality claims can sometimes be extracted using other methods, even when their METEOR scores are lower.</description>

      <title>mmBERT: A Modern Multilingual Encoder with Annealed Language Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encoder-only languages models are frequently used for a variety of standard machine learning tasks, including classification and retrieval. However, there has been a lack of recent research for encoder models, especially with respect to multilingual models. We introduce mmBERT, an encoder-only language model pretrained on 3T tokens of multilingual text in over 1800 languages. To build mmBERT we introduce several novel elements, including an inverse mask ratio schedule and an inverse temperature sampling ratio. We add over 1700 low-resource languages to the data mix only during the decay phase, showing that it boosts performance dramatically and maximizes the gains from the relatively small amount of training data. Despite only including these low-resource languages in the short decay phase we achieve similar classification performance to models like OpenAI's o3 and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. Overall, we show that mmBERT significantly outperforms the previous generation of models on classification and retrieval tasks -- on both high and low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Position Bias in Modern Information Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the position bias in information retrieval, where models tend to overemphasize content at the beginning of passages while neglecting semantically relevant information that appears later. To analyze the extent and impact of position bias, we introduce a new evaluation framework consisting of two position-aware retrieval benchmarks (SQuAD-PosQ, FineWeb-PosQ) and an intuitive diagnostic metric, the Position Sensitivity Index (PSI), for quantifying position bias from a worst-case perspective. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across the full retrieval pipeline, including BM25, dense embedding models, ColBERT-style late-interaction models, and full-interaction reranker models. Our experiments show that when relevant information appears later in the passage, dense embedding models and ColBERT-style models suffer significant performance degradation (an average drop of 15.6%). In contrast, BM25 and reranker models demonstrate greater robustness to such positional variation. These findings provide practical insights into model sensitivity to the position of relevant information and offer guidance for building more position-robust retrieval systems. Code and data are publicly available at: https://github.com/NovaSearch-Team/position-bias-in-IR.</description>

      <title>RecPS: Privacy Risk Scoring for Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18365v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems (RecSys) have become an essential component of many web applications. The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on highly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques are actively studied in the research community, the real-world model development still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled access. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \emph{not} to share highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the user to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus, quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to enabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a membership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS interaction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential privacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method. A critical component is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality membership estimation. We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning.</description>

      <title>FinAgentBench: A Benchmark Dataset for Agentic Retrieval in Financial Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain, where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of documents. Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&amp;P-100 listed firms and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance. We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance. Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance.</description>

      <title>PCR-CA: Parallel Codebook Representations with Contrastive Alignment for Multiple-Category App Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18166v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern app store recommender systems struggle with multiple-category apps, as traditional taxonomies fail to capture overlapping semantics, leading to suboptimal personalization. We propose PCR-CA (Parallel Codebook Representations with Contrastive Alignment), an end-to-end framework for improved CTR prediction. PCR-CA first extracts compact multimodal embeddings from app text, then introduces a Parallel Codebook VQ-AE module that learns discrete semantic representations across multiple codebooks in parallel -- unlike hierarchical residual quantization (RQ-VAE). This design enables independent encoding of diverse aspects (e.g., gameplay, art style), better modeling multiple-category semantics. To bridge semantic and collaborative signals, we employ a contrastive alignment loss at both the user and item levels, enhancing representation learning for long-tail items. Additionally, a dual-attention fusion mechanism combines ID-based and semantic features to capture user interests, especially for long-tail apps. Experiments on a large-scale dataset show PCR-CA achieves a +0.76% AUC improvement over strong baselines, with +2.15% AUC gains for long-tail apps. Online A/B testing further validates our approach, showing a +10.52% lift in CTR and a +16.30% improvement in CVR, demonstrating PCR-CA's effectiveness in real-world deployment. The new framework has now been fully deployed on the Microsoft Store.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attacks on LLM-based Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.</description>

      <title>Revealing Potential Biases in LLM-Based Recommender Systems in the Cold Start Setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for recommendation tasks due to their general-purpose capabilities. While LLMs perform well in rich-context settings, their behavior in cold-start scenarios, where only limited signals such as age, gender, or language are available, raises fairness concerns because they may rely on societal biases encoded during pretraining. We introduce a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate fairness in zero-context recommendation. Our modular pipeline supports configurable recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and flexible audits of any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases across recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and cultural stereotypes. We also reveal a non-linear relationship between model size and fairness, highlighting the need for nuanced analysis.</description>

      <title>ResearchArena: Benchmarking Large Language Models' Ability to Collect and Organize Information as Research Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across many natural language processing tasks but face challenges in domain-specific, analytical tasks such as conducting research surveys. This study introduces ResearchArena, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in conducting academic surveys -- a foundational step in academic research. ResearchArena models the process in three stages: (1) information discovery, identifying relevant literature; (2) information selection, evaluating papers' relevance and impact; and (3) information organization, structuring knowledge into hierarchical frameworks such as mind-maps. Notably, mind-map construction is treated as a bonus task, reflecting its supplementary role in survey-writing. To support these evaluations, we construct an offline environment of 12M full-text academic papers and 7.9K survey papers. To ensure ethical compliance, we do not redistribute copyrighted materials; instead, we provide code to construct the environment from the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus (S2ORC). Preliminary evaluations reveal that LLM-based approaches underperform compared to simpler keyword-based retrieval methods, though recent reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 show slightly better zero-shot performance. These results underscore significant opportunities for advancing LLMs in autonomous research. We open-source the code to construct the ResearchArena benchmark at https://github.com/cxcscmu/ResearchArena.</description>

      <title>Evidential Transformers for Improved Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Evidential Transformer, an uncertainty-driven transformer model for improved and robust image retrieval. In this paper, we make several contributions to content-based image retrieval (CBIR). We incorporate probabilistic methods into image retrieval, achieving robust and reliable results, with evidential classification surpassing traditional training based on multiclass classification as a baseline for deep metric learning. Furthermore, we improve the state-of-the-art retrieval results on several datasets by leveraging the Global Context Vision Transformer (GC ViT) architecture. Our experimental results consistently demonstrate the reliability of our approach, setting a new benchmark in CBIR in all test settings on the Stanford Online Products (SOP) and CUB-200-2011 datasets.</description>

      <title>Conversational Code Generation: a Case Study of Designing a Dialogue System for Generating Driving Scenarios for Testing Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems like autonomous vehicles are tested in simulation before deployment, using domain-specific programs for scenario specification. To aid the testing of autonomous vehicles in simulation, we design a natural language interface, using an instruction-following large language model, to assist a non-coding domain expert in synthesising the desired scenarios and vehicle behaviours. We show that using it to convert utterances to the symbolic program is feasible, despite the very small training dataset. Human experiments show that dialogue is critical to successful simulation generation, leading to a 4.5 times higher success rate than a generation without engaging in extended conversation.</description>

      <title>OmniThink: Expanding Knowledge Boundaries in Machine Writing through Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine writing with large language models often relies on retrieval-augmented generation. However, these approaches remain confined within the boundaries of the model's predefined scope, limiting the generation of content with rich information. Specifically, vanilla-retrieved information tends to lack depth, novelty, and suffers from redundancy, which negatively impacts the quality of generated articles, leading to shallow, unoriginal, and repetitive outputs. To address these issues, we propose OmniThink, a slow-thinking machine writing framework that emulates the human-like process of iterative expansion and reflection. The core idea behind OmniThink is to simulate the cognitive behavior of learners as they slowly deepen their knowledge of the topics. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniThink improves the knowledge density of generated articles without compromising metrics such as coherence and depth. Human evaluations and expert feedback further highlight the potential of OmniThink to address real-world challenges in the generation of long-form articles. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/OmniThink.</description>

      <title>InterFeat: A Pipeline for Finding Interesting Scientific Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding interesting phenomena is the core of scientific discovery, but it is a manual, ill-defined concept. We present an integrative pipeline for automating the discovery of interesting simple hypotheses (feature-target relations with effect direction and a potential underlying mechanism) in structured biomedical data. The pipeline combines machine learning, knowledge graphs, literature search and Large Language Models. We formalize "interestingness" as a combination of novelty, utility and plausibility. On 8 major diseases from the UK Biobank, our pipeline consistently recovers risk factors years before their appearance in the literature. 40--53% of our top candidates were validated as interesting, compared to 0--7% for a SHAP-based baseline. Overall, 28% of 109 candidates were interesting to medical experts. The pipeline addresses the challenge of operationalizing "interestingness" scalably and for any target. We release data and code: https://github.com/LinialLab/InterFeat</description>

      <title>Confounding is a Pervasive Problem in Real World Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine, ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.</description>
