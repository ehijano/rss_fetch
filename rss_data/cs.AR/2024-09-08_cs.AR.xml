      <title>A Hardware-Aware Gate Cutting Framework for Practical Quantum Circuit Knitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circuit knitting emerges as a promising technique to overcome the limitation of the few physical qubits in near-term quantum hardware by cutting large quantum circuits into smaller subcircuits. Recent research in this area has been primarily oriented towards reducing subcircuit sampling overhead. Unfortunately, these works neglect hardware information during circuit cutting, thus posing significant challenges to the follow on stages. In fact, direct compilation and execution of these partitioned subcircuits yields low-fidelity results, highlighting the need for a more holistic optimization strategy.
  In this work, we propose a hardware-aware framework aiming to advance the practicability of circuit knitting. Drawing a contrast with prior methodologies, the presented framework designs a cutting scheme that concurrently optimizes the number of gate cuttings and SWAP insertions during circuit cutting. In particular, we leverage the graph similarity between qubits interactions and chip layout as a heuristic guide to reduces potential SWAPs in the subsequent step of qubit routing. Building upon this, the circuit knitting framework we developed has been evaluated on several quantum algorithms, leading to reduction of total subcircuits depth by up to 64% (48% on average) compared to the state-of-the-art approach, and enhancing the relative fidelity up to 2.7$\times$.</description>

      <title>Potential and Limitation of High-Frequency Cores and Caches</title>

Abstract: This paper explores the potential of cryogenic semiconductor computing and superconductor electronics as promising alternatives to traditional semiconductor devices. As semiconductor devices face challenges such as increased leakage currents and reduced performance at higher temperatures, these novel technologies offer high performance and low power computation. Conventional semiconductor electronics operating at cryogenic temperatures (below -150{\deg}C or 123.15 K) can benefit from reduced leakage currents and improved electron mobility. On the other hand, superconductor electronics, operating below 10 K, allow electrons to flow without resistance, offering the potential for ultra-low-power, high-speed computation. This study presents a comprehensive performance modeling and analysis of these technologies and provides insights into their potential benefits and limitations. We implement models of in-order and out-of-order cores operating at high clock frequencies associated with superconductor electronics and cryogenic semiconductor computing in gem5. We evaluate the performance of these components using workloads representative of real-world applications like NPB, SPEC CPU2006, and GAPBS. Our results show the potential speedups achievable by these components and the limitations posed by cache bandwidth. This work provides valuable insights into the performance implications and design trade-offs associated with cryogenic and superconductor technologies, laying the foundation for future research in this field using gem5.</description>
