      <title>Extension operators and geometric decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric decomposition is a widely used tool for constructing local bases for finite element spaces. For finite element spaces of differential forms on simplicial meshes, Arnold, Falk, and Winther showed that geometric decompositions can be constructed from extension operators satisfying certain properties. In this paper, we generalize their results to function spaces and meshes satisfying very minimal hypotheses, while at the same time reducing the conditions that must hold for the extension operators. In particular, the geometry of the mesh and the mesh elements can be completely arbitrary, and the function spaces need only have well-defined restrictions to subelements. In this general context, we show that extension operators yield geometric decompositions for both the primal and dual function spaces. Later, we specialize to simplicial meshes, and we show that, to obtain geometric decompositions, one needs only to construct extension operators on the reference simplex in each dimension. In particular, for simplicial meshes, the existence of geometric decompositions depends only on the dimension of the mesh.</description>

      <title>Quantile-RK and Double Quantile-RK Error Horizon Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In solving linear systems of equations of the form $Ax=b$, corruptions present in $b$ affect stochastic iterative algorithms' ability to reach the true solution $x^\ast$ to the uncorrupted linear system. The randomized Kaczmarz method converges in expectation to $x^\ast$ up to an error horizon dependent on the conditioning of $A$ and the supremum norm of the corruption in $b$. To avoid this error horizon in the sparse corruption setting, previous works have proposed quantile-based adaptations that make iterative methods robust. Our work first establishes a new convergence rate for the quantile-based random Kaczmarz (qRK) and double quantile-based random Kaczmarz (dqRK) methods, which, under mild conditions, improves upon known bounds. We further consider the more practical setting in which the vector $b$ includes both non-sparse "noise" and sparse "corruption". Error horizon bounds for qRK and dqRK are derived and shown to produce a smaller error horizon compared to their non-quantile-based counterparts, further demonstrating the advantages of quantile-based methods.</description>

      <title>Mixed Precision Orthogonalization-Free Projection Methods for Eigenvalue and Singular Value Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-precision arithmetic offers significant computational advantages for large-scale matrix computation tasks, yet preserving accuracy and stability in eigenvalue problems and the singular value decomposition (SVD) remains challenging. This paper introduces an approach that eliminates orthogonalization requirements in traditional Rayleigh-Ritz projection methods. The proposed method employs non-orthogonal bases computed at reduced precision, resulting in bases computed without inner-products. A primary focus is on maintaining the linear independence of the basis vectors. Through extensive evaluation with both synthetic test cases and real-world applications, we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves the desired accuracy while fully taking full advantage of mixed-precision arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Integral Representations of Sobolev Spaces via ReLU$^k$ Activation Function and Optimal Error Estimates for Linearized Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents two main theoretical results concerning shallow neural networks with ReLU$^k$ activation functions. We establish a novel integral representation for Sobolev spaces, showing that every function in $H^{\frac{d+2k+1}{2}}(\Omega)$ can be expressed as an $L^2$-weighted integral of ReLU$^k$ ridge functions over the unit sphere. This result mirrors the known representation of Barron spaces and highlights a fundamental connection between Sobolev regularity and neural network representations. Moreover, we prove that linearized shallow networks -- constructed by fixed inner parameters and optimizing only the linear coefficients -- achieve optimal approximation rates $O(n^{-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{2k+1}{2d}})$ in Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Schr\"odingerization method for linear non-unitary dynamics with optimal dependence on matrix queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schr\"odingerization method converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schr\"odinger-type equations with unitary evolution. It does so via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the original equation into a Schr\"odinger-type equation in one higher dimension \cite{Schrshort,JLY22SchrLong}. We show that by employing a smooth initialization of the warped phase transform \cite{JLM24SchrBackward}, Schr\"odingerization can in fact achieve optimal scaling in matrix queries. This paper presents the detailed implementation of three smooth initializations for the Schr\"odingerization method: (a) the cut-off function, (b) the higher-order polynomial interpolation, and (c) the Fourier transform methods, that achieve optimality for (a) and near-optimality for (b) and (c). A detailed analysis of key parameters affecting time complexity is conducted.</description>

      <title>Improving the scalability of a high-order atmospheric dynamics solver based on the deal.II library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present recent advances on the massively parallel performance of a numerical scheme for atmosphere dynamics applications based on the deal.II library. The implicit-explicit discontinuous finite element scheme is based on a matrix-free approach, meaning that no global sparse matrix is built and only the action of the linear operators on a vector is actually implemented. Following a profiling analysis, we focus on the performance optimization of the numerical method and describe the impact of different preconditioning and solving techniques in this framework. Moreover, we show how the use of the latest version of the \texttt{deal.II} library and of suitable execution flags can improve the parallel performance.</description>

      <title>Affine matrix scrambling achieves smoothness-dependent convergence rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convergence rate of the median estimator for affine matrix scrambled digital nets applied to integrands over the unit hypercube $[0, 1]^s$. By taking the median of $(2r-1)$ independent randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) samples, we demonstrate that the desired convergence rates can be achieved without increasing the number of randomizations $r$ as the quadrature size $N$ grows for both bounded and unbounded integrands. For unbounded integrands, our analysis assumes a boundary growth condition on the weak derivatives and also considers singularities such as kinks and jump discontinuities. Notably, when $r = 1$, the median estimator reduces to the standard RQMC estimator. By applying analytical techniques developed for median estimators, we prove that the affine matrix scrambled estimator achieves a convergence rate depending on the integrand's smoothness, and is therefore not limited by the canonical rate $\mathcal{O}(N^{-3/2})$. However, this smoothness-dependent theoretical rate is not observed empirically in numerical experiments when the affine matrix scrambling yields a heavy-tailed sampling distribution. In contrast, the median estimator consistently reveals the theoretical rates and yields smaller integration errors than mean estimators, further highlighting its advantages.</description>

      <title>Stability of the first-order unified gas-kinetic scheme based on a linear kinetic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) is becoming increasingly popular for multiscale simulations in all flow regimes. This paper provides the first analytical study on the stability of the UGKS applied to a linear kinetic model, which is able to reproduce the one-dimensional linear scalar advection-diffusion equation via the Chapman-Enskog expansion method. Adopting periodic boundary conditions and neglecting the error from numerical integration, this paper rigorously proves the weighted $L^2$-stability of the first-order UGKS under the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) conditions. It is shown that the time step of the method is not constrained by being less than the particle collision time, nor is it limited by parabolic type CFL conditions typically applied in solving diffusion equations. The novelty of the proof lies in that based on the ratio of the time step to the particle collision time, the update of distribution functions is viewed as a convex combinations of sub-methods related to various physics processes, such as the particle free transport and collisions. The weighted $L^2$-stability of the sub-methods is obtained by considering them as discretizations to corresponding linear hyperbolic systems and utilizing the associated Riemann invariants. Finally, the strong stability preserving property of the UGKS leads to the desired weighted $L^2$-stability.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for function approximation using generated sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of "generated sets" $\{ \{ k \boldsymbol{\zeta} \} : k = 1, \ldots, n \}$ for function approximation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces which consist of multi-dimensional functions with an absolutely convergent Fourier series. The algorithm is a least squares algorithm that samples the function at the points of a generated set. We show that there exist $\boldsymbol{\zeta} \in [0,1]^d$ for which the worst-case $L_2$ error has the optimal order of convergence if the space has polynomially converging approximation numbers. In fact, this holds for a significant portion of the generators. Additionally we show that a restriction to rational generators is possible with a slight increase of the bound. Furthermore, we specialise the results to the weighted Korobov space, where we derive a bound applicable to low values of sample points, and state tractability results.</description>

      <title>Subspace-Distance-Enabled Active Learning for Efficient Data-Driven Model Reduction of Parametric Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL) framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven (ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN. Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.</description>

      <title>Weak Random Feature Method for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random feature method (RFM) has demonstrated great potential in bridging traditional numerical methods and machine learning techniques for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). It retains the advantages of mesh-free approaches while achieving spectral accuracy for smooth solutions, without the need for iterative procedures. However, the implementation of RFM in the identification of weak solutions remains a subject of limited comprehension, despite crucial role of weak solutions in addressing numerous applied problems. While the direct application of RFM to problems without strong solutions is fraught with potential challenges, we propose an enhancement to the original random feature method that is specifically suited for finding weak solutions and is termed as Weak RFM. Essentially, Weak RFM reformulates the original RFM by adopting the weak form of the governing equations and constructing a new linear system through the use of carefully designed test functions, ensuring that the resulting solution satisfies the weak form by default. To rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on a variety of benchmark problems, including challenging three-dimensional cases, and compare its performance with state of the art machine learning-based approaches. The results demonstrate that Weak RFM achieves comparable or superior accuracy while significantly reducing computational time and memory consumption, highlighting its potential as a highly efficient and robust tool for finding weak solutions to various PDE problems.</description>

      <title>Model order reduction of hemodynamics by space-time reduced basis and reduced fluid-structure interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we apply the space-time Galerkin reduced basis (ST-GRB) method to a reduced fluid-structure interaction model, for the numerical simulation of hemodynamics in arteries. In essence, ST-GRB extends the classical reduced basis (RB) method, exploiting a data-driven low-dimensional linear encoding of the temporal dynamics to further cut the computational costs. The current investigation brings forth two key enhancements, compared to previous works on the topic. On the one side, we model blood flow through the Navier-Stokes equations, hence accounting for convection. In this regard, we implement a hyper-reduction scheme, based on approximate space-time reduced affine decompositions, to deal with nonlinearities effectively. On the other side, we move beyond the constraint of modelling blood vessels as rigid structures, acknowledging the importance of elasticity for the accurate simulation of complex blood flow patterns. To limit computational complexity, we adopt the Coupled Momentum model, incorporating the effect of wall compliance in the fluid's equations through a generalized Robin boundary condition. In particular, we propose an efficient strategy for handling the spatio-temporal projection of the structural displacement, which ultimately configures as a by-product. The performances of ST-GRB are assessed in three different numerical experiments. The results confirm that the proposed approach can outperform the classical RB method, yielding precise approximations of high-fidelity solutions at more convenient costs. However, the computational gains of ST-GRB vanish if the number of retained temporal modes is too large, which occurs either when complex dynamics arise or if very precise solutions are sought.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Nonoverlapping Preconditioners for the Helmholtz Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Helmholtz equation poses significant computational challenges due to its oscillatory solutions, particularly for large wavenumbers. Inspired by the Schur complement system for elliptic problems, this paper presents a novel substructuring approach to mitigate the potential ill-posedness of local Dirichlet problems for the Helmholtz equation. We propose two types of preconditioners within the framework of nonoverlapping spectral additive Schwarz (NOSAS) methods. The first type of preconditioner focuses on the real part of the Helmholtz problem, while the second type addresses both the real and imaginary components, providing a comprehensive strategy to enhance scalability and reduce computational cost. Our approach is purely algebraic, which allows for adaptability to various discretizations and heterogeneous Helmholtz coefficients while maintaining theoretical convergence for thresholds close to zero. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed preconditioners, demonstrating robust convergence rates and scalability, even for large wavenumbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that deep Heaviside networks (DHNs) have limited expressiveness but that this can be overcome by including either skip connections or neurons with linear activation. We provide lower and upper bounds for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimensions and approximation rates of these network classes. As an application, we derive statistical convergence rates for DHN fits in the nonparametric regression model.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian approach to inverse problems in spaces of measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a Bayesian framework for solving inverse problems in which the unknown parameter belongs to a space of Radon measures taking values in a separable Hilbert space. The inherent ill-posedness of such problems is addressed by introducing suitable measure-valued priors that encode prior information and promote desired sparsity properties of the parameter. Under appropriate assumptions on the forward operator and noise model, we establish the well-posedness of the Bayesian formulation by proving the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the posterior with respect to perturbations in the observed data. In addition, we also discuss computational strategies for approximating the posterior distribution. Finally, we present some examples that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A polytopal discrete de Rham scheme for the exterior calculus Einstein's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, based on the $3+1$ decomposition in [23, 32], we present a fully exterior calculus breakdown of spacetime and Einstein's equations. Links to the orthonormal frame approach [37] are drawn to help understand the variables in this context. Two formulations are derived, discretised and tested using the exterior calculus discrete de Rham complex [12], and some discrete quantities are shown to be conserved in one of the cases.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Type Exponential Integrators for Strongly Magnetized Charged Particle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculating the dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic fields (i.e. the particle pushing problem) is one of the most computationally intensive components of particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for plasma physics simulations. This task is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized, since in this case the particle motion consists of a wide range of temporal scales from highly oscillatory fast gyromotion to slow macroscopic behavior and the resulting numerical model is very stiff. Current state-of-the-art time integrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe numerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest. Recently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new approach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over commonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly and are $A$-stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms framework is extended to derive Nystr\"om-type exponential methods that integrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential equation. Specific Nystr\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are derived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\"om-type exponential integrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency over the standard exponential methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the well-posedness and solution regularity of an evolution equation with non-positive type variable-exponent memory, which describes multiscale viscoelasticity in materials with memory. The perturbation method is applied for model transformation, based on which the well-posedness is proved. Then the weighted solution regularity is derived, where the initial singularity is characterized by the initial value of variable exponent.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Spatial-Temporal Fusion Transformers: Multi-Output Prediction for Parametric Dynamical Systems with Time-Varying Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the promising performance of a transformer model in predicting outputs of parametric dynamical systems with external time-varying input signals. The outputs of such systems vary not only with physical parameters but also with external time-varying input signals. Accurately catching the dynamics of such systems is challenging. We have adapted and extended an existing transformer model for single output prediction to a multiple-output transformer that is able to predict multiple output responses of these systems. The multiple-output transformer generalizes the interpretability of the original transformer. The generalized interpretable attention weight matrix explores not only the temporal correlations in the sequence, but also the interactions between the multiple outputs, providing explanation for the spatial correlation in the output domain. This multiple-output transformer accurately predicts the sequence of multiple outputs, regardless of the nonlinearity of the system and the dimensionality of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>The local coupling of noise technique and its application to lower error bounds for strong approximation of SDEs with irregular coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, interest in approximation methods for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with non-Lipschitz continuous coefficients has increased. We show lower bounds for the $L^p$-error of such methods in the case of approximation at a single point in time or globally in time. On the one hand, we show that for a large class of piecewise Lipschitz continuous drifts and non-additive diffusions the best possible $L^p$-error rate for final time approximation that can be achieved by any method based on finitely many evaluations of the driving Brownian motion is at most $3/4$, which was previously known only for additive diffusions. Moreover, we show that the best $L^p$-error rate for global approximation that can be achieved by any method based on finitely many evaluations of the driving Brownian motion is at most $1/2$ when the drift is locally bounded and the diffusion is locally Lipschitz continuous.
  For the derivation of the lower bounds we introduce a new method of proof: the local coupling of noise technique. Using this technique when approximating a solution $X$ of the SDE at the final time, a lower bound for the $L^p$-error of any approximation method based on evaluations of the driving Brownian motion at the points $t_1 &lt; \dots &lt; t_n$ can be determined by the $L^p$-distances of solutions of the same SDE on $[t_{i-1}, t_i]$ with initial values $X_{t_{i-1}}$ and driving Brownian motions that are coupled at $t_{i-1}, t_i$ and independent, conditioned on the values of the Brownian motion at $t_{i-1}, t_i$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The propagation of charged particles through a scattering medium in the presence of a magnetic field can be described by a Fokker-Planck equation with Lorentz force. This model is studied both, from a theoretical and a numerical point of view. A particular trace estimate is derived for the relevant function spaces to clarify the meaning of boundary values. Existence of a weak solution is then proven by the Rothe method. In the second step of our investigations, a fully practical discretization scheme is proposed based on an implicit Euler method for the energy variable and a spherical-harmonics finite-element discretization with respect to the remaining variables. A complete error analysis of the resulting scheme is given and numerical test are presented to illustrate the theoretical results and the performance of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: We devise fast and provably accurate algorithms to transform between an $N\times N \times N$ Cartesian voxel representation of a three-dimensional function and its expansion into the {ball harmonics}, that is, the eigenbasis of the Dirichlet Laplacian on the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Given $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, our algorithms achieve relative $\ell^1$ - $\ell^\infty$ accuracy $\varepsilon$ in time $O(N^3 (\log N)^2 + N^3 |\log \varepsilon|^2)$, while the na\"{i}ve direct application of the expansion operators has time complexity $O(N^6)$. We illustrate our methods on numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Level-set shape optimization via polytopic discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new level-set shape optimization approach based on polytopic (i.e., polygonal in two and polyhedral in three spatial dimensions) discontinuous Galerkin methods. The approach benefits from the geometric mesh flexibility of polytopic discontinuous Galerkin methods to resolve the zero-level set accurately and efficiently. Additionally, we employ suitable Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin methods to update the level-set function on a fine underlying simplicial mesh. We discuss the construction and implementation of the approach, explaining how to modify shape derivate formulas to compute consistent shape gradient approximations using discontinuous Galerkin methods, and how to recover dG functions into smoother ones. Numerical experiments on unconstrained and PDE-constrained test cases evidence the good properties of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop efficient and effective strategies for the update of Katz centralities after node and edge removal in simple graphs. We provide explicit formulas for the ``loss of walks" a network suffers when nodes/edges are removed, and use these to inform our algorithms. The theory builds on the newly introduced concept of $\cF$-avoiding first-passage walks. Further, bounds on the change of total network communicability are also derived. Extensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world networks complement our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Hybrid discontinuous Galerkin discretizations for the damped time-harmonic Galbrun's equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the damped time-harmonic Galbrun's equation which models solar and stellar oscillations. We introduce and analyze hybrid discontinuous Galerkin discretizations (HDG) that are stable and optimally convergent for all polynomial degrees greater than or equal to one. The proposed methods are robust with respect to the drastic changes in the magnitude of the coefficients that naturally occur in stars. Our analysis is based on the concept of discrete approximation schemes and weak T-compatibility, which exploits the weakly T-coercive structure of the equation. Compared to the $H^1$-conforming discretization of [Halla, Lehrenfeld, Stocker, 2022], our method offers improved stability and robustness. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the computational costs compared to the $H(\operatorname{div})$-conforming DG discretization of [Halla, 2023], which has similar stability properties. These advantages make the proposed HDG methods well-suited for astrophysical simulations.</description>

      <title>WG-IDENT: Weak Group Identification of PDEs with Varying Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) identification is a data-driven method for mathematical modeling, and has received a lot of attentions recently. The stability and precision in identifying PDE from heavily noisy spatiotemporal data present significant difficulties. This problem becomes even more complex when the coefficients of the PDEs are subject to spatial variation. In this paper, we propose a Weak formulation of Group-sparsity-based framework for IDENTifying PDEs with varying coefficients, called WG-IDENT, to tackle this challenge. Our approach utilizes the weak formulation of PDEs to reduce the impact of noise. We represent test functions and unknown PDE coefficients using B-splines, where the knot vectors of test functions are optimally selected based on spectral analysis of the noisy data. To facilitate feature selection, we propose to integrate group sparse regression with a newly designed group feature trimming technique, called GF-trim, to eliminate unimportant features. Extensive and comparative ablation studies are conducted to validate our proposed method. The proposed method not only demonstrates greater robustness to high noise levels compared to state-of-the-art algorithms but also achieves superior performance while exhibiting reduced sensitivity to hyperparameter selection.</description>

      <title>Decomposition Problem in Process of Selective Identification and Localization of Voltage Fluctuations Sources in Power Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.05020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voltage fluctuations are common disturbances in power grids, therefore the effective and selective process of identification and localization of individual voltage fluctuations sources is necessary for the minimization of such disturbances. Selectivity in the process of identification and localization disturbing loads is possible by the use cascade of blocks: demodulation, decomposition and propagation assessment. The effectiveness of this approach is closely related to the used method of decomposition. The paper presents the problem of decomposition process for the selected method of selective identification and localization of voltage fluctuation sources, in which the algorithm of enhanced empirical wavelet transform (EEWT) is used as the decomposition method. The paper presents selected research results from the real power grid, for which the result of selected approach causes mistakes in the process of identification and localization of voltage fluctuations sources. The potential causes of such mistakes related to the decomposition process are discussed on the basis of obtained research results.</description>

      <title>Advanced Physics-Informed Neural Network with Residuals for Solving Complex Integral Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the Residual Integral Solver Network (RISN), a novel neural network architecture designed to solve a wide range of integral and integro-differential equations, including one-dimensional, multi-dimensional, ordinary and partial integro-differential, systems, fractional types, and Helmholtz-type integral equations involving oscillatory kernels. RISN integrates residual connections with high-accuracy numerical methods such as Gaussian quadrature and fractional derivative operational matrices, enabling it to achieve higher accuracy and stability than traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). The residual connections help mitigate vanishing gradient issues, allowing RISN to handle deeper networks and more complex kernels, particularly in multi-dimensional problems. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RISN consistently outperforms not only classical PINNs but also advanced variants such as Auxiliary PINN (A-PINN) and Self-Adaptive PINN (SA-PINN), achieving significantly lower Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) across various types of equations. These results highlight RISN's robustness and efficiency in solving challenging integral and integro-differential problems, making it a valuable tool for real-world applications where traditional methods often struggle.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Clamonds solution of the Colebrook-White equation - highest accuracy for engineering purposes with one iteration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Colebrook-White equation is the widely used basis for the calculation of the friction factor lambda for flows in pipes and ducts. Because this equation is implicit in lambda, many solutions have been developed to ease the calculation in order to reduce the effort and to reach a sufficient accuracy. Clamond has proposed in 2008 an iterative solution that requires maximally two iterations to obtain the machine double precision. Here an improvement of this solution is presented, that achieves already with one iteration a maximal error of 2.79E-7, what is more than sufficient for most engineering purposes. This solution is compared in a chart of CPU time versus accuracy with 28 solutions from the literature and in the group of the fastest solutions, that require only two calls of the logarithm function, it proved to be by far the most accurate one.</description>

      <title>Pychop: Emulating Low-Precision Arithmetic in Numerical Methods and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07835v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the growing demand for low-precision arithmetic in computational science, we exploit lower-precision emulation in Python -- widely regarded as the dominant programming language for numerical analysis and machine learning. Low-precision training has revolutionized deep learning by enabling more efficient computation and reduced memory and energy consumption while maintaining model fidelity. To better enable numerical experimentation with and exploration of low precision computation, we developed the Pychop library, which supports customizable floating-point formats and a comprehensive set of rounding modes in Python, allowing users to benefit from fast, low-precision emulation in numerous applications. Pychop also introduces interfaces for both PyTorch and JAX, enabling efficient low-precision emulation on GPUs for neural network training and inference with unparalleled flexibility.
  In this paper, we offer a comprehensive exposition of the design, implementation, validation, and practical application of Pychop, establishing it as a foundational tool for advancing efficient mixed-precision algorithms. Furthermore, we present empirical results on low-precision emulation for image classification and object detection using published datasets, illustrating the sensitivity of the use of low precision and offering valuable insights into its impact. Pychop enables in-depth investigations into the effects of numerical precision, facilitates the development of novel hardware accelerators, and integrates seamlessly into existing deep learning workflows.
