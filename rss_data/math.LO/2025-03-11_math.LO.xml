Abstract: In line with known results on groups, we give some characterizations of radicals in Lie rings with minimal condition on centralizers. In particular, we prove the existence of the nilpotent radical and we deduce a form of Engel theorem if the characteristic is zero.</description>

      <title>Representability for distributive quasi relation algebras via generalised ordinal sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the work of Galatos (2004) on generalised ordinal sums of residuated lattices. We show that the generalised ordinal sum of an odd quasi relation algebra (qRA) satisfying certain conditions and an arbitrary qRA is again a qRA. In a recent paper by Craig and Robinson (2024), the notion of representability for distributive quasi relation algebras (DqRAs) was developed. For certain pairs of representable DqRAs, we prove that their generalised ordinal sum is again representable. An important consequence of this result is that finite Sugihara chains are finitely representable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a variation of Woodin's $\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{max}}$ forcing, we force over a model of the Axiom of Determinacy to produce a model of ZFC containing a very strongly increasing sequence of length $\omega_{2}$ consisting of functions from $\omega$ to $\omega$. We also show that there can be no such sequence of length $\omega_{4}$.</description>

      <title>2-Coherent Internal Models of Homotopical Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The program of internal type theory seeks to develop the categorical model theory of dependent type theory using the language of dependent type theory itself. In the present work we study internal homotopical type theory by relaxing the notion of a category with families (cwf) to that of a wild, or precoherent higher cwf, and determine coherence conditions that suffice to recover properties expected of models of dependent type theory. The result is a definition of a split 2-coherent wild cwf, which admits as instances both the syntax and the "standard model" given by a universe type. This allows us to give a straightforward internalization of the notion of a 2-coherent reflection of homotopical type theory in itself: namely as a 2-coherent wild cwf morphism from the syntax to the standard model. Our theory also easily specializes to give definitions of "low-dimensional" higher cwfs, and conjecturally includes the container higher model as a further instance.</description>

      <title>Encoding Argumentation Frameworks to Propositional Logic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of argumentation frameworks ($AF$s) has been a useful tool for artificial intelligence. The research of the connection between $AF$s and logic is an important branch. This paper generalizes the encoding method by encoding $AF$s as logical formulas in different propositional logic systems. It studies the relationship between models of an AF by argumentation semantics, including Dung's classical semantics and Gabbay's equational semantics, and models of the encoded formulas by semantics of propositional logic systems. Firstly, we supplement the proof of the regular encoding function in the case of encoding $AF$s to the 2-valued propositional logic system. Then we encode $AF$s to 3-valued propositional logic systems and fuzzy propositional logic systems and explore the model relationship. This paper enhances the connection between $AF$s and propositional logic systems. It also provides a new way to construct new equational semantics by choosing different fuzzy logic operations.</description>

      <title>Quite free p-groups with trivial duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a class of abelian groups that exhibit a high degree of freeness while possessing no non-trivial homomorphisms to a canonical free object. Unlike prior investigations, which primarily focused on torsion-free groups, our work broadens the scope to include groups with torsion. Our main focus is on reduced separable p-groups, for which we formulate and prove the Trivial Duality Conjecture. Key tools in our analysis include the multi black-box method and the application of specific homological properties of relative trees. These techniques allow us to navigate the intricate interplay between freeness and duality in a broader class of abelian groups</description>

Abstract: Hjorth, assuming ${\sf{AD+ZF+DC}}$, showed that there is no sequence of length $\omega_2$ consisting of distinct $\Sigma^1_2$-sets. We show that the same theory implies that for $n\geq 0$, there is no sequence of length $\delta^1_{2n+2}$ consisting of distinct $\Sigma^1_{2n+2}$ sets. The theorem settles Question 30.21 of Kanamori, which was also conjectured by Kechris.</description>

      <title>The Open Coloring Axiom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is concerned with an axiom introduced by Todorc\v{e}vi\'{c} in \cite{stevo} that constitutes a Ramsey-like statement regarding the topology of the reals. Our aim is to explain the axiom in detail, give some interesting applications and finally prove that the axiom is indeed consistent with ZFC, so that it makes sense to consider working with it in the first place.
  For this particular academic endeavor, we cover several advanced topics in set theory, including concepts like {\sl Hausdorff gaps}, forcing, infinitary combinatorics and a tad of topology. We employ, for example, an argument based on Rothberger's theorem to show that the Open Coloring Axiom implies the equality $\mathfrak b=\aleph_2$, which in turn makes this axiom inconsistent with CH. In other words, in ZFC, the Open Coloring Axiom could be false. To prove its relative consistency, we show that the axiom could be true by following a rather long and technical lemma of Todorc\v{e}vi\'{c}, which leads to the culmination of this work.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to present an approach to Hod Pair Capturing (HPC). $HPC$ is the most outstanding open problem of descriptive inner model theory. More specifically, we introduce two principles, the Direct Limit Independence and the Bounded Direct Limits, and show that they together imply HPC.</description>

      <title>Representable distributive quasi relation algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a definition of representability for distributive quasi relation algebras (DqRAs). These algebras are a generalisation of relation algebras and were first described by Galatos and Jipsen (2013). Our definition uses a construction that starts with a poset. The algebra is concretely constructed as the lattice of upsets of a partially ordered equivalence relation. The key to defining the three negation-like unary operations is to impose certain symmetry requirements on the partial order. Our definition of representable distributive quasi relation algebras is easily seen to be a generalisation of the definition of representable relations algebras by Jonsson and Tarski (1948). We give examples of representable DqRAs and give a necessary condition for an algebra to be finitely representable. We leave open the questions of whether every DqRA is representable, and also whether the class of representable DqRAs forms a variety. Moreover, our definition provides many other opportunities for investigations in the spirit of those carried out for representable relation algebras.</description>

      <title>AD$^+$ implies that $\omega_1$ is a $\Theta$-Berkeley cardinal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following \cite{bagaria2019large}, given cardinals $\kappa&lt;\lambda$, we say $\kappa$ is a club $\lambda$-Berkeley cardinal if for every transitive set $N$ of size $&lt;\lambda$ such that $\kappa\subseteq N$, there is a club $C\subseteq \kappa$ with the property that for every $\eta\in C$ there is an elementary embedding $j: N\rightarrow N$ with crit$(j)=\eta$. We say $\kappa$ is $\nu$-club $\lambda$-Berkeley if $C\subseteq \kappa$ as above is a $\nu$-club. We say $\kappa$ is $\lambda$-Berkeley if $C$ is unbounded in $\kappa$. We show that under AD$^+$, (1) every regular Suslin cardinal is $\omega$-club $\Theta$-Berkeley (see \rthm{main theorem}), (2) $\omega_1$ is club $\Theta$-Berkeley (see \rthm{main theorem lr} and \rthm{main theorem}), and (3) the ${\tilde\delta}^1_{2n}$'s are $\Theta$-Berkeley -- in particular, $\omega_2$ is $\Theta$-Berkeley (see \rrem{omega2}).
  Along the way, we represent regular Suslin cardinals in direct limits as cutpoint cardinals (see \rthm{char extenders}). This topic has been studied in \cite{MPSC} and \cite{jackson2022suslin}, albeit from a different point of view. We also show that, assuming $V=L(\mathbb{R})+{\mathrm{AD}}$, $\omega_1$ is not $\Theta^+$-Berkeley, so the result stated in the title is optimal (see \rthm{lr optimal} and \rthm{thetareg optimal}).</description>

      <title>Residually Constructible Extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T$ be an o-minimal theory expanding $\mathrm{RCF}$ and $T_{\mathrm{convex}}$ be the common theory of its models expanded by predicate for a non-trivial $T$-convex valuation ring. We call an elementary extension $(\mathbb{E}, \mathcal{O}) \prec (\mathbb{E}_*, \mathcal{O}_*) \models T_{\mathrm{convex}}$ $\textit{res-constructible}$ if there is a tuple $\overline{s}$ in $\mathcal{O}_*$ such that the projection $\mathbf{res}(\overline{s})$ of $\overline{s}$ in the residue field sort is $\mathrm{dcl}$-independent over the residue field $\mathbf{res}(\mathbb{E}, \mathcal{O})$ of $(\mathbb{E}, \mathcal{O})$. We study factorization properties of res-constructible extensions. Our main result is that a res-constructible extension $(\mathbb{E}, \mathcal{O}) \prec (\mathbb{E}_*, \mathcal{O}_*)$ has the property that all $(\mathbb{E}_1, \mathcal{O}_1)$ with $(\mathbb{E}, \mathcal{O}) \prec (\mathbb{E}_1, \mathcal{O}_1) \prec (\mathbb{E}_*, \mathcal{O}_*)$ are res-constructible over $(\mathbb{E}, \mathcal{O})$, if and only if $\mathbb{E}_*$ has countable dimension over $\mathbb{E}$ or the value group $\mathbf{val}(\mathbb{E}_*, \mathcal{O}_*)$ contains no uncountable well-ordered subset. This analysis entails complete answers to [9, Problem 5.12].</description>

      <title>Weak Baumgartner axioms and universal spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $X$ is a topological space and $\kappa$ is a cardinal then $\mathsf{BA}_\kappa (X)$ is the statement that for each pair $A, B \subseteq X$ of $\kappa$-dense subsets there is an autohomeomorphism $h:X \to X$ mapping $A$ to $B$. In particular $\mathsf{BA}_{\aleph_1} (\mathbb R)$ is equivalent the celebrated Baumgartner axiom on isomorphism types of $\aleph_1$-dense linear orders. In this paper we consider two natural weakenings of $\mathsf{BA}_\kappa (X)$ which we call $\mathsf{BA}^-_\kappa (X)$ and $\mathsf{U}_\kappa (X)$ for arbitrary perfect Polish spaces $X$. We show that the first of these, though properly weaker, entails many of the more striking consequences of $\mathsf{BA}_\kappa (X)$ while the second does not. Nevertheless the second is still independent of $\mathsf{ZFC}$ and we show in particular that it fails in the Cohen and random models. This motivates several new classes of pairs of spaces which are ``very far from being homeomorphic" which we call ``avoiding", ``strongly avoiding", and ``totally avoiding". The paper concludes by studying these classes, particularly in the context of forcing theory, in an attempt to gauge how different weak Baumgartner axioms may be separated.</description>

Abstract: The consistency of the theory $\mathsf{ZF} + \mathsf{AD}_{\mathbb{R}} + {}$``every set of reals is universally Baire'' is proved relative to $\mathsf{ZFC} + {}$``there is a cardinal that is a limit of Woodin cardinals and of strong cardinals.'' The proof is based on the derived model construction, which was used by Woodin to show that the theory $\mathsf{ZF} + \mathsf{AD}_{\mathbb{R}} + {}$``every set of reals is Suslin'' is consistent relative to $\mathsf{ZFC} + {}$``there is a cardinal $\lambda$ that is a limit of Woodin cardinals and of $\mathord{&lt;}\lambda$-strong cardinals.'' The $\Sigma^2_1$ reflection property of our model is proved using genericity iterations as used by Neeman and Steel.</description>

      <title>Proof complexity of positive branching programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.06673v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the proof complexity of systems based on positive branching programs, i.e. non-deterministic branching programs (NBPs) where, for any 0-transition between two nodes, there is also a 1-transition. Positive NBPs compute monotone Boolean functions, just like negation-free circuits or formulas, but constitute a positive version of (non-uniform) NL, rather than P or NC1, respectively.

The proof complexity of NBPs was investigated in previous work by Buss, Das and Knop, using extension variables to represent the dag-structure, over a language of (non-deterministic) decision trees, yielding the system eLNDT. Our system eLNDT+ is obtained by restricting their systems to a positive syntax, similarly to how the 'monotone sequent calculus' MLK is obtained from the usual sequent calculus LK by restricting to negation-free formulas.

Our main result is that eLNDT+ polynomially simulates eLNDT over positive sequents. Our proof method is inspired by a similar result for MLK by Atserias, Galesi and Pudl\'ak, that was recently improved to a bona fide polynomial simulation via works of Je\v{r}\'abek and Buss, Kabanets, Kolokolova and Kouck\'y. Along the way we formalise several properties of counting functions within eLNDT+ by polynomial-size proofs and, as a case study, give explicit polynomial-size poofs of the propositional pigeonhole principle.</description>

      <title>Unifying Sequent Systems for G\"odel-L\"ob Provability Logic via Syntactic Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the inter-translatability of proofs between the most prominent sequent-based formalisms for G\"odel-L\"ob provability logic. In particular, we consider Sambin and Valentini's sequent system GLseq, Shamkanov's non-wellfounded and cyclic sequent systems GL$\infty$ and GLcirc, Poggiolesi's tree-hypersequent system CSGL, and Negri's labeled sequent system G3GL. Shamkanov provided proof-theoretic correspondences between GLseq, GL$\infty$, and GLcirc, and Gor\'e and Ramanayake showed how to transform proofs between CSGL and G3GL, however, the exact nature of proof transformations between the former three systems and the latter two systems has remained an open problem. We solve this open problem by showing how to restructure tree-hypersequent proofs into an end-active form and introduce a novel linearization technique that transforms such proofs into linear nested sequent proofs. As a result, we obtain a new proof-theoretic tool for extracting linear nested sequent systems from tree-hypersequent systems, which yields the first cut-free linear nested sequent calculus LNGL for G\"odel-L\"ob provability logic. We show how to transform proofs in LNGL into a certain normal form, where proofs repeat in stages of modal and local rule applications, and which are translatable into GLseq and G3GL proofs. These new syntactic transformations, together with those mentioned above, establish full proof-theoretic correspondences between GLseq, GL$\infty$, GLcirc, CSGL, G3GL, and LNGL while also giving (to the best of the author's knowledge) the first constructive proof mappings between structural (viz. labeled, tree-hypersequent, and linear nested sequent) systems and a cyclic sequent system.</description>

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) and decision-making systems, structured approximations play a crucial role in balancing model interpretability and predictive accuracy. Coarse Set Theory (CST) introduces a mathematical framework to formalize Coarse Ethics (CE), which models coarse-grained decision-making processes commonly used in human evaluations and AI classification systems. CST defines hierarchical relationships among sets using totally ordered structures and coarse mappings, enabling us to adjust decision granularity dynamically. Furthermore, coarse evaluations inherently involve a trade-off between efficiency and information retention, as they simplify complex data representations at the cost of precision. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we introduce Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence as a measure of information loss in coarse evaluations, demonstrating the impact of coarse partitioning on decision accuracy. This study employs CST in grading systems, automated recommendations, and risk assessments, demonstrating its potential to enhance fairness, reduce bias, and improve transparency in AI-driven decision-making.</description>
