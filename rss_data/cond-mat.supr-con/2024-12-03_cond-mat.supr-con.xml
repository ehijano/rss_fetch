      <title>Supercurrent flow in inhomogeneous superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the supercurrent flow pattern is altered by inhomogeneities in superconducting films. Working in the vicinity of the critical temperature and assuming a model of short-range disorder in the quadratic term of the Ginzburg-Landau functional, we develop a perturbation theory in the inhomogeneity strength. Absorbing the ultraviolet divergences into the renormalization of the critical temperature, we arrive at a well-defined theory governed by large-scale physics. In the presence of inhomogeneities, the correlation functions of the order parameter and supercurrent exhibit a long-range power-law behavior, which can be attributed to the mixing of the amplitude and phase modes. The fluctuation magnitude grows with increasing the average current, and the system becomes strongly inhomogeneous near the critical current.</description>

      <title>Friedel oscillations and chiral superconductivity in monolayer NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1965 Kohn and Luttinger proposed a genuine electronic mechanism for superconductivity. Despite the bare electrostatic interaction between two electrons being repulsive, in a metal electron-hole fluctuations can give rise to Friedel oscillations of the screened Coulomb potential. Cooper pairing among the electrons then emerges when taking advantage of the attractive regions. The nature of the leading pairing mechanism in some two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is still debated. Focusing on NbSe$_2$, we show that superconductivity can be induced by the Coulomb interaction when accounting for screening effects on the trigonal lattice with multiple orbitals. Using ab initio-based tight-binding parametrizations for the relevant low-energy d-bands, we evaluate the screened interaction microscopically, in a scheme that includes Bloch overlaps and Umklapp processes. In the direct space, we find long-range Friedel oscillations which alternate in sign. The momentum-resolved gap equations predict two quasi-degenerate nematic solutions near the critical temperature $T_c$, signaling the unconventional nature of the pairing. Their complex linear combination, i.e., a chiral gap with p-like symmetry, provides the ground state of the system. Our prediction of a fully gapped chiral phase well below $T_c$ is in agreement with the spectral function extracted from tunneling spectroscopy measurements of single-layer NbSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity at Pd/Bi$_2$Se$_3$ Interfaces Due to Self-Formed PdBiSe Interlayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the physical and chemical processes at the interface of metals and topological insulators is crucial for developing the next generation of topological quantum devices. Here we report the discovery of robust superconductivity in Pd/Bi$_2$Se$_3$ bilayers fabricated by sputtering Pd on the surface of Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Through transmission electron microscopy measurements, we identify that the observed interfacial superconductivity originates from the diffusion of Pd into Bi$_2$Se$_3$. In the diffusion region, Pd chemically reacts with Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and forms a layer of PdBiSe, a known su-perconductor with a bulk transition temperature of 1.5 K. Our work provides a method for in-troducing superconductivity into Bi$_2$Se$_3$, laying the foundation for developing sophisticated Bi$_2$Se$_3$-based topological devices.</description>

      <title>Structured light and induced vorticity in superconductors II: Quantum Print with Laguerre-Gaussian beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Challenge to control the quantum states of matter via light have been at the forefront of modern research on driven quantum matter. We explore the imprinting effects of structured light on superconductors, demonstrating how the quantum numbers of light-specifically spin angular momentum, orbital angular momentum, and radial order-can be transferred to the superconducting order parameter and control vortex dynamics. Using Laguerre-Gaussian beams, we show that by tuning the quantum numbers and the amplitude of the electric field, it is possible to manipulate a variety of vortex behaviors, including breathing vortex pairs, braiding vortex pairs, vortex droplets, supervortices, and swirling 2D vortex rings. More complex structure of vortex-clusters, such as vortex-flake structures, and standing wave motions, also emerge under specific quantum numbers. These results demonstrate the ability to control SC vortex motion and phase structures through structured light, offering potential applications in quantum fluids and optical control of superconducting states. Our findings present a diagram that links light's quantum numbers to the resulting SC vortex behaviors, highlighting the capacity of light to transfer its symmetry onto superconducting condensates. We point that this approach represents the extension of the printing to quantum printing by light in a coherent state of electrons.</description>

      <title>Transverse Josephson diode effect in tilted Dirac systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the transverse charge transport in Josephson junctions based on the tilted Dirac materials with valley-dependent gaps. It is shown that a finite tilt-assisted transverse Josephson Hall current is present under broken time-reversal symmetry. This transverse current is driven by the superconducting phase difference across the junction and exhibits a nonsinusoidal current-phase relation, leading to the transverse Josephson diode effect (TJDE), where the critical currents flowing oppositely along the transverse direction are asymmetric. Compared to the conventional longitudinal Josephson diode effect, the predicted TJDE supports a fully polarized diode efficiency with a $100\%$ quality factor and can completely decouple the input signal path from the output, suggesting potential applications for nonreciprocal superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Optimisation and Loss Analyses of Pulsed Field Magnetisation in a Superconducting Motor with Cryocooled Iron Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 2D electromagnetic-thermal coupled numerical model has been developed using the finite element method and validated against experimental data to investigate a superconducting machine featuring high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tape stacks and cryocooled iron cores. The HTS stacks are transformed into trapped field stacks (TFSs) through pulsed field magnetisation (PFM), generating rotor fields. After PFM, the superconducting motor operates on the same principle as permanent magnet synchronous motors. This study explores the behaviour of HTS stacks by altering the stack's layer number from one to nine and adjusting the pulsed current amplitude from 250 A to 1000 A. The primary objective of this paper is to identify the optimal combination of pulsed current amplitudes and TFS layer numbers for achieving maximum magnetisation fields. The secondary objective is to evaluate the overall losses in both superconducting and non-superconducting parts of the machine during magnetisation, including heat generated in various layers of the TFS, and losses in the motor's active materials (copper windings and iron cores). Two motor configurations were proposed, and two calculation methods using linear interpolation of iron losses and steel grades were introduced to estimate the iron losses for the studied iron material, M270-35A. This pioneering study is expected to serve as a valuable reference for loss analyses and structural design considerations in developing superconducting machines.</description>

      <title>Andreev non-Hermitian Hamiltonian for open Josephson junctions from Green's functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of open Josephson junctions (JJs) through a minimal effective non-Hermitian (NH) approach derived from the equilibrium Green's function (GF) formalism. Specifically, we consider a JJ with a quantum dot barrier coupled to a normal metal reservoir. The coupling introduces an imaginary self-energy term in the JJ Hamiltonian which can be naturally accounted for in the NH formalism. While most approaches to similar problems work with the full junction Hamiltonian we propose a scheme for deriving an effective NH Hamiltonian for the Andreev levels only, that we compute from the singular part of the barrier GF. To establish the range of applicability of this NH model we benchmark our results for both the dot density of states and the supercurrent against exact GF predictions in different transport regimes. We find that, as a rule of thumb, the Andreev NH description is accurate when the spectral overlap between the Andreev bound states (ABS) and the near-gap continuum states is negligible, i.e. when the ABS energies lie sufficiently far from the superconducting gap relative to their line-width. This method not only highlights the effective physics of the JJ but also offers a scalable framework for studying large-size devices.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of Proximity-Induced Superconductivity in PbTe/Pb heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor-superconductor hybrid devices have been proposed as promising platforms for detecting and analyzing Majorana zero modes, which find applications in topological quantum computing. In this work, we solve the Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory and Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations to describe the normal and superconducting properties of a PbTe/Pb heterostructure. We resolve a proximity-induced superconducting gap on the PbTe side. The hybridization between PbTe and Pb causes the emergence of a soft Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like superconducting gap. We compute the anomalous charge density in real space, estimating its decay length and showing that the pairing potential is anisotropic, which is a necessary condition for unconventional superconductivity. Contrary to the models that predict Majorana zero modes in these interfaces, we find a significantly large Schottky barrier in the normal state preventing the emergence of zero modes. Our findings strengthen the understanding of the physics governing PbTe/Pb hybrid devices and their viability for Majorana zero modes applications.</description>

      <title>Collective quantum phases in frustrated arrays of Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study collective quantum phases and quantum phase transitions occurring in frustrated sawtooth arrays of small quantum Josephson junctions. Frustration is introduced through the periodic arrangement of $0$- and $\pi$- Josephson junctions with the Josephson coupling energies $\alpha E_\mathrm{J}$ of different signs, $-1\leq \alpha \leq 1$. The complexity of the potential landscape of the system is controlled by the frustration parameter $f=(1-\alpha)/2$. The potential energy has a single global minimum in the non-frustrated regime ($f&lt;f_\mathrm{cr}=0.75$) and a macroscopic number of equal minima in the frustrated regime ($f&gt;f_\mathrm{cr}=0.75$). We address the coherent quantum regime and identify several collective quantum phases: disordered (insulating) and ordered (superconducting) phases in the non-frustrated regime, as well as highly entangled patterns of vortices and anti-vortices in the frustrated regime. These collective quantum phases are controlled by several physical parameters: the frustration $f$, the Josephson coupling, and the charging energies of junctions and islands. We map the control parameter phase diagram by characterizing the quantum dynamics of frustrated Josephson junction arrays by spatially and temporally resolved quantum-mechanical correlation function of the local magnetization.</description>

      <title>Coulomb screening of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene has been a subject of intense debate. While some experimental evidence indicated an unconventional pairing mechanism, efforts to tune the critical temperature by screening the Coulomb interactions have been unsuccessful, possibly indicating a conventional phonon-mediated pairing. Here we study a double-layer electronic system consisting of two twisted graphene bilayers in immediate proximity of each other but remaining electronically decoupled. By increasing the carrier density in one bilayer, we completely suppressed both the superconductivity and the correlated-insulator state in the adjacent magic-angle graphene. The observation of such a screening effect offers strong support for an unconventional mechanism of Cooper pairing in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, shedding new light on the underlying physics governing their properties.</description>

      <title>Double-edged Role of Interactions in Superconducting Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the unconventional superconducting phases in moire materials, a critical question is the role played by electronic interactions in the formation of Cooper pairs. In twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), the strength of electronic interactions can be reduced by increasing the twist angle or screening provided by the dielectric medium. In this work, we place tBLG at 3-4 nm above bulk SrTiO3 substrates, which have a large yet tunable dielectric constant. By raising the dielectric constant in situ in a magic angle device, we observe suppression of both the height and the width of the entire superconducting dome, thus demonstrating that, unlike conventional superconductors, the pairing mechanism in tBLG is strongly dependent on electronic interactions. Interestingly, in contrast to the absence of superconductivity in devices on SiO2 with angle&gt;1.3 deg, we observe a superconducting pocket in a large-angle (angle=1.4 deg) tBLG/STO device while the correlated insulating states are absent. These experimental results are in qualitative agreement with a theoretical model in which the pairing mechanism arises from Coulomb interactions that are screened by plasmons, electron-hole pairs, and longitudinal acoustic phonons. Our results highlight the unconventional nature of the superconductivity in tBLG, the double-edged role played by electronic interactions in its formation, as well as their complex interplay with the correlated insulating states.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of the Higgs particle in a superconductor by non-equilibrium Raman scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Even before its role in electroweak symmetry breaking, the Anderson-Higgs mechanism was introduced to explain the Meissner effect in superconductors. Spontaneous symmetry-breaking yields massless phase modes representing the low-energy excitations of the Mexican-Hat potential. Only in superconductors the phase mode is shifted towards higher energies owing to the gauge field of the charged condensate. This results in a low-energy excitation spectrum governed by the Higgs mode. Consequently, the Meissner effect signifies a macroscopic quantum condensate in which a photon acquires mass, representing a one-to-one analogy to high-energy physics. We report on the direct observation of the Higgs particle in the high-temperature superconductor Bi-2212 by developing an innovative technique to study its symmetries and energies after a "soft quench" of the Mexican-Hat potential. Population inversion of the metastable Higgs particle induced by an initial laser pulse allows identifying the polarization-dependent Higgs modes as an additional anti-Stokes Raman-scattering signal. Within Ginzburg-Landau theory, the Higgs-mode energy is connected to the Cooper-pair coherence length. Within a BCS weak-coupling model we develop a quantitative and coherent description of single-particle and two-particle channels. This opens the avenue for Higgs Spectroscopy in quantum condensates and provides a unique pathway to control and explore Higgs physics.</description>

      <title>Density-wave-like gap evolution in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure revealed by ultrafast optical spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density wave (DW) order is believed to be correlated with superconductivity in the recently discovered high-temperature superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. However, experimental investigations of its evolution under high pressure are still lacking. Here, we explore the quasiparticle dynamics in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ single crystals using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy under high pressures up to 34.2 GPa. At ambient pressure, the temperature-dependent relaxation dynamics demonstrate a phonon bottleneck effect due to the opening of an energy gap around 151 K. The energy scale of the DW-like gap is determined to be 66 meV by the Rothwarf-Taylor model. Combined with recent experiential results, we propose that this DW-like transition at ambient pressure and low temperature is spin density wave (SDW). With increasing pressure, this SDW order is significantly suppressed up to 13.3 GPa before it completely disappears around 26 GPa. Remarkably, at pressures above 29.4 GPa, we observe the emergence of another DW-like order with a transition temperature of approximately 135 K, which is probably related to the predicted charge density wave (CDW) order. Our study provides the experimental evidence of the evolution of the DW-like gap under high pressure, offering critical insights into the correlation between DW order and superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

Abstract: The possibility of an unconventional form of high temperature superconductivity in flat band (FB) material does not cease to challenge our understanding of the physics in correlated systems. Here, we calculate the normal and anomalous one-particle correlation functions in various one and two dimensional FB systems and systematically extract the characteristic lengthscales. When the Fermi energy is located in the FB, it is found that the coherence length ($\xi$) is of the order of the lattice spacing and weakly sensitive to the strength of the electron-electron interaction. Recently, it has been argued that in FB compounds $\xi$ could be decomposed into a conventional part of BCS type ($\xi_{BCS}$) and a geometric contribution which characterises the FB eigenstates, the quantum metric ($\langle g \rangle$). However, by calculating the coherence length in two possible ways, our calculations show that $\xi \neq \sqrt{\langle g \rangle.}$ This may suggest that the link between QM and coherence length is more complex, and leaves us with the open question: what is the appropriate definition of the coherence length in flat-band systems?</description>

      <title>Models of interacting bosons with exact ground states: a unified approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define an infinite class of ``frustration-free'' interacting lattice quantum Hamiltonians for bosons, constructed such that their exact ground states have a density distribution specified by the Boltzmann weight of a corresponding classical lattice gas problem. By appropriately choosing the classical weights, we obtain boson representations of various known solvable models, including quantum dimer and vertex models, toric code, and certain Levin-Wen string-net models. We also systematically construct solvable models with other interesting ground states, including ``quantum spin liquids,'' supersolids, ``Bose-Einstein insulators,'' Bose liquids with ``Bose surfaces'', and Bose-Einstein condensates that permit adiabatic evolution from a non-interacting limit to a Gutzwiller-projected limit.</description>

      <title>InvDesFlow: An AI search engine to explore possible high-temperature superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of new superconducting materials, particularly those exhibiting high critical temperature ($T_c$), has been a vibrant area of study within the field of condensed matter physics. Conventional approaches primarily rely on physical intuition to search for potential superconductors within the existing databases. However, the known materials only scratch the surface of the extensive array of possibilities within the realm of materials. Here, we develop InvDesFlow, an AI search engine that integrates deep model pre-training and fine-tuning techniques, diffusion models, and physics-based approaches (e.g., first-principles electronic structure calculation) for the discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductors. Utilizing InvDesFlow, we have obtained 74 dynamically stable materials with critical temperatures predicted by the AI model to be $T_c \geq$ 15 K based on a very small set of samples. Notably, these materials are not contained in any existing dataset. Furthermore, we analyze trends in our dataset and individual materials including B$_4$CN$_3$ (at 5 GPa) and B$_5$CN$_2$ (at ambient pressure) whose $T_c$s are 24.08 K and 15.93 K, respectively. We demonstrate that AI technique can discover a set of new high-$T_c$ superconductors, outline its potential for accelerating discovery of the materials with targeted properties.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram, $d$-Wave Superconductivity, and Pseudogap of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ Model at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06322v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, robust $d$-wave superconductive (SC) order has been unveiled in the ground state of the 2D $t$-$t'$-$J$ model -- with both nearest-neighbor ($t$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($t'$) hoppings -- by density matrix renormalization group studies. However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t&gt;0$ and $t'/t&lt;0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t&gt;0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t&lt;0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</description>

      <title>Molecular beam epitaxy growth of superconducting tantalum germanide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing new material platforms for use in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid structures is desirable due to limitations caused by intrinsic microwave losses present in commonly used III/V material systems. With the recent reports on tantalum superconducting qubits that show improvements over the Nb and Al counterparts, exploring Ta as an alternative superconductor in hybrid material systems is promising. Here, we study the growth of Ta on semiconducting Ge (001) substrates grown via molecular beam epitaxy. We show that at a growth temperature of 400$^{\circ}$C the Ta diffuses into the Ge matrix in a self-limiting nature resulting in smooth and abrupt surfaces and interfaces with roughness on the order of 3-7 \r{A} as measured by atomic force microscopy and x-ray reflectivity. The films are found to be a mixture of Ta$_{5}$Ge$_{3}$ and TaGe$_{2}$ binary alloys and form a native oxide that seems to form a sharp interface with the underlying film. These films are superconducting with a $T_{C}\sim 1.8-2$K and $H_{C}^{\perp} \sim 1.88T$, $H_{C}^{\parallel} \sim 5.1T$. These results show this tantalum germanide film to be promising for future superconducting quantum information platforms.</description>

      <title>Photonic heat transport through a Josephson junction in a resistive environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments (Subero et. al. Nature Comm. $\bf{14}$, 7924 (2023)) we analyze photonic heat transport through a Josephson junction in a dissipative environment. For this purpose we derive general expressions for the heat current in terms of non-equilibrium Green functions for the junction coupled in series or in parallel with two environmental impedances at different temperatures. We show that even on the insulating side of the Schmid transition the heat current is sensitive to the Josephson coupling exhibiting an opposite behavior for the series and parallel connection and in qualitative agreement with experiments. We also predict that this device should exhibit heat rectification properties and provide simple expressions to account for them in terms of the system parameters.</description>

      <title>Extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model for quark and nuclear matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to one capable of exploring quark and nuclear matter consistently. With an extra term standing for quark-nucleon interactions, nucleons could automatically emerge as color-singlet three-quark entities by following a process similar to mesons. Besides the quark part in mean field approximation, both mesons and nucleons could contribute to the thermodynamic potential thus possibly give rise to quarkyonic matter beyond mean field. In the study, two kinds of "confining" couplings are adopted for the new interaction term and two different quark masses are considered for comparison. It turns out that only confined nuclear matter or deconfined quark matter is possible for all the cases at zero temperature, thus quarkyonic matter is not favored at all. Even more strictly, only the case with stronger confinement effect and a smaller quark mass admits a physical first-order phase transition from nuclear matter to quark matter around twice saturation density.</description>

      <title>A quantum dot in germanium proximitized by a superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planar germanium quantum wells have recently been shown to host hard-gapped superconductivity. Additionally, quantum dot spin qubits in germanium are well-suited for quantum information processing, with isotopic purification to a nuclear spin-free material expected to yield long coherence times. Therefore, as one of the few group IV materials with the potential to host superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices, proximitized quantum dots in germanium is a compelling platform to achieve and combine topological superconductivity with existing and novel qubit modalities. Here we demonstrate a quantum dot (QD) in a Ge/SiGe heterostructure proximitized by a platinum germanosilicide (PtGeSi) superconducting lead (SC), forming a SC-QD-SC junction. We show tunability of the QD-SC coupling strength, as well as gate control of the ratio of charging energy and the induced gap. We further exploit this tunability by exhibiting control of the ground state of the system between even and odd parity. Furthermore, we characterize the critical magnetic field strengths, finding a critical out-of-plane field of 0.90(4). Finally we explore sub-gap spin splitting in the device, observing rich physics in the resulting spectra, that we model using a zero-bandwidth model in the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov limit. The demonstration of controllable proximitization at the nanoscale of a germanium quantum dot opens up the physics of novel spin and superconducting qubits, and Josephson junction arrays in a group IV material.</description>

      <title>Gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy for artificially designed complex oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In designing material functionalities for transition metal oxides, lattice structure and d-orbital occupancy are key determinants. However, the modulation of these two factors is inherently limited by the need to balance thermodynamic stability, growth kinetics, and stoichiometry precision, particularly for metastable phases. We introduce a methodology, namely the gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GOALL-Epitaxy), enhancing oxidation power 3-4 orders of magnitude beyond conventional pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and oxide molecular beam epitaxy (OMBE), while ensuring atomic-layer-by-layer growth of designed complex structures. Thermodynamic stability is markedly augmented with stronger oxidation at elevated temperatures, whereas growth kinetics is sustained by laser ablation at lower temperatures. We demonstrate the accurate growth of complex nickelates and cuprates, especially an artificially designed structure with alternating single and double NiO2 layers possessing distinct nominal d-orbital occupancy, as a parent of high-temperature superconductor. The GOALL-Epitaxy enables material discovery within the vastly broadened growth parameter space.</description>
