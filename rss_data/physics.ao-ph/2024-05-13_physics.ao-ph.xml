      <title>Machine learning disentangles bias causes of shortwave cloud radiative effect in a climate model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large bias exists in shortwave cloud radiative effect (SWCRE) of general circulation models (GCMs), attributed mainly to the combined effect of cloud fraction and water contents, whose representations in models remain challenging. Here we show an effective machine-learning approach to dissect the individual bias of relevant cloud parameters determining SWCRE. A surrogate model for calculating SWCRE was developed based on random forest using observations and FGOALS-f3-L simulation data of cloud fraction (CFR), cloud-solar concurrence ratio (CSC), cloud liquid and ice water paths (LWP and IWP), TOA upward clear-sky solar flux (SUC), and solar zenith angle. The model, which achieves high determination coefficient &gt; 0.96 in the validation phase, was then used to quantify SWCRE bias associated with these parameters following the partial radiation perturbation method. The global-mean SWCRE bias (in W m-2) is contributed by CFR (+5.11), LWP (-6.58), IWP (-1.67), and CSC (+4.38), while SUC plays a minor role; the large CSC contribution highlights the importance of cloud diurnal variation. Regionally, the relative importance varies according to climate regimes. In Tropics, overestimated LWP and IWP exist over lands, while oceans exhibit underestimated CFR and CSC. In contrast, the extratropical lands and oceans have, respectively, too-small CSC and the 'too few, too bright' low-level clouds. We thus suggest that machine learning, in addition for developing GCM physical parameterizations, can also be utilized for diagnosing and understanding complex cloud-climate interactions.</description>

      <title>BharatBench: Dataset for data-driven weather forecasting over India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced weather and climate models use numerical techniques on grided meshes to simulate atmospheric and ocean dynamics, which are computationally expensive. Data-driven approaches are gaining popularity in weather and climate modeling, with a broad scope of applications. Although Machine Learning (ML) has been employed in this domain, significant progress has occurred in the past decade, leading to ML applications that are now competitive with traditional numerical methods. This study presents a user-friendly dataset for data-driven medium-range weather forecasting focused on India. The dataset is derived from IMDAA reanalysis datasets and optimized for ML applications. The study provides clear evaluation metrics and a few baseline scores from simple linear regression techniques and deep learning models. The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maslab/bharatbench, while the codes are available at https://github.com/MASLABnitrkl/BharatBench. We hope this dataset will boost data-driven weather forecasting over India. We also address limitations in the current evaluation process and future challenges in data-driven weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Ocean-DC: An analysis ready data cube framework for environmental and climate change monitoring over the port areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The environmental hazards and climate change effects causes serious problems in land and coastal areas. A solution to this problem can be the periodic monitoring over critical areas, like coastal region with heavy industrial activity (i.e., ship-buildings) or areas where a disaster (i.e., oil-spill) has occurred. Today there are several Earth and non-Earth Observation data available from several data providers. These data are huge in size and usually it is needed to combine several data from multiple sources (i.e., data with format differences) for a more effective evaluation. For addressing these issues, this work proposes the Ocean-DC framework as a solution in data harmonization and homogenization. A strong advantage of this Data Cube implementation is the generation of a single NetCDF product that contains Earth Observation data of several data types (i.e., Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2). To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Ocean-DC implementation, it is examined a case study of an oil-spill in Saronic gulf in September of 2017. The generated 4D Data Cube considers both Landsat-8,9 and Sentinel-2 products for a time-series analysis, before, during, and after the oil-spill event. The Ocean-DC framework successfully generated a NetCDF product, containing all the necessary remote sensing products for monitoring the oil-spill disaster in the Saronic gulf.</description>

      <title>OXYGENERATOR: Reconstructing Global Ocean Deoxygenation Over a Century with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately reconstructing the global ocean deoxygenation over a century is crucial for assessing and protecting marine ecosystem. Existing expert-dominated numerical simulations fail to catch up with the dynamic variation caused by global warming and human activities. Besides, due to the high-cost data collection, the historical observations are severely sparse, leading to big challenge for precise reconstruction. In this work, we propose OxyGenerator, the first deep learning based model, to reconstruct the global ocean deoxygenation from 1920 to 2023. Specifically, to address the heterogeneity across large temporal and spatial scales, we propose zoning-varying graph message-passing to capture the complex oceanographic correlations between missing values and sparse observations. Additionally, to further calibrate the uncertainty, we incorporate inductive bias from dissolved oxygen (DO) variations and chemical effects. Compared with in-situ DO observations, OxyGenerator significantly outperforms CMIP6 numerical simulations, reducing MAPE by 38.77%, demonstrating a promising potential to understand the "breathless ocean" in data-driven manner.</description>
