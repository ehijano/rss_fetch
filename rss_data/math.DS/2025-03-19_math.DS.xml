      <title>Efficient forward and inverse uncertainty quantification for dynamical systems based on dimension reduction and Kriging surrogate modeling in functional space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surrogate models are extensively employed for forward and inverse uncertainty quantification in complex, computation-intensive engineering problems. Nonetheless, constructing high-accuracy surrogate models for complex dynamical systems with limited training samples continues to be a challenge, as capturing the variability in high-dimensional dynamical system responses with a small training set is inherently difficult. This study introduces an efficient Kriging modeling framework based on functional dimension reduction (KFDR) for conducting forward and inverse uncertainty quantification in dynamical systems. By treating the responses of dynamical systems as functions of time, the proposed KFDR method first projects these responses onto a functional space spanned by a set of predefined basis functions, which can deal with noisy data by adding a roughness regularization term. A few key latent functions are then identified by solving the functional eigenequation, mapping the time-variant responses into a low-dimensional latent functional space. Subsequently, Kriging surrogate models with noise terms are constructed in the latent space. With an inverse mapping established from the latent space to the original output space, the proposed approach enables accurate and efficient predictions for dynamical systems. Finally, the surrogate model derived from KFDR is directly utilized for efficient forward and inverse uncertainty quantification of the dynamical system. Through three numerical examples, the proposed method demonstrates its ability to construct highly accurate surrogate models and perform uncertainty quantification for dynamical systems accurately and efficiently.</description>

      <title>Decomposition results for multiplicative actions and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by partition regularity problems of homogeneous quadratic equations, we prove multiple recurrence and convergence results for multiplicative measure preserving actions with iterates given by rational sequences involving polynomials that factor into products of linear forms in two variables. We focus mainly on actions that are finitely generated, and the key tool in our analysis is a decomposition result for any bounded measurable function into a sum of two components, one that mimics concentration properties of pretentious multiplicative functions and another that mimics vanishing properties of aperiodic multiplicative functions. Crucial to part of our arguments are some new seminorms that are defined by a mixture of addition and multiplication of the iterates of the action, and we prove an inverse theorem that explicitly characterizes the factor of the system on which these seminorms vanish.</description>

      <title>Gibbs Properties of Equilibrium States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of equivalence of Gibbs states and equilibrium states for continuous potentials on full shift spaces $E^{\mathbb{Z}}$. Sinai, Bowen, Ruelle and others established equivalence under various assumptions on the potential $\phi$. At the same time, it is known that every ergodic measure is an equilibrium state for some continuous potential. This means that the equivalence can occur only under some appropriate conditions on the potential function. In this paper, we identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of an open dense subset within the class of real analytic one-frequency quasi-periodic $\mathrm{\Sp}(4,\mathbb{R})$-cocycles, characterized by either the distinctness of all their Lyapunov exponents or the non-zero nature of all their accelerations, which partially answers an open problem raised by A.

      <title>Convex Optimization Boundary-Control Policies for Stability and Invariance of Traffic Flow Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we propose an optimization-based boundary controller for traffic flow dynamics capable of achieving both stability and invariance conditions. The approach is based on the definition of Boundary Control Barrier Functionals (BCBFal), from which sets of invariance-preserving boundary controllers are derived. In combination with sets of stabilizing controllers, we reformulate the problem as a convex optimization program solved at each point in time to synthesize the boundary control inputs. Sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal controllers are derived in the case of traffic flow models with stability and invariance conditions.</description>

      <title>Matrix nearness problems and eigenvalue optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This book is about solving matrix nearness problems that are related to eigenvalues or singular values or pseudospectra. These problems arise in great diversity in various fields, be they related to dynamics, as in questions of robust stability and robust control, or related to graphs, as in questions of clustering and ranking. Algorithms for such problems work with matrix perturbations that drive eigenvalues or singular values or Rayleigh quotients to desired locations.
  Remarkably, the optimal perturbation matrices are typically of rank one or are projections of rank-1 matrices onto a linear structure, e.g. a prescribed sparsity pattern. In the approach worked out here, these optimal rank-1 perturbations will be determined in a two-level iteration: In the inner iteration, an eigenvalue optimization problem for a fixed perturbation size is to be solved via gradient-based rank-1 matrix differential equations. This amounts to numerically driving a rank-1 matrix, which is represented by two vectors, into a stationary point, mostly starting nearby. The outer iteration determines the optimal perturbation size by solving a scalar nonlinear equation.
  A wide variety of matrix nearness problems, as outlined in the introductory Chapter I, will be tackled in Chapters II to VIII by such an approach and its nontrivial extensions.</description>

      <title>Semi-Gradient SARSA Routing with Theoretical Guarantee on Traffic Stability and Weight Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the traffic control problem of dynamic routing over parallel servers, which arises in a variety of engineering systems such as transportation and data transmission. We propose a semi-gradient, on-policy algorithm that learns an approximate optimal routing policy. The algorithm uses generic basis functions with flexible weights to approximate the value function across the unbounded state space. Consequently, the training process lacks Lipschitz continuity of the gradient, boundedness of the temporal-difference error, and a prior guarantee on ergodicity, which are the standard prerequisites in existing literature on reinforcement learning theory. To address this, we combine a Lyapunov approach and an ordinary differential equation-based method to jointly characterize the behavior of traffic state and approximation weights. Our theoretical analysis proves that the training scheme guarantees traffic state stability and ensures almost surely convergence of the weights to the approximate optimum. We also demonstrate via simulations that our algorithm attains significantly faster convergence than neural network-based methods with an insignificant approximation error.</description>

      <title>Instability of the peaked traveling wave in a local model for shallow water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traveling wave with the peaked profile arises in the limit of the family of traveling waves with the smooth profiles. We study the linear and nonlinear stability of the peaked traveling wave by using a local model for shallow water waves, which is related to the Hunter--Saxton equation. The evolution problem is well-defined in the function space $H^1_{\rm per} \cap W^{1,\infty}$, where we derive the linearized equations of motion and study the nonlinear evolution of co-periodic perturbations to the peaked periodic wave by using methods of characteristics. Within the linearized equations, we prove the spectral instability of the peaked traveling wave from the spectrum of the linearized operator in a Hilbert space, which completely covers the closed vertical strip with a specific half-width. Within the nonlinear equations, we prove the nonlinear instability of the peaked traveling wave by showing that the gradient of perturbations grow at the wave peak. By using numerical approximations of the smooth traveling waves and the spectrum of their associated linearized operator, we show that the spectral instability of the peaked traveling wave cannot be obtained in the limit along the family of the spectrally stable smooth traveling waves.</description>

      <title>Local rigidity of higher rank partially hyperbolic algebraic actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:1103.3077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a complete solution to the local classification program of higher rank partially hyperbolic algebraic actions. We show $C^\infty$ local rigidity of abelian ergodic algebraic actions for symmetric space examples, twisted symmetric space examples and automorphisms on nilmanifolds. The method is a combination of representation theory, harmonic analysis and a KAM iteration. A striking feature of the method is no specific information from representation theory is needed. It is the first time local rigidity for non-accessible partially hyperbolic actions has ever been obtained other than torus examples. Even for Anosov actions, our results are new: it is the first time twisted spaces with non-abelian nilradical have been treated in the literature.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study rigidity properties of abelian \hyphenation{break-able}actions with weak or no hyperbolicty. We introduce a general strategy for proving $C^\infty$ local rigidity of algebraic actions. As a consequence, we show $C^\infty$ local rigidity for a broad class of parabolic algebraic actions on homogeneous spaces of semisimple Lie groups. This is the first time in the literature that (strong) local rigidity for these actions is addressed.</description>

      <title>Opinion-driven risk perception and reaction in SIS epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and analyze a mathematical model to study the feedback between behavior and epidemic spread in a population that is actively assessing and reacting to risk of infection. In our model, a population dynamically forms an opinion that reflects its willingness to engage in risky behavior (e.g., not wearing a mask in a crowded area) or reduce it (e.g., social distancing). We consider SIS epidemic dynamics in which the contact rate within a population adapts as a function of its opinion. For the new coupled model, we prove the existence of two distinct parameter regimes. One regime corresponds to a low baseline infectiousness, and the equilibria of the epidemic spread are identical to those of the standard SIS model. The other regime corresponds to a high baseline infectiousness, and there is a bistability between two new endemic equilibria that reflect an initial preference towards either risk seeking behavior or risk aversion. We prove that risk seeking behavior increases the steady-state infection level in the population compared to the baseline SIS model, whereas risk aversion decreases it. When a population is highly reactive to extreme opinions, we show how risk aversion enables the complete eradication of infection in the population. Extensions of the model to a network of populations or individuals are explored numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a two-species Lotka-Volterra competition patch model in a Y-shaped river network, where the two species are assumed to be identical except for their random and directed movements. We show that competition exclusion can occur under certain conditions, i.e., one of the semi-trivial equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Especially, if the random dispersal rates of the two species are equal, the species with a smaller drift rate will drive the other species to extinction, which suggests that small drift rates are favored.</description>

      <title>Line zonotopes: a set representation suitable for unbounded systems and its application to set-based state estimation and active fault diagnosis of descriptor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10239v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes new methods for set-based state estimation and active fault diagnosis (AFD) of linear descriptor systems (LDS). Unlike intervals, ellipsoids, and zonotopes, constrained zonotopes (CZs) can directly incorporate linear static constraints on state variables - typical of descriptor systems - into their mathematical representation, leading to less conservative enclosures. However, for LDS that are unstable or not fully observable, a bounded representation cannot ensure a valid enclosure of the states over time. To address this limitation, we introduce line zonotopes, a new representation for unbounded sets that retains key properties of CZs, including polynomial time complexity reduction methods, while enabling the description of strips, hyperplanes, and the entire n-dimensional Euclidean space. This extension not only generalizes the use of CZs to unbounded settings but can also enhance set-based estimation and AFD in both stable and unstable scenarios. Additionally, we extend the AFD method for LDS from Rego et al. (2020) to operate over reachable tubes rather than solely on the reachable set at the final time of the considered horizon. This reduces conservatism in input separation and enables more accurate fault diagnosis based on the entire output sequence. The advantages of the proposed methods over existing CZ-based approaches are demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: We study selected topics about induced actions of topological groups $G$ on Lipschitz-free spaces $\mathcal{F}(M)$ coming from isometric actions on pointed metric spaces $M$. In particular, induced dynamical $G$-systems (under weak-star topology and the dual actions) on the dual $\mathrm{Lip_0} (M)=\mathcal{F}(M)^*$ and on the bidual $\mathcal{F}(M)^{**}$. We propose also topometric version of Lipschitz-free spaces and show that universal property remains true for a large class of topometric spaces.</description>
