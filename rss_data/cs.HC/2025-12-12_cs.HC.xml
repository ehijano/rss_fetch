      <title>Offscript: Automated Auditing of Instruction Adherence in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative search systems are increasingly used for information seeking by diverse populations with varying preferences for knowledge sourcing and presentation. While users can customize LLM behavior through custom instructions and behavioral prompts, no mechanism exists to evaluate whether these instructions are being followed effectively. We present Offscript, an automated auditing tool that efficiently identifies potential instruction following failures in LLMs. In a pilot study analyzing custom instructions sourced from Reddit, Offscript detected potential deviations from instructed behavior in 86.4% of conversations, 22.2% of which were confirmed as material violations through human review. Our findings suggest that automated auditing serves as a viable approach for evaluating compliance to behavioral instructions related to information seeking.</description>

      <title>HyFinBall: a Hybrid User Interface for Coordinated 2D+3D Visualization in Semi-Immersive VR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sophisticated 3D visualization applications usually provide coordinated 2D and 3D views. Normally 3D input device is used for 3D tasks since they perform better than traditional 2D input devices. However, they do not perform better for 2D tasks. This paper presents a bimanual hybrid user interface that supports four interaction modes: a dual 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) input device mode, a dual planar constrained 3DOF input device mode, a dual 2-finger multi-touch mode, and 3D hand and finger gestures. The application is a multi-dimensional visualization with coordinated 3D and 2D views on a desktop VR system. The input devices are buttonballs with seamless switching between 3D and 2D device modes, as well as between free-hand finger input and device usage. The 3D and 2D device mode switch automatically switches a buttonball's visual representation between a 3D cursor and a 2D cursor while changing the available user interaction techniques between 3D and 2D interaction techniques to interact with the coordinated views. The paper also provides two formal user studies to evaluate HyFinBall for various dimensional tasks, including 3D, 2D, and cross-dimensional tasks. Our experimental results show the benefits of the HyFinBall interface for cross-dimensional tasks that require 3D and 2D interactions.</description>

      <title>InFerActive: Towards Scalable Human Evaluation of Large Language Models through Interactive Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human evaluation remains the gold standard for evaluating outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs). The current evaluation paradigm reviews numerous individual responses, leading to significant scalability challenges. LLM outputs can be more efficiently represented as a tree structure, reflecting their autoregressive generation process and stochastic token selection. However, conventional tree visualization cannot scale to the exponentially large trees generated by modern sampling methods of LLMs. To address this problem, we present InFerActive, an interactive inference system for scalable human evaluation. InFerActive enables on-demand exploration through probability-based filtering and evaluation features, while bridging the semantic gap between computational tokens and human-readable text through adaptive visualization techniques. Through a technical evaluation and user study (N=12), we demonstrate that InFerActive significantly improves evaluation efficiency and enables more comprehensive assessment of model behavior. We further conduct expert case studies that demonstrate InFerActive's practical applicability and potential for transforming LLM evaluation workflows.</description>

      <title>Reject or Not?: A Benchmark for Voice Assistant Query Rejection in Smart Home Scenario and an Improved Method Based on LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In smart-home voice assistant scenario, deciding whether to accept or reject a user query is the first step before any downstream processing. To address the limited query-rejection capability of current voice assistants, this paper presents the first Chinese-oriented open-source benchmark and evaluation suite for smart homes, together with a personalized query-rejection method based on large language models. On the data side, we construct the first multimodal query-rejection dataset tailored for domestic scenarios, containing 11,913 manually labeled text-speech pairs that systematically cover twelve typical dialogue types (e.g., chit-chat, non-human sounds, valid commands, ambiguous references, device-irrelevant requests). Fine-grained labels, conversational context and multi-turn information are provided to support both zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations across language and multimodal large models. On the method side, we propose a three-tier collaborative architecture: first, a Qwen-2.5-3B adapter fine-tuned to model family-agnostic semantic boundaries; second, a dynamic household-level historical dialogue module to capture personalized habits; third, a household-specific RAG knowledge base that explicitly memorizes and revises past false-rejection cases. Experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms zero-shot and fine-tuned general LLMs on the constructed dataset, with pronounced gains in rejection accuracy for family-specific expressions and complex multi-turn scenarios. This work provides a reproducible data foundation, evaluation standard and extensible technical framework for reliability research in smart-home voice interaction.</description>

      <title>CompanionCast: A Multi-Agent Conversational AI Framework with Spatial Audio for Social Co-Viewing Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social presence is central to the enjoyment of watching content together, yet modern media consumption is increasingly solitary. We investigate whether multi-agent conversational AI systems can recreate the dynamics of shared viewing experiences across diverse content types. We present CompanionCast, a general framework for orchestrating multiple role-specialized AI agents that respond to video content using multimodal inputs, speech synthesis, and spatial audio. Distinctly, CompanionCast integrates an LLM-as-a-Judge module that iteratively scores and refines conversations across five dimensions (relevance, authenticity, engagement, diversity, personality consistency). We validate this framework through sports viewing, a domain with rich dynamics and strong social traditions, where a pilot study with soccer fans suggests that multi-agent interaction improves perceived social presence compared to solo viewing. We contribute: (1) a generalizable framework for orchestrating multi-agent conversations around multimodal video content, (2) a novel evaluator-agent pipeline for conversation quality control, and (3) exploratory evidence of increased social presence in AI-mediated co-viewing. We discuss challenges and future directions for applying this approach to diverse viewing contexts including entertainment, education, and collaborative watching experiences.</description>

      <title>ExaCraft: Dynamic Learning Context Adaptation for Personalized Educational Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning is most effective when it's connected to relevant, relatable examples that resonate with learners on a personal level. However, existing educational AI tools don't focus on generating examples or adapting to learners' changing understanding, struggles, or growing skills. We've developed ExaCraft, an AI system that generates personalized examples by adapting to the learner's dynamic context. Through the Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API, accessible via a Chrome extension, ExaCraft combines user-defined profiles (including location, education, profession, and complexity preferences) with real-time analysis of learner behavior. This ensures examples are both culturally relevant and tailored to individual learning needs. The system's core innovation is its ability to adapt to five key aspects of the learning context: indicators of struggle, mastery patterns, topic progression history, session boundaries, and learning progression signals. Our demonstration will show how ExaCraft's examples evolve from basic concepts to advanced technical implementations, responding to topic repetition, regeneration requests, and topic progression patterns in different use cases.</description>

      <title>Suzume-chan: Your Personal Navigator as an Embodied Information Hub</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Access to expert knowledge often requires real-time human communication. Digital tools improve access to information but rarely create the sense of connection needed for deep understanding. This study addresses this issue using Social Presence Theory, which explains how a feeling of "being together" enhances communication. An "Embodied Information Hub" is proposed as a new way to share knowledge through physical and conversational interaction. The prototype, Suzume-chan, is a small, soft AI agent running locally with a language model and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It learns from spoken explanations and responds through dialogue, reducing psychological distance and making knowledge sharing warmer and more human-centered.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap! Pathways Towards Unifying AI Safety and Ethics Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While much research in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on scaling capabilities, the accelerating pace of development makes countervailing work on producing harmless, "aligned" systems increasingly urgent. Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.
  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.</description>

      <title>Linear socio-demographic representations emerge in Large Language Models from indirect cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how LLMs encode sociodemographic attributes of human conversational partners inferred from indirect cues such as names and occupations. We show that LLMs develop linear representations of user demographics within activation space, wherein stereotypically associated attributes are encoded along interpretable geometric directions. We first probe residual streams across layers of four open transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) prompted with explicit demographic disclosure. We show that the same probes predict demographics from implicit cues: names activate census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics. These linear representations allow us to explain demographic inferences implicitly formed by LLMs during conversation. We demonstrate that these implicit demographic representations actively shape downstream behavior, such as career recommendations. Our study further highlights that models that pass bias benchmark tests may still harbor and leverage implicit biases, with implications for fairness when applied at scale.</description>

      <title>Generate-Then-Validate: A Novel Question Generation Approach Using Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the use of small language models (SLMs) for automatic question generation as a complement to the prevalent use of their large counterparts in learning analytics research. We present a novel question generation pipeline that leverages both the text generation and the probabilistic reasoning abilities of SLMs to generate high-quality questions. Adopting a "generate-then-validate" strategy, our pipeline first performs expansive generation to create an abundance of candidate questions and refine them through selective validation based on novel probabilistic reasoning. We conducted two evaluation studies, one with seven human experts and the other with a large language model (LLM), to assess the quality of the generated questions. Most judges (humans or LLMs) agreed that the generated questions had clear answers and generally aligned well with the intended learning objectives. Our findings suggest that an SLM can effectively generate high-quality questions when guided by a well-designed pipeline that leverages its strengths.</description>

      <title>Dark Personality Traits and Online Toxicity: Linking Self-Reports to Reddit Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark personality traits have been linked to online misbehavior such as trolling, incivility, and toxic speech. Yet the relationship between these traits and actual online conduct remains understudied. Here we investigate the associations between dark traits, online toxicity, and the socio-linguistic characteristics of online user activity. To explore this relationship, we developed a Web application that integrates validated psychological questionnaires from Amazon Mechanical Turk users to their Reddit activity data. This allowed collecting nearly 57K Reddit comments, including 2.2M tokens and 152.7K sentences from 114 users, that we systematically represent through 224 linguistic and behavioral features. We then examined their relationship to questionnaire-based trait measures via multiple correlation analyses. Among our findings is that dark traits primarily influence the production rather than the perception of online incivility. Sadistic and psychopathic tendencies are most strongly associated with overtly toxic language, whereas other dark dispositions manifest more subtly, often eluding simple textual proxies. Self-reported engagement in hostile behavior mirrors actual online activity, while existing hand-crafted textual proxies for dark triad traits show limited correspondence with our validated measures. Finally, bright and dark traits interact in nuanced ways, with extraversion reducing trolling tendencies and conscientiousness showing modest associations with entitlement and callousness. These findings deepen understanding of how personality shapes toxic online behavior and highlight both opportunities and challenges for developing reliable computational tools and targeted, effective moderation strategies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Large Language Models for End-to-End Circuit Analysis Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in data-rich domains such as programming, but their reliability in engineering tasks remains limited. Circuit analysis -- requiring multimodal understanding and precise mathematical reasoning -- highlights these challenges. Although Gemini 2.5 Pro improves diagram interpretation and analog-circuit reasoning, it still struggles to consistently produce correct solutions when given both text and circuit diagrams. At the same time, engineering education needs scalable AI tools capable of generating accurate solutions for tasks such as automated homework feedback and question-answering. This paper presents an enhanced, end-to-end circuit problem solver built on Gemini 2.5 Pro. We first benchmark Gemini on a representative set of undergraduate circuit problems and identify two major failure modes: 1) circuit-recognition hallucinations, particularly incorrect source polarity detection, and 2) reasoning-process hallucinations, such as incorrect current directions. To address recognition errors, we integrate a fine-tuned YOLO detector and OpenCV processing to isolate voltage and current sources, enabling Gemini to re-identify source polarities from cropped images with near-perfect accuracy. To reduce reasoning errors, we introduce an ngspice-based verification loop in which Gemini generates a .cir file, ngspice simulates the circuit, and discrepancies trigger iterative regeneration with optional human-in-the-loop review. Across 83 problems, the proposed pipeline achieves a 97.59% success rate (81 correct solutions), substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro's original 79.52% accuracy. This system extends LLM capabilities for multimodal engineering problem-solving and supports the creation of high-quality educational datasets and AI-powered instructional tools.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of today's educators are in no shortage of digital and online learning technologies available at their fingertips, ranging from Learning Management Systems such as Canvas, Blackboard, or Moodle, online meeting tools, online homework, and tutoring systems, exam proctoring platforms, computer simulations, and even virtual reality/augmented reality technologies. Furthermore, with the rapid development and wide availability of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) services such as ChatGPT, we are just at the beginning of harnessing their potential to transform higher education. Yet, facing the large number of available options provided by cutting-edge technology, an imminent question on the mind of most educators is the following: how should I choose the technologies and integrate them into my teaching process so that they would best support student learning? We contemplate over these types of important and timely questions and share our reflections on evidence-based approaches to harnessing digital learning tools using a Self-regulated Engaged Learning Framework we have employed in our research in physics education that can be valuable for educators in other disciplines.</description>

      <title>Developing and Evaluating a Large Language Model-Based Automated Feedback System Grounded in Evidence-Centered Design for Supporting Physics Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI offers new opportunities for individualized and adaptive learning, particularly through large language model (LLM)-based feedback systems. While LLMs can produce effective feedback for relatively straightforward conceptual tasks, delivering high-quality feedback for tasks that require advanced domain expertise, such as physics problem solving, remains a substantial challenge. This study presents the design of an LLM-based feedback system for physics problem solving grounded in evidence-centered design (ECD) and evaluates its performance within the German Physics Olympiad. Participants assessed the usefulness and accuracy of the generated feedback, which was generally perceived as useful and highly accurate. However, an in-depth analysis revealed that the feedback contained factual errors in 20% of cases; errors that often went unnoticed by the students. We discuss the risks associated with uncritical reliance on LLM-based feedback systems and outline potential directions for generating more adaptive and reliable LLM-based feedback in the future.</description>

      <title>Agile Deliberation: Concept Deliberation for Subjective Visual Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From content moderation to content curation, applications requiring vision classifiers for visual concepts are rapidly expanding. Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through "concept deliberation", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called "Agile Deliberation" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort.</description>

      <title>Visualization Generation with Large Language Models: An Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The frequent need for analysts to create visualizations to derive insights from data has driven extensive research into the generation of natural Language to Visualization (NL2VIS). While recent progress in large language models (LLMs) suggests their potential to effectively support NL2VIS tasks, existing studies lack a systematic investigation into the performance of different LLMs under various prompt strategies. This paper addresses this gap and contributes a crucial baseline evaluation of LLMs' capabilities in generating visualization specifications of NL2VIS tasks. Our evaluation utilizes the nvBench dataset, employing six representative LLMs and eight distinct prompt strategies to evaluate their performance in generating six target chart types using the Vega-Lite visualization specification. We assess model performance with multiple metrics, including vis accuracy, validity and legality. Our results reveal substantial performance disparities across prompt strategies, chart types, and LLMs. Furthermore, based on the evaluation results, we uncover several counterintuitive behaviors across these dimensions, and propose directions for enhancing the NL2VIS benchmark to better support future NL2VIS research.</description>

      <title>Screen Reader Programmers in the Vibe Coding Era: Adaptation, Empowerment, and New Accessibility Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI agents are reshaping human-computer interaction, shifting users from direct task execution to supervising machine-driven actions, especially the rise of "vibe coding" in programming. Yet little is known about how screen reader programmers interact with AI code assistants in practice. We conducted a longitudinal study with 16 blind and low-vision programmers. Participants completed a GitHub Copilot tutorial, engaged with a programming task, and provided initial feedback. After two weeks of AI-assisted programming, follow-ups examined how their practices and perceptions evolved. Our findings show that code assistants enhanced programming efficiency and bridged accessibility gaps. However, participants struggled to convey intent, interpret AI outputs, and manage multiple views while maintaining situational awareness. They showed diverse preferences for accessibility features, expressed a need to balance automation with control, and encountered barriers when learning to use these tools. Furthermore, we propose design principles and recommendations for more accessible and inclusive human-AI collaborations.</description>

      <title>Reframing Human-Robot Interaction Through Extended Reality: Unlocking Safer, Smarter, and More Empathic Interactions with Virtual Robots and Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This perspective reframes human-robot interaction (HRI) through extended reality (XR), arguing that virtual robots powered by large foundation models (FMs) can serve as cognitively grounded, empathic agents. Unlike physical robots, XR-native agents are unbound by hardware constraints and can be instantiated, adapted, and scaled on demand, while still affording embodiment and co-presence. We synthesize work across XR, HRI, and cognitive AI to show how such agents can support safety-critical scenarios, socially and cognitively empathic interaction across domains, and outreaching physical capabilities with XR and AI integration. We then discuss how multimodal large FMs (e.g., large language model, large vision model, and vision-language model) enable context-aware reasoning, affect-sensitive situations, and long-term adaptation, positioning virtual robots as cognitive and empathic mediators rather than mere simulation assets. At the same time, we highlight challenges and potential risks, including overtrust, cultural and representational bias, privacy concerns around biometric sensing, and data governance and transparency. The paper concludes by outlining a research agenda for human-centered, ethically grounded XR agents - emphasizing multi-layered evaluation frameworks, multi-user ecosystems, mixed virtual-physical embodiment, and societal and ethical design practices to envision XR-based virtual agents powered by FMs as reshaping future HRI into a more efficient and adaptive paradigm.</description>

      <title>Advancing Mathematical Research via Human-AI Interactive Theorem Proving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how large language models can be used as research tools in scientific computing while preserving mathematical rigor. We propose a human-in-the-loop workflow for interactive theorem proving and discovery with LLMs. Human experts retain control over problem formulation and admissible assumptions, while the model searches for proofs or contradictions, proposes candidate properties and theorems, and helps construct structures and parameters that satisfy explicit constraints, supported by numerical experiments and simple verification checks. Experts treat these outputs as raw material, further refine them, and organize the results into precise statements and rigorous proofs. We instantiate this workflow in a case study on the connection between manifold optimization and Grover's quantum search algorithm, where the pipeline helps identify invariant subspaces, explore Grover-compatible retractions, and obtain convergence guarantees for the retraction-based gradient method. The framework provides a practical template for integrating large language models into frontier mathematical research, enabling faster exploration of proof space and algorithm design while maintaining transparent reasoning responsibilities. Although illustrated on manifold optimization problems in quantum computing, the principles extend to other core areas of scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Hand Palm Motion Gesture Recognition by Eliminating Reference Frame Bias via Frame-Invariant Similarity Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability of robots to recognize human gestures facilitates a natural and accessible human-robot collaboration. However, most work in gesture recognition remains rooted in reference frame-dependent representations. This poses a challenge when reference frames vary due to different work cell layouts, imprecise frame calibrations, or other environmental changes. This paper investigated the use of invariant trajectory descriptors for robust hand palm motion gesture recognition under reference frame changes. First, a novel dataset of recorded Hand Palm Motion (HPM) gestures is introduced. The motion gestures in this dataset were specifically designed to be distinguishable without dependence on specific reference frames or directional cues. Afterwards, multiple invariant trajectory descriptor approaches were benchmarked to assess how their performances generalize to this novel HPM dataset. After this offline benchmarking, the best scoring approach is validated for online recognition by developing a real-time Proof of Concept (PoC). In this PoC, hand palm motion gestures were used to control the real-time movement of a manipulator arm. The PoC demonstrated a high recognition reliability in real-time operation, achieving an $F_1$-score of 92.3%. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the invariant descriptor approach as a standalone solution. Moreover, we believe that the invariant descriptor approach can also be utilized within other state-of-the-art pattern recognition and learning systems to improve their robustness against reference frame variations.</description>

      <title>JEEVHITAA -- An End-to-End HCAI System to Support Collective Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current mobile health platforms are predominantly individual-centric and lack the necessary primitives for coordinated, auditable, multi-actor workflows. However, in many settings worldwide, health decisions are enacted by multi-actor care networks rather than single users. We present JEEVHITAA, an Android/Flutter system that provides context-sensitive, role-aware sharing and verifiable information flows for care circles. JEEVHITAA ingests platform and device data (via Google Health Connect and BLE connectors), constructs multi-layer user profiles from sensor streams and tiered onboarding, and enforces fine-grained, time-bounded access control across permissioned care graphs. Data are end-to-end encrypted in local stores and during peer sync (Firebase), and provisions are made for document capture by camera or upload as PDF. An integrated retrieval-augmented LLM pipeline (i) produces structured, role-targeted summaries and action plans, (ii) enables users to gather advanced insights on health reports, and (iii) performs evidence-grounded user-relevant verification of arbitrary health content, returning provenance, confidence scores, and source citations. We describe the system architecture, connector abstractions, and security primitives, and evaluate robustness and compatibility using synthetic, ontology-driven simulations and vendor compatibility tests. Finally, we outline plans for longitudinal in-the-wild deployments to measure system performance, the correctness of access control, and the real-world effectiveness of relationship-aware credibility support.</description>
