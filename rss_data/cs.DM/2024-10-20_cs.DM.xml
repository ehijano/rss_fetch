      <title>Morse Sequences: A simple approach to discrete Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the notion of a Morse sequence, which provides an alternative approach to discrete Morse theory, and which is both simple and effective. A Morse sequence on a finite simplicial complex is a sequence composed solely of two elementary operations, that is, expansions (the inverse of a collapse), and fillings (the inverse of a perforation). In a dual manner, a Morse sequence may be obtained by considering only collapses and perforations. Such a sequence is another way to represent the gradient vector field of an arbitrary discrete Morse function. To each Morse sequence, we assign a reference map and an extension map. A reference map associates a set of critical simplexes to each simplex of a given complex, and an extension map associates a set of simplexes to each critical simplex. By considering the boundary of each critical simplex, we obtain a chain complex from these maps, which corresponds precisely to the Morse complex. We show that, when restricted to homology, an extension map is the inverse of a reference map. Also we show that these two maps allow us to recover directly the isomorphism theorem between the homology of an object and the homology of its Morse complex. At last, we introduce the notion of a flow complex, which is based solely on extension maps. We prove that this notion is equivalent to the classical one based on gradient flows.</description>

      <title>Planting and MCMC Sampling from the Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from the ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the random $d$-regular graph with parameter $\beta&gt;0$. A key difficulty that arises in sampling from the model is the existence of a metastability window $(\beta_u,\beta_u')$ where the distribution has two competing modes, the so-called disordered and ordered phases, causing MCMC-based algorithms to be slow mixing from worst-case initialisations.
  To this end, Helmuth, Jenssen and Perkins designed a sampling algorithm that works for all $\beta$ when $q$ is large, using cluster expansion methods; more recently, their analysis technique has been adapted to show that random-cluster dynamics mixes fast when initialised more judiciously. However, a bottleneck behind cluster-expansion arguments is that they inherently only work for large $q$, whereas it is widely conjectured that sampling is possible for all $q,d\geq 3$. The only result so far that applies to general $q,d\geq 3$ is by Blanca and Gheissari who showed that the random-cluster dynamics mixes fast for $\beta&lt;\beta_u$. For $\beta&gt;\beta_u$, certain correlation phenomena emerge because of the metastability which have been hard to handle, especially for small $q$ and $d$.
  Our main contribution is to perform a delicate analysis of the Potts distribution and the random-cluster dynamics that goes beyond the threshold $\beta_u$. We use planting as the main tool in our proofs, and combine it with the analysis of random-cluster dynamics. We are thus able to show that the random-cluster dynamics initialised from all-out mixes fast for all integers $q,d\geq 3$ beyond the uniqueness threshold $\beta_u$; our analysis works all the way up to the threshold $\beta_c\in (\beta_u,\beta_u')$ where the dominant mode switches from disordered to ordered. We also obtain an algorithm in the ordered regime $\beta&gt;\beta_c$ that refines significantly the range of $q,d$.</description>

      <title>An abstract structure determines the contextuality degree of observable-based Kochen-Specker proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article delves into the concept of quantum contextuality, specifically focusing on proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem obtained by assigning Pauli observables to hypergraph vertices satisfying a given commutation relation. The abstract structure composed of this hypergraph and the graph of anticommutations is named a hypergram. Its labelings with Pauli observables generalize the well-known magic sets. A first result is that all these quantum labelings satisfying the conditions of a given hypergram inherently possess the same degree of contextuality. Then we provide a necessary and sufficient algebraic condition for the existence of such quantum labelings and an efficient algorithm to find one of them. We finally attach to each assignable hypergram an abstract notion of contextuality degree. By presenting the study of observable-based Kochen-Specker proofs from the perspective of graphs and matrices, this abstraction opens the way to new methods to search for original contextual configurations.</description>

      <title>Nonadaptive Noisy Group Testing with Optimal Tests and Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Group Testing, the objective is to identify K defective items out of N, K&lt;&lt;N, by testing pools of items together and using the least amount of tests possible. In this paper, we propose a non-adaptive probabilistic group testing scheme in the presence of both false positives and false negatives in test outcomes. Our scheme simultaneously achieves the optimal asymptotic bound of O(KlogN) for both the number of tests and the decoding complexity of recovery with high probability, where O hides a constant that depends on the noisy channel. This result generalizes Price and Scarlett's group testing algorithm from the noiseless setting to the Binary Asymmetric Channel (BAC) and Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) settings, achieving both the optimal number of tests and decoding complexity, which was one of the main open problems of this line of research.</description>

      <title>A subquadratic certification scheme for P5-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In local certification, vertices of a $n$-vertex graph perform a local verification to check if a given property is satisfied by the graph. This verification is performed thanks to certificates, which are pieces of information that are given to the vertices. In this work, we focus on the local certification of $P_5$-freeness, and we prove a $O(n^{3/2})$ upper bound on the size of the certificates, which is (to our knowledge) the first subquadratic upper bound for this property.</description>

      <title>Certificates in P and Subquadratic-Time Computation of Radius, Diameter, and all Eccentricities in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.04660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of fine-grained complexity, we investigate the notion of certificate enabling faster polynomial-time algorithms. We specifically target radius (minimum eccentricity), diameter (maximum eccentricity), and all-eccentricity computations for which quadratic-time lower bounds are known under plausible conjectures. In each case, we introduce a notion of certificate as a specific set of nodes from which appropriate bounds on all eccentricities can be derived in subquadratic time when this set has sublinear size. The existence of small certificates is a barrier against SETH-based lower bounds for these problems. We indeed prove that for graph classes with small certificates, there exist randomized subquadratic-time algorithms for computing the radius, the diameter, and all eccentricities respectively.Moreover, these notions of certificates are tightly related to algorithms probing the graph through one-to-all distance queries and allow to explain the efficiency of practical radius and diameter algorithms from the literature. Our formalization enables a novel primal-dual analysis of a classical approach for diameter computation that leads to algorithms for radius, diameter and all eccentricities with theoretical guarantees with respect to certain graph parameters. This is complemented by experimental results on various types of real-world graphs showing that these parameters appear to be low in practice. Finally, we obtain refined results for several graph classes.</description>

      <title>Composable Constraint Models for Permutation Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constraint programming (CP) is a powerful tool for modeling mathematical concepts and objects and finding both solutions or counter examples. One of the major strengths of CP is that problems can easily be combined or expanded. In this paper, we illustrate that this versatility makes CP an ideal tool for exploring problems in permutation patterns.
  We declaratively define permutation properties, permutation pattern avoidance and containment constraints using CP and show how this allows us to solve a wide range of problems. We show how this approach enables the arbitrary composition of these conditions, and also allows the easy addition of extra conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques by modelling the containment and avoidance of six permutation patterns, eight permutation properties and measuring five statistics on the resulting permutations. In addition to calculating properties and statistics for the generated permutations, we show that arbitrary additional constraints can also be easily and efficiently added.
  This approach enables mathematicians to investigate permutation pattern problems in a quick and efficient manner. We demonstrate the utility of constraint programming for permutation patterns by showing how we can easily and efficiently extend the known permutation counts for a conjecture involving the class of $1324$ avoiding permutations. For this problem, we expand the enumeration of $1324$-avoiding permutations with a fixed number of inversions to permutations of length 16 and show for the first time that in the enumeration there is a pattern occurring which follows a unique sequence on the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.</description>

      <title>Partitioning a Planar Graph into two Triangle-Forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the vertices of every planar graph can be partitioned into two sets, each inducing a so-called triangle-forest, i.e., a graph with no cycles of length more than three. We further discuss extensions to locally planar graphs. After finishing the paper we noticed that our main result was already proved much earlier by Carsten Thomassen [Decomposing a Planar Graph into Degenerate Graphs, JCTB 1995].</description>

      <title>A logarithmic approximation of linearly-ordered colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19556v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A linearly ordered (LO) $k$-colouring of a hypergraph assigns to each vertex a colour from the set $\{0,1,\ldots,k-1\}$ in such a way that each hyperedge has a unique maximum element. Barto, Batistelli, and Berg conjectured that it is NP-hard to find an LO $k$-colouring of an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph for any constant $k\geq 2$ [STACS'21] but even the case $k=3$ is still open. Nakajima and \v{Z}ivn\'{y} gave polynomial-time algorithms for finding, given an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph, an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt{n})$ colours [ICALP'22] and an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt[3]{n})$ colours [ACM ToCT'23]. Very recently, Louis, Newman, and Ray gave an SDP-based algorithm with $O^*(\sqrt[5]{n})$ colours. We present two simple polynomial-time algorithms that find an LO colouring with $O(\log_2(n))$ colours, which is an exponential improvement.</description>

      <title>List strong and list normal edge-coloring of (sub)cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A strong edge-coloring of a graph is a proper edge-coloring, in which the edges of every path of length 3 receive distinct colors; in other words, every pair of edges at distance at most 2 must be colored differently. The least number of colors needed for a strong edge-coloring of a graph is the strong chromatic index. We consider the list version of the coloring and prove that the list strong chromatic index of graphs with maximum degree 3 is at most 10. This bound is tight and improves the previous bound of 11 colors.
  We also consider the question whether the strong chromatic index and the list strong chromatic index always coincide. We answer it in negative by presenting an infinite family of graphs for which the two invariants differ. For the special case of the Petersen graph, we show that its list strong chromatic index equals 7, while its strong chromatic index is 5. Up to our best knowledge, this is the first known edge-coloring for which there are graphs with distinct values of the chromatic index and its list version.
  In relation to the above, we also initiate the study of the list version of the normal edge-coloring. A normal edge-coloring of a cubic graph is a proper edge-coloring, in which every edge is adjacent to edges colored with 4 colors or to edges colored with 2 colors. It is conjectured that 5 colors suffice for a normal edge-coloring of any bridgeless cubic graph which is equivalent to the Petersen Coloring Conjecture.
  Similarly to the strong edge-coloring, the list normal edge-coloring is much more restrictive and consequently for many graphs the list normal chromatic index is greater than the normal chromatic index. In particular, we show that there are cubic graphs with the list normal chromatic index at least 9, there are bridgeless cubic graphs with its value at least 8, and there are cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graphs with value at least 7.</description>
