      <title>Learning Chaotic Dynamics with Embedded Dissipativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaotic dynamics, commonly seen in weather systems and fluid turbulence, are characterized by their sensitivity to initial conditions, which makes accurate prediction challenging. Despite its sensitivity to initial perturbations, many chaotic systems observe dissipative behaviors and ergodicity. Therefore, recently various approaches have been proposed to develop data-driven models preserving invariant statistics over long horizons. Although these methods have shown empirical success in reducing instances of unbounded trajectory generation, many of the models are still prone to generating unbounded trajectories, leading to invalid statistics evaluation. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture that simultaneously learns a dissipative dynamics emulator that guarantees to generate bounded trajectories and an energy-like function that governs the dissipative behavior. More specifically, by leveraging control-theoretic ideas, we derive algebraic conditions based on the learned energy-like function that ensure asymptotic convergence to an invariant level set. Using these algebraic conditions, our proposed model enforces dissipativity through a ReLU projection layer, which provides formal trajectory boundedness guarantees. Furthermore, the invariant level set provides an outer estimate for the strange attractor, which is known to be very difficult to characterize due to its complex geometry. We demonstrate the capability of our model in producing bounded long-horizon trajectory forecasts and characterizing the attractor for chaotic dynamical systems including Lorenz 96 and a truncated Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach for Optimal Cruise Airspeed with Variable Cost Index for Fuel-powered and All-electric Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes for the first time a unified optimal approach to solve a direct operating cost (DOC) minimization problem where the cost index (CI) is time-varying. More specifically, the coefficient CI is modeled as a time-varying parameter commanded by Air Traffic Control (ATC). The proposed unified approach relies on the solution of an optimal control problem both for fuel-powered and all-electric aircraft. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates how a variable CI affects the solution of the optimization problem as it presents the equations that allow the computation of optimal constant cruise airspeed and flight time in response to step changes in the CI value. The proposed methodology is validated by a simulated flight scenario. In this scenario the inputs from the ATC are received during flight and the aircraft is required to adjust its optimal airspeed, flight time, and total energy consumption to comply with the operational restrictions imposed by the ATC. The optimal values of airspeed, flight time and energy consumption are computed for both a fuel-powered and an all-electric aircraft, thus enabling applications of the proposed approach to future air mobility all-electric vehicles.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Modelling and Robust Observer Synthesis using the Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a robust nonlinear observer synthesis method for a population of systems modelled using the Koopman operator. The Koopman operator allows nonlinear systems to be rewritten as infinite-dimensional linear systems. A finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator can be identified directly from data, yielding an approximately linear model of a nonlinear system. The proposed observer synthesis method is made possible by this linearity that in turn allows uncertainty within a population of Koopman models to be quantified in the frequency domain. Using this uncertainty model, linear robust control techniques are used to synthesize robust nonlinear Koopman observers. A population of several dozen motor drives is used to experimentally demonstrate the proposed method. Manufacturing variation is characterized in the frequency domain, and a robust Koopman observer is synthesized using mixed $\mathcal{H}_2$-$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ optimal control.</description>

      <title>Development of a Platform to Enable Real Time, Non-disruptive Testing and Early Fault Detection of Critical High Voltage Transformers and Switchgears in High Speed-rail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial discharge (PD) incidents can occur in critical components of high-speed rail electric systems, such as transformers and switchgears, due to localized insulation defects that cannot withstand electric stress, leading to potential flashovers. These incidents can escalate over time, resulting in breakdowns, downtime, and safety risks. Fortunately, PD activities emit radio frequency (RF) signals, allowing for the development of a hardware platform for real-time, non-invasive PD detection and monitoring. The system uses an RF antenna and high-speed data acquisition to scan signals across a configurable frequency range (100MHz to 3GHz), utilizing intermediate frequency modulation and sliding frequency windows for detailed analysis. When signals exceed a threshold, the system records the events, capturing both raw signal data and spectrum snapshots. Real-time data is streamed to a cloud server, offering remote access through a dedicated smartphone application, enabling maintenance teams to monitor and respond promptly. Laboratory testing has confirmed the system's ability to accurately capture RF signals and provide real-time PD monitoring, enhancing the reliability and safety of high-speed rail infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Sparse Actuation for LPV Systems with Full-State Feedback in $\mathcal{H}_2/\mathcal{H}_\infty$ Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the sparse actuation problem for nonlinear systems represented in the Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) form. We propose a convex optimization framework that concurrently determines actuator magnitude limits and the state-feedback law that guarantees a user-specified closed-loop performance in the $\mathcal{H}_2/\mathcal{H}_\infty$ sense. We also demonstrate that sparse actuation is achieved when the actuator magnitude-limits are minimized in the $l_1$ sense. This is the first paper that addresses this problem for LPV systems. The formulation is demonstrated in a vibration control problem for a flexible wing.</description>

      <title>A Control Barrier Function Candidate for Limited Field of View Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of control based on vision measurements (bearings) has been amply studied in the literature; however, the problem of addressing the limits of the field of view of physical sensors has received relatively less attention (especially for agents with non-trivial dynamics). The technical challenge is that, as in most vision-based control approaches, a standard approach to the problem requires knowing the distance between cameras and observed features in the scene, which is not directly available. Instead, we present a solution based on a Control Barrier Function (CBF) approach that uses a splitting of the original differential constraint to effectively remove the dependence on the unknown measurement error. Compared to the current literature, our approach gives strong robustness guarantees against bounded distance estimation errors. We showcase the proposed solution with the numerical simulations of a double integrator and a quadrotor tracking a trajectory while keeping the corners of a rectangular gate in the camera field of view.</description>

      <title>Single versus Multi-Tone Wireless Power Transfer with Physically Large Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed beamforming is a key enabler to provide power wirelessly to a massive amount of energy-neutral devices (ENDs). However, without prior information and fully depleted ENDs, initially powering these devices efficiently is an open question. This work investigates and assesses the feasibility of harvesting sufficient energy to transmit a backscatter pilot signal from the END, which can be then used for coherent downlink transmission. We experimentally evaluated adaptive single-tone and multi-tone signals during initial charging. The results indicate that the response time for ENDs with unknown locations can extend to several tens of seconds. Notably, the adaptive single-tone excitation shows, among others, better performance at lower transmit power levels, providing a faster response. These findings underscore the potential of adaptive single-tone signals in optimizing power delivery to END in future networks.</description>

      <title>Detection and suppression of epileptiform seizures via model-free control and derivatives in a noisy environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in control theory yield closed-loop neurostimulations for suppressing epileptiform seizures. These advances are illustrated by computer experiments which are easy to implement and to tune. The feedback synthesis is provided by an intelligent proportional-derivative (iPD) regulator associated to model-free control. This approach has already been successfully exploited in many concrete situations in engineering, since no precise computational modeling is needed. iPDs permit tracking a large variety of signals including high-amplitude epileptic activity. Those unpredictable pathological brain oscillations should be detected in order to avoid continuous stimulation, which might induce detrimental side effects. This is achieved by introducing a data mining method based on the maxima of the recorded signals. The real-time derivative estimation in a particularly noisy epileptiform environment is made possible due to a newly developed algebraic differentiator. The virtual patient is the Wendling model, i.e., a set of ordinary differential equations adapted from the Jansen-Rit neural mass model in order to generate epileptiform activity via appropriate values of excitation- and inhibition-related parameters. Several simulations, which lead to a large variety of possible scenarios, are discussed. They show the robustness of our control synthesis with respect to different virtual patients and external disturbances.</description>

      <title>Min-Time Escape of a Dubins Car from a Polygon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A turn constrained vehicle is initially located inside a polygon region and desires to escape in minimum time. First, the method of characteristics is used to describe the time-optimal strategies for reaching a line of infinite length. Next, the approach is extended to polygons constructed of a series of line segments. Using this construction technique, the min-time path to reach each edge is obtained; the resulting minimum of the set of optimal trajectories is then selected for escaping the polygon.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Fractional Punishment in Optional Public Goods Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Punishment is probably the most frequently used mechanism to increase cooperation in Public Goods Games (PGG); however, it is expensive. To address this problem, this paper introduces an optimal control problem that uses fractional punishment to promote cooperation. We present a series of computational experiments illustrating the effects of single and combined terms of the optimization cost function. In the findings, the optimal controller outperforms the use of constant fractional punishment and gives an insight into the period and size of the penalization to be implemented with respect to the defection in the game.</description>

      <title>A Microgrid Deployment Framework to Support Drayage Electrification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrification of heavy-duty commercial vehicles (HDCVs) is pivotal in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution; however, this transition poses significant challenges for the existing electric grid, which is not designed to meet the high electricity demands of HDCVs. This can lead to a less effective reduction in freight transportation's carbon intensity despite significant electrification efforts. Deploying renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaics, alongside energy storage solutions, is essential to address these challenges. This paper examines the current grid limitations and explores the critical role of microgrid deployment, integrating solar and battery energy storage systems, in supporting the electrification of HDCVs. We propose an integrated framework that is designed to enhance regional grid capacity and decrease carbon intensity by identifying viable sites where a microgrid can be deployed and provide estimates for the deployment cost. Furthermore, using this framework, we quantify the maximal impact of microgrid deployment in reducing CO2 emissions when we optimize the use of the available power. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to the region of the Port of Savannah, GA USA.</description>

      <title>Effects of eco-driving on energy consumption and battery degradation for electric vehicles at signalized intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eco-driving has been shown to reduce energy consumption for electric vehicles (EVs). Such strategies can also be implemented to both reduce energy consumption and improve battery lifetime. This study considers the eco-driving of a connected electric vehicle equipped with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication passing through two signalized intersections. Dynamic programming is employed to construct an eco-driving algorithm that incorporates a battery degradation model in addition to minimizing energy consumption to optimize the vehicle's speed trajectory while transiting the control zone. A parametric study is conducted for various signal timings and distances between the two intersections. It is found that eco-driving can provide up to 49\% in cost benefits over regular driving due to energy savings and improved battery life which could boost consumers' interests on EVs. This study also considered different battery capacity decay rates based on battery chemistry. Although a higher decay rate affects the optimal speed trajectories only slightly, it amplifies the benefits of eco-driving on battery life. Two battery sizes were also studied to show that the larger battery is associated with a drastically increased lifetime, thus creating opportunities for electric vehicles in other applications such as vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration. Field tests were also conducted using a simplified rule-based version of the eco-driving algorithm implemented as a phone app which issues audio speed recommendations to the driver. The field test results were promising and validated the results from simulations. The phone app implementation is convenient and could facilitate broader adoption and widespread use of eco-driving which helps to improve transportation efficiency and protect the environment.</description>

      <title>Safe Autonomy for Uncrewed Surface Vehicles Using Adaptive Control and Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marine robots must maintain precise control and ensure safety during tasks like ocean monitoring, even when encountering unpredictable disturbances that affect performance. Designing algorithms for uncrewed surface vehicles (USVs) requires accounting for these disturbances to control the vehicle and ensure it avoids obstacles. While adaptive control has addressed USV control challenges, real-world applications are limited, and certifying USV safety amidst unexpected disturbances remains difficult. To tackle control issues, we employ a model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) to stabilize the USV along a desired trajectory. For safety certification, we developed a reachability module with a moving horizon estimator (MHE) to estimate disturbances affecting the USV. This estimate is propagated through a forward reachable set calculation, predicting future states and enabling real-time safety certification. We tested our safe autonomy pipeline on a Clearpath Heron USV in the Charles River, near MIT. Our experiments demonstrated that the USV's MRAC controller and reachability module could adapt to disturbances like thruster failures and drag forces. The MRAC controller outperformed a PID baseline, showing a 45%-81% reduction in RMSE position error. Additionally, the reachability module provided real-time safety certification, ensuring the USV's safety. We further validated our pipeline's effectiveness in underway replenishment and canal scenarios, simulating relevant marine tasks.</description>

      <title>Panopticus: Omnidirectional 3D Object Detection on Resource-constrained Edge Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D object detection with omnidirectional views enables safety-critical applications such as mobile robot navigation. Such applications increasingly operate on resource-constrained edge devices, facilitating reliable processing without privacy concerns or network delays. To enable cost-effective deployment, cameras have been widely adopted as a low-cost alternative to LiDAR sensors. However, the compute-intensive workload to achieve high performance of camera-based solutions remains challenging due to the computational limitations of edge devices. In this paper, we present Panopticus, a carefully designed system for omnidirectional and camera-based 3D detection on edge devices. Panopticus employs an adaptive multi-branch detection scheme that accounts for spatial complexities. To optimize the accuracy within latency limits, Panopticus dynamically adjusts the model's architecture and operations based on available edge resources and spatial characteristics. We implemented Panopticus on three edge devices and conducted experiments across real-world environments based on the public self-driving dataset and our mobile 360{\deg} camera dataset. Experiment results showed that Panopticus improves accuracy by 62% on average given the strict latency objective of 33ms. Also, Panopticus achieves a 2.1{\times} latency reduction on average compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>WiFi-CSI Sensing and Bearing Estimation in Multi-Robot Systems: An Open-Source Simulation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Development and testing of multi-robot systems employing wireless signal-based sensing requires access to suitable hardware, such as channel monitoring WiFi transceivers, which can pose significant limitations. The WiFi Sensor for Robotics (WSR) toolbox, introduced by Jadhav et al. in 2022, provides a novel solution by using WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) to compute relative bearing between robots. The toolbox leverages the amplitude and phase of WiFi signals and creates virtual antenna arrays by exploiting the motion of mobile robots, eliminating the need for physical antenna arrays. However, the WSR toolbox's reliance on an obsoleting WiFi transceiver hardware has limited its operability and accessibility, hindering broader application and development of relevant tools. We present an open-source simulation framework that replicates the WSR toolbox's capabilities using Gazebo and Matlab. By simulating WiFi-CSI data collection, our framework emulates the behavior of mobile robots equipped with the WSR toolbox, enabling precise bearing estimation without physical hardware. We validate the framework through experiments with both simulated and real Turtlebot3 robots, showing a close match between the obtained CSI data and the resulting bearing estimates. This work provides a virtual environment for developing and testing WiFi-CSI-based multi-robot localization without relying on physical hardware.

      <title>Multi-Robot Trajectory Generation via Consensus ADMM: Convex vs. Non-Convex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: C-ADMM is a well-known distributed optimization framework due to its guaranteed convergence in convex optimization problems. Recently, C-ADMM has been studied in robotics applications such as multi-vehicle target tracking and collaborative manipulation tasks. However, few works have investigated the performance of C-ADMM applied to non-convex problems in robotics applications due to a lack of theoretical guarantees. For this project, we aim to quantitatively explore and examine the convergence behavior of non-convex C-ADMM through the scope of distributed multi-robot trajectory planning. We propose a convex trajectory planning problem by leveraging C-ADMM and Buffered Voronoi Cells (BVCs) to get around the non-convex collision avoidance constraint and compare this convex C-ADMM algorithm to a non-convex C-ADMM baseline with non-convex collision avoidance constraints. We show that the convex C-ADMM algorithm requires 1000 fewer iterations to achieve convergence in a multi-robot waypoint navigation scenario. We also confirm that the non-convex C-ADMM baseline leads to sub-optimal solutions and violation of safety constraints in trajectory generation.</description>

      <title>On Continuous Full-Order Integral-Terminal Sliding Mode Control with Unknown A Priori Bound on Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims at providing a solution to the problem of designing a continuous and finite-time control for a class of nonlinear systems in the presence of matched uncertainty with an unknown apriori bound. First, we propose a Full-Order Integral-Terminal Sliding Manifold (FOITSM) with a conventional (discontinuous) sliding mode to show that it provides the combined attributes of the nonsingular terminal and integral sliding mode algorithms. Secondly, an Adaptive Disturbance Observer (ADO) has been designed to alleviate the effect of the uncertainty acting on the system. On application of the ADO-based Full-Order Integral-Terminal Sliding Mode Control (FOITSMC), the chattering phenomenon in control input has been reduced substantially in the presence of conditionally known matched disturbances. Moreover, the adaptive gains of ADO are updated non-monotonically without over-bounding the acting disturbance, yet sustain the global boundedness of state trajectories within a specific bound. %Finally, an application of the proposed algorithm for attitude stabilization of a rigid spacecraft has been successively shown.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lyapunov conditions for k-contraction: analysis and feedback design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the concept of k-contraction has been introduced as a promising generalization of contraction for dynamical systems. However, the study of k-contraction properties has faced significant challenges due to the reliance on complex mathematical objects called matrix compounds. As a result, related control design methodologies have yet to appear in the literature. In this paper, we overcome existing limitations and propose new sufficient conditions for k-contraction which do not require matrix compounds computation. Notably, these conditions are also necessary in the linear time-invariant framework. Leveraging on these findings, we propose a feedback design methodology for both the linear and the nonlinear scenarios which can be used to enforce k-contractivity properties on the closed-loop dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Sum Secrecy Rate Maximisation for Wireless Vehicular Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless communications form the backbone of future vehicular networks, playing a critical role in applications ranging from traffic control to vehicular road safety. However, the dynamic structure of these networks creates security vulnerabilities, making security considerations an integral part of network design. We address these security concerns from a physical layer security aspect by investigating achievable secrecy rates in wireless vehicular networks. Specifically, we aim to maximize the sum secrecy rate from all vehicular pairs subject to bandwidth and power resource constraints. For the considered problem, we first propose a solution based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) method, which has not been applied in this context before. To further reduce the complexity of the SCA-based method, we also propose a low-complexity solution based on a fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA). Our simulation results for SCA and FISTA show a trade-off between convergence and runtime. While the SCA method achieves better convergence, the FISTA-based approach is at least 300 times faster than the SCA method.</description>

      <title>Robust Data-EnablEd Predictive Leading Cruise Control via Reachability Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven predictive control promises model-free wave-dampening strategies for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic flow. However, its performance relies on data quality, which suffers from unknown noise and disturbances. This paper introduces a Robust Data-EnablEd Predictive Leading Cruise Control (RDeeP-LCC) method based on reachability analysis, aiming to achieve safe and optimal CAV control under bounded process noise and external disturbances. Precisely, the matrix zonotope set technique and Willems' Fundamental Lemma are employed to derive the over-approximated system dynamics directly from data, and a data-driven feedback control technique is utilized to obtain an additional feedback input for stability. We decouple the mixed platoon into an error system and a nominal system, where the error system provides data-driven reachability sets for the enhanced safety constraints in the nominal system. Finally, a data-driven predictive control framework is formulated in a tube-based control manner for robustness guarantees. Nonlinear simulations with noise-corrupted data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline methods in mitigating traffic waves.</description>

Abstract: This manuscript considers the problem of ensuring stability and safety during formation control with distributed multi-agent systems in the presence of parametric uncertainty in the dynamics and limited communication. We propose an integrative approach that combines Control Barrier Functions, Adaptive Control, and connected graphs. A reference model is designed so as to ensure a safe and stable formation control strategy. This is combined with a provably correct adaptive control design that includes the use of a CBF-based safety filter that suitably generates safe reference commands. Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical derivations.</description>

      <title>Loss of Control Prevention of an Agile Aircraft: Dynamic Command Saturation Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prevention of the loss of control in agile aircraft during the extreme maneuvers is of concern due to the nonlinear aerodynamics and flight dynamics nature of the aircraft in this study. Within this context, the primary objective is to present an architectural framework and elucidate the methodology for its determination. This architecture enables agile maneuvering aircraft to execute more extreme maneuvers while avoiding departure from stable flight, surpassing maneuverability capabilities of conventional state limiters. Hence, the notion of an incremental attainable moment set is introduced for an instantaneous controllability investigation using demanded control moment coefficients derived in the high-level controller, which is the incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion. In the event of detecting a violation of controllability boundaries, Lyapunov-based dynamic command saturation is employed to limit pilot commands, preventing the aircraft from initiating departure from stable flight. As a result, abrupt and excessive pilot inputs are dynamically softened in-flight, and presumable departure tendencies are mitigated. Consequently, the superiority of the proposed method over conventional state limiters is proven through the flight simulations of agile and abrupt maneuvers, as well as Monte Carlo simulations that demonstrate the expansion of stable maneuverable volumes up to 55%.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop Diffusion Control of Complex Physical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control problems of complex physical systems have broad applications in science and engineering. Previous studies have shown that generative control methods based on diffusion models offer significant advantages for solving these problems. However, existing generative control approaches face challenges in both performance and efficiency when extended to the closed-loop setting, which is essential for effective control. In this paper, we propose an efficient Closed-Loop Diffusion method for Physical systems Control (CL-DiffPhyCon). By employing an asynchronous denoising framework for different physical time steps, CL-DiffPhyCon generates control signals conditioned on real-time feedback from the environment with significantly reduced computational cost during sampling. Additionally, the control process could be further accelerated by incorporating fast sampling techniques, such as DDIM. We evaluate CL-DiffPhyCon on two tasks: 1D Burgers' equation control and 2D incompressible fluid control. The results demonstrate that CL-DiffPhyCon achieves superior control performance with significant improvements in sampling efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the challenge of safe control in decentralized multi-agent robotic settings, where agents use uncertain black-box models to predict other agents' trajectories. We use the recently proposed conformal decision theory to adapt the restrictiveness of control barrier functions-based safety constraints based on observed prediction errors. We use these constraints to synthesize controllers that balance between the objectives of safety and task accomplishment, despite the prediction errors. We provide an upper bound on the average over time of the value of a monotonic function of the difference between the safety constraint based on the predicted trajectories and the constraint based on the ground truth ones. We validate our theory through experimental results showing the performance of our controllers when navigating a robot in the multi-agent scenes in the Stanford Drone Dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network-based complex systems are inherently interconnected, with the design and performance of subnetworks being interdependent. However, the decisions of self-interested operators may lead to suboptimal outcomes for users. In this paper, we consider the question of what cooperative mechanisms can benefit both operators and users simultaneously. We address this question in a game theoretical setting, integrating both non-cooperative and cooperative game theory. During the non-cooperative stage, subnetwork decision-makers strategically design their local networks. In the cooperative stage, the co-investment mechanism and the payoff-sharing mechanism are developed to enlarge collective benefits and fairly distribute them. A case study of the Sioux Falls network is conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework. The impact of this interactive network design on environmental sustainability, social welfare and economic efficiency is evaluated, along with an examination of scenarios involving regions with heterogeneous characteristics.</description>

      <title>Auction designs to increase incentive compatibility and reduce self-scheduling in electricity markets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The system operator's scheduling problem in electricity markets, called unit commitment, is a non-convex mixed-integer program. The optimal value function is non-convex, preventing the application of traditional marginal pricing theory to find prices that clear the market and incentivize market participants to follow the dispatch schedule. Units that perceive the opportunity to make a profit may be incentivized to self-commit (submitting an offer with zero fixed operating costs) or self-schedule their production (submitting an offer with zero total cost). We simulate bidder behavior to show that market power can be exercised by self-committing/scheduling. Agents can learn to increase their profits via a reinforcement learning algorithm without explicit knowledge of the costs or strategies of other agents. We investigate different non-convex pricing models over a multi-period commitment window simulating the day-ahead market and show that convex hull pricing can reduce producer incentives to deviate from the central dispatch decision. In a realistic test system with approximately 1000 generators, we find strategic bidding under the restricted convex model can increase total producer profits by 4.4\% and decrease lost opportunity costs by 2/3. While the cost to consumers with convex hull pricing is higher at the competitive solution, the cost to consumers is higher with the restricted convex model after strategic bidding.</description>

      <title>Controllable Preference Optimization: Toward Controllable Multi-Objective Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alignment in artificial intelligence pursues the consistency between model responses and human preferences as well as values. In practice, the multifaceted nature of human preferences inadvertently introduces what is known as the "alignment tax" -a compromise where enhancements in alignment within one objective (e.g.,harmlessness) can diminish performance in others (e.g.,helpfulness). However, existing alignment techniques are mostly unidirectional, leading to suboptimal trade-offs and poor flexibility over various objectives. To navigate this challenge, we argue the prominence of grounding LLMs with evident preferences. We introduce controllable preference optimization (CPO), which explicitly specifies preference scores for different objectives, thereby guiding the model to generate responses that meet the requirements. Our experimental analysis reveals that the aligned models can provide responses that match various preferences among the "3H" (helpfulness, honesty, harmlessness) desiderata. Furthermore, by introducing diverse data and alignment goals, we surpass baseline methods in aligning with single objectives, hence mitigating the impact of the alignment tax and achieving Pareto improvements in multi-objective alignment.</description>

      <title>Sensory Glove-Based Surgical Robot User Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic surgery has reached a high level of maturity and has become an integral part of standard surgical care. However, existing surgeon consoles are bulky, take up valuable space in the operating room, make surgical team coordination challenging, and their proprietary nature makes it difficult to take advantage of recent technological advances, especially in virtual and augmented reality. One potential area for further improvement is the integration of modern sensory gloves into robotic platforms, allowing surgeons to control robotic arms intuitively with their hand movements. We propose one such system that combines an HTC Vive tracker, a Manus Meta Prime 3 XR sensory glove, and SCOPEYE wireless smart glasses. The system controls one arm of a da Vinci surgical robot. In addition to moving the arm, the surgeon can use fingers to control the end-effector of the surgical instrument. Hand gestures are used to implement clutching and similar functions. In particular, we introduce clutching of the instrument orientation, a functionality unavailable in the da Vinci system. The vibrotactile elements of the glove are used to provide feedback to the user when gesture commands are invoked. A qualitative and quantitative evaluation has been conducted that compares the current device with the dVRK console. The system is shown to have excellent tracking accuracy, and the new interface allows surgeons to perform common surgical training tasks with minimal practice efficiently.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Zero-Shot Scalable Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is significantly transforming various fields like autonomous vehicle networks. However, real-world multi-agent systems typically contain multiple roles, and the scale of these systems dynamically fluctuates. Consequently, in order to achieve zero-shot scalable collaboration, it is essential that strategies for different roles can be updated flexibly according to the scales, which is still a challenge for current MARL frameworks. To address this, we propose a novel MARL framework named Scalable and Heterogeneous Proximal Policy Optimization (SHPPO), integrating heterogeneity into parameter-shared PPO-based MARL networks. We first leverage a latent network to learn strategy patterns for each agent adaptively. Second, we introduce a heterogeneous layer to be inserted into decision-making networks, whose parameters are specifically generated by the learned latent variables. Our approach is scalable as all the parameters are shared except for the heterogeneous layer, and gains both inter-individual and temporal heterogeneity, allowing SHPPO to adapt effectively to varying scales. SHPPO exhibits superior performance in classic MARL environments like Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) and Google Research Football (GRF), showcasing enhanced zero-shot scalability, and offering insights into the learned latent variables' impact on team performance by visualization.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Optimization in Time-Varying Networks with Arbitrary Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a decentralized optimization problem for networks affected by communication delays. Examples of such networks include collaborative machine learning, sensor networks, and multi-agent systems. To mimic communication delays, we add virtual non-computing nodes to the network, resulting in directed graphs. This motivates investigating decentralized optimization solutions on directed graphs. Existing solutions assume nodes know their out-degrees, resulting in limited applicability. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel gossip-based algorithm, called DT-GO, that does not need to know the out-degrees. The algorithm is applicable in general directed networks, for example networks with delays or limited acknowledgment capabilities. We derive convergence rates for both convex and non-convex objectives, showing that our algorithm achieves the same complexity order as centralized Stochastic Gradient Descent. In other words, the effects of the graph topology and delays are confined to higher-order terms. Additionally, we extend our analysis to accommodate time-varying network topologies. Numerical simulations are provided to support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>SysCaps: Language Interfaces for Simulation Surrogates of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surrogate models are used to predict the behavior of complex energy systems that are too expensive to simulate with traditional numerical methods. Our work introduces the use of language descriptions, which we call "system captions" or SysCaps, to interface with such surrogates. We argue that interacting with surrogates through text, particularly natural language, makes these models more accessible for both experts and non-experts. We introduce a lightweight multimodal text and timeseries regression model and a training pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality captions from simulation metadata. Our experiments on two real-world simulators of buildings and wind farms show that our SysCaps-augmented surrogates have better accuracy on held-out systems than traditional methods while enjoying new generalization abilities, such as handling semantically related descriptions of the same test system. Additional experiments also highlight the potential of SysCaps to unlock language-driven design space exploration and to regularize training through prompt augmentation.</description>

      <title>Ca{\Sigma}oS: A nonlinear sum-of-squares optimization suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Ca$\Sigma$oS, the first MATLAB software specifically designed for nonlinear sum-of-squares optimization. A symbolic polynomial algebra system allows to formulate parametrized sum-of-squares optimization problems and facilitates their fast, repeated evaluations. To that extent, we make use of CasADi's symbolic framework and realize concepts of monomial sparsity, linear operators (including duals), and functions between polynomials. Ca$\Sigma$oS currently provides interfaces to the conic solvers SeDuMi, Mosek, and SCS as well as methods to solve quasiconvex optimization problems (via bisection) and nonconvex optimization problems (via sequential convexification). Numerical examples for benchmark problems including region-of-attraction and reachable set estimation for nonlinear dynamic systems demonstrate significant improvements in computation time compared to existing toolboxes. Ca$\Sigma$oS is available open-source at https://github.com/ifr-acso/casos.</description>

      <title>Learning from Demonstration with Implicit Nonlinear Dynamics Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a useful paradigm for training policies that solve tasks involving complex motions, such as those encountered in robotic manipulation. In practice, the successful application of LfD requires overcoming error accumulation during policy execution, i.e. the problem of drift due to errors compounding over time and the consequent out-of-distribution behaviours. Existing works seek to address this problem through scaling data collection, correcting policy errors with a human-in-the-loop, temporally ensembling policy predictions or through learning a dynamical system model with convergence guarantees. In this work, we propose and validate an alternative approach to overcoming this issue. Inspired by reservoir computing, we develop a recurrent neural network layer that includes a fixed nonlinear dynamical system with tunable dynamical properties for modelling temporal dynamics. We validate the efficacy of our neural network layer on the task of reproducing human handwriting motions using the LASA Human Handwriting Dataset. Through empirical experiments we demonstrate that incorporating our layer into existing neural network architectures addresses the issue of compounding errors in LfD. Furthermore, we perform a comparative evaluation against existing approaches including a temporal ensemble of policy predictions and an Echo State Network (ESN) implementation. We find that our approach yields greater policy precision and robustness on the handwriting task while also generalising to multiple dynamics regimes and maintaining competitive latency scores.</description>

      <title>A Parallel-in-Time Newton's Method for Nonlinear Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful framework for optimal control of dynamical systems. However, MPC solvers suffer from a high computational burden that restricts their application to systems with low sampling frequency. This issue is further amplified in nonlinear and constrained systems that require nesting MPC solvers within iterative procedures. In this paper, we address these issues by developing parallel-in-time algorithms for constrained nonlinear optimization problems that take advantage of massively parallel hardware to achieve logarithmic computational time scaling over the planning horizon. We develop time-parallel second-order solvers based on interior point methods and the alternating direction method of multipliers, leveraging fast convergence and lower computational cost per iteration. The parallelization is based on a reformulation of the subproblems in terms of associative operations that can be parallelized using the associative scan algorithm. We validate our approach on numerical examples of nonlinear and constrained dynamical systems.</description>
