      <title>Holographic CFT phase transitions for 4-D Dyonic AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we investigate the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics of four dimensional charged dyonic AdS black holes. By considering the changes in the cosmological constant and Newton's constant, the gravitational thermodynamics of AdS black holes can be extended. This corresponds to including the central charge $C$ and its chemical potential $\mu$ to the conventional pairs of temperature vs. entropy $(T, S)$, electric potential vs. charge $(\tilde{\Phi},\tilde{Q})$, and field theory pressure vs. volume $(p,\mathcal{V})$ as a new pair of conjugate thermodynamic variables in the dual CFT. Here we have dived further and introduced an extra potential and charge making it a dyonic system. So the conventional pairs for potential and charges become electric potential and charge $(\tilde{\Phi}_e,\tilde{Q}_e)$ and magnetic potential and charge $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_m)$. In all the 16 ensembles that we examined, we found that only some have interesting phase behavior. For ensembles $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$, $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_e \mathcal{V}, C )$ and $(\tilde{Q}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$ we notice a first and second order phase transition. For the ensemble $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{\Phi}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$ we see a confined/deconfined phase transition. At a temperature that depends on $\mu$, we discover a zeroth-order phase transition between a high- and low-entropy phase in the fixed $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, \mu )$, $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_e \mathcal{V}, \mu )$, $(\tilde{Q}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, \mu )$. Since in our study of the parametric plots, the fixed eight $p$ ensembles exhibit no critical behavior, or $p-\mathcal{V}$ criticality, the CFT state dual to a classical charged black hole cannot be a Van der Waals fluid.</description>

      <title>Generation of circular polarization of CMB due to the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the dominant contribution of primordial anisotropies of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is linearly polarized via Compton scattering. However circular polarization of this anisotropy has not been observed up to now, but it has not been excluded in observational evidence. Here we show that the Euler-Heisenberg Effective Lagrangian can generate circular polarization in CMB. This generation is calculated by using the Quantum Boltzmann Equation for the time evolution of the Stokes parameter. Also, we estimate the Faraday conversion phase in order of $10^{-13} $ due to this Lagrangian which gives a lower bound on circular polarization of CMB.</description>

      <title>Chaos and integrability in triangular billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize quantum dynamics in triangular billiards in terms of five properties: (1) the level spacing ratio (LSR), (2) spectral complexity (SC), (3) Lanczos coefficient variance, (4) energy eigenstate localisation in the Krylov basis, and (5) dynamical growth of spread complexity. The billiards we study are classified as integrable, pseudointegrable or non-integrable, depending on their internal angles which determine properties of classical trajectories and associated quantum spectral statistics. A consistent picture emerges when transitioning from integrable to non-integrable triangles: (1) LSRs increase; (2) spectral complexity growth slows down; (3) Lanczos coefficient variances decrease; (4) energy eigenstates delocalize in the Krylov basis; and (5) spread complexity increases, displaying a peak prior to a plateau instead of recurrences. Pseudo-integrable triangles deviate by a small amount in these charactertistics from non-integrable ones, which in turn approximate models from the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). Isosceles pseudointegrable and non-integrable triangles have independent sectors that are symmetric and antisymmetric under a reflection symmetry. These sectors separately reproduce characteristics of the GOE, even though the combined system approximates characteristics expected from integrable theories with Poisson distributed spectra.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos in Liouville CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast scrambling is a distinctive feature of quantum gravity, which by means of holography is closely tied to the behaviour of large$-c$ conformal field theories. We study this phenomenon in the context of semiclassical Liouville theory, providing both insights into the mechanism of scrambling in CFTs and into the structure of Liouville theory, finding that it exhibits a maximal Lyapunov exponent despite not featuring the identity in its spectrum. However, as we show, the states contributing to the relevant correlation function can be thought of as dressed scramblons. At a technical level we we first use the path integral picture in order to derive the Euclidean four-point function in an explicit compact form. Next, we demonstrate its equivalence to a conformal block expansion, revealing an explicit but non-local map between path integral saddles and conformal blocks. By analytically continuing both expressions to Lorentzian times, we obtain two equivalent formulations of the OTOC, which we use to study the onset of chaos in Liouville theory. We take advantage of the compact form in order to extract a Lyapunov exponent and a scrambling time. From the conformal block expansion formulation of the OTOC we learn that scrambling shifts the dominance of conformal blocks from heavy primaries at early times to the lightest primary at late times. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of holography.</description>

      <title>S-confinement of 3d Argyres-Douglas theories and the Seiberg-like duality with an adjoint matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an $\mathcal{N}=2$ preserving deformation that leads to the confining phase of the 3d reduction of the $D_p[SU(N)]$ Argyres-Douglas theories, referred to as $\mathbb{D}_p[SU(N)]$. This deformation incorporates monopole superpotential terms, which have recently played interesting roles in exploring possible RG fixed points of 3d supersymmetric gauge theories. Employing this confining phenomenon in 3d $\mathbb{D}_p[SU(N)]$ theories, we also propose a deconfined version of the Kim-Park duality, an IR duality for 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ adjoint SQCDs, where an adjoint matter field is replaced by a linear quiver tail of $\mathbb{D}_p[SU(N)]$. Surprisingly, both the confinement of deformed $\mathbb{D}_p[SU(N)]$ and the deconfined Kim-Park duality can be proven only assuming some basic 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ IR dualities. Finally, we propose a variant of the Kim-Park duality deformed by a single monopole superpotential term, which can also be derived using the same method.</description>

      <title>Quantum Null Geometry and Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that quantizing gravity on a null hypersurface leads to the emergence of a CFT associated with each null ray. This result stems from the ultralocal nature of null physics and is derived through a canonical analysis of the Raychaudhuri equation, interpreted as a constraint generating null time reparametrizations. The CFT exhibits a non-zero central charge, providing a mechanism for the quantum emergence of time in gravitational systems and an associated choice of vacuum state. Our analysis reveals that the central charge quantifies the degrees of freedom along each null ray. Throughout our investigation, the area element of a cut plays a crucial role, necessitating its treatment as a quantum operator due to its dynamic nature in phase space or because of quantum backreaction. Furthermore, we show that the total central charge diverges in a perturbative analysis due to the infinite number of null generators. This divergence is resolved if there is a discrete spectrum for the area form operator. We introduce the concept of `embadons' to denote these localized geometric units of area, the fundamental building blocks of geometry at a mesoscopic quantum gravity scale.</description>

      <title>Deconfinements, Kutasov-Schwimmer dualities and $D_p[SU(N)]$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kutasov-Schwimmer (KS) dualities involve a rank-$2$ field with a polynomial superpotential. We derive KS-like dualities via deconfinement, that is assuming only Seiberg-like dualities, which instead just involve fundamental matter. Our derivation is split into two main steps. The first step is the construction of two families of linear quivers with $p\!-\!1$ nodes that confine into a rank-$2$ chiral field with degree-$(p\!+\!1)$ superpotential. Such chiral field is an $U(N)$ adjoint in 3d and an $USp(2N)$ antisymmetric in 4d. In the second step we use these linear quivers to derive, via deconfinement, in a relatively straightforward fashion, two classes of KS-like dualities: the Kim-Park duality for $U(N)$ with adjoint in 3d and the Intriligator duality for $USp(2N)$ with antisymmetric in 4d. We also discuss the close relation of our 3d family of confining unitary quivers to the 4d $\mathcal{N}\!=\!2$ $D_p[SU(N)]$ SCFTs by circle compactification and various deformations.</description>

      <title>Global conformal symmetry in scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a subclass of Horndeski gravity which has both global conformal and shift symmetries. Global symmetries are characterised by the presence of a conserved current which has been shown to be of particular importance for the integrability features of the theory at hand yielding numerous compact object solutions. We find the general conserved current associated to global conformal symmetry of Horndeski theories. We discuss some of its properties, how it can be conveniently broken by physically relevant terms and, show how it is related to that of shift symmetry when shift symmetry is present. Given our results, we consider a particular theory and demonstrate how the presence of symmetries provides integrability for the given black hole solution. We then find the charged extension of the solution thanks to the conformal invariance of the Maxwell action.</description>

      <title>A New Non-Renormalization Theorem from UV/IR Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a new non-renormalization theorem which arises from UV/IR mixing. This theorem and its corollaries are relevant for all four-dimensional tachyon-free closed string theories which can be realized from higher-dimensional theories via geometric compactifications. As such, they therefore apply regardless of the presence or absence of spacetime supersymmetry and regardless of the gauge symmetries or matter content involved. This theorem resolves a hidden clash between modular invariance and the process of decompactification, and enables us to uncover a number of surprising phenomenological properties of these theories. Chief among these is the fact that certain physical quantities within such theories cannot exhibit logarithmic or power-law running and instead enter an effective fixed-point regime above the compactification scale. This cessation of running occurs as the result of the UV/IR mixing inherent in the theory. These effects apply not only for gauge couplings but also for the Higgs mass and other quantities of phenomenological interest, thereby eliminating the logarithmic and/or power-law running that might have otherwise appeared for such quantities. These results illustrate the power of UV/IR mixing to tame divergences -- even without supersymmetry -- and reinforce the notion that UV/IR mixing may play a vital role in resolving hierarchy problems without supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Seiberg-Witten curves of $\widehat{D}$-type Little Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little Strings are a type of non-gravitational quantum theories that contain extended degrees of freedom, but behave like ordinary Quantum Field Theories at low energies. A particular class of such theories in six dimensions is engineered as the world-volume theory of an M5-brane on a circle that probes a transverse orbifold geometry. Its low energy limit is a supersymmetric gauge theory that is described by a quiver in the shape of the Dynkin diagram of the affine extension of an ADE-group. While the so-called $\widehat{A}$-type Little String Theories (LSTs) are very well studied, much less is known about the $\widehat{D}$-type, where for example the Seiberg-Witten curve (SWC) is only known in the case of the $\widehat{D}_4$ theory. In this work, we provide a general construction of this curve for arbitrary $\widehat{D}_{M}$ that respects all symmetries and dualities of the LST and is compatible with lower-dimensional results in the literature. For $M=4$ our construction reproduces the same curve as previously obtained by other methods. The form in which we cast the SWC for generic $\widehat{D}_M$ allows to study the behaviour of the LST under modular transformations and provides insights into a dual formulation as a circular quiver gauge theory with nodes of $Sp(M-4)$ and $SO(2M)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the frequency ratios $\tau\equiv \omega_z/\omega_{\rho}$ for which the Hamiltonian system with a potential \[ V=\frac{1}{r}+\frac{1}{2}\Big({\omega_{\rho}}^2(x^2+y^2)+{\omega_z}^2 z^2\Big) \] is completely integrable. We relate this result to the existence of conformal Killing tensors of the associated Eisenhart metric on $\mathbb{R}^{1, 4}$. Finally we show that trajectories of a particle moving under the influence of the potential $V$ are not unparametrised geodesics of any Riemannian metric on $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally dominated instantons and instability of dS, AdS and Minkowski spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decay of the false vacuum in the regime where the quantum field theory analysis is not valid, since gravitational effects become important. This happens when the height of the barrier separating the false and the true vacuum is large, and it has implications for the instability of de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua. We carry out the calculations for a scalar field with a potential coupled to gravity, and work within the thin-wall approximation, where the bubble wall is thin compared to the size of the bubble. We show that the false de Sitter vacuum is unstable, independently of the height of the potential and the relative depth of the true vacuum compared to the false vacuum. The false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua can be stable despite the existence of a lower energy true vacuum. However, when the relative depth of the true and false vacua exceeds a critical value, which depends on the potential of the false vacuum and the height of the barrier, then the false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua become unstable. We calculate the probability for the decay of the false de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua, as a function of the parameters characterizing the field potential.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric localization and non-conformal $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM theories in the perturbative regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the relation between supersymmetric localization on $\mathbb{S}^4$ and standard QFT results for non-conformal theories in flat space. Specifically, we consider 1/2 BPS circular Wilson loops in four-dimensional SU($N$) $\mathcal{N}$= 2 SYM theories with massless hypermultiplets in an arbitrary representation $\mathcal{R}$ such that the $\beta$-function is non-vanishing. On $\mathbb{S}^4$, localization maps this observable into an interacting matrix model. Although conformal symmetry is broken at the quantum level, we show that within a specific regime of validity the matrix model predictions are consistent with perturbation theory in flat space up to order $g^6$. In particular, at this order, localization predicts two classes of corrections proportional to $\zeta(3)$ whose diagrammatic origins in field theory are remarkably different. One class of $\zeta(3)$-like corrections emerges via interference effects between evanescent terms and the ultraviolet (UV) poles associated with the bare coupling constant, while the second one stems from a Feynman integral which retains the same form in flat space and on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Black hole solutions in double field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study black hole solutions in double field theory. In the first part, we introduce a solution-generating method and classify black hole solutions into three categories in standard double field theory. To solve the problem of double time, we utilize space/time split double field theory in the second part to derive black hole solutions. By introducing a cosmological constant and imposing the strong constraint, our findings indicate that when considering the entire doubled spacetime, the curvature signifies an AdS vacuum. However, in the subspace of the entire spacetime, black holes and curvature singularities emerge.</description>

      <title>Fay identities for polylogarithms on higher-genus Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent construction of polylogarithms on Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus in arXiv:2306.08644 is based on a flat connection assembled from single-valued non-holomorphic integration kernels that depend on two points on the Riemann surface. In this work, we construct and prove infinite families of bilinear relations among these integration kernels that are necessary for the closure of the space of higher-genus polylogarithms under integration over the points on the surface. Our bilinear relations generalize the Fay identities among the genus-one Kronecker-Eisenstein kernels to arbitrary genus. The multiple-valued meromorphic kernels in the flat connection of Enriquez are conjectured to obey higher-genus Fay identities of exactly the same form as their single-valued non-holomorphic counterparts. We initiate the applications of Fay identities to derive functional relations among higher-genus polylogarithms involving either single-valued or meromorphic integration kernels.</description>

      <title>Holographic Lifshitz flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Without Lorentz symmetry, generic fixed points of the renormalization group (RG) are labelled by their dynamical (or `Lifshitz') exponent $z$. Hence, a rich variety of possible RG flows arises. The first example is already given by the standard non-relativistic limit, which can be viewed as the flow from a $z=1$ UV fixed point to a $z=2$ IR fixed point. In strongly coupled theories, there are good arguments suggesting that Lorentz invariance can emerge dynamically in the IR from a Lorentz violating UV. In this work, we perform a generic study of fixed points and the possible RG flows among them in a minimal bottom-up holographic model without Lorentz invariance, aiming to shed light on the possible options and the related phenomenology. We find: i) A minor generalization of previous models involving a massive vector field with allowed self-couplings leads to a much more efficient emergence of Lorentz invariance than in the previous attempts. Moreover, we find that generically the larger is the UV dynamical exponent $z_{UV}$ the faster is the recovery of Lorentz symmetry in the IR. ii) We construct explicitly a holographic model with a line of fixed points, realizing different Lifshitz scaling along the line. iii) We also confirm the monotonicity of a recently proposed a-function along all our Lorentz violating RG flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the universal AdS$_{4}$ black hole that asymptotes to the $(\varphi,\chi)$-family of type IIB S-fold backgrounds dual to the conformal manifold of $\mathcal{N}=2$ S-fold CFT's. We present the explicit type IIB embedding of such a universal black hole for two particular asymptotics: the $\,\mathcal{N}=2\,$ S-fold with $\,\textrm{U}(2)\,$ symmetry at $\,(\varphi,\chi)=(0,0)\,$ and the $\,\mathcal{N}=4\,$ S-fold with $\,\textrm{SO}(4)\,$ symmetry at $\,(\varphi,\chi)=(1,0)$. As a byproduct, we also present a novel $1/16$-BPS two-parameter family of $\,\textrm{AdS}_{2} \times \textrm{M}_{8}\,$ S-fold backgrounds with $\,\textrm{M}_{8}=\mathbb{H}^{2} \times \textrm{S}^{5} \times \textrm{S}^{1}$ that features a parametrically-controlled scale separation.</description>

      <title>T-Duality and $T \overline{T}$-like Deformations of Sigma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the interplay between T-duality and classical stress tensor deformations in two-dimensional sigma models. We first show that a general Abelian T-duality commutes with the $T \overline{T}$ deformation, which can be engineered by a gravitational dressing. Then, by using an auxiliary field formulation of stress tensor deformations of the principal chiral model (PCM), we prove that non-Abelian T-duality and arbitrary $T \overline{T}$-like flows also commute for theories in this class. We argue that all such auxiliary field deformations of both the PCM and its T-dual are classically integrable.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Casimir Energy in Horava-Lifshitz Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the violation of Lorentz symmetry through the Casimir effect. The Casimir effect is one of the most intriguing aspects of modern physics, representing a macroscopic quantum-origin force between two neutral conducting surfaces, and it stands as a triumph of Quantum Field Theory. Here, we examine the Casimir effects associated with a massive fermionic quantum field confined in the region between two large and parallel plates within the Horava-Lifshitz framework of Lorentz symmetry violation. To calculate the Casimir energy and consequently the Casimir pressure, we impose a MIT bag boundary condition on two plates, compatible with the higher-order derivative term in the modified Dirac equation. Our results indicate a strong influence of Lorentz violation on the Casimir effect. We observe that the Casimir energy is affected, both in intensity and sign, potentially exhibiting repulsive or attractive force between the plates, depending on the critical exponent associated with the Horava-Lifshitz formalism.</description>

      <title>Towards massive field-theory amplitudes from the cohomology of pure spinor superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analogy with the formula for the massless string disk amplitudes, we define massive field-theory tree amplitudes and conjecture that the BRST cohomology structure of pure spinor superspace fixes their form. We give evidence by deriving the pure spinor superspace expression of the massive field-theory n-point tree amplitude with one first-level massive and n-1 massless states in two ways: 1) from BRST cohomology arguments in pure spinor superspace and 2) from the ${\alpha^\prime}^2$ correction to the massless string amplitudes by inverting the unitarity constraint in superspace.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a realisation of partially-massless higher spin algebras in four dimensions in terms of bosonic and fermionic oscillators, using Howe duality between $sp(4,\mathbb R) \cong so(2,3)$ and $osp(1|2(\ell-1), \mathbb R)$. More precisely, we show that the centraliser of $osp(1|2(\ell-1),\mathbb R)$ in the Weyl--Clifford algebra generated by $4$ bosonic and $8(\ell-1)$ fermionic symbols, modulo $osp(1|2(\ell-1),\mathbb R)$ generators, is isomorphic to the higher spin algebra of the type-A$_\ell$ theory whose spectrum contains partially-massless fields of all spins and depths $t=1,3,\dots,2\ell-1$. We also discuss the possible existence of a deformation of this algebra, which would encode interaction for the type-A$_\ell$ theory.</description>

      <title>Holographic QCD Running Coupling for Light Quarks in Strong Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider running coupling constant in holographic model with external magnetic field supported by Einstein-dilaton-three-Maxwell action. We obtain a significant dependence of the running coupling constant $\alpha$ on chemical potential, temperature and magnetic field. We use the boundary condition that ensures the agreement with lattice calculations of string tension between quarks at zero chemical potential. The location of the 1-st order phase transitions in $(\mu, T)$-plane does not depend on the dilaton boundary conditions. We observe that running coupling $\alpha$ decreases with increasing magnetic field for the fixed values of chemical potential and temperature. At the 1-st order phase transitions the functions $\alpha$ undergo jumps depending on temperature, chemical potential and magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Young Black Holes Have Smooth Horizons: A Swampland Argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested that black hole microstates in string theory may have "no interiors". The arguments of arXiv:2312.14108 suggest that even if this were the case, conventional bulk EFT should be valid at the horizon for black holes that are not too old. Here, we explore the validity of bulk EFT for young black holes from a different perspective, by considering the gravitational collapse of scalar moduli. This builds on arXiv:2003.05488, which studied the numerical collapse of a scalar field in a Choptuik-like set up. Evidence was presented there for two observations -- (a) For every scalar profile that results in collapse, the scalar field undergoes trans-Planckian variation, (b) Every trans-Planckian scalar motion is hidden behind an apparent horizon. The results of arXiv:2003.05488 were mostly obtained in regimes close to critical collapse, where scale-separation was difficult to achieve. In this paper, we study the same system in super-critical regimes. This allows us to study the localization properties of scalar variations inside the apparent horizon by separating the horizon and singularity scales. We find strong evidence that the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ scalar variation is localized around the curvature divergence, and is hierarchically well-separated from the apparent horizon. Because $\mathcal{O}(1)$ scalar movement is associated to the breakdown of bulk EFT according to the swampland distance conjecture, this is an indication that bulk EFT is well-behaved in the interiors of young black holes. Our results suggest the perspective that cosmic censorship is a mechanism for preserving bulk EFT between the horizon and the singularity.</description>

      <title>Quantizing Carrollian field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carrollian field theories have recently emerged as a candidate dual to flat space quantum gravity. We carefully quantize simple two-derivative Carrollian theories, revealing a strong sensitivity to the ultraviolet. They can be regulated upon being placed on a spatial lattice and working at finite inverse temperature. Unlike in conventional field theories, the details of the lattice-regulated Carrollian theories remain important at long distances even in the limit that the lattice spacing is sent to zero. We use that limit to define interacting continuum models with a tractable perturbative expansion. The ensuing theories are those of generalized free fields, with non-Gaussian correlations suppressed by positive powers of the lattice spacing, and an unbroken supertranslation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Q-Balls in the Presence of Attractive Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Q-balls are non-topological solitons in field theories whose stability is typically guaranteed by the existence of a global conserved charge. A classic realization is the Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin (FLS) Q-ball in a two-scalar system where a real scalar $\chi$ triggers the symmetry breaking and confining a complex scalar $\Phi$ with a global $U(1)$ symmetry. A quartic interaction $\kappa \chi^2|\Phi|^2$ with $\kappa&gt;0$ is usually considered to produce a nontrivial Q-ball configuration, and this repulsive force contributes to its stability. On the other hand, the attractive cubic interaction $\Lambda \chi |\Phi|^2$ is generally allowed in a renormalizable theory and could induce an instability. In this paper, we study the behavior of the Q-ball under the influence of this attractive force which has been overlooked. We find approximate Q-ball solutions in the limit of weak and moderate force couplings using the thin-wall and thick-wall approximations respectively. Our analytical results are consistent with numerical simulations and predict the parameter dependencies of the maximum charge. A crucial difference with the ordinary FLS Q-ball is the existence of the maximum charge beyond which the Q-ball solution is classically unstable. Such a limitation of the charge fundamentally affects Q-ball formation in the early Universe and could plausibly lead to the formation of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Time-symmetric correlations for open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-time expectation values of sequential measurements of dichotomic observables are known to be time symmetric for closed quantum systems. Namely, if a system evolves unitarily between sequential measurements of dichotomic observables $\mathscr{O}_{A}$ followed by $\mathscr{O}_{B}$, then it necessarily follows that $\langle\mathscr{O}_{A}\,,\mathscr{O}_{B}\rangle=\langle\mathscr{O}_{B}\,,\mathscr{O}_{A}\rangle$, where $\langle\mathscr{O}_{A}\,,\mathscr{O}_{B}\rangle$ is the two-time expectation value corresponding to the product of the measurement outcomes of $\mathscr{O}_{A}$ followed by $\mathscr{O}_{B}$, and $\langle\mathscr{O}_{B}\,,\mathscr{O}_{A}\rangle$ is the two-time expectation value associated with the time reversal of the unitary dynamics, where a measurement of $\mathscr{O}_{B}$ precedes a measurement of $\mathscr{O}_{A}$. In this work, we show that a quantum Bayes' rule implies a time symmetry for two-time expectation values associated with open quantum systems, which evolve according to a general quantum channel between measurements. Such results are in contrast with the view that processes associated with open quantum systems -- which may lose information to their environment -- are not reversible in any operational sense. We give an example of such time-symmetric correlations for the amplitude-damping channel, and we propose an experimental protocol for the potential verification of the theoretical predictions associated with our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent surge of research in many-body quantum entanglement has uncovered intriguing properties of quantum many-body systems. A prime example is the modular commutator, which can extract a topological invariant from a single wave function. Here, we unveil novel geometric properties of many-body entanglement via a modular commutator of two-dimensional gapped quantum many-body systems. We obtain the geometric additivity of a modular commutator, indicating that modular commutator for a multipartite system may be an integer multiple of the one for tripartite systems. Using our additivity formula, we also derive a curious identity for the modular commutators involving disconnected intervals in a certain class of conformal field theories. We further illustrate this geometric additivity for both bulk and edge subsystems using numerical calculations of the Haldane and $\pi$-flux models.</description>

Abstract: Despite their success, General Relativity (GR) and the Standard Model (SM) are currently understood as effective field theories only valid up to some energy (length) scale, where new physics is expected to appear. We review the framework of extended relativity (ER) in Clifford spaces (C-spaces), summarising some of its concepts, methods and results. We also discuss likely links of this approach with other relativies (OR), beyond GR and SM theories, recent ideas from emergent spacetime (ES) and quantum entanglement (QE), in search for quantum gravity (QG) and unification (U). Finally, we explore and expose the need to go even beyond ER, and the challenges it poses, from both experimental and theoretical sides.</description>

Abstract: We consider the time evolution of a particle on a ring with a long solenoid through and show that due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect this system naturally makes up a physical implementation of the quantum phase estimation algorithm for a $U(1)$ unitary operator. The implementation of the full quantum phase estimation algorithm with a $U(N)$ unitary operator is realised through the non-abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect. The implementation allows for a more physically intuitive understanding of the algorithm. As an example we use the path integral formulation of the implemented quantum phase estimation algorithm to analyse the classical limit $\hbar\to0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent data seem to suggest a preference for the evolving dark energy (DE). However, if the case is actually so, and not caused by unknown systematics in data, it might impact our understanding about our Universe in an anomalous way due to the shifts of some primary parameters. As an example, we present the search for the primordial gravitational waves, based on the evolving DE. The joint analysis of recent BICEP/Keck cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarization data with Planck18 CMB, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and PantheonPlus data shows that the bestfit tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.05}\sim 0.01$, and the lower bound of $r_{0.05}$ is $\sim 2\sigma$ non-zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum information science, Clifford operators and stabilizer codes play a central role for systems of qubits (or qudits). In this paper, we study the analogous objects for systems of Majorana fermions. A crucial role is played by fermion parity symmetry, which is an unbreakable symmetry present in any system in which the fundamental degrees of freedom are fermionic. We prove that the subgroup of parity-preserving fermionic Cliffords can be represented by the orthogonal group over the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$, and we show how it can be generated by braiding operators and used to construct any (even-parity) Majorana stabilizer code. We also analyze the frame potential for this so-called p-Clifford group, proving that it is equivalent to the frame potential of the ordinary Clifford group acting on a fixed-parity sector of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Ref. \cite{Wang:2023tdz} investigated the model of Einstein-Bardeen theory coupled to a free complex scalar field. The introduction of the scalar field prevents the formation of the event horizon, and when the magnetic charge exceeds a certain critical value, the frozen Bardeen-boson star can be obtained with the frequency $\omega \rightarrow 0$. In this paper, we extend the investigation of the Einstein-Bardeen model with a charged scalar field and obtain two types of solutions: the small $q$ solution and the large $q$ solution. Specifically, for the small $q$ solution, we find that there exists a maximum value for the charge $q$, the introduction of the charge makes it possible to obtain solutions for frozen stars without the frequency to be approached to zero. For the large $q$ solution, the charge can tend toward infinity, and as $q \rightarrow \infty$, the large $q$ solution gradually becomes the pure Bardeen solution. Similar to Ref. \cite{Wang:2023tdz}, the event horizon is not found in our results.</description>

      <title>DMRG study of the theta-dependent mass spectrum in the 2-flavor Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $\theta$-dependent mass spectrum of the massive $2$-flavor Schwinger model in the Hamiltonian formalism using the density-matrix renormalization group(DMRG). The masses of the composite particles, the pion and sigma meson, are computed by two independent methods. One is the improved one-point-function scheme, where we measure the local meson operator coupled to the boundary state and extract the mass from its exponential decay. Since the $\theta$ term causes a nontrivial operator mixing, we unravel it by diagonalizing the correlation matrix to define the meson operator. The other is the dispersion-relation scheme, a heuristic approach specific to Hamiltonian formalism. We obtain the dispersion relation directly by measuring the energy and momentum of the excited states. The sign problem is circumvented in these methods, and their results agree with each other even for large $\theta$. We reveal that the $\theta$-dependence of the pion mass at $m/g=0.1$ is consistent with the prediction by the bosonized model. We also find that the mass of the sigma meson satisfies the semi-classical formula, $M_{\sigma}/M_{\pi}=\sqrt{3}$, for almost all region of $\theta$. While the sigma meson is a stable particle thanks to this relation, the eta meson is no longer protected by the $G$-parity and becomes unstable for $\theta\neq 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have investigated the phase space analysis in modified Galileon cosmology, where the Galileon term is considered a coupled scalar field, $F(\phi)$. We focus on the exponential type function of $F(\phi)$ and the three well-motivated potential functions $V(\phi)$. We obtain the critical points of the autonomous system, along with their stability conditions and cosmological properties. The critical points of the autonomous system describe different phases of the Universe. In the results of our analysis, we have found the scaling solution for critical points, which determine different evolutionary eras for the Universe. The dark-energy-dominated critical points show stable behavior and indicate the Universe's late-time cosmic acceleration phase. Further, the results are examined with the cosmological data sets of the Hubble rate $H(z)$ and the Supernovae Ia.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we examine the role of the repulsive Casimir force in counteracting the gravitational contraction of a thin spherically symmetric shell. Our main focus is to explore the possibility of achieving a stable balanced configuration within the theoretically reliable weak field limit. To this end, we consider different types of Casimir forces, including those generated by massless scalar fields, massive scalar fields, electromagnetic fields, and temperature-dependent fields.</description>

      <title>Tying knots in particle physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lord Kelvin's pioneering hypothesis that the identity of atoms is knots of vortices of the aether had a profound impact on the fields of mathematics and physics despite being subsequently refuted by experiments. While knot-like excitations emerge in various systems of condensed matter physics, the fundamental constituents of matter have been revealed to be elementary particles such as electrons and quarks, seemingly leaving no room for the appearance of knots in particle physics. Here, we show that knots indeed appear as meta-stable solitons in a realistic extension of the standard model of particle physics that provides the QCD axion and right-handed neutrinos. This result suggests that during the early Universe, a "knot dominated era" may have existed, where knots were a dominant component of the Universe, and this scenario can be tested through gravitational wave observations. Furthermore, we propose that the end of this era involves the collapse of the knots via quantum tunneling, leading to the generation of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Our findings exhibit the significant role of knots in particle physics and represent a modern version of Kelvin's hypothesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent work we showed that the detection of the exchange of a single graviton between a massive quantum resonator and a gravitational wave can be achieved. Key to this ability are the experimental progress in preparing and measuring massive resonators in the quantum regime, and the correlation with independent LIGO detections of gravitational waves that induce stimulated absorption. But do stimulated single-graviton processes imply the quantization of gravity? Here we analyze this question and make a historic analogy to the early days of quantum theory. We discuss in what ways such experiments can indeed probe key features of the quantized interaction between gravity and matter, and outline five experimental tests. This capability would open the first window into experimental exploration of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Classical Dynamics with Random Permutation Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is among the most enduring problems in modern physics. A particularly interesting question concerns the role played by quantum mechanics in this process, i.e. whether thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is fundamentally different from that in classical many-body systems and, if so, which of its features are genuinely quantum. Here we study this question in minimally structured many-body systems which are only constrained to have local interactions, i.e. local random circuits. We introduce a class of random permutation circuits (RPCs), where the gates locally permute basis states modelling generic microscopic classical dynamics, and compare them to random unitary circuits (RUCs), a standard toy model for generic quantum dynamics. We show that, like RUCs, RPCs permit the analytical computation of several key quantities such as out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs), or entanglement entropies. RPCs can be interpreted both as quantum or classical dynamics, which we use to find similarities and differences between the two. Performing the average over all random circuits, we discover a series of exact relations, connecting quantities in RUC and (quantum) RPCs. In the classical setting, we obtain similar exact results relating (quantum) purity to (classical) growth of mutual information and (quantum) OTOCs to (classical) decorrelators. Our results indicate that despite of the fundamental differences between quantum and classical systems, their dynamics exhibits qualitatively similar behaviours.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alternative to the embedding formalism, we provide a group theoretic approach to the conformal primary basis for the massless field with arbitrary helicity. To this end, we first point out that $sl(2,\mathds{C})$ isometry gets enhanced to $sl(2,\mathds{C})\times D$ symmetry for the solution space of the massless field with arbitrary helicity. Then associated with $sl(2,\mathds{C})\times D$ symmetry, we introduce the novel quadratic Casimirs and relevant tensor/spinor fields to derive 2 explicit constraints on the bulk dilatation and $sl(2,\mathds{C})$ Casimirs. With this, we further argue that the candidate conformal primary basis can be constructed out of the infinite tower of the descendants of the left and right highest (lowest) conformal primary wavefunction of $sl(2,\mathds{C})$ Lie algebra, and the corresponding celestial conformal weights are determined by the bulk scaling dimension through solving out the exact on-shell conformal primary wavefunctions, where on top of the two kinds of familiar-looking on-shell conformal primary wavefunctions, we also obtain another set of independent on-shell conformal primary wavefunctions for the massless field with helicity $|s|\ge 1$. In passing, we also develop the relationship between the 4D Lorentz Lie algebra and 2D conformal Lie algebra from scratch, and present an explicit derivation for the two important properties associated with the conformal primary wavefunctions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07528v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to challenge the calculation of genus-$g$, bulk $n$-point, $b$-boundary, $c$-crosscap correlation functions with $x$ boundary operators $\mathcal{F}_{g,n,b,c}^{x}$ in two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFT$_2$). We show that $\mathcal{F}_{g,n,b,c}^{x}$ are infinite linear combinations of genus-$g$, bulk $(n+b+c)$-point functions $\mathcal{F}_{g,(n+b+c)}$, and try to obtain the linear coefficients in this work. We show the existence of a single pole structure in the linear coefficients at degenerate limits. A practical method to obtain the infinite linear coefficients is the free field realizations of Ishibashi states. We review the results in Virasoro minimal models $\mathcal{M}(p,p')$ and extend it to the $N=1$ minimal models $\mathcal{SM}(p,p')$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well established that the spectral analysis of canonically quantized four-dimensional Seiberg-Witten curves can be systematically studied via the Nekrasov-Shatashvili functions. In this paper, we explore another aspect of the relation between $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions and operator theory. Specifically, we study an example of an integral operator associated with Painlev\'e equations and whose spectral traces are related to correlation functions of the 2d Ising model. This operator does not correspond to a canonically quantized Seiberg-Witten curve, but its kernel can nevertheless be interpreted as the density matrix of an ideal Fermi gas. Adopting the approach of Tracy and Widom, we provide an explicit expression for its eigenfunctions via an $\mathrm{O}(2)$ matrix model. We then show that these eigenfunctions are computed by surface defects in $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ super Yang-Mills in the self-dual phase of the $\Omega$-background. Our result also yields a strong coupling expression for such defects which resums the instanton expansion. Even though we focus on one concrete example, we expect these results to hold for a larger class of operators arising in the context of isomonodromic deformation equations.</description>

      <title>Massless Lifshitz Field Theory for Arbitrary $z$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the notion of fractional derivatives, we introduce a class of massless Lifshitz scalar field theory in (1+1)-dimension with an arbitrary anisotropy index $z$. The Lifshitz scale invariant ground state of the theory is constructed explicitly and takes the form of Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK). We show that there is a continuous family of ground states with degeneracy parameterized by the choice of solution to the equation of motion of an auxiliary classical system. The quantum mechanical path integral establishes a 2d/1d correspondence with the equal time correlation functions of the Lifshitz scalar field theory. We study the entanglement properties of the Lifshitz theory for arbitrary $z$ using the path integral representation. The entanglement measures are expressed in terms of certain cross ratio functions we specify, and satisfy the $c$-function monotonicity theorems. We also consider the holographic description of the Lifshitz theory. In order to match with the field theory result for the entanglement entropy, we propose a $z$-dependent radius scale for the Lifshitz background. This relation is consistent with the $z$-dependent scaling symmetry respected by the Lifshitz vacuum. Furthermore, the time-like entanglement entropy is determined using holography. Our result suggests that there should exist a fundamental definition of time-like entanglement other than employing analytic continuation as performed in relativistic field theory.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes an alternative regularization method for handling the ultraviolet behavior of entanglement entropy. Utilizing an $i\epsilon$ prescription in the Euclidean double cone geometry, it accurately reproduces the universal behavior of entanglement entropy. The method is demonstrated in the free boson theory in arbitrary dimensions and two-dimensional conformal field theories. The findings highlight the effectiveness of the $i\epsilon$ regularization method in addressing ultraviolet issues in quantum field theory and gravity, suggesting potential applications to other calculable quantities.</description>

Abstract: We conjecture a set of differential equations that characterizes the Liouville irregular states of half-integer ranks, which extends the generalized AGT correspondence to all the $(A_1,A_\text{even})$ and $(A_1,D_\text{odd})$ types Argyres-Douglas theories. For lower half-integer ranks, our conjecture is verified by deriving it as a suitable limit of a similar set of differential equations for integer ranks. This limit is interpreted as the 2D counterpart of a 4D RG-flow from $(A_1,D_{2n})$ to $(A_1,D_{2n-1})$. For rank $3/2$, we solve the conjectured differential equations and find a power series expression for the irregular state $|I^{(3/2)}\rangle$. For rank $5/2$, our conjecture is consistent with the differential equations recently discovered by H. Poghosyan and R. Poghossian.</description>

Abstract: Euler hydrodynamics of perfect fluids can be viewed as an effective bosonic field theory. In cases when the underlying microscopic system involves Dirac fermions, the quantum anomalies should be properly described. In 1+1 dimensions the action formulation of hydrodynamics at zero temperature is reconsidered and shown to be equal to standard field-theory bosonization. Furthermore, it can be derived from a topological gauge theory in one extra dimension, which identifies the fluid variables through the anomaly inflow relations. Extending this framework to 3+1 dimensions yields an effective field theory/hydrodynamics model, capable of elucidating the mixed axial-vector and axial-gravitational anomalies of Dirac fermions. This formulation provides a platform for bosonization in higher dimensions. Moreover, the connection with 4+1 dimensional topological theories suggests some generalizations of fluid dynamics involving additional degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: The effect of noise induced by gravitons has been investigated using a Bose-Einstein condensate. The gravitational wave perturbation is then considerd as a sum of discrete Fourier modes in the momentum space. Coming to an operatorial representation and quantizing the phase space variables via appropriately introduced canonincal commutation relations between the canonically conjugate variables corresponding to the graviton and bosonic part of the total system, one obtains a proper quantum gravity setup. Then we obtain the Bogoliubov coefficients from the solution of the time-dependent part of the pseudo-Goldstone boson and construct the covariance metric for the bosons initially being in a squeezed state. Using the stochastic average of the Fisher information, we obtain a lower bound on the amplitude parameter of the gravitational wave. As the entire calculation is done at zero temperature, the bosonic system, by construction, will behave as a Bose-Einstein condensate. For a Bose-Einstein condensate with a single mode, we observe that the lower bound of the expectation value of the square of the uncertainty in the amplitude measurement does not become infinite when the total observational term approaches zero. In order to sum over all possible momentum modes, we next consider a noise term with a suitable Gaussian weight factor which decays over time. We then obtain the lower bound on the final expectation value of the square of the variance in the amplitude parameter. Because of the noise induced by the graviton, there is a minimum value of the measurement time below which it is impossible to detect any gravitational wave using a Bose-Einstein condensate. Finally, we consider interaction between the phonon modes of the Bose-Einstein condensate which results in the decoherence. We observe that the decoherence effect becomes significant for gravitons with minimal squeezing.</description>

Abstract: Symmetries of Seiberg-Witten (SW) geometries capture intricate physical aspects of the underlying 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ field theories. For rank-one theories, these geometries are rational elliptic surfaces whose automorphism group is a semi-direct product between the Coulomb branch (CB) symmetries and the Mordell-Weil group. We study quotients of the SW geometry by subgroups of its automorphism group, which most naturally become gaugings of discrete 0- and 1-form symmetries. Yet, new interpretations of these surgeries become evident when considering 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories. There, certain CB symmetries are related to symmetries of the corresponding $(p,q)$-brane web and, as a result, CB surgeries can give rise to (fractional) S-folds. Another novel interpretation of these quotients is the folding across dimensions: circle compactifications of the 5d $E_{2N_f + 1}$ Seiberg theories lead in the infrared to two copies of locally indistinguishable 4d SU(2) SQCD theories with $N_f$ fundamental flavours. This extends earlier results on holonomy saddles, while also reproducing detailed computations of 5d BPS spectra and predicting new 5d and 6d BPS quivers. Finally, we argue that the semi-direct product structure of the automorphism group of the SW geometry includes mixed 't Hooft anomalies between the 0- and 1-form symmetries, and we also present some new results on non-cyclic CB symmetries.</description>

      <title>Center-less BMS charge algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that when the Wald-Zoupas prescription is implemented, the resulting charges realize the BMS symmetry algebra without any 2-cocycle nor central extension, at any cut of future null infinity. We refine the covariance prescription for application to the charge aspects, and introduce a new aspect for Geroch's super-momentum with better covariance properties. For the extended BMS symmetry with singular conformal Killing vectors we find that a Wald-Zoupas symplectic potential exists, if one is willing to modify the symplectic structure by a corner term. The resulting algebra of Noether currents between two arbitrary cuts is center-less. The charge algebra at a given cut has a residual field-dependent 2-cocycle, but time-independent and non-radiative. More precisely, super-rotation fluxes act covariantly, but super-rotation charges act covariantly only on global translations. The take home message is that in any situation where 2-cocycles appears in the literature, covariance has likely been lost in the charge prescription, and that the criterium of covariance is a powerful one to reduce ambiguities in the charges, and can be used also for ambiguities in the charge aspects.</description>

      <title>Discrete torsion in gauging non-invertible symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss generalizations of discrete torsion to noninvertible symmetries in 2d QFTs. One point of this paper is to explain that there are two complementary generalizations. Both generalizations are counted by $H^2(G,U(1))$ when one specializes to ordinary finite groups $G$. However, the counting is different for more general fusion categories. Furthermore, only one generalizes the picture of discrete torsion as differences in choices of gauge actions on B fields. Explaining this in detail, how one of the generalizations of discrete torsion to noninvertible cases encodes actions on B fields, is the other point of this paper. In particular, this generalizes old results in ordinary orbifolds that discrete torsion is a choice of group action on the B field. We also explain how this same generalization of discrete torsion gives rise to physically-sensible twists on gaugeable algebras and fiber functors.</description>

      <title>Impurities with a cusp: general theory and 3d Ising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In CFTs, the partition function of a line defect with a cusp depends logarithmically on the size of the line with an angle-dependent coefficient: the cusp anomalous dimension. In the first part of this work, we study the general properties of the cusp anomalous dimension. We relate the small cusp angle limit to the effective field theory of defect fusion, making predictions for the first couple of terms in the expansion. Using a concavity property of the cusp anomalous dimension we argue that the Casimir energy between a line defect and its orientation reversal is always negative ("opposites attract"). We use these results to determine the fusion algebra of Wilson lines in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM as well as pinning field defects in the Wilson-Fisher fixed points. In the second part of the paper we obtain nonperturbative numerical results for the cusp anomalous dimension of pinning field defects in the Ising model in $d=3$, using the recently developed fuzzy-sphere regularization. We also compute the pinning field cusp anomalous dimension in the $O(N)$ model at one-loop in the $\varepsilon$-expansion. Our results are in agreement with the general theory developed in the first part of the work, and we make several predictions for impurities in magnets.</description>

      <title>Timelike boundaries in de Sitter JT gravity and the Gao-Wald theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gao-Wald theorem says that de Sitter spacetime reacts to a positive energy perturbation by getting "taller." How does this change in the presence of timelike boundaries? We study this question in two-dimensional de Sitter JT gravity coupled to conformal matter. The effect of the boundaries has its roots in quantum corrections to the vacuum energy of the CFT due to Casimir-like effects. We consider two different kinds of timelike boundaries, either at locations where the coordinate $\varphi$ is constant or at locations where the dilaton is constant. For each kind we compute the vacuum expectation value of the matter CFT stress tensor. The stress tensor violates the null energy condition in the first case and saturates it in the second case, with each case exhibiting a negative energy density in the vacuum state. We then compute the semiclassical backreaction of this energy density and show how it can make the spacetime "fatter" or "taller" or a combination of both, depending on the regime. The spacetime getting fatter corresponds to an increase in the value of the dilaton at the horizon and hence also in the static patch horizon area in the higher-dimensional solution. We comment on the implications of our results for the quantum theories living on the timelike boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The resonant energy transfer mechanism, responsible for the presence of fractal patterns in the velocity diagrams of kink-antikink scattering, is analyzed for a family of two-component scalar field theory models, in which the kink solutions have two shape modes (one longitudinal and one orthogonal to the kink orbit), in addition to the zero mode, and in which energy redistribution can occur among these three discrete modes. We investigate the scattering between wobbling kinks whose orthogonal shape mode is initially excited, examining how the final velocities, amplitudes, and frequencies depend on the initial excitation amplitude. The differences that this model presents with respect to the $\phi^4$ model and its novel properties are highlighted. This analysis sheds light on the intricate dynamics that arise from the interplay between multiple degrees of freedom in kink scattering processes, offering insights distinct from those observed in simpler models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the SVD entanglement entropy, which has recently come up as a successor to the pseudo entropy. This paper is a first-of-its-kind application of SVD entanglement entropy to a system of chiral Dirac oscillators which prove to be natural to study the SVD formalism because the two chiral oscillator ground states can be taken as the pre-selected and post-selected states. We argue how this alternative for entanglement entropy is better and more intuitive than the von Neumann one to study quantum phase transition. We also provide as an illustrative example, a new generalized proof of the SVD entanglement entropy being $\log2$ for a pair of Bell states that differ from each other by relative phases.</description>

Abstract: We continue to develop the theory of separable higher categories, including center functors, higher centralizers, modular extensions and group theoretical higher fusion categories. Moreover, we outline a theory of orthogonal higher categories to treat anti-unitary symmetries. Using these results we derive a systematic classification of gapped quantum liquids and predict many new SPT orders in spacetime dimension $\ge3$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Positivity for Phenomenologists: Dark Gauge Boson in the Swampland</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational positivity bound gives quantitative "swampland'' constraints on low-energy effective theories inside theories of quantum gravity. We give a comprehensive discussion of this bound for those interested in applications to phenomenological model building. We present a practical recipe for deriving the bound, and discuss subtleties relevant for realistic models. As an illustration, we study the positivity bound on the scattering of the massive gauge bosons in the Higgs/St\"{u}ckelberg mechanism. Under certain assumptions on gravitational amplitudes at high energy, we obtain a lower bound $m_{V} \gtrsim \Lambda_\mathrm{UV}^2 /g M_\mathrm{Pl}$ on the gauge boson mass $m_V$, where $g$ is the coupling constant of the gauge field, $M_\mathrm{Pl}$ is the reduced Planck mass and $\Lambda_\mathrm{UV}$ is the ultraviolet cutoff of the effective field theory. This bound can strongly constrain new physics models involving a massive gauge boson.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic correlation functions in 2D critical percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is believed that the large-scale geometric properties of two-dimensional critical percolation are described by a logarithmic conformal field theory, but it has been challenging to exhibit concrete examples of logarithmic singularities and to find an explanation and a physical interpretation, in terms of lattice observables, for their appearance. We show that certain percolation correlation functions receive independent contributions from a large number of similar connectivity events happening at different scales. Combined with scale invariance, this leads to logarithmic divergences. We study several logarithmic correlation functions for critical percolation in the bulk and in the presence of a boundary, including the four-point function of the density (spin) field. Our analysis confirms previous findings, provides new explicit calculations and explains, in terms of lattice observables, the physical mechanism that leads to the logarithmic singularities we discover. Although we adopt conformal field theory (CFT) terminology to present our results, the core of our analysis relies on probabilistic arguments and recent rigorous results on the scaling limit of critical percolation and does not assume a priori the existence of a percolation CFT. As a consequence, our results provide strong support for the validity of a CFT description of critical percolation and a step in the direction of a mathematically rigorous formulation of a logarithmic CFT of two-dimensional critical percolation.</description>

      <title>Ladder Symmetries and Love Numbers of Reissner--Nordstr\"om Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that asymptotically flat black holes in general relativity have vanishing tidal Love numbers. In the case of Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, this property has been shown to be a consequence of a hidden structure of ladder symmetries for the perturbations. In this work, we extend the ladder symmetries to non-rotating charged black holes in general relativity. As opposed to previous works in this context, we adopt a more general definition of Love numbers, including quadratic operators that mix gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations in the point-particle effective field theory. We show that the calculation of a subset of those couplings in full general relativity is affected by an ambiguity in the split between source and response, which we resolve through an analytic continuation. As a result, we derive a novel master equation that unifies scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations around Reissner--Nordstr\"om black holes. The equation is hypergeometric and can be obtained from previous formulations via nontrivial field redefinitions, which allow to systematically remove some of the singularities and make the presence of the ladder symmetries more manifest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal properties of quantum fields at finite temperature are crucial to understanding strongly interacting matter and recent development in quantum computing has provided an alternative and promising avenue of study. In this work, we study thermal field theories involving only fermions using quantum algorithms. We first delve into the presentations of fermion fields via qubits on digital quantum computers alongside the quantum algorithms such as quantum imaginary time evolutions employed to evaluate thermal properties of generic quantum field theories. Specifically, we show numerical results such as the thermal distribution and the energy density of thermal field theories for Majorana fermions in 1+1 dimensions using quantum simulators. In addition to free field theory, we also study the effects of interactions resulting from coupling with a spatially homogeneous Majorana field. In both cases, we show analytically that thermal properties of the system can be described using phase-space distributions, and the quantum simulation results agree with analytical and semiclassical expectations. Our work is an important step to understand thermal fixed points, preparing for quantum simulation of thermalization in real time.</description>

Abstract: We study time symmetric initial data for asymptotically AdS spacetimes with conformal boundary containing a spatial circle. Such $d$-dimensional initial data sets can contain $(d-2)$-dimensional minimal surfaces if the circle is contractible. We compute the minimum energy of a large class of such initial data as a function of the area $A$ of this minimal surface. The statement $E \ge E_{min}(A)$ is analogous to the Penrose inequality which bounds the energy from below by a function of the area of a $(d-1)$-dimensional minimal surface.</description>

      <title>The worldsheet skein D-module and basic curves on Lagrangian fillings of the Hopf link conormal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: HOMFLYPT polynomials of knots in the 3-sphere in symmetric representations satisfy recursion relations. Their geometric origin is holomorphic curves at infinity on knot conormals that determine a $D$-module with characteristic variety the Legendrian knot conormal augmention variety and with the recursion relations as operator polynomial generators [arXiv:1304.5778, arXiv:1803.04011]. We consider skein lifts of recursions and $D$-modules corresponding to skein valued open curve counts [arXiv:1901.08027] that encode HOMFLYPT polynomials colored by arbitrary partitions. We define a worldsheet skein module which is the universal target for skein curve counts and a corresponding $D$-module.
  We then consider the concrete example of the Legendrian conormal of the Hopf link. We show that the worldsheet skein $D$-module for the Hopf link conormal is generated by three operator polynomials that annihilate the skein valued partition function for any choice of Lagrangian filling and recursively determine it uniquely. We find Lagrangian fillings for any point in the augmentation variety and show that their skein valued partition functions admit quiver-like expansions where all holomorphic curves are generated by a small number of basic holomorphic disks and annuli and their multiple covers.</description>
