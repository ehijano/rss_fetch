      <title>Observational Constraints on Evolution of Dust Disc Properties in Upper Scorpius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary discs in the Upper Scorpius star-forming region are excellent laboratories to investigate late stages of planet formation. In this work, we analyse the morphology of the dust continuum emission of 121 discs from an ALMA Band 7 survey of the Upper Scorpius region. This analysis is done in the visibility plane, to measure the flux, geometry and characterise potential structures. We compare the results with state-of-the art gas and dust evolution models that include external photoevaporation, with mild values of the $F_{\rm{UV}}$ of 1-40$G_0$. From the visibility analysis, 52 of the 121 discs are resolved (43%). From the resolved discs, 24 discs have structures and 28 remain as smooth discs at the mean resolution scale of $\sim$0.1$^{\prime \prime}$ (~14au). Our results show no significant dust disc size evolution of the surviving discs in UpperSco when compared to discs in younger star-forming regions, such as Lupus. We find a strong, steeper-than-previously-reported correlation between dust disc size and disc millimeter continuum luminosity, in agreement with drift-dominated dust evolution models. We also find positive correlations between the dust disc mass vs. stellar mass and dust disc size vs. stellar mass. The slope of the dust disc size vs. stellar mass relationship is steeper compared to younger star forming regions. Additionally, we observe no significant correlation between dust disc properties and the environmental $F_{\rm{UV}}$, consistent with models predicting that dust disc properties are primarily shaped by drift and dust traps. Our models predict that gas disc masses and sizes should be highly affected by the moderate $F_{\rm{UV}}$ values that Upper Scorpius discs experience in contrast to the dust, highlighting the need for deeper and higher-resolution gas observations of these discs exposed to mild external photoevaporation.</description>

      <title>Searching for GEMS: TOI-5349b is a Saturn-like planet orbiting a metal-rich early M-dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the confirmation and analysis of TOI-5349b, a transiting, warm, Saturn-like planet orbiting an early M-dwarf with a period of $\sim$3.3 days, which we confirmed as part of the Searching for GEMS (Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars) survey. TOI-5349b was initially identified in photometry from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission and subsequently confirmed using high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) and MAROON-X spectrographs, and from ground-based transit observations obtained using the 0.6-m telescope at Red Buttes Observatory (RBO) and the 1.0-m telescope at the Table Mountain Facility of Pomona College. From a joint fit of the RV and photometric data, we determine the planet's mass and radius to be $0.40\pm 0.02~\mathrm{M_J}$ ($127.4_{-5.7}^{+5.9}~M_\oplus$) and $0.91\pm 0.02~\mathrm{R_J}$ ($10.2\pm 0.3~R_\oplus$), respectively, resulting in a bulk density of $\rho_p=0.66 \pm0.06~\mathrm{g~cm^{-3}}$ ($\sim$0.96 the density of Saturn). We determine that the host star is a metal-rich M1-type dwarf with a mass and radius of $0.61 \pm 0.02~M_\odot$ and $0.58\pm 0.01~R_\odot$, and an effective temperature of $T_\mathrm{eff} = 3751 \pm 59$ K. Our analysis highlights an emerging pattern, exemplified by TOI-5349, in which transiting GEMS often have Saturn-like masses and densities and orbit metal-rich stars. With the growing sample of GEMS planets, comparative studies of short-period gas giants orbiting M-dwarfs and Sun-like stars are needed to investigate how metallicity and disk conditions shape the formation and properties of these planets.</description>

      <title>A High-Precision, Differentiable Code for Solar System Ephemerides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present jorbit, a python/JAX library designed to enable modern data-driven numerical studies of the solar system. Written entirely in JAX, an auto-differentiable and optionally GPU accelerated language behind many current large-scale machine learning efforts, jorbit includes an independent implementation of REBOUND's IAS15 integrator and the ability to parse precomputed ephemerides such as the JPL DE series. In its default behavior, jorbit maintains ~1 mas agreement with JPL Horizons on ~decade timescales for typical main-belt asteroids, enabling it to fully capitalize on high-precision astrometry and ranging data. We include details of the code's implementation and several worked examples, including illustrations of jorbit's ability to simulate N-body systems, forward model astrometric data, fit orbits, replicate the Minor Planet Center's "MPChecker" service, and contribute to modeling the effect of minor planets on stellar light curves.</description>

      <title>Flipping particles with nodal circulations by general relativity under the presence of an inner perturber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a secular Hamiltonian up to the quadrupole level with general relativity (GR), we study nodal circulations with orbital flips of test particles of the Habitable Zone (HZ) around a solar-mass star, which are perturbed by an inner planetary-mass companion. Nodal circulations with orbital flips of an HZ test particle with eccentricity e2 are possible for any mass m1 and eccentricity e1 of the inner perturber and a suitable inclination i2. In particular, the greater the values of m1 and e2 , the smaller the minimum extreme inclination i2 capable of producing nodal circulations with orbital flips for each e1. As long as nodal librations with orbital flips are not possible for any i2, the greater the values of m1, e1, and e2, the larger the region of the plane ({\Omega}2, i2) associated with nodal circulations with orbital flips. If nodal librations with orbital flips occur, the region of the plane ({\Omega}2, i2) referred to nodal circulations with orbital flips increases with a decrease in m1 and e2, and with an increase in e1. We observe very good agreements between the analytical criteria and the N-body experiments for m1 ranging from Earth-mass planets to super-Jupiters, and small and moderate e2. The main discrepancies are found for high e2, which are more evident with an increase in m1 and e1.</description>

      <title>A Deep Dive into the Impact of Solar Storms on LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks are an important part of the global communication infrastructure today. Despite ongoing efforts to improve their resilience, they remain vulnerable to component damage and deorbiting under harsh space weather conditions. Prior work identified a modest but noticeable impact on LEO satellite network performance during solar storms, typically manifesting as an immediate rise in packet loss and a sustained increase in round-trip time (RTT). However, these studies offer only coarse-grained insights and do not capture the nuanced spatial and temporal patterns of disruption across the LEO network.
  In this paper, we conduct a deep dive into the impact of solar storms on LEO satellite communications. By localizing the impact of increased atmospheric drag at the level of individual satellites and orbits, we reveal significant heterogeneity in how different parts of the network are affected. We find that the degree of performance degradation varies significantly across geographic regions, depending on satellite positioning during the storm. Specifically, we find that (i) not all satellite orbits are equally vulnerable, (ii) within a given orbit, certain satellites experience disproportionate impact depending on their position relative to geomagnetic conditions, and (iii) autonomous maneuvering of satellites might be a cause of the sustained increase in RTT. Our findings uncover previously overlooked patterns of vulnerability in LEO satellite constellations and highlight the need for more adaptive, region-aware mitigation strategies to address space weather-induced network disruptions.</description>

      <title>Winding Motion of Spirals in a Gravitationally Unstable Protoplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of wide-orbit giant exoplanets has posed a challenge to our conventional understanding of planet formation by coagulation of dust grains and planetesimals, and subsequent accretion of protoplanetary disk gas. As an alternative mechanism, the direct in-situ formation of planets or planetary cores by gravitational instability (GI) in protoplanetary disks has been proposed. However, observational evidence for GI in regions where wide-orbit planets are formed is still lacking. Theoretical studies predict that GI induces spiral arms moving at the local Keplerian speed in a disk. Here, with multiple high angular resolution observations over a seven-year time baseline using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we report the evidence for spiral arms following the Keplerian rotation in the dust continuum disk around the young star IM Lup. This demonstrates that GI can operate in wide-orbit planet-formation regions, establishing it as a plausible formation mechanism for such planets.</description>

      <title>Gravitational scattering of ejecta in the Didymos system cannot explain the evolution of the binary's orbital period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first few months following the DART impact on Dimorphos, it appears that the orbital period dropped by ${\sim} 30$ s in addition to the immediate ${\sim}30 $ min drop. This effect has been attributed to ``binary hardening,'' whereby the binary's orbital period would have gradually decreased as Dimorphos continuously scattered bound ejecta out of the system and lost angular momentum. We investigated this hypothesis with the goal of constraining the conditions that would lead to a gradual decrease in the binary's orbital period. We used $N$-body simulations to study the dynamical evolution of the Didymos system under the influence of a cloud of massive test particles. We demonstrate that the gravitational scattering of ejecta is not a plausible explanation for Dimorphos's anomalous orbital period drop under any circumstances. This is a result of Dimorphos's escape speed being low compared to its orbital velocity, making it a weak scatterer. If a significant fraction of DART ejecta was launched at low speeds, as impact models and scaling laws suggest, then the binary's orbital period was likely increased as this material was accreted back onto Didymos and Dimorphos. Therefore, some additional mechanism must have overcome this effect, leading to a net orbital period decrease.</description>

      <title>Runaway origins of a disc mass gradient in $\sigma$ Orionis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation from massive stars is known to significantly affect the evolution of protoplanetary discs around surrounding stars by driving external photoevaporative winds. Typically most studies assume that the massive stars driving these winds are comoving with their associated clusters. However, it is also known that massive stars can be runaways, after being violently ejected from their birth environment through interactions with other massive stars. In this letter, we show that the well studied system $\sigma~{\rm Ori~AB}$ is actually a runaway system, only now passing through $\sigma~{\rm Orionis}$. There are multiple observable features that indicate this is the case, including significantly larger proper motions for $\sigma~{\rm Orionis}$ than the surrounding stars, an infrared arc of ionising gas along the predicted velocity vector, and a disparity in protoplanetary disc masses across $\sigma~{\rm Orionis}$. We finally use protoplanetary disc evolution models to explain the observed disparity in disc masses, showing that those discs downstream of $\sigma~{\rm Ori~AB}$, i.e. those yet to encounter it, have larger masses than those upstream, consistent with observations. Overall, our work highlights the importance of understanding the dynamical history of star forming regions, since the time varying UV fields provided by runway stars results in a complex history for the evolution of the protoplanetary discs.</description>

      <title>On the lower mass limit for circumbinary disc fragmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, many wide orbit circumbinary (CB) giant planets have been discovered; some of these may have formed by gravitational fragmentation of circumbinary discs. The aim of this work is to investigate the lower mass limit for circumbinary disc fragmentation. We use the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code SEREN, which employs an approximate method for the radiative transfer, to perform 3 sets of simulations of gravitationally unstable discs. The first set of simulations covers circumstellar discs heated by a single 0.7$\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ star (CS model), the second set covers binaries with the same total stellar mass as the CS model, attended by circumbinary discs with the same temperature profile (CB fiducial model), and the third set covers circumbinary discs heated by each individual star (CB realistic model). We vary the binary separation, mass ratio and eccentricity to see their effect on disc fragmentation. For the circumstellar disc model, we find a lower disc-to-star mass ratio for fragmentation of $\sim\,$0.31. For the circumbinary fiducial disc model we find the same disc-to-star mass ratio for fragmentation (but slightly lower for more eccentric, equal-mass binaries; 0.26). On the other hand, realistic circumbinary discs fragment at a lower mass limit (disc-to-star mass ratio of 0.17\,-\,0.26), depending on the binary properties. We conclude that circumbinary discs fragment at a lower disc mass (by $\sim 45\%$) than circumstellar discs. Therefore, gas giant planet around binaries may be able to form by gravitational instability easier than around single stars.</description>

Abstract: Exoplanet imaging is a major challenge in astrophysics due to the need for high angular resolution and high contrast. We present a multi-scale statistical model for the nuisance component corrupting multivariate image series at high contrast. Integrated into a learnable architecture, it leverages the physics of the problem and enables the fusion of multiple observations of the same star in a way that is optimal in terms of detection signal-to-noise ratio. Applied to data from the VLT/SPHERE instrument, the method significantly improves the detection sensitivity and the accuracy of astrometric and photometric estimation.</description>

      <title>Metallicity dependence of dust growth in a protoplanetary disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of planet formation, growth from micron-sized grains to kilometer-sized planetesimals is a crucial question. Since the dust growth rate depends on the amount of dust, realizing planet formation scenarios based on dust growth is challenging in environments with low metallicity, i.e. less dust. We investigate dust growth during disk evolution, particularly focusing on the relationship with metallicity. We perform two-dimensional thin-disk hydrodynamic simulations to track the disk evolution over 300 kyr from its formation. The dust motion is solved separately from the gas motion, with its distribution changing due to drag forces from the gas. Dust size growth is also accounted for, with the magnitude of the drag force varying according to the dust size. We employ three models with metallicities of 1.0, 0.1, and 0.01 ${\rm Z}_{\odot}$, i.e. dust-to-gas mass ratios of 10$^{-2}$, 10$^{-3}$, and 10$^{-4}$, respectively. In the disks with the metallicities $\ge0.1$ ${\rm Z}_{\odot}$, the dust radii reach cm sizes, consistent with estimations from the dust growth timescale. Conversely, for the metallicity of 0.01 ${\rm Z}_{\odot}$, the maximum dust size is only 10$^{-2}$ cm, with almost no growth observed across the entire disk scale ($\sim$100 au). At the metallicities $\ge0.1$ ${\rm Z}_{\odot}$, the decoupling between grown dust and gas leads to non-uniform dust-to-gas mass ratios. However, deviations from the canonical value of this ratio have no impact on the gravitational instability of the disk. The formation of dust rings is confirmed in the innermost part of the disk ($\sim$10-30 au). The dust rings where the dust-to-gas mass ratio is enhanced, and the Stokes number reaches $\sim$0.1, are suitable environments for the streaming instability. We conjecture that planetesimal formation occurs through the streaming instability in these dust rings.</description>

      <title>Mapping the SO2 Shoreline in Gas Giant Exoplanets</title>

Abstract: JWST has revealed sulfur chemistry in giant exoplanet atmospheres, where molecules such as SO2 trace photochemistry, metallicity, and formation and migration. To ascertain the conditions that determine whether (or how much) SO2, H2S, and other sulfur-bearing species are present in exoplanet atmospheres, we present a grid of planetary atmospheres covering metallicities from 0.3-1000x Solar and temperatures from 250-2050 K. These models map out the 'SO2 shoreline,' the region of metallicity and irradiation for which SO2 may be sufficiently abundant to be detectable. SO2 is a sensitive indicator of metallicity; expected SO2 abundances also depend strongly on overall temperature and C/O ratio; the SO2 abundance depends surprisingly weakly on XUV irradiation, also weakly on Kzz (for Teq &gt; 600 K), and is essentially independent of internal temperature. Despite its detection in a growing number of giant planets, SO2 is never the dominant sulfur-bearing molecule: depending on temperature and metallicity, H2S, S2, NS, SO, SH, and even S8 or atomic S are frequently as common (or more so) as SO2. Nonetheless SO2 remains the most easily detectable sulfur-bearing species, followed by H2S, though perhaps SO and SH could be detectable in some gas giants. Aside from a pressing need for additional observational constraints on sulfur, we also identify the need for future work to account for the effects of clouds and hazes, fully self-consistent atmospheric models, 2D and 3D models, a wider range of planetary masses and radii, and studies to measure and refine reaction rates and molecular opacities of sulfur-bearing species</description>

      <title>Benchmark stars for mean stellar density and surface gravity estimates of solar-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adding an independent estimate of the mean stellar density, $\rho_{\star}$, as a constraint in the analysis of stars that host transiting exoplanets can significantly improve the precision of the planet radius estimate in cases where the light curve is too noisy to yield an accurate value of the transit impact parameter, e.g. the light curves of Earth-size planets orbiting in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars that will be obtained by the PLATO mission. I have compiled a sample of 36 solar-type stars for which analysis of high-quality light curves together with constraints on the orbital eccentricity yield mean stellar density measurements with a median error of 2.3%. Of these, 8 are in transiting exoplanet systems and 28 in eclipsing binary systems with very low mass companions that contribute &lt;0.1% of the total flux in the V band. A re-calibrated empirical relation for stellar mass as a function of T$_{\rm eff}$, $\rho_{\star}$ and [Fe/H] has been used to find mass estimates with a typical precision of 5.2% for the stars in this sample. Examples are given of how this sample can be used to test the accuracy and precision of $\rho_{\star}$ and log(g) estimates from catalogues of stellar parameters for solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>21st-Century Astrobiology Missions Should Seek These High-Confidence Biosignatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This white paper was submitted to NASA's Search For Life Science Analysis Group (SFL-SAG): To ensure that the first mission designed to seek signs of extant life since 1976 is able to produce an unambiguous biological interpretation, the SFL-SAG is tasked with identifying the most high-confidence, agnostic biosignatures which are targetable, detectable, and measurable in Martian subsurface mid-latitude ice. To aid in this effort, this white paper highlights three examples of target materials or phenomena, along with associated instrument concepts, which the SFL-SAG shall prioritize in its efforts to define the appropriate astrobiological strategy. These include 1) polyelectrolyte informational biopolymers, 2) macromolecular biological homochirality, and 3) chiral-specific metabolic reactions. The Agnostic Life Finding Association (ALFA) and University of Florida (UF) support the development of instrumentation that seeks these high-confidence biosignatures.</description>
