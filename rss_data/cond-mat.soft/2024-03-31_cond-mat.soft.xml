      <title>Synthetic Oil Gels With Organoclays In The Formulation Of Magnetorheological Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetorheological fluids (MRF) are smart composite materials that, under an external magnetic field, show a reversible solid-liquid transition in less than 10 ms. This study aimed to evaluate which organoclays would jellify a synthetic oil for the formulation of MRF. Three dispersant additives for carbonyl iron powder were evaluated. Fifteen different gelling additives from four clay families, bentonites, hectorites, montmorillonites, and mixed mineral thixotropes (MMT), were dispersed in oil only, keeping the same concentration, without iron particles. The gels were then tested through amplitude and frequency sweeps in oscillatory rheometry to evaluate their viscoelastic behavior. All the MRFs were prepared using carbonyl iron powder HS in oil gels with the same organoclay. All three dispersant additives showed a thixotropic recovery above 100% in the three-interval test. Regarding the dispersibility after one year, the MRF formulations with octan-1-amine and lecithin were reproved, as they reached normal force peaks of 19 and 24 N, while the work was 28 and 415 mJ, respectively. The best MRF was formulated with octan-1-ol, and resulted in a normal force of 0.33 N and 3.4 mJ at 35 mm of vane penetration. Therefore, we conclude that the MRF with octan-1-ol and montmorillonite #6 showed a better balance between thixotropy, MR effect, and, above all, good redispersibility.</description>

      <title>Ion-Mediated Structural Discontinuities in Phospholipid Vesicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite intense research, methods for controlling soft matter's spontaneous self-assembly in-to well-defined layers remain a significant challenge. We observed ion-induced structural disconti-nuities of phospholipid vesicles that can be exploited for controlled self-assembly of soft materials. We used dynamic light scattering, zeta-potential measurement, cryo-electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray, and small-angle neutron scattering. All the experimental observations indicate that de-clining solvent quality and increasing osmotic pressure direct lipids to expel preferentially to the inner compartment. Upon reaching a critical concentration, excess lipids can form a new bilayer. This spontaneous self-assembly process causes simultaneous shrinkage of the aqueous core and expansion of the vesicle. This approach opens an intriguing path for controlling the self-assembly of bioinspired colloids, which can also serve as a vehicle to control the polymerization of multilayer polymeric systems.</description>

      <title>Size-dependent fracture in elastomers: experiments and continuum modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastomeric materials display a complicated set of stretchability and fracture properties that strongly depend on the flaw size, which has long been of interest to engineers and materials scientists. Here, we combine experiments and numerical simulations for a comprehensive understanding of the nonlocal, size-dependent features of fracture in elastomers. We show the size-dependent fracture behavior is quantitatively described through a nonlocal continuum model. The key ingredient of the nonlocal model is the use of an intrinsic length scale associated with a finite fracture process zone, which is inferred from experiments. Of particular importance, our experimental and theoretical approach passes the critical set of capturing key aspects of the size-dependent fracture in elastomers. Applications to a wide range of synthetic elastomers that exhibit moderate (~100%) to extreme stretchability (~1000%) are presented, which is also used to demonstrate the applicability of our approach in elastomeric specimens with complex geometries.</description>

      <title>From cell intercalation to flow, the importance of T1 transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the context of epithelial monolayers, T1 transitions, also known as cell-intercalations, are topological rearrangements of cells that contribute to fluidity of the epithelial monolayers. We use a multi-phase field model to show that the ensemble-averaged flow profile of a T1 transition exhibits a saddle point structure, where large velocities are localised near cells undergoing T1 transitions, contributing to vortical flow. This tissue fluidisation corresponds to the dispersion of cells relative to each other. While the temporal evolution of the mean pair-separation distance between initially neighbouring cells depends on specific model details, the mean pair-separation distance increases linearly with the number of T1 transitions, in a way that is robust to model parameters.</description>

      <title>Crystallization morphology and self-assembly of polyacrylamide solutions during evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigated crystallization and self-assembly phenomena in polyacrylamide (PAM) solutions during evaporation. As the solvent gradually evaporated, microscopic crystals began to form in the solution. The results show that concentration gradients form as the solution evaporates, leading to varied crystalline morphologies. From the edge to the center of the PAM solution, grass-like structures with intricate vein-like patterns and irregular morphologies were formed. The concentration gradient played a crucial role in this process. The relationship between the concentration gradient and crystalline structures was elucidated using absorbance spectroscopy. Schematics and absorbance spectra illustrate the evolution of the crystallization stages. Our findings not only contribute to a fundamental understanding of colloidal self-assembly but also hold significant implications for various applications, including thin-film fabrication, drug delivery, and nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Confinement and magnetic field effect on chiral ferroelectric nematic in Grandjean-Cano wedge cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the structure and magnetic field response of edge dislocations in Grandjean-Cano wedge cells filled with chiral mixtures of the ferroelectric nematic mesogen DIO. Upon cooling, the ordering changes from paraelectric in the cholesteric phase N* to antiferroelectric in the smectic SmZ_A* and to ferroelectric in the cholesteric N_F*. Dislocations of the Burgers vector b equal the helicoidal pitch P are stable in all three phases, while dislocations with b=P/2 exist only in the N* and SmZ_A*. The b=P/2 dislocations split into pairs of {\tau}(-1/2) {\lambda}(+1/2) disclinations, while the thick dislocations b=P are pairs of nonsingular {\lambda}(-1/2) {\lambda}(+1/2) disclinations. The polar order makes the {\tau}(-1/2) disclinations unstable in the N_F* phase, as they should be connected to singular walls in the polarization field. We propose a model of transformation of the composite {\tau}(-1/2) line-wall defect into a nonsingular {\lambda}(-1/2) disclination, which is paired up with a {\lambda}(+1/2) line to form a b=P dislocation. The SmZ_A* behavior in the in-plane magnetic field is different from that of the N_F* and N*: the dislocations show no zigzag instability, and the pitch remains unchanged in the magnetic fields up to 1 T. The behavior is associated with the finite compressibility of smectic layers.</description>

      <title>Bridging Microscopic Dynamics and Hydraulic Permeability in Mechanically-Deformed Nanoporous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of nanoconfined fluids, there are striking examples of deformation/transport coupling in which mechanical solicitation of the confining host and dynamics of the confined fluid impact each other. While this intriguing behavior can be potentially used for practical applications (e.g. energy storage, phase separation, catalysis), the underlying mechanisms remain to be understood as they challenge existing frameworks. Here, using molecular simulations analyzed through concepts inherent to interfacial fluids, we investigate fluid flow in compliant nanoporous materials subjected to external mechanical stresses. We show that the pore mechanical properties significantly affect fluid flow as they lead to significant pore deformations and different density layering at the interface accounted for by invoking interfacial viscous effects. Despite such poromechanical effects, we show that the thermodynamic properties (i.e. adsorption) can be linked consistently to Darcy's law for the permeability by invoking a pore size definition based on the concept of Gibbs' dividing surface. In particular, regardless of the pore stiffness and applied external stress, all data can be rationalized by accounting for the fluid viscosity and slippage at the interface independent of a specific pore size definition. Using such a formalism, we establish that the intimate relation - derived using the linear response theory - between collective diffusivity and hydraulic permeability remains valid. This allows for linking consistently microscopic dynamics experiments and permeability experiments on fluid flow in compliant nanoporous materials.</description>

      <title>Beyond Local Structures In Critical Supercooled Water Through Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of a second critical point in water has been a topic of intense investigation for the last few decades. The molecular origins underlying this phenomenon are typically rationalized in terms of the competition between local high-density (HD) and low-density (LD) structures. Their identification often require designing parameters that are subject to human intervention. Herein, we use unsupervised learning to discover structures in atomistic simulations of water close to the Liquid-Liquid Critical point (LLCP). Encoding the information of the environment using local descriptors, we do not find evidence for two distinct thermodynamic structures. In contrast, when we deploy non-local descriptors that probe instead heterogeneities on the nanometer length scale, this leads to the emergence of LD and HD domains rationalizing the microscopic origins of the density fluctuations close to criticality.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the wetting behavior of solid surfaces by water-like models within a density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the analysis of predictions of a classical density functional theory for associating fluids with different association strength concerned with wetting of solid surfaces. The four associating sites water-like models with non-associative square-well attraction parametrized by Clark et al. [Mol. Phys., 2006, 104, 3561] are considered. The fluid-solid potential is assumed to have a 10-4-3 functional form. The growth of water film on the substrate upon changing the chemical potential is described. The wetting and prewetting critical temperatures, as well as the prewetting phase diagram are evaluated for different fluid-solid attraction strength from the analysis of the adsorption isotherms. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the contact angle is obtained from the Young equation. It yields estimates for the wetting temperature as well. Theoretical findings are compared with experimental results and in a few cases with data from computer simulations. The theory is successful and quite accurate in describing the wetting temperature and contact angle changes with temperature for different values of fluid-substrate attraction. Moreover, the method provides an easy tool to study other associating fluids on solids of importance for chemical engineering, in comparison with laboratory experiments and computer simulations.</description>

      <title>On the Renormalisation group, protein folding, and naturalness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14755v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I am showing how the ideas behind the renormalisation group can be generalised in order to produce the desired reduction in the degrees of freedom other that the ones considered up to now. Instead of looking only at the renormalisation group flow, inspiration from optimisation tools for regulators of truncated theories is used to show that there exists another mathematical structure in the morphisms between various renormalisation groups, characterised by their operations, encoded by means of various regularisation functions. This expands the idea of renormalisation group to a renormalisation category. A group structure exists at the level of those morphisms, leading to new information emerging in the flowing process. Impact on problems like the naturalness and protein folding is being presented briefly.</description>
