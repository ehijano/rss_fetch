      <title>The Depth Poset under Transpositions in the Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The depth poset of a filtered Lefschetz complex reflects the dependencies between the cancellations of different shallow birth-death pairs. Using the fast algorithms for computing the depth poset in the present work and for updating the persistence diagram under transpositions (Vineyard persistence), we give a complete case analysis of how transpositions of cells in the filter affect the depth poset. In addition, we present statistics on the depth poset for random point data and its sensitivity to the transpositions that occur in random straight-line homotopies.</description>

      <title>Posets of decompositions in spherical buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose definitions of the common bases complex, the poset of decompositions, and the poset of partial decompositions for arbitrary spherical buildings. We show that the poset of decompositions is Cohen-Macaulay, and that the poset of partial decompositions is spherical and homotopy equivalent to the common bases complex. To prove these results, we rely on the concepts of opposition, Levi spheres, and convexity in buildings.
  In particular, our results extend the already known constructions for the linear case (vector spaces) to arbitrary buildings. As a byproduct, we see that the poset of ordered partial decompositions carries the square of the Steinberg representation.</description>

      <title>On the Classification of $S^3$-Bundles over $\mathbb{C}P^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a classification of the total spaces of $S^3$-bundles over $\mathbb{C}P^2$ up to orientation-preserving homotopy equivalence. Our approach proceeds in two steps: we first derive the PL-homeomorphism classification for these manifolds by computing their Kreck-Stolz invariants. Then, building upon this PL classification result and through an application of surgery theory, we establish the homotopy equivalence classification.</description>

      <title>Real isotropic motivic spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the category of real isotropic motivic spectra, and show that the real realization functor from motivic spectra over $\mathbb{R}$ to classical spectra factors through it. We then describe its cellular subcategory as a one-parameter deformation of the category of spectra, with parameter $\rho$ corresponding to $-1 \in \mathbb{R}^{\times}$, whose special fiber is the derived category of comodules over the dual Steenrod algebra. This leads to an identification of real isotropic cellular spectra with $\mathbb{F}_2$-synthetic spectra, and sheds light on the relation between motivic homotopy theory over $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{F}_2$-synthetic homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>Oriented Grassmannian Bundle, Normal Curvature Reduction, and Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a smooth closed orientable submanifold $M \subset \mathbb{R}^D$ with narrow cycles. We embed $M$ into a scaled oriented Grassmannian bundle via the Gauss map in order to enlarge the scale of these cycles. Under mild assumptions, we show that this embedding reduces the normal curvature of the embedded submanifold in directions where the original normal curvature is large. For smooth closed hypersurfaces, we further show that this construction increases the distance between antipodal points of narrow cycles for fixed volume.
  We then obtain an explicit range of radii for which the ambient \v{C}ech complex on this Grassmannian bundle is homotopy equivalent to the embedded manifold, yielding lower bounds on the scales at which the \v{C}ech filtration recovers the homology of $M$. Since the distance induced by the embedding depends on both positions and oriented tangent spaces, we work with Whitney $C^1$ convergence of embeddings and prove that the associated \v{C}ech persistent homology is stable with respect to the interleaving distance. Finally, we describe a procedure for computing a distance matrix for a finite subset with respect to this embedding and illustrate the construction on several examples, including an approximate quasi-halo orbit in the Saturn--Enceladus system.</description>

      <title>Quantum topological Hochschild homology and annular Khovanov spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological Hochschild homology is a topological analogue of classical Hochschild homology of algebras and bimodules. Beliakova, Putyra, and Wehrli introduced quantum Hochschild homology (qHH) and used it to define a quantization of annular Khovanov homology as qHH of the tangle bimodules of Chen-Khovanov and Stroppel. After introducing quantum topological Hochschild homology (qTHH), we construct a new stable homotopy refinement of quantum annular Khovanov homology and show that it agrees with qTHH of the spectral Chen-Khovanov tangle bimodules of Lawson, Lipshitz, and Sarkar. We also show that this new stable homotopy refinement recovers the construction introduced in earlier work of Krushkal together with the first and third authors.</description>

      <title>Modeling $(\infty,1)$-categories with Segal spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a model structure for $(\infty,1)$-categories on the category of simplicial spaces, whose fibrant objects are the Segal spaces. In particular, we show that it is Quillen equivalent to the models of $(\infty,1)$-categories given by complete Segal spaces and Segal categories. We furthermore prove that this model structure has desirable properties: it is cartesian closed and left proper. As applications, we get a simple description of the inclusion of categories into $(\infty,1)$-categories and of homotopy limits of $(\infty,1)$-categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1904.07352v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theorem of Lurie and Pridham establishes a correspondence between formal moduli problems and differential graded Lie algebras in characteristic zero, thereby formalising a well-known principle in deformation theory. We introduce a variant of differential graded Lie algebras, called partition Lie algebras, in arbitrary characteristic. We then explicitly compute the homotopy groups of free algebras, which parametrise operations. Finally, we prove generalisations of the Lurie-Pridham correspondence classifying formal moduli problems via partition Lie algebras over an arbitrary field, as well as over a complete local base.</description>

      <title>All Segal objects are generalised monads in spans</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Barwick's and Haugseng's construction of the double $\infty$-category of spans in a pullback-complete $\infty$-category $\mathfrak{C}$ to more general shapes: for a large class of algebraic patterns $\mathfrak{P}$, we define a $\mathfrak{P}$-monoidal $\infty$-category of $\mathfrak{P}$-shaped spans in $\mathfrak{C}$, and we identify $\mathfrak{P}$-monads in it with Segal $\mathfrak{P}$-objects in $\mathfrak{C}$. For the cell pattern $\Theta^{\mathrm{op}}$, this recovers a homotopical reformulation of Batanin's original definition of weak $\omega$-categories, and in general can be seen as a variant of the generalised multicategories of Burroni, Hermida, Leinster and Cruttwell-Shulman.</description>

      <title>Faster computation of Whitney stratifications and their minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe two new algorithms for the computation of Whitney stratifications of real and complex algebraic varieties. The first algorithm is a modification of the algorithm of Helmer and Nanda (HN), but is made more efficient by using techniques for equidimensional decomposition rather than computing the set of associated primes of a polynomial ideal at a key step in the HN algorithm. We note that this modified algorithm may fail to produce a minimal Whitney stratification even when the HN algorithm would produce a minimal stratification.
  The second algorithm coarsens a given Whitney stratification of a complex variety to the unique minimal Whitney stratification; we refer to this as the minimization of a stratification. The theoretical basis for our approach is a classical result of Teissier. To our knowledge this yields the first algorithm for computing a minimal Whitney stratification.</description>

      <title>Duals of Higher Vector Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of ``$n$-dual'' to a simplicial vector space for $n\ge 0$. Coming with it, there is a canonical pairing, which we show to be non-degenerate up to homotopy for homotopy $n$-types. As a result this notion of duality is reflexive up to homotopy for $n$-types. In particular the same properties hold for $n$-groupoid objects in vector spaces, whose $n$-duals are again such $n$-groupoid objects. We study this construction in the context of the Dold-Kan correspondence and we reformulate the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem, which classically controls monoidality of the Dold-Kan functors, in terms of internal homs. We compute explicitly the 1-dual of a groupoid object and the 2-dual of a 2-groupoid object in the category of vector spaces. As the 1-dual of a groupoid object, we recover its dual as a $\mathsf{VB}$ groupoid over a point.</description>

      <title>Isotropic motivic fundamental groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to study relative versions of the category of modules over the isotropic motivic Brown-Peterson spectrum, with a particular emphasis on their cellular subcategories. Using techniques developed by Levine, we equip these categories with motivic $t$-structures, whose hearts are Tannakian categories over ${\mathbb F}_2$. This allows to define isotropic motivic fundamental groups, and to interpret relative isotropic Tate motives in the heart as their representations. Moreover, we compute these groups in the cases of the punctured projective line and split tori. Finally, we also apply Spitzweck's derived approach to establish an identification between relative isotropic Tate motives and representations of certain affine derived group schemes, whose 0-truncations coincide with the aforementioned isotropic motivic fundamental groups.</description>

      <title>A type-theoretic definition of lax $(\infty,\infty)$-limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a purely syntactic notion of lax cones and $(\infty,\infty)$-limits on finite computads in \texttt{CaTT}, a type theory for $(\infty,\infty)$-categories due to Finster and Mimram. Conveniently, finite computads are precisely the contexts in \texttt{CaTT}. We define a cone over a context to be a context, which is obtained by induction over the list of variables of the underlying context. In the case where the underlying context is globular we give an explicit description of the cone and conjecture that an analogous description continues to hold also for general contexts. We use the cone to control the types of the term constructors for the universal cone. The implementation of the universal property follows a similar line of ideas. Starting with a cone as a context, a set of context extension rules produce a context with the shape of a transfor between cones, i.e.~a higher morphism between cones. As in the case of cones, we use this context as a template to control the types of the term constructor required for universal property.</description>

      <title>On exact categories and their stable envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Klemenc's stable envelope of exact $\infty$-categories induces an equivalence between stable $\infty$-categories with a bounded heart structure and weakly idempotent complete exact $\infty$-categories. Moreover, we generalise the Gillet-Waldhausen theorem to the connective algebraic K-theory of exact $\infty$-categories and deduce a universal property of connective algebraic K-theory as an additive invariant on exact $\infty$-categories.
  A key tool is a generalisation of a theorem due to Keller which provides a sufficient condition for an exact functor to induce a fully faithful functor on stable envelopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stable Sp-decompositions of the cokernel of the Johnson homomorphism. Continuing the work of Conant in 2016, which identified the 1-loop part of the Johnson cokernel as the Enomoto-Satoh obstruction, we study the 2-loop part. Using the corresponding 2-loop trace map, we capture all the components of the Johnson cokernels in degree 6 that cannot be detected by the Enomoto-Satoh trace.</description>
