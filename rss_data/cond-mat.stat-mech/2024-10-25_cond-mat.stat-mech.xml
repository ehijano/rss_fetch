      <title>Speech perception: a model of word recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model of speech perception which takes into account effects of correlations between sounds. Words in this model correspond to the attractors of a suitably chosen descent dynamics. The resulting lexicon is rich in short words, and much less so in longer ones, as befits a reasonable word length distribution. We separately examine the decryption of short and long words in the presence of mishearings. In the regime of short words, the algorithm either quickly retrieves a word, or proposes another valid word. In the regime of longer words, the behaviour is markedly different. While the successful decryption of words continues to be relatively fast, there is a finite probability of getting lost permanently, as the algorithm wanders round the landscape of suitable words without ever settling on one.</description>

      <title>Effects of Disorder in a Single-site anisotropic XY ferromagnet: A Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform Monte Carlo simulation to study the effects of random disorder on equilibrium phase transition of three three-dimensional single-site anisotropic XY ferromagnetnet. The disorder is incorporated in two ways; having a randomly distributed anisotropy and presence of a quenched random field. We show that the critical temperature of ferro-para transition increases with an increase in strength of constant anisotropy. In contrast, the system gets ordered at lower temperatures if the anisotropy has random distribution. The effects of quenched random fields are also studied in single-site anisotropic XY ferromagnet. The transition temperature reduces due to the presence of quenched random field. The compensating field (the required amount of field which preserves the critical temperature for isotropic XY ferromagnet) linearly depends on the strength of constant single-site anisotropy. We compute the magnetic and susceptibility exponent ratios for constant single-site anisotropic XY system only via detailed finite-size scaling analysis.</description>

      <title>Persistence exponents of self-interacting random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistence exponent, which characterises the long-time decay of the survival probability of stochastic processes in the presence of an absorbing target, plays a key role in quantifying the dynamics of fluctuating systems. Determining this exponent for non-Markovian processes is known to be a difficult task, and exact results remain scarce despite sustained efforts. In this Letter, we consider the fundamental class of self-interacting random walks (SIRWs), which display long-range memory effects that result from the interaction of the random walker at time $t$ with the territory already visited at earlier times $t'&lt;t$. We compute exactly the persistence exponent for all physically relevant SIRWs. As a byproduct, we also determine the splitting probability of these processes. Besides their intrinsic theoretical interest, these results provide a quantitative characterization of the exploration process of SIRWs, which are involved in fields as diverse as foraging theory, cell biology, and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Giant density fluctuations in locally hyperuniform states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems driven far from equilibrium may exhibit anomalous density fluctuations: active matter with orientational order display giant density fluctuations at large scale, while systems of interacting particles close to an absorbing phase transition may exhibit hyperuniformity, suppressing large-scale density fluctuations. We show that these seemingly incompatible phenomena can coexist in nematically ordered active systems, provided activity is conditioned to particle contacts. We characterize this unusual state of matter and unravel the underlying mechanisms simultaneously leading to spatially enhanced (on large length scales) and suppressed (on intermediate length scales) density fluctuations. Our work highlights the potential for a rich phenomenology in active matter systems in which particles' activity is triggered by their local environment, and calls for a more systematic exploration of absorbing phase transitions in orientationally-ordered particle systems.</description>

      <title>Dielectric and Structural Study of Water with Various NaCl Concentrations via Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specifically, we examine concentrations from [NaCl]=1m to [NaCl]=6m, where 6.1m represents the solubility threshold of NaCl in H2O. For the water model, we employ the flexible TIP4P/$\epsilon_{Flex}$ model, which offers an enhanced reproduction of various properties compared to other flexible models and non-polarisable rigid models. This includes improvements in the prediction of the infrared spectrum. For the ions, we utilise two distinct models: NaCl/Madrid and NaCl/$\epsilon$, allowing for a comparative analysis of their impact on the system's behaviour.</description>

      <title>More on the Operator Space Entanglement (OSE): R\'enyi OSE, revivals, and integrability breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the R\'enyi Operator Space Entanglement ($OSE$) entropies $S_n$ across several one-dimensional integrable and chaotic models. As a paradigmatic integrable system, we first consider the so-called rule $54$ chain. Our numerical results reveal that the R\'enyi $OSE$ entropies of diagonal operators with nonzero trace saturate at long times, in contrast with the behavior of von Neumann entropy. Oppositely, the R\'enyi entropies of traceless operators exhibit logarithmic growth with time, with the prefactor of this growth depending in a nontrivial manner on $n$. Notably, at long times, the complete operator entanglement spectrum ($ES$) of an operator can be reconstructed from the spectrum of its traceless part. We observe a similar pattern in the $XXZ$ chain, suggesting universal behavior. Additionally, we consider dynamics in nonintegrable deformations of the $XXZ$ chain. Finite-time corrections do not allow to access the long-time behavior of the von Neumann entropy. On the other hand, for $n&gt;1$ the growth of the entropies is milder, and it is compatible with a sublinear growth, at least for operators associated with global conserved quantities. Finally, we show that in finite-size integrable systems, $S_n$ exhibit strong revivals, which are washed out when integrability is broken.</description>

      <title>A universal inequality on the unitary 2D CFT partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the conjecture proposed by Hartman, Keller and Stoica [HKS14]: the grand-canonical free energy of a unitary 2D CFT with a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12}+\epsilon$ and below the twist $\frac{c}{12}$ is universal in the large $c$ limit for all $\beta_L\beta_R \neq 4\pi^2$.
  The technique of the proof allows us to derive a one-parameter (with parameter $\alpha\in(0,1]$) family of universal inequalities on the unitary 2D CFT partition function with general central charge $c\geqslant 0$, using analytical modular bootstrap. We derive an iterative equation for the domain of validity of the inequality on the $(\beta_L,\beta_R)$ plane. The infinite iteration of this equation gives the boundary of maximal-validity domain, which depends on the parameter $\alpha$ in the inequality.
  In the $c \to \infty$ limit, with the additional assumption of a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12} + \epsilon$ and the twist $\frac{\alpha c}{12}$ (with $\alpha \in (0,1]$ fixed), our inequality shows that the grand-canonical free energy exhibits a universal large $c$ behavior in the maximal-validity domain. This domain, however, does not cover the entire $(\beta_L, \beta_R)$ plane, except in the case of $\alpha = 1$. For $\alpha = 1$, this proves the conjecture proposed by [HKS14], and for $\alpha &lt; 1$, it quantifies how sparseness in twist affects the regime of universality. Furthermore, this implies a precise lower bound on the temperature of near-extremal BTZ black holes, above which we can trust the black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>KMS states of Information Flow in Directed Brain Synaptic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain's synaptic network, characterized by parallel connections and feedback loops, drives information flow between neurons through a large system with infinitely many degrees of freedom. This system is best modeled by the graph $C^*$-algebra of the underlying directed graph, the Toeplitz-Cuntz-Krieger algebra, which captures the diversity of potential information pathways. Coupled with the gauge action, this graph algebra defines an {\em algebraic quantum system}, and here we demonstrate that its thermodynamic properties provide a natural framework for describing the dynamic mappings of information flow within the network. Specifically, we show that the KMS states of this system yield global statistical measures of neuronal interactions, with computational illustrations based on the {\em C. elegans} synaptic network.</description>

      <title>A gauge-invariant formulation of optical responses in superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductors are often discussed in the mean-field approximation that breaks $U(1)$ symmetry. Since the $U(1)$ symmetry underlies the charge conservation, naive application of response theory sometimes gives results that are not gauge-invariant. We study the effect of vertex corrections on the electromagnetic responses of superconductors by employing the gauge-invariant formulation, called consistent fluctuations of order parameters, that manifestly satisfy the Ward identity. For inversion broken two-band superconductors, we find that the linear and second-order optical responses are significantly affected by vertex corrections and the conductivities near the gap energy almost completely disappear. We also investigate the linear optical responses in $d$-wave superconductors and obtained qualitatively different results compared to the result using the solution to the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The full photon vertex used in our study, manifestly satisfies the Ward identity. Our results demonstrate the fundamental importance of vertex corrections in exploring optical responses in superconductors.</description>

      <title>How combining integral equation closures with force density functional theory opens new perspectives in the study of inhomogeneous fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful framework to study inhomogeneous fluids. Its standard form is based on the knowledge of a generating free energy functional. If this is known exactly, then the results obtained by using standard DFT or its alternative, recently developed version, force-DFT, are the same. If the free energy functional is known only approximately then these two routes produce different outcomes. However, as we show in this work, force-DFT has the advantage that it is also implementable without knowledge of the free energy functional, by using instead liquid-state integral equation closures. This broadens the range of systems that can be explored, since free energy functionals are generally difficult to approximate. In this paper we explore the utility of using inhomogeneous integral equation closures within force-DFT thus demonstrating the versatility and accuracy of this new approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a single-qubit quantum measurement engine fuelled by backaction energy input. To reduce energetic costs associated with information processing, the measurement outcomes are only used with a prescribed laziness probability in the feedback step. As a result, we show that the work extracted over consecutive cycles is a second-order Markov process, analogous to a run-and-tumble process with transient anomalous diffusion. We derive exact analytical expressions for the work finite-time moments and first-passage-time statistics. Furthermore, we find the optimal laziness probability maximizing the mean power extracted per cycle.</description>

      <title>Preempting Fermion Sign Problem: Unveiling Quantum Criticality through Nonequilibrium Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notorious fermion sign problem, arising from fermion statistics, constitutes one of the main obstacles of deciphering quantum many-body systems by numerical approach. The progress in overcoming sign problem will definitely lead to a great leap in various areas of modern physics. Here, by deviating from the conventional cognition that nonequilibrium studies should be more complicated than equilibrium cases, we propose an innovative framework based on nonequilibrium critical dynamics to preempt sign problem and investigate quantum critical point in fermionic model through numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation. By virtue of universal scaling theory of imaginary-time relaxation dynamics, we demonstrate that accurate critical point and critical exponents can be obtained in the short-time stage, in which the sign problem is not severe such that the QMC is accessible. After confirming the effectiveness of the method in two typical interacting fermionic models featuring Dirac quantum critical point (QCP), we for the first time reveal the quantum phase diagram in the Hubbard model hosting $\rm SU(3)$-symmetric Dirac fermions, and find that the QCP between Dirac semi-metal and a $\lambda_8$-antiferromagnetic phase belongs to a new universality class different from the previously known Gross-Neveu transitions.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Processes In Quantum Thermodynamics: The Limits Of Irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of irreversibility in physical processes, despite the fundamentally reversible nature of quantum mechanics, remains an open question in physics. This thesis explores the intricate relationship between quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, with a particular focus on minimizing entropy production in finite-time processes. By employing tools from quantum information theory and geometric thermodynamics, we tackle the challenge of deriving irreversible thermodynamic behavior from the reversible microscopic framework of quantum mechanics. We begin with a comprehensive review of the laws of thermodynamics, setting the stage for the subsequent analyses. We introduce novel developments in quantum thermodynamics through a generalized framework for geometric thermodynamics, which enables the derivation of finite-time corrections beyond the Markovian regime. Building on this foundation, we extend Landauer's principle by incorporating a finite-time correction that highlights the necessity of strong coupling for optimal information erasure processes. This result underscores the emergence of Planckian time as a fundamental speed limit to thermalization. Additionally, we explore how collective effects can be harnessed to reduce energy dissipation in thermodynamic operations, revealing that classical correlations between systems can significantly mitigate dissipation, though this may pose new questions regarding the third law of thermodynamics. Finally, we optimize thermodynamic processes in mesoscopic systems, including quantum dot engines and information engines. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the fundamental limits of irreversibility but also open new avenues for research. Future works will focus on fully exploiting collective effects, aligning these with the third law of thermodynamics, and understanding the thermodynamic consistency of master equations.</description>

Abstract: Fractals are ubiquitous natural emergences that have gained increased attention in engineering applications, thanks to recent technological advancements enabling the fabrication of structures spanning across many spatial scales. We show how the geometries of fractals can be exploited to determine their important mechanical properties, such as the first and second moments, which physically correspond to the center of mass and the moment of inertia, using a family of complex fractals known as the dragons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10952v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuation-dissipation relations elucidate the response of near-equilibrium systems to environmental changes, with recent advances extending response theory to non-equilibrium steady states. However, a general response theory for systems evolving far from steady states has remained elusive. Using information geometry of stochastic trajectory probabilities, we derive universal thermodynamic bounds on both linear and nonlinear responses of Markov systems to environmental changes, applicable across all non-equilibrium regimes. This theory establishes a new paradigm in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, offering a unified perspective on the responsiveness of non-stationary systems to external control and environmental changes. Applicable to systems ranging from biological sensory processes to engineered responsive materials, our framework paves the way for understanding and designing complex responsiveness in far-from-equilibrium stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Exact Thermal Eigenstates of Nonintegrable Spin Chains at Infinite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12330v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) plays a major role in explaining thermalization of isolated quantum many-body systems. However, there has been no proof of the ETH in realistic systems due to the difficulty in the theoretical treatment of thermal energy eigenstates of nonintegrable systems. Here, we write down analytically thermal eigenstates of nonintegrable spin chains. We consider a class of theoretically tractable volume-law states, which we call entangled antipodal pair (EAP) states. These states are thermal, in the most fundamental sense that they are indistinguishable from the Gibbs state with respect to all local observables, with infinite temperature. We then identify Hamiltonians having the EAP state as an eigenstate and rigorously show that some of these Hamiltonians are nonintegrable. Furthermore, a thermal pure state at an arbitrary temperature is obtained by the imaginary time evolution of an EAP state. Our results offer a potential avenue for providing a provable example of the ETH.</description>

      <title>On the Definition of Velocity in Discrete-Time, Stochastic Langevin Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically develop beneficial and practical velocity measures for accurate and efficient statistical simulations of the Langevin equation with direct applications to computational statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics sampling. Recognizing that the existing velocity measures for the most statistically accurate discrete-time Verlet-type algorithms are inconsistent with the simulated configurational coordinate, we seek to create and analyze new velocity companions that both improve existing methods as well as offer practical options for implementation in existing computer codes. The work is based on the set of GJ methods that, of all methods, for any time step within the stability criteria correctly reproduces the most basic statistical features of a Langevin system; namely correct Boltzmann distribution for harmonic potentials and correct transport in the form of drift and diffusion for linear potentials. Several new and improved velocities exhibiting correct drift are identified, and we expand on an earlier conclusion that, generally, only half-step velocities can exhibit correct, time-step independent Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions. Specific practical and efficient algorithms are given in familiar forms, and these are used to numerically validate the analytically derived expectations. One especially simple algorithm is highlighted, and the ability of one of the new on-site velocities to produce statistically correct averages for a particular damping value is specified.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Spectrum as a diagnostic of chirality of Topological Spin Liquids: Analysis of an $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ PEPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the key question of representation of chiral topological quantum states in (2+1) dimensions (i.e., with non-zero chiral central charge) by Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS). A noted result (due to Wahl, Tu, Schuch, and Cirac [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 236805 (2013)], and Dubail and Read [Phys. Rev. B 92, 205307 (2015)]) says that this is possible for non-interacting fermions, but the answer is as yet unknown for interacting systems. Characteristic counting of degeneracies of low-lying states in the entanglement spectrum (ES) at fixed transverse momentum of bipartitioned long cylinders ("Li-Haldane counting") provides often-used supporting evidence for chirality. However, non-chiral PEPS (with zero chiral central charge), yet with strong breaking of time-reversal and reflection symmetries, with invariance under the product of these two operations (i.e., "apparently" chiral states), are known whose low-lying ES exhibits the same Li-Haldane counting as a chiral state in certain topological sectors [Kure\v{c}i\'c, Vanderstraeten, and Schuch, Phys. Rev. B 99, 045116 (2019); Arildsen, Schuch, and Ludwig, Phys. Rev. B 108, 245150 (2023)]. In the present work, we identify a distinct indicator and hallmark of chirality in the ES of PEPS with global $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ symmetry: the splittings of conjugate irreps. We prove that in the ES of the chiral states conjugate irreps are exactly degenerate, because the operators that would split them [related to the cubic Casimir invariant of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$] are forbidden. By contrast, in the ES of non-chiral states, conjugate splittings are demonstrably non-vanishing. Such a diagnostic provides an unambiguous and powerful tool to distinguish chiral and non-chiral topological states in (2+1) dimensions via their entanglement spectra.</description>

      <title>Weak ergodicity breaking transition in randomly constrained model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experiments in Rydberg atoms have recently found unusually slow decay from a small number of special initial states. We investigate the robustness of such long-lived states (LLS) by studying an ensemble of locally constrained random systems with tunable range $\mu$. Upon varying $\mu$, we find a transition between a thermal and a weakly non-ergodic (supporting a finite number of LLS) phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LLS observed in the experiments disappear upon the addition of small perturbations so that the transition reported here is distinct from known ones. We then show that the LLS dynamics explores only part of the accessible Hilbert space, thus corresponding to localisation in Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Synergistic signatures of group mechanisms in higher-order systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between causal mechanisms and emerging collective behaviors is a central aspect of understanding, controlling, and predicting complex networked systems. In our work, we investigate the relationship between higher-order mechanisms and higher-order behavioral observables in two representative models with group interactions: a simplicial Ising model and a social contagion model. In both systems, we find that group (higher-order) interactions show emergent synergistic (higher-order) behavior. The emergent synergy appears only at the group level and depends in a complex, non-linear way on the trade-off between the strengths of the low- and higher-order mechanisms and is invisible to low-order behavioral observables. Our work sets the basis for systematically investigating the relation between causal mechanisms and behavioral patterns in complex networked systems with group interactions, offering a robust methodological framework to tackle this challenging task.</description>

      <title>Stark Many-Body Localisation Under Periodic Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stability of localisation under periodic driving in many-body Stark systems. We find that localisation is stable except near special resonant frequencies, where resonances cause delocalisation. We provide approximate analytical arguments and numerical evidence in support of these results. This shows that disorder-free broken ergodicity is stable to driving, opening up the way to studying nonequilibrium driven physics in a novel setting.</description>

      <title>Everything everywhere all at once, a probability-based enhanced sampling approach to rare events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of studying rare events is central to many areas of computer simulations. In a recent paper [Kang, P., et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 4, 451-460, 2024], we have shown that a powerful way of solving this problem passes through the computation of the committor function, and we have demonstrated how the committor can be iteratively computed in a variational way and the transition state ensemble efficiently sampled. Here, we greatly ameliorate this procedure by combining it with a metadynamics-like enhanced sampling approach in which a logarithmic function of the committor is used as a collective variable. This integrated procedure leads to an accurate and balanced sampling of the free energy surface in which transition states and metastable basins are studied with the same thoroughness. We also show that our approach can be used in cases in which competing reactive paths are possible and intermediate metastable are encountered. In addition, we demonstrate how physical insights can be obtained from the optimized committor model and the sampled data, thus providing a full characterization of the rare event under study. We ascribe the success of this approach to the use of a probability-based description of rare events.</description>
