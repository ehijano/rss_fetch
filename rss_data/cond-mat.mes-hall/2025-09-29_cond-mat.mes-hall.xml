      <title>Real Space Imaging of Spin Scattering in Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between electron spin and molecular chirality plays a fundamental role in quantum phenomena, with significant implications for spintronics and quantum computing. The chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where chiral materials preferentially transmit electrons of a particular spin, has sparked intense interest and debate regarding its underlying mechanism. Despite extensive research, the spatial distribution of spin polarization in chiral systems, the key evidence to reveal the spin scattering mechanism in CISS, has remained experimentally elusive particularly due to complications arising from spin-orbit coupling in metal electrodes typically used in such studies. Here we show, through reflective magnetic circular dichroism measurements on chiral tellurium nanowires with graphene electrodes, that current-induced spin polarization exhibits identical signs in both the nanowire and electrodes, distinct from the presumed spin filter scenario. The observed spin polarization scales linearly with current amplitude, aligns parallel to the current direction, reverses with chirality or current flow, and demonstrates spin relaxation lengths of several micrometers into graphene. Our findings provide the first direct visualization of spatial spin distribution in chiral devices. This work establishes a new paradigm for investigating spin-dependent phenomena in chiral materials and opens avenues for developing chirality-based spintronic and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive equivalent circuit model for high overtone bulk acoustic resonators (HBARs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new and comprehensive equivalent circuit model for high overtone bulk acoustic resonators (HBARs). HBARs demonstrate several very sharp resonance modes distributed nearly periodically over a very wide frequency range. This spectrum response of HBARs offers unique advantages but poses significant modeling challenges. The proposed circuit incorporates and models the unique physical components of the HBAR: piezoelectric transducer, substrate (a perfectly periodic multimode cavity), piezoelectric coupling, and critically, the imperfectly matched transducer-substrate interface which imparts characteristic aperiodicity to the HBAR mode spectrum. By judicious use of fixed, periodic, or tightly constrained virtual lumped-element branches, and sets of branches, the model retains clear and intuitive links to the physical device, while reducing the complexity needed for fitting dense, broadband datasets. We demonstrate the validity and power of this model by simultaneously fitting measured data for 61 modes of a GaN/NbN/sapphire HBAR over a span of 1 GHz, and extracting modal parameters such as quality factors and coupling coefficients. We show that this new model is compact and yet scalable: by leveraging the inherent internal relationships in an HBAR, the model can be easily expanded to include multiple transducer overtones and envelopes, multiple distinct transducers, and spurious modes. In addition to fitting measured datasets, the new model can also be used to easily analyze various perturbations to the nominal state of the HBAR. We expect the new model to be useful for the design of classical HBAR-based oscillators, filters, and sensors, and for the integration of HBARs into quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Hexagonal boron nitride/bilayer graphene moir\'e superlattices in the Dirac-material family: energy-band engineering and carrier doping by dual gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the fabrication and transport characterization of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)/Bernal bilayer graphene (BLG) moir\'e superlattices. Due to the moir\'e effect, the hBN/BLG moir\'e superlattices exhibit an energy gap at the charge neutrality point (CNP) even in the absence of a perpendicular electric field. In BLG, the application of a perpendicular electric field tunes the energy gap at the CNP, which contrasts with single-layer graphene and is similar to the family of rhombohedral multilayer graphene. The hBN/BLG moir\'e superlattice is associated with non-trivial energy-band topology and a narrow energy band featuring a van Hove singularity. By employing a dual-gated device structure where both the perpendicular displacement field and the carrier density are individually controllable, systematic engineering of the energy-band structure can be achieved. The data presented here demonstrate the universality and diversity in the physics of hBN/BLG moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of magnetoresistance effect in $\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}/\mathrm{MgO}/\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ antiferromagnetic tunnel junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The antiferromagnets with the time-reversal symmetry broken magnetic structures possess a finite spin splitting in the momentum space, and may contribute to a realization of a finite tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect even with magnets with zero net spin polarization. In this paper, we study the TMR effect with the noncollinear antiferromagnet $\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ whose inverse $120^{\circ}$ antiferromagnetic order breaks the time-reversal symmetry. In particular, we employ the representative barrier material $\mathrm{MgO}$ as the tunnel insulator, and calculate the TMR effect in the $\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}(01\bar{1}0)/\mathrm{MgO}(110)/\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), which has an optimal geometry for the spin-orbit torque switching of the magnetic configurations. We show that a finite TMR ratio reaching $\gtrsim 1000\%$ appears in the $\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}/\mathrm{MgO}/\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ MTJs, which is due to the spin splitting properties of $\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ in the momentum space combined with the screening effect of $\mathrm{MgO}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin Hall effect in III-V semiconductors at elevated temperatures: advancing topological electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE), a hallmark of topological insulators, enables dissipationless, spin-polarized edge transport and has been predicted in various two-dimensional materials. However, challenges such as limited scalability, low-temperature operation, and the lack of robust electronic transport have hindered practical implementations. Here, we demonstrate the QSHE in an InAs/GaInSb/InAs trilayer quantum well structure operating at elevated temperatures. This platform meets key criteria for device integration, including scalability, reproducibility, and tunability via electric field. When the Fermi level is positioned within the energy gap, we observe quantized resistance values independent of device length and in both local and nonlocal measurement configurations, confirming the QSHE. Helical edge transport remains stable up to T = 60 K, with further potential for higher-temperature operation. Our findings establish the InAs/GaInSb system as a promising candidate for integration into next-generation devices harnessing topological functionalities, advancing the development of topological electronics.</description>

      <title>Antitoroidal magnets and anomalous Hall effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a theoretical model of a metallic magnetic system with an antitoroidal order. We introduce a mechanism of indirect interaction of conducting fermions with localized spins based on the tunneling processes of conducting fermions through the localized spins. We demonstrate that interaction of conducting fermions with an antitoroidal order results in odd in momentum spin-momentum locking. The interaction resembles Rashba spin-orbit coupling but breaks the time-reversal symmetry. As a result, we show that a ferromagnet with the antitoroidal order is an insulator with anomalous Hall effect occurring without any spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Selective bulk-boundary correspondence in higher-order topological insulators with anticommuting mirror and chiral symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate higher-order topological insulators protected by chiral and mirror symmetries. Using models in the BDI class, which include the prototypical topological quadrupole insulator, we show that breaking mirror symmetries that anticommute with the chiral operator leads to edge-selective bulk-boundary correspondence, with gap closings and bound states appearing only along a subset of boundaries of the same orientation. We define a new edge-sensitive topological invariant, distinguishing this mechanism from previous reports of non-topological edge-selection effects.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic In-Memory Computing with Phase-Change Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-memory computing (IMC) is an emerging non-von Neumann paradigm that leverages the intrinsic physics of memory devices to perform computations directly within the memory array. Among the various candidates, phase-change memory (PCM) has emerged as a leading non-volatile technology, showing significant promise for IMC, particularly in deep learning acceleration. PCM-based IMC is also poised to play a pivotal role in cryogenic applications, including quantum computing and deep space electronics. In this work, we present a comprehensive characterization of PCM devices across temperatures down to 5 K, covering the range most relevant to these domains. We systematically investigate key physical mechanisms such as phase transitions and threshold switching that govern device programming at low temperatures. In addition, we study attributes including electrical transport, structural relaxation, and read noise, which critically affect readout behavior and, in turn, the precision achievable in computational tasks.</description>

      <title>Multiferroicity of oxygen-deficient Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observed a superparamagnetic-type response of ultra-small (5 - 10 nm in size) Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles prepared by the solid-state organonitrate synthesis. The Raman spectra indicate the decisive role of surface defects, presumably oxygen vacancies, for all studied x = 1, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4 and significant degree "y" of oxygen deficiency. At the same time elemental analysis did not reveal any noticeable concentration of magnetic impurities in theHf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanopowders, and the X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the dominant presence (from 87 to 96 wt. %) of the orthorhombic phase. Therefore, the superparamagnetic response of the nanoparticles is explained by the appearance of magnetic state of oxygen vacancies accumulated near their surface. The Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach, density functional theory calculations and dielectric measurements reveal that the studied ultra-small Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles may have ferroelectric-like properties and giant dielectric permittivity (&gt; 10^3 - 10^5) in the frequency range 4 Hz - 10 kHz. In this work we observed that the static relative dielectric permittivity of the Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanopowders overcomes 10^6 and related the colossal values with the superparaelectric states of the ultra-small cores of the nanoparticles.Thus, obtained results open the way for the creation of silicon-compatible multiferroics - oxygen-deficient Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles with the superparamagnetic and superparaelectric properties, indispensable ultra-high k nanomaterials for advanced FETs and electronic logic elements.</description>

      <title>Noise cross-correlations from single-shot measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method that we call Single-Shot Cross-Spectroscopy (SSCS), for extracting the auto- and cross-power spectral densities of dephasing noise of a qubit pair. The method uses straightforward input, namely single-shot readouts from single-qubit Ramsey-type experiments, and is resilient against errors in state preparation and measurement. We apply it to experimental data from a semiconductor spin-qubit device and obtain noise spectra over five orders of magnitude in frequency (5 mHz--500 Hz). Compared to other techniques, SSCS enables access to noise correlations in the previously inaccessible intermediate-frequency range (1--500 Hz) for spin qubits, and can be further extended with faster readout. More broadly, the frequency range accessible with SSCS is limited only by the experiment repetition rate, and scales accordingly on other platforms.</description>

      <title>Privacy in Distributed Quantum Sensing with Gaussian Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the privacy properties of distributed quantum sensing protocols in a Gaussian quantum network, where each node encodes a parameter via a local phase shift. For networks with more than two nodes, achieving perfect privacy is possible only asymptotically, in the limit of large photon numbers. However, we show that optimized fully symmetric Gaussian states enable rapidly approaching perfect privacy while maintaining near-optimal sensing performance. We show that local homodyne detection achieves a quadratic scaling of precision with the total number of photons. We further analyze the impact of thermal noise in the preparation stage on both privacy and estimation precision. Our results pave the way for the development of practical, private distributed quantum sensing protocols in continuous-variable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Probing Fractional Quantum Hall states in weakly interacting Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum gases are used to simulate the physics of the lowest Landau level (LLL) with neutral atoms, which in the simplest setup is achieved by rotating the gas at the confining harmonic trap frequency, a requirement that is difficult to achieve in practice. We point out that for weakly interacting Fermi gases, this rapid-rotation limit is not needed to access the LLL: As a direct consequence of first-order perturbation theory, many-body wave functions of states in the LLL remain unchanged at any rotation, and only their energies shift. This implies that even in the absence of rotations or for moderate rotations frequencies, LLL states are present as excited states at finite angular momentum. For fermions with contact interactions, these states are exact eigenstates of a paradigmatic model of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) states described by a single Haldane pseudopotential ($V_1$ for spin-polarized and $V_0$ for spinful systems), which realizes exact Laughlin and Haldane wave functions. We suggest that recently developed excitation and imaging techniques for rotating few-fermion systems allow for a detailed experimental investigation of FQH wave functions and to study the crossover to large particle number. We illustrate this for $N = 6$ spin-balanced fermions</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mean-field broken symmetry phases of charge neutral multilayer rhombohedral graphene within tight-binding approximations including self-consistent extended Hubbard interactions. We used on-site and inter-site Hubbard interactions obtained from a newly developed first-principles calculation method. Our calculations for systems up to eight layers give rise to electron-hole asymmetries, band flatness, band gaps, and layer anti-ferromagnetic ground states in keeping with available experiments. By including the intersite Hubbard interactions up to the next-nearest neighboring sites, the band gaps are shown to open when the number of layers is larger than three, while the trilayer system maintains its metallic nature with two low energy density of state peaks near the Fermi energy whose separation increases with the range of inter-site Hubbard parameters. Within our framework, the calculated band gaps reflect mean-field ground states with extended Hubbard interactions, in closer agreement with experimental estimates. The tight-binding formulation further enables efficient treatment of large rhombohedral chiral systems, including twisted multilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale defects as probes of time reversal symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoscale defects such as Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers can serve as sensitive and non-invasive probes of electromagnetic fields and fluctuations from materials, which in turn can be used to characterize these systems. Here we specifically discuss how NV centers can probe time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) phenomena in low-dimensional conductors. We argue that the difference in relaxation rates $\Gamma_{\pm \hat{z}}$ of NV centers starting from $m = \pm 1$ spin states to the ground state with $m = 0$ directly probes TRSB. The effect arises from the difference in the fluctuation spectrum of left and right-polarized electromagnetic fields emanating from such materials. In the quantum Hall setting, the NV center experiences (nearly zero) large additional contribution to its relaxation due to the presence of the material when its magnetic dipole (anti-) aligns with the external field. More generally, the difference in the relaxation rates is sensitive to the imaginary part of the wave-vector dependent Hall conductivity. We argue that this can be used to determine the Hall viscosity, which can potentially distinguish candidate fractional quantum Hall states and be used to infer the pairing angular momentum in TRSB superconductors. For the latter, we consider specifically the case of TRSB in stacked twisted Bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) flakes, which have recently been investigated experimentally and are suggested to exhibit TRSB. We show that the average relaxation rate $\left[\Gamma_{+\hat{z}} + \Gamma_{-\hat{z}}\right]$ near such a system exhibits a Hebel-Slichter like enhancement below $T_c$. The difference $\Gamma_{+\hat{z}} - \Gamma_{-\hat{z}}$ also inherits this peak but is only non-zero for $T &lt; T_c$ and only in a chiral d-wave superconductor. We provide concrete estimates for observing this effect.</description>

      <title>Observation of a non-reciprocal skyrmion Hall effect of hybrid chiral skyrmion tubes in synthetic antiferromagnetic multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hybrid chiral skyrmion tube is a well-known example of a 3D topological spin texture, exhibiting an intriguing chirality transition along the thickness direction. This transition progresses from left-handed to right-handed N\'eel-type chirality, passing through a Bloch-type intermediate state. Such an exotic spin configuration potentially exhibits distinctly different dynamics from that of the common skyrmion tube that exhibits a homogeneous chirality; yet these dynamics have not been ascertained so far. Here we reveal the distinct features of current-induced dynamics that result from the hybrid chiral skyrmion tube structure in synthetic antiferromagnetic (SyAFM) multilayers. Strikingly, the SyAFM hybrid chiral skyrmion tubes exhibit a non-reciprocal skyrmion Hall effect in the flow regime. The non-reciprocity can even be tuned by the degree of magnetic compensation in the SyAFM systems. Our theoretical modeling qualitatively corroborates that the non-reciprocity stems from the dynamic oscillation of skyrmion helicity during its current-induced motion. The findings highlight the critical role of the internal degrees of freedom of these complex skyrmion tubes for their current-induced dynamics.</description>

      <title>Chirality-induced Spin-Orbit Coupling and Spin Selectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09338v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a spinor traveling along a one-dimensional helical path develops a spin-orbit coupling as a result of the curvature of the path. We estimate the magnitude of the associated spin polarization and obtain values typical of many helical molecular structures that showcase the Chirality-induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect. We find that this chirality-induced spin-orbit coupling ($\chi$-SOC), in conjunction with broken time-reversal symmetry, may be an important ingredient for the microscopic underpinning of the CISS phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Hole spin splitting in a Ge quantum dot with finite barriers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the low-energy spectrum of a single hole confined in a planar Ge quantum dot (QD) within the effective-mass formalism. The QD is sandwiched between two GeSi barriers of finite potential height grown along the [001] direction. To treat this finite barrier problem, we adopt an independent-band approach in dealing with boundary conditions. The effects of different system parameters are investigated, including the width of the out-of-plane confining well, the size of the dot, and silicon concentration in the confining layers. The more accurate finite-barrier model results in the non-negligible dependence of the anisotropic $g$-factor on the choice of boundary conditions and on the silicon concentration in the barrier. Furthermore, while the ideal model of a planar dot with a square-well heterostructure already has an intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, realistic effects arising from the experimental setup may give rise to additional contributions. We investigate the impact from the top-gate electric field and the residual tensile strain on the qubit states. The results indicate that these effects are important contributions to the total spin-orbit coupling which enables fast electric control.</description>

      <title>Orbital Hall conductivity and orbital diffusion length of Vanadium thin films by Hanle magnetoresistance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spintronics, the spin Hall effect has been widely used to generate and detect spin currents in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling such as Pt and Ta. Recently, its orbital counterpart has drawn attention as a new tool to generate and detect orbital currents and thus investigate orbital transport parameters. In this study, we investigate vanadium (V), a $3d$ transition metal with weak spin-orbit coupling but with a theoretically large orbital Hall conductivity. We measure a large Hanle magnetoresistance in V thin films with a magnitude comparable to that of heavy metals and at least one order of magnitude higher than the spin Hall magnetoresistance observed in a Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/V bilayer, pointing to the orbital Hall origin of the effect. A fit of the magnetic-field dependence and thickness dependence of the Hanle magnetoresistance to the standard diffusion model allows us to quantify the orbital diffusion length (~2 nm) and the orbital Hall conductivity (~78 ($\hbar/2e$) $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$) of V. The obtained orbital Hall conductivity is two orders of magnitude smaller than theoretical calculations of the intrinsic value, suggesting there is an important role of disorder.</description>

      <title>Dissecting intervalley coupling mechanisms in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monolayer (1L) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a unique opportunity to control the valley degree of freedom of optically excited charge carriers due to the spin-valley locking effect. Despite extensive studies of the valley-contrasting physics, stimulated by perspective valleytronic applications, a unified picture of competing intervalley coupling processes in 1L-TMDs is lacking. Here, we apply broadband helicity-resolved transient absorption to explore exciton valley polarization dynamics in 1L-WSe${}_2$. By combining experimental results with microscopic simulations, we dissect individual intervalley coupling mechanisms and reveal the crucial role of phonon-assisted scattering in the fast decay of the A exciton circular dichroism and the formation of the dichroism of opposite polarity for the B exciton. We further provide a consistent description of the valley depolarization driven by the combined action of Coulomb scattering processes and indicate the presence of efficient single spin-flip mechanisms. Our study brings us closer to a complete understanding of exciton dynamics in TMDs.</description>

Abstract: In very clean solid-state systems, where carrier-carrier interactions dominate over any other scattering mechanisms, the flow of electrons can be described within a hydrodynamic framework. In these cases, analogues of viscous fluid phenomena have been experimentally observed. However, experimental studies of electron hydrodynamics have so far been limited to the low velocity, linear response regime. At velocities approaching the speed of sound, the electronic fluid is expected to exhibit compressible behaviour where nonlinear effects and discontinuities such as shocks and choked flow have long been predicted. This compressible regime remains unexplored in electronic systems, despite its promise of strongly nonlinear flow phenomena. Here, we demonstrate compressible electron flow in bilayer graphene through an electronic de Laval nozzle, a structure that accelerates charge carriers past the electronic speed of sound, until they slow down suddenly in a shock. Discontinuities in transport measurements and local flattening of potential in Kelvin probe measurements are consistent with a viscous electron shock front and the presence of supersonic electron flow, and are not consistent with Ohmic or ballistic flow. Breaking the sound barrier in electron liquids opens the door for novel, intrinsically nonlinear electronic devices beyond the paradigm of incompressible flow.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos and Universal Trotterisation Behaviours in Digital Quantum Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.11113v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital quantum simulation (DQS) is one of the most promising paths for achieving first useful real-world applications for quantum processors. Yet even assuming rapid progress in device engineering and development of fault-tolerant quantum processors, algorithmic resource optimisation will long remain crucial to exploit their full power. Currently, Trotterisation provides state-of-the-art resource scaling. And recent theoretical studies of Trotterised Ising models suggest that even better performance than expected may be possible up to a distinct breakdown threshold in empirical performance. Here, we study multiple paradigmatic DQS models with experimentally realisable Trotterisations, and evidence the universality of a range of Trotterisation performance behaviours, including not only the threshold, but also new features in the pre-threshold regime that is most important for practical applications. In each model, we observe a distinct Trotterisation threshold shared across widely varying performance signatures; we further show that an onset of quantum chaotic dynamics causes the performance breakdown and is directly induced by digitisation errors. In the important pre-threshold regime, we are able to identify new distinct regimes displaying qualitatively different quasiperiodic performance behaviours, and show analytic behaviour for properly defined operational Trotter errors. Our results rely crucially on diverse new analytical tools, and provide a previously missing unified picture of Trotterisation behaviour across local observables, the global quantum state, and the full Trotterised unitary. This work provides new insights and tools for addressing important questions about the algorithm performance and underlying theoretical principles of sufficiently complex Trotterisation-based DQS, that will help in extracting maximum simulation power from future quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Solving Free Fermion Problems on a Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04550v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating noninteracting fermion systems is a common task in computational many-body physics. In absence of translational symmetries, modeling free fermions on $N$ modes usually requires poly$(N)$ computational resources. While often moderate, these costs can be prohibitive in practice when large systems are considered. We present several free-fermion problems that can be solved by a quantum algorithm with substantially reduced computational costs. The memory costs are exponentially improved, poly log$(N)$. The runtime improvement, compared to the best known classical algorithms, is either exponential or significantly polynomial, depending on the geometry of the problem. The simulation of free-fermion dynamics belongs to the BQP-hard complexity class. This implies (under standard assumptions) that our algorithm yields an exponential speedup for any classical algorithm at least for some geometries. The key technique in our algorithm is the block-encoding of objects such as correlation matrices and Green's functions into a unitary. We demonstrate how such unitaries can be efficiently realized as quantum circuits, in the context of dynamics and thermal states of tight-binding Hamiltonians. The special cases of disordered and inhomogeneous lattices, as well as large non-lattice graphs, are presented in detail. Finally, we show that our simulation algorithm generalizes to other promising targets, including free boson systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have analyzed the dynamics of entanglement in dissipative fermionic and bosonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models and found that, when the decoherence channel preserves the chiral symmetry, they exhibit a revival of entanglement in a wide range of parameters. This behavior only emerges in the topological phase, with the visibility of the revival dropping to zero at the phase boundary. Furthermore, the revival acquires a universal character once the system size exceeds the localization length of the edge modes. Our findings indicate that the universal entanglement revival has its origin in the topological properties of the SSH model. These dynamical properties may be experimentally accessible, for example, using photonic quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Complex gene regulatory networks often display emergent simple behavior. Sometimes this simplicity can be traced to a nearly equivalent energy landscape, but not always. Here we show how topological theory for stochastic and biochemical networks can predict phase transitions between dynamical regimes, where the simplest landscape paradigm fails. We demonstrate the utility of this topological approach for a simple gene network, revealing a new oscillatory regime in addition to previously recognized multimodal phases. We show how local winding numbers predict the steady-state locations in the single and bimodal phases, and a flux analysis predicts the respective strengths of steady-state peaks.</description>

      <title>Identifying Majorana edge and end modes in a Josephson junction of a $p$-wave superconductor with a magnetic barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical model describing a Josephson junction featuring a magnetically textured barrier within two-dimensional (2D) $p$-wave superconductor, considering both $p_x + p_y$ and $p_x + ip_y$ type pairing symmetries. Our study reveals the influence of the magnetic barrier strength and its spatial periodicity on the system's topological properties, in terms of local density of states and Josephson current calculations. Notably, we demonstrate that these parameters regulate the number of Majorana zero modes at the junction in the topological regime. Our setup further allows for the identification of three distinct topological phases, the differentiation between one-dimensional (1D) Majorana edge (either flat/dispersive and arising from intrinsic 2D $p$-wave pairing) and localized Majorana end modes, and an analysis of their hybridization through the Josephson current. In particular, the Josephson current exhibits a discontinuous jump due to the edge modes and pronounced hump in the $p_x + ip_y$ pairing case, directly linked to the hybridized Majorana modes. Moreover, our study opens a possible interesting avenue to distinguish between 1D Majorana edge modes and zero-dimensional end modes via Josephson current signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motion of a quantum particle in a one-dimensional periodic potential can be described in terms of Bloch wave packets. Like free-particle wave packets, they can propagate without attenuation. Here, we examine this similarity more closely by investigating whether Bloch wave packets can maintain a definite -- or nearly definite -- momentum direction, a property inherent to free-particle wave packets. This question is particularly relevant to the feasibility of using solid-state-based systems in the search for the first experimental realization of quantum backflow, a quantum interference effect in which a particle's probability density flows in a direction opposite to its momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses a connection between two important classes of materials, namely quasicrystals and topological insulators as exemplified by the Quantum Hall problem. It has been remarked that the quasicrystal ``inherits" topological properties from the 2D Quantum Hall model. We show this explicitly by introducing the Fibonacci-Hall model as a link between a 1D quasicrystal and the magnetic problems. We show here how Chern numbers for bands in periodic approximants of quasicrystals can be computed, along with gap labels. The Chern numbers are thus seen as a consequence of a flux parameter $\phi^S$ induced by the geometry of winding in 2D space of the quasicrystal. We show the existence of lines of Lifshitz transitions in the phase space of the model. These are marked by change of Chern number and disappearance of edge states. The proposed extrapolation method can be generalized to higher dimensional 2D and 3D quasicrystals, where higher order Chern numbers could be computed, and related to experimentally measurable transport quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a lasing system that is driven by a current of bosonic (quasi-) particles via a dissipative three-mode mixing process. A semi-classical analysis of this system predicts distinct dynamical regimes, where both the cavity mode and the gain medium can undergo lasing transitions. Of particular interest is an intermediate self-pulsing phase that exhibits the characteristics of an excitable system and converts random input signals into separated, quasi-periodic pulses at the output. By performing exact Monte-Carlo simulations, we extend this analysis into the quantum regime and show that despite being dominated by huge bosonic particle number fluctuations, this effect of coherence resonance survives even for rather low average photon numbers. Our system thus represents a intriguing model for an excitable quantum many-body system with practical relevance for quantum detectors or autonomous quantum machines. As an illustration, we discuss the realization of this system with superconducting quantum circuits and its application as a number-resolved avalanche detector for microwave photons.</description>
