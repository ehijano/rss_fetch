      <title>Generation of vortex electrons by atomic photoionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the process of orbital angular momentum (OAM) transfer from a twisted light beam to an electron in atomic ionization within the first Born approximation. The characteristics of the ejected electron are studied regardless of the detection scheme. We find that the outgoing electron possesses a definite projection of OAM when a single atom is located on the propagation axis of the photon, whereas the size of the electron wave packet is solely determined by the energy of the photon rather than by its transverse coherence length. Shifting the position of the atom yields a finite dispersion of the electron OAM. We also study a more experimentally feasible scenario -- a localized finite-sized atomic target -- and develop representative approaches to describing coherent and incoherent regimes of photoionization.</description>

      <title>X-ray Coulomb explosion imaging reveals role of molecular structure in internal conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular photoabsorption results in an electronic excitation/ionization which couples to the rearrangement of the nuclei. The resulting intertwined change of nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom determines the conversion of photoenergy into other molecular energy forms. Nucleobases are excellent candidates for studying such dynamics, and great effort has been taken in the past to observe the electronic changes induced by the initial excitation in a time-resolved manner using ultrafast electron spectroscopy. The linked geometrical changes during nucleobase photorelaxation have so far not been observed directly in time-resolved experiments. Here, we present a study on a thionucleobase, where we extract comprehensive information on the molecular rearrangement using Coulomb explosion imaging. Our measurement links the extracted deplanarization of the molecular geometry to the previously studied temporal evolution of the electronic properties of the system. In particular, the protons of the exploded molecule are well-suited messengers carrying rich information on the molecule's geometry at distinct times after the initial electronic excitation. The combination of ultrashort laser pulses to trigger molecular dynamics, intense X-ray free-electron laser pulses for the explosion of the molecule, and multi-particle coincidence detection opens new avenues for time-resolved studies of complex molecules in the gas phase.</description>

      <title>Quantum nondemolition measurement operator with spontaneous emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theory for quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements of an atomic ensemble in the presence of spontaneous emission. We derive the master equation that governs the evolution of the ground state of the atoms and the quantum state of light. Solving the master equation exactly without invoking the Holstein-Primakoff approximation and projecting out the quantum state of light, we derive a positive operator-valued measure that describes the QND measurement. We show that at high spontaneous emission conditions, the QND measurement has a unique dominant state to which the measurement collapses. We additionally investigate the behavior of the QND measurement in the limiting case of strong atom-light interactions, where we show that the positive operator valued measure becomes a projection operator. We further analyze the effect of spontaneous emission noise on atomic state preparation. We find that it limits the width of the eigenvalue spectrum available to a quantum state in a linear superposition. This effect leads to state collapse on the dominant state. We generate various non-classical states of the atom by tuning the atom-light interaction strength. We find that non-classical states such as the Schr\"odinger-cat state, whose coherence spans the entire eigenvalue spectrum of the total spin operator $J_z$ for a given spin eigenvalue $J$, lose their coherence because spontaneous emission limits the accessibility of states farther away from the dominant state.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing classical accelerometers and gyroscopes with a quantum inertial sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of inertial quantities is essential in geophysics, geodesy, fundamental physics and navigation. For instance, inertial navigation systems require stable inertial sensors to compute the position and attitude of the carrier. Here, we present the first hybridized cold-atom inertial sensor based on matter wave interferometry where the atomic measurements are used to correct the drift and bias of both an accelerometer and a gyroscope at the same time. We achieve respective bias stabilities of $7 \times 10^{-7}$ m/s$^2$ and $4 \times 10^{-7}$ rad/s after two days of integration, corresponding to a 100-fold and 3-fold increase on the stability of the hybridized sensor compared to the force-balanced accelerometer and Coriolis vibrating gyroscope operated alone. The instrument has been operated under up to 100-times the Earth rotation rate. Compared to state-of-the-art atomic gyroscope, the simplicity and scalability of our architecture make it easily extendable to a compact full six-axis inertial measurement unit, providing a pathway towards autonomous positioning and orientation using cold-atom sensors.</description>
