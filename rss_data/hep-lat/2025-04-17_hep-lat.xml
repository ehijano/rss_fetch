      <title>$D \bar D_1(2420)$ and $D^* \bar D^*(2400)$ molecular states: Probing their electromagnetic fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As in previous decades, a comprehensive understanding of the intricate internal configuration of hadrons continues to be a central objective within both experimental and theoretical hadron physics. This pursuit plays a pivotal role in advancing our knowledge of QCD and critically evaluating the robustness and accuracy of the theoretical models developed to date. Furthermore, deciphering the underlying mechanisms of exotic states, both those currently observed and those anticipated in future experiments, remains a pressing and unresolved challenge. Motivated by this, in the present study, we investigate the electromagnetic properties of the $D \bar D_1(2420)$ and $D^* \bar D^*(2400)$ molecular tetraquark states with quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{--}$, using the QCD light-cone sum rule method. These states are analyzed within a hadronic molecular framework, where their magnetic and quadrupole moments are computed to probe internal structure and geometric deformation. Our results reveal distinct electromagnetic signatures, with the magnetic moments primarily dominated by light-quark contributions, and the quadrupole moments suggesting an oblate charge distribution. The findings are compared with prior studies assuming compact tetraquark configurations, emphasizing the sensitivity of electromagnetic observables to the underlying hadronic structure. This analysis provides critical insights into the nature of exotic hadrons and contributes to the broader understanding of QCD dynamics in the non-perturbative regime.</description>

      <title>Center vortices and localized Dirac modes in the deconfined phase of (2+1)-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the deconfinement transition in (2+1)-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory both as a percolation transition of center vortices and as a localization transition for the low-lying Dirac modes. We study in detail the critical properties of the Anderson transition in the Dirac spectrum in the deconfined phase, showing that it is of BKT type; and the critical properties of the center-vortex percolation transition, showing that they differ from those of ordinary two-dimensional percolation. We then study the relation between localized modes and center vortices in the deconfined phase, identifying the simple center-vortex structures that mainly support the localized Dirac modes. As the system transitions to the confined phase, center vortices merge together into an infinite cluster, causing the low Dirac modes to delocalize.</description>

      <title>Weak interaction axial form factors of the octet baryons in nuclear medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the axial-vector and the induced pseudoscalar form factors associated with the weak transitions between the octet baryon members in nuclear medium, using a covariant constituent quark model. We extend previous calculations of the axial transition form factors from the vacuum (free space) to the nuclear medium (symmetric nuclear matter). The extension of the model to the nuclear medium takes into account the modifications of the properties of hadrons in the medium (masses and coupling constants), as determined by the quark-meson coupling model. The axial-vector ($G_A$) and the induced pseudoscalar ($G_P$) form factors are evaluated for different values of the nuclear density $\rho$ in terms of the square transfer momentum $q^2= -Q^2$. We conclude that, in general, the $G_A$ and $G_P$ form factors are reduced in the nuclear medium. The reduction is stronger for light baryons and high densities. The medium modifications are milder for the heavier octet baryons, particularly at large $Q^2$. The calculations presented here can be used to estimate the cross sections of neutrino and antineutrino scattering with nucleus, and neutrino and antineutrino scattering with hyperons bound to a nucleus, as well as those in the cores of compact stars.</description>

      <title>Holographic Hagedorn Temperature: Strong Coupling, Flavor and $\theta$-angle Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Hagedorn temperature $T_H$ of strongly coupled quantum field theories admitting a holographic string or M-theory description in various regimes and scenarios.
  In the first part of the paper we propose a ``thermal scalar'' effective approach to the calculation of $T_H$ in eleven-dimensional supergravity. The proposal allows to extend the existing results for $T_H$ to the strongly coupled string regime, i.e. to a previously unexplored regime of field theory parameters where the number of colors $N$ is smaller than (some power of) the 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$. We can thus extend the existing results for the $\alpha'$ expansion of the ABJM model, which have a spectacular agreement with predictions from integrability, in a different direction in parameter space. In particular, we explicitate the first non-perturbative corrections. We also apply the formalism to the Witten-Yang-Mills model, finding that the result for the ratio of $T_H$ with the deconfinement temperature is in the same ballpark of the lattice one for pure Yang-Mills. Within the same model, we study the dependence of the Hagedorn temperature on the $\theta$-angle.
  In the second part of the paper we analyze the effect of dynamical flavors on $T_H$ in confining theories. By studying the few available examples of regular backgrounds dual to confining theories with flavors, we find that generally the effects of flavors is to reduce the value of $T_H$ in units of the square root of the confining string tension. The effect turns out to be milder than the analogous reduction of the critical temperature for deconfinement when the latter is known.</description>
