      <title>Towards Verifiability of Total Value Locked (TVL) in Decentralized Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Total Value Locked (TVL) aims to measure the aggregate value of cryptoassets deposited in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols. Although blockchain data is public, the way TVL is computed is not well understood. In practice, its calculation on major TVL aggregators relies on self-reports from community members and lacks standardization, making it difficult to verify published figures independently. We thus conduct a systematic study on 939 DeFi projects deployed in Ethereum. We study the methodologies used to compute TVL, examine factors hindering verifiability, and ultimately propose standardization attempts in the field. We find that 10.5% of the protocols rely on external servers; 68 methods alternative to standard balance queries exist, although their use decreased over time; and 240 equal balance queries are repeated on multiple protocols. These findings indicate limits to verifiability and transparency. We thus introduce ``verifiable Total Value Locked'' (vTVL), a metric measuring the TVL that can be verified relying solely on on-chain data and standard balance queries. A case study on 400 protocols shows that our estimations align with published figures for 46.5% of protocols. Informed by these findings, we discuss design guidelines that could facilitate a more verifiable, standardized, and explainable TVL computation.</description>

      <title>Cryptocurrencies in the Balance Sheet: Insights from (Micro)Strategy -- Bitcoin Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the evolving link between cryptocurrency and equity markets in the context of the recent wave of corporate Bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategies. We assemble a dataset of 39 publicly listed firms holding BTC, from their first acquisition through April 2025. Using daily logarithmic returns, we first document significant positive co-movements via Pearson correlations and single factor model regressions, discovering an average BTC beta of 0.62, and isolating 12 companies, including Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy, MSTR), exhibiting a beta exceeding 1. We then classify firms into three groups reflecting their exposure to BTC, liquidity, and return co-movements. We use transfer entropy (TE) to capture the direction of information flow over time. Transfer entropy analysis consistently identifies BTC as the dominant information driver, with brief, announcement-driven feedback from stocks to BTC during major financial events. Our results highlight the critical need for dynamic hedging ratios that adapt to shifting information flows. These findings provide important insights for investors and managers regarding risk management and portfolio diversification in a period of growing integration of digital assets into corporate treasuries.</description>
