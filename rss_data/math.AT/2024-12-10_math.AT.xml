      <title>Sparsification of the Generalized Persistence Diagrams for Scalability through Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized persistence diagram (GPD) is a natural extension of the classical persistence barcode to the setting of multi-parameter persistence and beyond. The GPD is defined as an integer-valued function whose domain is the set of intervals in the indexing poset of a persistence module, and is known to be able to capture richer topological information than its single-parameter counterpart. However, computing the GPD is computationally prohibitive due to the sheer size of the interval set. Restricting the GPD to a subset of intervals provides a way to manage this complexity, compromising discriminating power to some extent. However, identifying and computing an effective restriction of the domain that minimizes the loss of discriminating power remains an open challenge.
  In this work, we introduce a novel method for optimizing the domain of the GPD through gradient descent optimization. To achieve this, we introduce a loss function tailored to optimize the selection of intervals, balancing computational efficiency and discriminative accuracy. The design of the loss function is based on the known erosion stability property of the GPD. We showcase the efficiency of our sparsification method for dataset classification in supervised machine learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our sparsification method significantly reduces the time required for computing the GPDs associated to several datasets, while maintaining classification accuracies comparable to those achieved using full GPDs. Our method thus opens the way for the use of GPD-based methods to applications at an unprecedented scale.</description>

      <title>On The Whisker Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explore properties of the whisker topology, which is a topology endowed on the fundamental group and whose utility is to detect locally complicated phenomena in pathological topological spaces. We show that the whisker topology preserves products, resolve an open question regarding the existence of a space which makes $\pi_1^{wh}(X,x_0)$ a non-discrete, non-abelian, and Hausdorff topological group, and show the whisker topology is not separable on the earring group $\pi_1(\Er^1,x_0)$.</description>

      <title>Abstract categorical residues and duality in Rabinowitz Floer theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the simple fact that a compact $n$-dimensional manifold-with-boundary which satisfies Poincar\'{e}-Lefschetz duality of dimension $n$ has a boundary which itself satisfies Poincar\'{e} duality of dimension $n-1$, we show that the categorical formal punctured neighborhood of infinity, a canonical categorical construction associated to every $A_{\infty}$-category, has a weak proper Calabi-Yau structure of dimension $n-1$ whenever the original $A_{\infty}$-category admits a weak smooth Calabi-Yau structure of dimension $n$. Through the functoriality in Rabinowitz Floer theory, this leads to a chain-level weak proper Calabi-Yau structure on the Rabinowitz Fukaya category of a nondegenerate Liouville manifold, which homotopically perturbs the rigid but restrictive open-string pairing. This proper Calabi-Yau structure is also related to the closed-string Rabinowitz Floer cohomology, to which we construct a geometric map from Hochschild homology of the wrapped Fukaya category with coefficients in the Rabinowitz Fukaya category, comparing the dualities in the open and closed strings.</description>

      <title>Pre-Lie algebras with divided powers and the Deligne groupoid in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to develop a deformation theory controlled by pre-Lie algebras with divided powers over a ring of positive characteristic. We show that every differential graded pre-Lie algebra with divided powers comes with operations, called weighted braces, which we use to generalize the classical deformation theory controlled by Lie algebras over a field of characteristic $0$. Explicitly, we define the Maurer-Cartan set, as well as the gauge group, and prove that there is an action of the gauge group on the Maurer-Cartan set. This new deformation theory moreover admits a Goldman-Millson theorem which remains valid on the integers. As an application, we give the computation of the $\pi_0$ of a mapping space $\text{Map}(B^c(\mathcal{C}),\mathcal{P})$ with $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{P}$ suitable cooperad and operad respectively.</description>

      <title>Floer Homology: From Generalized Morse-Smale Dynamical Systems to Forman's Combinatorial Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.02567v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a Floer type boundary operator for generalised Morse-Smale dynamical systems on compact smooth manifolds by counting the number of suitable flow lines between closed (both homoclinic and periodic) orbits and isolated critical points. The same principle works for the discrete situation of general combinatorial vector fields, defined by Forman, on CW complexes. We can thus recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ homology of both smooth and discrete structures directly from the flow lines (V-paths) of our vector field.</description>
