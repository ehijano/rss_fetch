      <title>Hardware-Algorithm Co-Design for Hyperdimensional Computing Based on Memristive System-on-Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC), utilizing a parallel computing paradigm and efficient learning algorithm, is well-suited for resource-constrained artificial intelligence (AI) applications, such as in edge devices. In-memory computing (IMC) systems based on memristive devices complement this by offering energy-efficient hardware solutions. To harness the advantages of both memristive IMC hardware and HDC algorithms, we propose a hardware-algorithm co-design approach for implementing HDC on a memristive System-on-Chip (SoC). On the hardware side, we utilize the inherent randomness of memristive crossbar arrays for encoding and employ analog IMC for classification. At the algorithm level, we develop hardware-aware encoding techniques that map data features into hyperdimensional vectors, optimizing the classification process within the memristive SoC. Experimental results in hardware demonstrate 90.71% accuracy in the language classification task, highlighting the potential of our approach for achieving energy-efficient AI deployments on edge devices.</description>

      <title>Process Analytics -- Data-driven Business Process Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven analysis of business processes has a long tradition in research. However, recently the term of process mining is mostly used when referring to data-driven process analysis. As a consequence, awareness for the many facets of process analysis is decreasing. In particular, while an increasing focus is put onto technical aspects of the analysis, human and organisational concerns remain under the radar. Following the socio-technical perspective of information systems research, we propose a new perspective onto data-driven process analysis that combines the process of analysis with the organisation and its stakeholders. This paper conceptualises the term process analytics and its various dimensions by following both an inductive and deductive approach. The results are discussed by contrasting them to a real-life case study from a large company implementing data-driven process analysis and automation.</description>

      <title>Design and Validation of a Modular Smart Headband with Embroidered Electrodes for Comfortable EEG Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The wearable EEG device sector is advancing rapidly, enabling fast and reliable detection of brain activity for investigating brain function and pathology. However, many current EEG systems remain challenging for users with neurological conditions due to bulky wiring, lengthy skin preparation, gel-induced discomfort, risk of irritation, and high cost, all of which limit long-term monitoring. This study presents a proof-of-concept smart modular headband incorporating adjustable, replaceable embroidered electrodes for EEG acquisition. Compared with conventional devices, the smart headband reduces wiring complexity, removes the need for skin preparation, and minimizes irritation associated with gel-based electrodes. Its modular structure allows adjustable fitting without requiring multiple size options, enhancing comfort and adaptability for everyday EEG monitoring. The smart headband prototype was tested on 10 healthy university students using three behavioral tasks: (1) eyes open/closed, (2) auditory oddball, and (3) visual oddball paradigms. The smart headband successfully captured alpha peaks during the eyes-open/closed task (p = 0.01) and reliably recorded the event-related potentials associated with the oddball effects - the auditory P300 (p = 0.014) and the visual N170 (p = 0.013) - demonstrating an equivalent performance to a commercial sponge-based EEG cap. A user survey indicated improved comfort and usability, with participants reporting that the soft, structurally designed headband enhanced wearability relative to a conventional cap. Overall, this prototype provides a comfortable, modular, and cost-effective solution to reliable EEG monitoring in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Validation of Quantum Computing for Transition Metal Oxide-based Automotive Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing presents a promising alternative to classical computational methods for modeling strongly correlated materials with partially filled d orbitals. In this study, we perform a comprehensive quantum resource estimation using quantum phase estimation (QPE) and qubitization techniques for transition metal oxide molecules and a Pd zeolite catalyst fragment. Using the binary oxide molecules TiO, MnO, and FeO, we validate our active space selection and benchmarking methodology, employing classical multireference methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2). We then apply these methods to estimate the quantum resources required for a full-scale quantum simulation of a $Z_2Pd$ ($Z=Al_2Si_{22}O_{48}$) fragment taken from the $Pd/2(Al_xSi_{(1-x)})$ catalyst family where x=Si/Al. Our analysis demonstrates that for large Pd zeolite systems, simulations achieving chemical accuracy would require ~$10^6-10^7$ physical qubits, and range that is consistent with the projected capabilities of future fault-tolerant quantum devices. We further explore the impact of active space size, basis set quality, and phase estimation error on the required qubit and gate counts. These findings provide a roadmap for near-term and future quantum simulations of industrially relevant catalytic materials, offering insights into the feasibility and scaling of quantum chemistry applications in materials science.</description>
