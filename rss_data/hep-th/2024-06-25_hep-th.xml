      <description>arXiv:2406.15434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent numerical evaluation of the spherical universal log coefficient in the Maxwell free--energy and its decomposition into bulk and edge contributions via a bounded hyperbolic geometry mode calculation is shown to be equivalent to an existing compact formulation for p-forms, at p=1, on a conically deformed sphere. The edge mode seems to be a ghost $(p-1)$--form. Some numbers are given.</description>

      <title>On Spectral Data for $(2,2)$ Berry Connections, Difference Equations &amp; Equivariant Quantum Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study supersymmetric Berry connections of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) quantized on a circle, which are periodic monopoles, with the aim to provide a fruitful physical arena for recent mathematical constructions related to the latter. These are difference modules encoding monopole solutions via a Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence established by Mochizuki. We demonstrate how the difference modules arise naturally by studying the ground states as the cohomology of a one-parameter family of supercharges. In particular, we show how they are related to one kind of monopole spectral data, a quantization of the Cherkis-Kapustin spectral curve, and relate them to the physics of the GLSM. By considering states generated by D-branes and leveraging the difference modules, we derive novel difference equations for brane amplitudes. We then show that in the conformal limit, these degenerate into novel difference equations for hemisphere partition functions, which are exactly calculable. When the GLSM flows to a nonlinear sigma model with K\"ahler target $X$, we show that the difference modules are related to the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$.</description>

      <title>A geometric dual of F-maximization in massive type IIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using equivariant localization we construct a geometric dual of F-maximization in massive type IIA supergravity. Our results use only topological data to quantize the fluxes, compute the free-energy and conformal dimensions of operators in the dual field theory without the need for explicit solutions. We utilize our formalism to study various classes of solutions, including examples where an explicit solution is not known.</description>

      <title>All planar two-loop amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the general planar dual-conformally invariant double-pentagon and pentabox integrals in four dimensions. Concretely, we derive one-fold integral representations for these elliptic integrals over polylogarithms of weight three. These integral representations allow us to determine the respective symbols using consistency conditions alone. Together with the previously calculated double-box integral, these integrals suffice to express all two-loop planar scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions -- which we thus calculate for any number of particles and any helicity configuration!</description>

      <title>The Monopole-Fermion Problem in a Chiral Gauge Theory (the $\psi\chi\eta$ Model)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering of electrically charged fermions on magnetic monopole leads to the Callan-Rubakov problem. We discuss some aspects of this problem for Abelian gauge theories with chiral fermions in a Dirac monopole background. In some cases, it is possible to embed the theory in a non-Abelian gauge theory where the monopole is regularized as a 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole. One theory of this kind is the $SU(N)$ chiral gauge theory with fermions in the symmetric, anti-antisymmetric and anti-fundamental representations also called "$\psi \chi \eta$" model, with an extra adjoint scalar that induces the Abelianization of the gauge group. We examine this model in detail and provide a possible solution for the condensates around the monopole, the symmetry preserving boundary conditions, and discuss the particle scattering problem.</description>

      <title>Meso-inflationary Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking with non-minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a realization of the inflationary scenario where the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is spontaneously broken during inflation, facilitated by its non-minimal coupling to gravity. This results in effectively two-field inflation: the early stage is driven by an inflaton field with the PQ symmetry intact, and the later stage is driven by the PQ scalar after its effective mass becomes tachyonic, causing destabilization from the origin. The non-minimal coupling serves the dual purpose of restoring the PQ symmetry during early inflation and flattening the PQ potential post-tachyonic shift, allowing for continued slow roll. We analyze the inflationary background solutions and scalar perturbations, which are amplified at small scales via significant isocurvature perturbations generated near the symmetry-breaking epoch. These perturbations lead to second-order gravitational waves, detectable by next-generation space-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Moyal product and Generalized Hom-Lie-Virasoro symmetries in Bloch electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore two variations of the Curtright-Zachos (CZ) deformation of the Virasoro algebra. Firstly, we introduce a scaled CZ algebra that inherits the scaling structure found in the differential operator representation of the magnetic translation (MT) operators. We then linearly decompose the scaled CZ generators to derive two types of Hom-Lie deformations of the W-infinity algebra. We discuss *-bracket formulations of these algebras and their connection to the Moyal product. We show that the *-bracket form of the scaled CZ algebra arises from the Moyal product, while we obtain the second type of deformed W-infinity through a coordinate transformation of the first type of Moyal operators. From a physical point of view, we construct the Hamiltonian of a tight binding model (TBM) using the Wyle matrix representation of the scaled CZ algebra. We note that the integer powers of q are linked to the quantum fluctuations that are inherent in the Moyal product.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the elliptic Miura transformation and use it to obtain the expression of the currents of elliptic corner VOA. We subsequently prove a novel combinatorial formula that is essential for deriving the quadratic relations of the currents. In addition, we give a conjecture that relates the correlation function of the currents of elliptic corner VOA to a certain family of partially symmetric polynomials. The elliptic Macdonald polynomials, constructed recently by Awata-Kanno-Mironov-Morozov-Zenkevich, and Fukuda-Ohkubo-Shiraishi, can be obtained as a particular case of this family.</description>

      <title>One-particle irreducibility of Vilkovisky-DeWitt effective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective action formalism introduced by Vilkovisky and later modified by DeWitt is completely covariant suitable for obtaining an effective action that is independent of the parametrization of the quantum fields. Among a few basic properties of an effective action, one property is that it can be written as a sum of one-particle irreducible diagrams. In this work, we verify this property up to three-loop order for Vilkovisky-Dewitt effective action (VDEA) by solving the equations satisfied by VDEA written down in the original parametrization for non-gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Quantum origin of Ohm's reciprocity relation and its violation: conductivity as inverse resistivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom teaches us that the electrical conductivity in a material is the inverse of its resistivity. In this work, we show that when both of these transport coefficients are defined in linear response through the Kubo formulae as two-point correlators of quantum fields, this Ohm's reciprocity relation is generically violated in theories with dynamical electromagnetism. We also elucidate how in special limits (e.g., in the DC limit in the presence of thermal effects, in certain 2+1$d$ conformal theories, and in holographic supersymmetric theories) the reciprocity is again reinstated, and show that if the response of a material is measured with respect to the total electric field that includes quantum corrections, then the reciprocity relation is satisfied by definition. However, in that case, the transport coefficients are given by the photon vacuum polarisation and not the correlators of conserved currents that dominate macroscopic late-time transport.</description>

      <title>Geometrisation of Ohm's reciprocity relation in a holographic plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been pointed out in [1] that the familiar reciprocity relation between the conductivity $\sigma$ and resistivity $\rho$ should not be expected to hold in all possible settings, but, as argued in [2], is rather a property that may (or may not) emerge as a consequence of specific features, or in certain limits of interest, of a given theory. In this work, I prove the conventional statement: $\rho= \sigma^{-1}$, which I refer to as $\textit{Ohm's reciprocity relation}$, for a large class of holographic models with $d=3+1$ boundary dimensions. The proof involves a generalisation of the electric-magnetic duality in the $D=4+1$ bulk, the validity of which is discussed in detail. I then confirm these findings by considering one specific model and run numerical simulations in different settings.</description>

      <title>Boundary Conditions that Remove Certain Ultraviolet Divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum field theory, Hamiltonians contain particle creation and annihilation terms that are usually ultraviolet (UV) divergent. It is well known that these divergences can sometimes be removed by adding counter-terms and taking limits in which an UV cut-off tends to infinity. Here, I review a novel way of removing UV divergences: by imposing a kind of boundary condition on the wave function. These conditions, called interior-boundary conditions (IBCs), relate the values of the wave function at two configurations linked by the creation or annihilation of a particle. They allow for a direct definition of the Hamiltonian without renormalization or limiting procedures. In the last section, I review another boundary condition that serves for determining the probability distribution of detection times and places on a timelike 3-surface.</description>

      <title>Brane Profiles of Non-Supersymmetric Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We connect the indications of 2D CFT for branes in non-supersymmetric strings to actual spacetime profiles, taking the bulk tadpole potentials into account. We find exact solutions for the uncharged branes that spread in the internal intervals of Dudas-Mourad vacua for non-tachyonic orientifolds and heterotic strings. These solutions involve suitable dressings of the uncharged branes of the nine-dimensional tadpole-free theory. Similar exact results for uncharged branes that are transverse to the internal space, or for charged branes, appear more challenging. Nevertheless, we identify their large-distance behavior, which is determined by linearized equations, and show that it is compatible with the CFT analysis in all expected cases. We also draw some indications on the leading back-reaction of the form-fields.</description>

      <title>Replica R\'enyi Wormholes and Generalised Modular Entropy in JT Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing semi-classical R\'enyi entropies of CFT on AdS$_2$ backgrounds in JT gravity with nongravitating baths, for general replica number $n$. Away from the $n\to 1$ limit, the backreaction of the CFT twist fields on the geometry is nontrivial. For one twist field insertion and general $n$, we show that the quantum extremal surface (QES) condition involves extremisation of the generalised modular entropy, consistent with Dong's generalisation of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for general $n$. For multiple QES we describe replica wormhole geometries using the theory of Fuchsian uniformisation, explicitly working out the analytically tractable case of the $n=2$ double trumpet wormhole geometry. We determine the off-shell dependence of the gravitational action on the QES locations and boundary map. In a factorisation limit, corresponding to late times, we are able to relate this action functional to area terms given by the value of the JT dilaton at the (off-shell) QES locations, with computable corrections. Applied to the two-sided eternal black hole, we find the $n$-dependent Page times for R\'enyi enropies in the high temperature limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum and classical symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a somewhat non-standard view on a set of curious, paradoxical from the standpoint of simple classical physics and everyday experience phenomena. There are the quantisation (discrete set of values) of the observables (e.g., energy, momentum, angular momentum); forbidden simultaneous measurements of the observables in the most cases (e.g., of a coordinate and momentum, of angular momentum projections on difference axis); counter-intuitive relations on the simultaneously measurable quantities (e.g., the famous expression for the square momentum $l(l+1)$ with the maximal projection $l$). These and other paradoxes are traditionally related to "purely quantum" phenomenon, i.e., having no analogue in the "classical world" ones. However, there are deep analogies between classical and "quantum" worlds, as soon as the quantum technique is applied to the classical phenomenon. We follow these analogies with the examples of relatively simple and well known models of classical physics, such as a simplified model of light transition through the media, a system of electric charges close to each other and far from the observer; the specific of motion in the Coulomb/Newtonian field. This text can be considered as a mini-course addressed to higher school and undergraduate students who are interested in basics of quantum mechanics, but are not yet ready for systematic study of standard courses. The text may be also useful to those who supervise such students.</description>

      <title>Commutative families in DIM algebra, integrable many-body systems and $q,t$ matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our consideration of commutative subalgebras (rays) in different representations of the $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra to the elliptic Hall algebra (or, equivalently, to the Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra $U_{q,t}(\widehat{\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}}_1)$). Its advantage is that it possesses the Miki automorphism, which makes all commutative rays equivalent. Integrable systems associated with these rays become finite-difference and, apart from the trigonometric Ruijsenaars system not too much familiar. We concentrate on the simplest many-body and Fock representations, and derive explicit formulas for all generators of the elliptic Hall algebra $e_{n,m}$. In the one-body representation, they differ just by normalization from $z^nq^{m\hat D}$ of the $W_{1+\infty}$ Lie algebra, and, in the $N$-body case, they are non-trivially generalized to monomials of the Cherednik operators with action restricted to symmetric polynomials. In the Fock representation, the resulting operators are expressed through auxiliary polynomials of $n$ variables, which define weights in the residues formulas. We also discuss $q,t$-deformation of matrix models associated with constructed commutative subalgebras.</description>

      <title>Normalization of ZZ instanton amplitudes in type 0B minimal superstring theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ZZ instanton corrections in the $(2,4k)$ $N=1$ minimal superstring theory with the type 0B GSO projection, which becomes the type 0B $N=1$ super-JT gravity in the $k \to \infty$ limit. Each member of the $(2,4k)$ family of theories has two phases distinguished by the sign of the Liouville bulk cosmological constant. The worldsheet method for computing the one-loop normalization constant multiplying the instanton corrections gives an ill-defined answer in both phases. We fix these divergences using insights from string field theory and find finite, unambiguous results. Each member of the $(2,4k)$ family of theories is dual to a double-scaled one-matrix integral, where the double-scaling limit can be obtained starting either from a unitary matrix integral with a leading one-cut saddle point, or from a hermitian matrix integral with a leading two-cut saddle point. The matrix integral exhibits a gap-closing transition, which is the same as the double-scaled Gross-Witten-Wadia transition when $k=1$. We also compute instanton corrections in the double-scaled matrix integral for all $k$ and in both phases, and find perfect agreement with the string theory results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05010v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the low temperature thermodynamic equations corrected by virtual processes for integrable QFT on large but finite size space circle. Obtained TBA's are solved numerically for the sinh-Gordon model. We also derive corresponding Euler scale generalized hydrodynamic (GHD) equations and display them explicitly for small occupation ratio of virtual quasiparticles. The spectrum of velocities for the linear approximation to GHD is numerically calculated.</description>

      <title>The Resurgence of the G(2) Group for the Strong Sector and the Emergence of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: G(2) is the smallest exceptional group and it is the simplest and viable gauge group to minimally extend the strong interaction sector: G(2) includes the group SU(3) of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) as a maximal subgroup and it is equipped with six additional gluons that can acquire mass via a Higgs mechanism driven by a new Higgs particle and constitute dark matter. In this article I want to describe how the exceptional G(2) group can be a physical gauge group, capable of extending the Standard Model (SM) of particles and including a versatile dark sector, which is compatible with experimental observations. In fact, due to its peculiar mathematical features, the group G(2) manifests some complex features, not properly considered in literature, which guarantee its correct use in physics, as its {3}+anti{3} decompositions w.r.t. SU(3) can acquire a complex structure. The resulting framework can be a solid Beyond Standard Model (BSM) solution for the dark matter (DM) problem, in the form of massive complex scalar glueballs, and it includes the proper color representations for quarks and leptons. Several quantum field theory features are discussed, like the G(2) coupling constant running and its spectrum before and after the phase transition, along with all the DM astrophysical realizations, in order to present the unexpected potential of this gauge group.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics in Curved Space(time) with a Noncommutative Geometric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have previously presented a version of the Weak Equivalence Principle for a quantum particle as an exact analog of the classical case, based on the Heisenberg picture analysis of free particle motion. Here, we take that to a full formalism of quantum mechanics in a generic curved space(time). Our basic perspective is to take seriously the noncommutative symplectic geometry corresponding to the quantum observable algebra. Particle position coordinate transformations and a nontrivial metric assigning an invariant inner product to vectors, and covectors, are implemented accordingly. That allows an analog to the classical picture of the phase space as the cotangent bundle. The mass-independent quantum geodesic equations as equations of free particle motion under a generic metric as a quantum observable are obtained from an invariant Hamiltonian. Hermiticity of momentum observables is to be taken as reference frame dependent. Our results have a big contrast to the alternative obtained based on the Schr\"odinger wavefunction representation. Hence, the work points to a very different approach to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Pragmatic Self-adjoint Procedure in the Schrodinger Equation for the Inverse Square Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-adjoint extension (SAE) procedure is considered in the Schrodinger equation for potentials behaving as an attractive inverse square at the origin of coordinates. This approach guarantees self-adjointness of the radial Hamiltonian in three dimensions. It is shown that the single bound state appears after such an extension, which depends on SAE parameter. The same parameter arises for the scattering case as well, when the extension is made by orthogonality requirement. The closed form is derived for the modified scattering amplitude, which consists an extra factor depended on the SAE parameter. That guarantees the appearance of the same bound state in the form of the scattering amplitude pole. So, the generalization of pragmatic method is demonstrated in case of continuous spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the preparation of thermal states of the dense and sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model using a variational quantum algorithm for $6 \le N \le 12$ Majorana fermions over a wide range of temperatures. Utilizing IBM's 127-qubit quantum processor, we perform benchmark computations for the dense SYK model with $N = 6$, showing good agreement with exact results. The preparation of thermal states of a non-local random Hamiltonian with all-to-all coupling using the simulator and quantum hardware represents a significant step toward future computations of thermal out-of-time order correlators in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the ratio between the shear viscosity and the shear relaxation time, $\eta/\tau_\pi$, should be defined as a thermodynamic quantity obtained from the equal-time symmetric correlator of the shear-stress tensor. In kinetic theory, we show that this ratio does not depend on the type of interaction. Similarly, an exact expression for this ratio is obtained for holographic gauge theories. We also determine how stochastic fluctuations change $\eta/\tau_\pi$ in transient relativistic hydrodynamics and show that thermal fluctuations do not spoil causality and stability.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for Some Logistic Maps and the Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain the relation between the $r=1$ logistic map $x_{i+1}=rx_i(1-x_i)$, $x_i\in\mathbb R$, $i=0,1,\ldots$, $r&gt;0$ and $x_0\geq0$, and the RG flow in the multiscale analysis of zero fixed point, asymptotic free QFT models as e.g. the ultraviolet (1+1)-dimensional Gross-Neveu model and QCD, and the infrared $\phi^4_4$. We obtain the asymptotics of the mapping, showing an inverse power decay to the fixed point $x^*=0$ Gaussian fixed point, with logarithmic-like corrections. This asymptotics is independent of the initial condition $x_0\in(0,1)$ (so, there is no constraint for $x_0$ to be small, as usual in QFT models), and only depends on the lowest orders in a polynomial perturbation. In asymptotic free QFT, this means that knowing the RG $\beta$ function expansion up to higher orders in the coupling does not improve our knowledge of the flow asymptotics. A comparison with an ODE with continuous time is made by analyzing stability of the solution with higher order monomial perturbations. We also obtain the asymptotics for $0&lt;r&lt;1$. Also, our methods work when $r\in(1,3]$. It is known, but without detailed asymptotics, that all trajectories with initial condition $x_0\in(-1,1)$ converge to the fixed point $x^*=(r-1)/r$. For the super attractive case $r=2$, we obtain an explicit exact solution with an exploding nonconstant exponential decay rate to the $x^*=1/2$ fixed point. Our methods include the use of iterations, a discrete version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, a discrete version of the integrating factor method for 1st order linear ODEs and, sometimes, a scaling transformation. We do not use the Banach contraction mapping theorem, which only provides an upper bound on the asymptotics. We expect that our methods apply to determine the asymptotics of the logistic map for a wider range of parameters, where other fixed points are present.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the role of scalar field potentials in the dynamical evolution of the Universe. A gravity theory with a non-minimally coupled scalar field with torsion in the geometrical action simulating effective dark energy is considered to study an extended matter bounce scenario. The dynamical behaviour of the equation of state parameter has been studied near the bouncing epoch. Keeping in mind the inflationary behaviour near the bounce, five different scalar field potential functions are explored, and their effect on the equation of state parameter is investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum entanglement measure of concurrence is shown to be directly calculable from a Tomita- Takesaki modular operator framework constructed from the local von Neumann algebras of observables for two quantum systems. Specifically, the Tomita-Takesaki modular conjugation operator $J$ that links two separate systems with respect to their von Neumann algebras is related to the quantum concurrence $C$ of a pure bi-variate entangled state composed from these systems. This concurrence relation provides a direct physical meaning to $J$ as both a symmetry operator and a quantitative measure of entanglement. This procedure is then demonstrated for a supersymmetric quantum mechanical system and a real scalar field interacting with two entangled spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Unruh-DeWitt qubit detectors. For the latter system, the concurrence result is shown to be consistent with some known results on the Bell-CHSH inequality for such a system.</description>

Abstract: We show that every operator in $L^{2}$ has an associated measure on a space of functions and prove that it can be used to find solutions to abstract Cauchy problems, including partial differential equations. We find explicit formulas to compute the integral of functions with respect to this measure and develop approximate formulas in terms of a perturbative expansion. We show that this method can be used to represent solutions of classical equations, such as the diffusion and Fokker-Plank equations, as Wiener and Martin-Siggia-Rose-Jansen-de Dominics integrals, and propose an extension to paths in infinite dimensional spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis embarks on a comprehensive investigation of modified gravity theories and their implications on the properties of compact objects. Our primary objective is to shed light on the fundamental nature of gravity by exploring potential departures from General Relativity (GR) through a combination of theoretical analyses and observational techniques. On the theoretical side, we consider black hole thermodynamics, stability of compact objects, presence of black hole hairs, and the issue of causality that may provide valuable input towards the ultimate quantum theory of gravity. Moreover, on the observational side, we employ gravitational wave observations and black hole perturbation theory to explore new aspects of gravity and put stringent bounds on the beyond-GR parameters.
  To provide a structured overview of the thesis, we have organized it into chapters that progressively delve deeper into these diverse aspects of modified gravity and compact objects. Each chapter is dedicated to a specific facet of our investigation, building a coherent narrative that spans both theoretical and observational explorations. We aspire to achieve nothing less than imparting valuable insights and novel perspectives that may significantly enhance our understanding of the fundamental nature of gravitation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been established that certain higher-dimensional topological phases of matter support extended objects like quasi-strings and quasi-membranes in their bulk states. In this study, we investigate the physics of these topological systems using a phase-space approach in the semiclassical regime, incorporating tensorial coordinates related to the extended objects. Specifically, we explore the semiclassical currents associated to open quasi-strings in topological phases in three spatial dimensions, considering the presence of both coordinate-space Kalb-Ramond fields and momentum-space tensor Berry connections. Our results show that the currents associated to the endpoints of open quasi-strings on the system's boundary exhibit a quantized Hall response. This formalism accurately reproduces the boundary response as predicted by an Abelian BF theory proving a novel way to study extended objects in topological matter.</description>

      <title>Canonical quantization of the dark Dirac field and time asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform canonical quantization of the single-component, spin-zero field that was introduced by Dirac in 1971 and recently suggested as a candidate for dark matter by Bogomolny. The massive and massless cases are treated separately. Since in the massive case only positive-frequency modes are normalizable and regarded as physical, the mode expansion for the field involves annihilation operators only, making the quantization procedure particularly simple. The corresponding Hamiltonian of the system turns out to be unambiguous, with no need for normal ordering. The positive-energy requirement imposed on the second-quantized system leads to bosonic commutation relations, in agreement with the spin-statistics theorem. The boson nature of the positive-energy Dirac particles, which, evidently, have no antiparticles, hints at the possibility of a dark, background Bose-Einstein condensate that drives different parts of the universe in the same temporal direction. In the massless case, on the other hand, we explore the possibility of allowing the mode expansion to involve both positive- and negative-frequency components, which leads to the anticommutation relations, resulting in the fermionic behavior of the field in ultrarelativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Parity-violating primordial gravitational waves from null energy condition violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the parity-violating effects in primordial gravitational waves (GWs) due to null energy condition (NEC) violation in two very early universe scenarios: bounce-inflation and intermediate NEC violation during inflation. In both scenarios, we numerically solve the power spectra of parity-violating primordial GWs generated by coupling the background field and the spectator field with the Nieh-Yan term, respectively. We find that the background field can significantly enhance parity-violating effects at scales corresponding to the maximum of the GW power spectra. In contrast, the parity-violating effects produced by the spectator show significantly weaker observability even if the coupling constant is large. Therefore, in NEC-violating scenarios, the significant observable parity-violating effects in primordial GWs primarily arise from the physics directly related to NEC violation. This result highlights the potential of primordial GWs as crucial tools for exploring NEC-violating and parity-violating physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method is developed to compute minimal energy vortex lattices in a general Ginzburg-Landau model of a superconductor subjected to an applied magnetic field. The model may have any number of components and may be spatially anisotropic. Both the period vectors of the vortex lattice, and the orientation of its vortex lines, are determined dynamically; no assumptions are made about them. Methods to compute the first and second critical magnetic fields, $H_{c_1}$ and $H_{c_2}$, in this class of models are also developed.
  These methods are applied to a simple anisotropic single-component model, and to an anisotropic two-component model of strong current theoretical interest (a so-called $s+id$ model). It is found, in both cases, that at low applied field the vortex lines can tilt very significantly away from the direction of the applied field (by as much as $40^o$ for the single-component and $30^o$ for the $s+id$ model). The optimal lattice in the $s+id$ model is qualitatively very different from the conventional triangular Abrikosov lattice, exhibiting a phase transition from a system of Skyrmion chains when the external field is orthogonal to the basal plane to a deformed Abrikosov lattice when applied in the basal plane.</description>

Abstract: We explore the universal signatures of quantum phase transitions that can be extracted with the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm applied to quantum chains with a gradient. We present high-quality data collapses for the order parameter and for the entanglement entropy for three minimal models: transverse-field Ising, 3-state Potts and Ashkin-Teller. Furthermore, we show that scan-DMRG successfully captures the universal critical scaling when applied across the magnetic Wess-Zumino-Witten and non-magnetic Ising transitions in the frustrated Haldane chain. In addition, we report a universal scaling of the lowest excitation energy as a function of a gradient rate. Finally, we argue that the scan-DMRG approach has significantly lower computational cost compare to the conventional DMRG protocols to study quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Radiative QED corrections to the lepton anomaly from four-loop vacuum polarization insertions with three identical leptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytical expressions for the tenth order electromagnetic corrections to the lepton ($L=e, ~\mu $ and $\tau$) anomaly $a_L$ are derived explicitly for a class of Feynman diagrams with insertions of the vacuum polarization operator consisting of four closed lepton loops. We consider a particular case when one loop is formed by the lepton $L$ of the same kind as the one under consideration, the other three loops being formed by leptons $\ell\neq L$. The method is based on the consecutive application of dispersion relations for the polarization operator and the Mellin--Barnes transform for the propagators of massive particles. The result is expressed in terms of the mass ratio $r=m_\ell/m_L$. We investigate the behaviour of the exact analytical expressions as $r\to 0$ and $r\to \infty$ and compare them with the corresponding asymptotic expansions known in the literature.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem of analog gravity systems II: rotation and energy-dependent boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the inverse problem of analog gravity systems which admit rotation and energy-dependent boundary conditions. By extending two recent results, we provide a recipe that allows one to relate resonant transmission spectra with effective potentials and even reconstruct the boundary condition at the core. Our methodology is based on the WKB method and the identification of universal features in the transmission. One of the main advantages of this method is that it is parameter-free, and relies only on general properties of the underlying potential, instead of specific models. While the reconstruction of underlying potentials is generally not uniquely possible, the inverse method provides effective potentials with similar spectral properties to the original one. To demonstrate the accuracy and scope of our method, we apply it to a rotating imperfect draining vortex, which has been proposed as an analog system to astrophysical extreme compact objects. We conclude that the capability to explore energy-dependent boundary conditions could be of interest for experimental studies of such systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalies in mirror symmetry enriched topological orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional mirror symmetry-enriched topological orders can be studied using the folding approach: it can be folded along the mirror axis and turned into a bilayer system on which the mirror symmetry acts as a $\mathbb Z_2$ layer-exchange symmetry. How mirror-symmetry enriches the topological order is then encoded at the mirror axis, which is a gapped boundary of the folded bilayer system. Based on anyon-condensation theory, we classify possible $\mathbb Z_2$-symmetric gapped boundaries of the folded system. In particular, we derive an $H^2$ obstruction function, which corresponds to an $H^3$ obstruction for topological orders enriched by the time-reversal symmetry instead of mirror symmetry. We demonstrate that states with a nontrivial $H^2$ obstruction function can be constructed on the surface of a three-dimensional mirror SET order.</description>

      <title>Adjusted Connections I: Differential Cocycles for Principal Groupoid Bundles with Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new perspective on principal bundles with connection as morphisms from the tangent bundle of the underlying manifold to a classifying dg-Lie groupoid. This groupoid can be identified with a lift of the inner homomorphisms groupoid arising in \v{S}evera's differentiation procedure of Lie quasi-groupoids. Our new perspective readily extends to principal groupoid bundles, but requires an adjustment, an additional datum familiar from higher gauge theory. The resulting adjusted connections naturally provide a global formulation of the kinematical data of curved Yang-Mills-Higgs theories as described by Kotov-Strobl (arXiv:1510.07654) and Fischer (arXiv:2104.02175).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a tensor renormalization group simulation of non-Abelian gauge theory in three dimensions using a formulation based on the `armillary sphere.' In this formulation, matrix indices are completely traced out, eliminating the degeneracy in the singular value spectrum of the initial tensor. We demonstrate the usefulness of this technique by computing the average plaquette at zero temperature and the Polyakov loop susceptibility at finite temperatures for 2+1D SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories. The deconfinement transition is identified for both gauge groups, with the SU(2) case being consistent with previous Monte Carlo results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By following closely Weinberg's soft theorem, which captures the $1/\omega$ pole contribution to the amplitude for soft graviton emissions ($\omega&lt;\Lambda$) on top of an arbitrary background hard process, we calculate the expectation value of the graviton's angular momentum operator for arbitrary collisions dressed with soft radiation. We find that the result becomes independent of the cutoff $\Lambda$ on the graviton's frequency, effectively localizing at $\omega=0$. In this way, our result captures the contribution to the angular momentum that comes from the zero-frequency modes. Like the soft theorem, our formula has an exact dependence on the kinematics of the hard particles and is only a function of their momenta. As an example, we discuss in some detail the case of the $2 \to 2$ scattering of spinless particles in General Relativity and ${\cal N}=8$ supergravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1977 L\"uscher found a class of SO(4)-symmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills solutions in Minkowski space, which have been rederived 40 years later by employing the isometry $S^3\cong\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and conformally mapping SU(2)-equivariant solutions of the Yang-Mills equations on (two copies of) de Sitter space $\mathrm{dS}_4\cong\mathbb{R}{\times}S^3$. Here we present the noncompact analog of this construction via $\mathrm{AdS}_3\cong\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$. On (two copies of) anti-de Sitter space $\mathrm{AdS}_4\cong\mathbb{R}{\times}\mathrm{AdS}_3$ we write down SU(1,1)-equivariant Yang-Mills solutions and conformally map them to $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$. This yields a two-parameter family of exact SU(1,1) Yang-Mills solutions on Minkowski space, whose field strengths are essentially rational functions of Cartesian coordinates. Gluing the two AdS copies happens on a $\mathrm{dS}_3$ hyperboloid in Minkowski space, and our Yang-Mills configurations are singular on a two-dimensional hyperboloid $\mathrm{dS}_3\cap\mathbb{R}^{1,2}$. This renders their action and the energy infinite, although the field strengths fall off fast asymptotically except along the lightcone. We also construct Abelian solutions, which share these properties but are less symmetric and of zero action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wu-Yang fiber bundle approach to magnetic charge is extended with a disk-like sheet current density and associated magnetic field in the overlap region between the Northern hemisphere and Southern hemisphere, where the different vector potentials connect. This disk magnetic field plays a role similar to the Dirac string in the Dirac approach to magnetic charge - it brings an inward magnetic flux of $4 \pi g$ which then gives rise to an outward Coulomb magnetic flux of $4 \pi g$. As with the Dirac string approach we show that placing an electric charge near this disk magnetic field gives rise to a non-zero electromagnetic field momentum. We discuss some of the possible physical consequences of this electromagnetic field momentum. We conclude by showing that the non-singular, but non-single valued Banderet monopole potential also has a disk-like magnetic flux and non-zero electromagnetic field momentum in the presence of an electric charge.</description>

Abstract: We present a triple point of a new kind for General Relativity, at which two gravitational solitons can coexist with a planar black hole in anti de Sitter space. Working in the context of non-linear electrodynamics, we obtain simple, sensible spacetimes for which the thermodynamics can be studied in an analytic manner. The spacetimes are charged under the non-linear electrodynamics leading to an electric charge for black holes and a magnetic flux for solitons. In the grand-canonical ensemble, we show that the phase space of the theory is very rich, containing re-entrant phase transitions, as well as triple points, for small values of the coupling controlling the non-linearity of the electrodynamics Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Localization of scalar field on the brane-world by coupling with gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a coupling mechanism between the kinetic term and the gravity, in which a coupling function $F(R)$ is introduced into the kinetic term of the five-dimensional scalar field. Based on this scenario, we investigate the localization of scalar fields in three specific braneworld models: the Minkowski brane, the de Sitter brane, and the Anti-de Sitter brane. The brane models considered here are regular with no singularity for scalar curvature. For the Minkowshi brane case, the zero mode can always be localized on the brane, and the massive modes can be localized or quasi-localized on the brane. For the dS$_4$ brane case, two forms of factor $F(R)$ is considered. The zero mode can always be localized, and the massive modes could be quasi-localized on the brane. Besides, with the second coupling factor, the scalar zero mode could be localized on the both sides of the origin of extra dimension, while the massive modes could be quasi-localized on the origin. Lastly, for the AdS$_4$ brane case, the localization of the scalar zero mode requires the consideration of a coupling potential $V(\Phi,\varphi)$, while the massive modes can still be localized on the brane with an infinite number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the framework of Hopf algebra and noncommutative differential geometry to build a noncommutative (NC) theory of gravity in a bottom-up approach. Noncommutativity is introduced via deformed Hopf algebra of diffeomorphisms by means of a Drinfeld twist. The final result of the construction is a general formalism for obtaining NC corrections to the classical theory of gravity for a wide class of deformations and a general background. This also includes a novel proposal for noncommutative Einstein manifold. Moreover, the general construction is applied to the case of a linearized gravitational perturbation theory to describe a NC deformation of the metric perturbations. We specifically present an example for the Schwarzschild background and axial perturbations, which gives rise to a generalization of the work by Regge and Wheeler. All calculations are performed up to first order in perturbation of the metric and noncommutativity parameter. The main result is the noncommutative Regge-Wheeler potential. Finally, we comment on some differences in properties between the Regge-Wheeler potential and its noncommutative counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11197v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics induced by a local perturbation in fracton field theory. For the ${\mathbb Z}_4$ and ${\mathbb Z}_8$-symmetric free fractonic theories, we compute the time dynamics of several observables such as the two-point Green function, $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ condensate, energy density, and the dipole momentum. The time-dependent considerations highlight that the free fractonic theory breaks causality and exhibits instantaneous signal propagation, even if an additional relativistic term is included to enforce a speed limit in the system. We show that it is related to the fact that the Lieb-Robinson bound does not hold in the continuum limit of the fracton field theory, and the effective bounded speed of light does not emerge. For the theory in finite volume, we show that the fracton wave front acquires fractal shape with non-trivial Hausdorff dimension, and argue that this phenomenon cannot be explained by a simple self-interference effect.</description>

Abstract: This work examines the thermodynamics and hydrodynamics behaviors of a five-dimensional black hole under the influence of an external magnetic field. The solution is the gravity dual to the Anti-de Sitter/Boundary Conformal Field Theory correspondence, enabling the study of properties within an anisotropic fluid framework. Utilizing holographic renormalization, we compute the free energy and the holographic stress tensor residing on the boundary denoted as $Q$. Within the fluid/gravity correspondence framework, we have a class of boundary extensions in $Q$, where the stress-energy tensor describes a magnetizing conformal fluid. We discuss the characteristics of this special solution as well as its thermodynamic properties, including the bulk and shear viscosity, the square of the speed of sound, as well as the anisotropic effects induced by the magnetic field in the magnetized conformal plasma.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present a realization of dark dimension. We consider the 5D standard model coupling to gravity with one dimension compactified on an orbifold, which is seen as dark dimension of size R. We stabilize the radion by casimir effect wrapping around compact dimension and recover the neutrino mass and 4D cosmological constant with the observed value. Orbifold can lead to a natural resolution of chirality problem in 5D at low energy, which we briefly discussed in the paper. Although we found that the radion mass is too light to survive under solar system tests of GR, several screening mechanisms might give us a solution, for example, Chameleon mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the computation of one-loop partition function in AdS$_{d+1}$ using the method in [arXiv:2201.09043] and [arXiv:2303.02711] for scalars and fermions to the case of $U(1)$ vectors. This method utilizes the eigenfunctions of the AdS Laplacian for vectors. For finite temperature, the partition function is obtained by generalizing the eigenfunctions so that they are invariant under the quotient group action, which defines the thermal AdS spaces. The results obtained match with those available in the literature. As an application of these results, we then analyze phases of scalar QED theories at one-loop in $d=2,3$. We do this first as functions of AdS radius at zero temperature showing that the results reduce to those in flat space in the large AdS radius limit. Thereafter the phases are studied as a function of the scalar mass and temperature. We also derive effective potentials and study phases of the scalar QED theories with $N$ scalars.</description>

      <title>Lecture notes on current-current deformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These are pedagogical lecture notes discussing current-current deformations of 2-dimensional field theories. The deformations that are considered here are generated infinitesimally by bilinears of Noether currents corresponding to internal global symmetries of the "seed" theory. When the seed theory is conformal, these deformations are marginal and are often known as $J\bar J$-deformations. In this context, we review the criterion for marginal operators due to Chaudhuri and Schwartz. When the seed theory is an integrable $\sigma$-model (in the sense that it possesses a Lax connection), these deformations preserve the integrability. Here we review this fact by viewing the deformations as maps that leave the equations of motion and the Poisson brackets of the 2-dimensional $\sigma$-models invariant. The reinterpretation as undeformed theories with twisted boundary conditions is also discussed, as well as the effect of the deformation at the level of the S-matrix of the quantum theory. The finite (or integrated) form of the deformations is equivalent to sequences of T-duality--shift--T-duality transformations (TsT's), and here we review the $O(d,d)$-covariant formalism that is useful to describe them.
  The presentation starts with pedagogical examples of deformations of free massless scalars in 2 dimensions, and minimal prerequisites on conformal field theories or integrability are needed to understand later sections. Moreover, guided exercises are proposed to the reader. These notes were prepared for the Young Researchers Integrability School and Workshop (YRISW) held in Durham from 17 to 21 July 2023.</description>

      <title>Entanglement islands and cutoff branes from path-integral optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently it was proposed that, the AdS/BCFT correspondence can be simulated by a holographic Weyl transformed CFT$_2$, where the cut-off brane plays the role of the Karch-Randall (KR) brane \cite{Basu:2022crn}. In this paper, we focus on the Weyl transformation that optimizes the path integral computation of the reduced density matrix for a single interval in a holographic CFT$_2$. When we take the limit that one of the endpoint of the interval goes to infinity (a half line), such a holographic Weyl transformed CFT$_2$ matches the AdS/BCFT configuration for a BCFT with one boundary. Without taking the limit, the induced cutoff brane becomes a circle passing through the two endpoints of the interval. We assume that the cutoff brane also plays the same role as the KR brane in AdS/BCFT, hence the path-integral-optimized purification for the interval is in the island phase. This explains the appearance of negative mutual information observed in \cite{Camargo:2022mme}. We check that, the entanglement entropy and the balanced partial entanglement entropy (BPE) calculated via the island formulas, exactly match with the RT formula and the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), which are allowed to anchor on the cutoff brane.</description>

      <title>Worldline approach for spinor fields in manifolds with boundaries</title>

Abstract: The worldline formalism is a useful scheme in Quantum Field Theory which has also become a powerful tool for numerical computations. It is based on the first quantisation of a point-particle whose transition amplitudes correspond to the heat-kernel of the operator of quantum fluctuations of the field theory. However, to study a quantum field theory in a bounded manifold one needs to restrict the path integration domain of the point-particle to a specific subset of worldlines enclosed by those boundaries. In the present article it is shown how to implement this restriction for the case of a spinor field in a two-dimensional curved half-plane under MIT bag boundary conditions, and compute the first few heat-kernel coefficients as a verification of the proposed construction. This construction admits several generalisations.</description>

      <title>Bulk-local dS$_3$ holography: the Matter with $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm which builds a concrete dual for large-radius 3d de Sitter with a timelike York boundary for both gravity and bulk effective fields. This generalizes the solvable $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$ deformation, whose finite real spectrum accounts for the refined Gibbons-Hawking entropy as a microstate count while reproducing the radial static patch geometry. The required generalization to produce approximately local boundary conditions for bulk quantum fields requires a scheme for defining double-trace operators dual to deformed boundary conditions to realize the finite timelike boundary, valid at finite N. By starting with a small stint of a pure $T\bar T$ trajectory, the theory becomes finite, enabling well-defined subtractions to define the double-trace deformation so as to match the large-N prescription of Hartman, Kruthoff, Shaghoulian, and Tajdini to good approximation. We incorporate the matter effecting an uplift from negative to positive cosmological constant, and analyze the effect of matter on the energy spectrum of the theory arising from time-dependent bulk excitations. This validates the cosmic horizon $dS_3$ microstate count for large-radius $dS_3$ holography, embedding $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$ concretely into a larger theory consistent with bulk locality for matter fields. We comment briefly on potential upgrades to four dimensions and other future directions.</description>

Abstract: We discuss general one and two-loop banana diagrams and one-loop diagrams with external lines with arbitrary masses on the anti de Sitter spacetime by using methods of AdS quantum field theory in the dimensional regularization approach. The banana diagrams explicitly computed in this paper are indeed the necessary ingredients for the evaluation of the two-loop effective potential of the Standard Model and can be used to extend the flat space results in in presence of a negative cosmological constant. In the one-loop case we also compute the effective potential for an $O(N)$ model in $d=4$ dimension as an explicit function of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, both exactly and perturbatively up to order $\Lambda$. In the two-loop case we show the explicit calculation is possible thanks to a remarkable discrete K\"all\'en-Lehmann formula which we found and proved sometimes ago and whose domain of applicability we extend in the present paper.</description>

Abstract: We study holographic volume complexity for various families of holographic cosmologies with Kasner-like singularities, in particular with $AdS$, hyperscaling violating and Lifshitz asymptotics. We find through extensive numerical studies that the complexity surface always bends in the direction away from the singularity and transitions from spacelike near the boundary to lightlike in the interior. As the boundary anchoring time slice approaches the singularity, the transition to lightlike is more rapid, with the spacelike part shrinking. The complexity functional has vanishing contributions from the lightlike region so in the vicinity of the singularity, complexity is vanishingly small, indicating a dual Kasner state of vanishingly low complexity, suggesting an extreme thinning of the effective degrees of freedom dual to the near singularity region. We also develop further previous studies on extremal surfaces for holographic entanglement entropy, and find that in the IR limit they reveal similar behaviour as complexity.</description>

      <title>Coupling of Branes and Twisted Self-Duality in the Maxwell-Chern-Simons Theory</title>

Abstract: We study three approaches to electric-magnetic duality in the 4-dimensional Maxwell theory coupled to a dyonic point charge and in the 5-dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons (MCS) theory coupled to an electric point charge and a magnetic string charge. The three approaches have been developed by Dirac, Bunster and Henneaux, and Pasti, Sorokin and Tonin (PST). In Dirac's formulation, the electric magnetic duality is realized only on the level of the equations of motion. The other two formulations introduce a dual (magnetic) gauge potential to induce manifest twisted self-duality in the action. In particular, we study the relations connecting the three approaches. The main results of this paper are the Bunster-Henneaux and PST formulations of the MCS theory with sources. We compare our result to the PST formulation of 11-dimensional supergravity coupled to the M2- and M5-brane by Bandos, Berkovits, and Sorokin.</description>

      <title>Flux vacua in type IIB compactifications on orbifolds: their finiteness and minimal string coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a detailed study of (supersymmetric) moduli stabilisation in type IIB toroidal orientifolds with fluxes. We provide strong evidence towards exhaustion of the finite number of inequivalent vacua for a given total 3-form flux charge $N_{\rm flux}$. We also find that the minimal value of the string coupling $g_s$ is given in terms of $N_{\rm flux}$ and present strong evidence for the asymptotic relation $g_{s,\,\rm{min}}\sim c/N_{\rm flux}^\alpha$, with $\alpha=1,2$, valid for not too small $N_{\rm flux}$, where $c$ is an order 1 coefficient and $\alpha$ depends on the orbifold. Imposing tadpole cancellation, $N_{\rm flux}$ is bounded from the number of orientifold O3-planes. Combined with the flux quantisation, this reduces considerably the allowed vacua while the lower bound of the string coupling is then not far from unity. On the other hand, the presence of negative D3-brane charge induced by magnetised D7-branes breaks supersymmetry and relaxes the bound, allowing significantly smaller values for $g_s$.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic Representations of Topological Orders with Loop- and Membrane-like Excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spacetime dimensions of 4D (i.e., 3+1D) and higher, topological orders exhibit spatially extended excitations like loops and membranes, which support diverse topological data characterizing braiding, fusion, and shrinking processes, despite the absence of anyons. Our understanding of these topological data remains less mature compared to 3D, where anyons have been extensively studied and can be fully described through diagrammatic representations. Inspired by recent advancements in field theory descriptions of higher-dimensional topological orders, this paper systematically constructs diagrammatic representations for 4D and 5D topological orders, generalizable to higher dimensions. We introduce elementary diagrams for fusion and shrinking processes, treating them as vectors in fusion and shrinking spaces, respectively, and build complex diagrams by combining these elementary diagrams. Within these vector spaces, we design unitary operations represented by \(F\)-, \(\Delta\)-, and \(\Delta^2\)-symbols to transform between different bases. We uncover \textit{pentagon equations} and \textit{(hierarchical) shrinking-fusion hexagon equations} that impose constraints on the legitimate forms of these unitary operations. We conjecture that all anomaly-free higher-dimensional topological orders must satisfy these conditions, with any violations indicating a quantum anomaly. This work opens promising avenues for future research, including the exploration of diagrammatic representations involving braiding and implications for noninvertible symmetries and Symmetry Topological Field Theory.</description>

Abstract: We construct dimer graphs for type D relativistic Toda models by introducing impurities to the $Y^{2N,0}$ square dimer graphs. By properly placing the impurities and change of canonical variables assigned to the 1-loops on the dimer graph, we introduce the "folding" of the graphs and get the type D relativistic Toda lattice Hamiltonian and monodromy matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism is applied to quantise the ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric generalisation of the Freedman-Townsend (FT) model, which was proposed by Lindstr\"om and Ro\v{c}ek in 1983 in Minkowski superspace and is lifted to a supergravity background in this paper. This super FT theory describes a non-Abelian tensor multiplet and is known to be classically equivalent to a supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model. Using path integral considerations, we demonstrate that this equivalence holds at the quantum level in the sense that the quantum supercurrents in the two theories coincide. A modified Faddeev-Popov procedure is employed to quantise models for the ${\cal N}=2$ tensor multiplet in harmonic superspace. The obtained results agree with those derived by applying the Batalin-Vilkovisky scheme within the harmonic superspace setting.</description>

Abstract: We study the asymptotic dynamics of 3D gravity with Rindler boundary conditions both in flat and AdS spacetimes.

      <description>arXiv:2406.06042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective Hamiltonians for chiral supersymmetric gauge theories at small spatial volume are generalizations of the Hamiltonians describing the motion of a scalar or a spinor particle in a field of Dirac monopoles (we are dealing in fact with a certain lattice of monopoles supplemented with a periodic singular potential). The gauge fields in such Hamiltonians belong to the Cartan subalgebras of the corresponding gauge algebras. Such a construction exists for all groups admitting complex representations, i.e. for $SU(N \geq 3), \ Spin(4n+2)$ with $n \geq 1$ and $E_6$. We give explicit expressions for these Hamiltonians for $SU(3)$, $SU(4) \simeq Spin(6)$ and for $SU(5)$. The simplified version of such a Hamiltonian, deprived of fermion terms, of the extra scalar potential and when only one node of the lattice is taken into consideration, describe a $3r$-dimensional motion ($r$ being the rank of the group) in the field what we call a {\it Cartan monopole}. As is the case for the ordinary monopole, the Lagrangian of this system enjoys gauge symmetry, rotational symmetry, and the parameter, generalizing the notion of magnetic charge for Cartan monopoles, is quantized.</description>

Abstract: We study timelike and conventional entanglement entropy as potential probes of black hole singularities via the AdS/CFT correspondence. Using an analytically tractable example, we find characteristic behavior of holographic timelike entanglement entropy when the geometry involves a curvature singularity. We also observe interesting phenomena that, in some particular setups, holographic timelike and conventional entanglement entropy are determined from multiple complex saddle points, which fall outside the assumptions of the Lewkowycz-Maldacena type argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.07459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the thermoelectric and thermal transport in the weakly disordered non-Fermi liquid phase of the Luttinger semimetals at zero doping, where the decay rate associated with the (strong) Coulomb interactions is much larger than the electron-impurity scattering rate. To this end, we implement the Mori-Zwanzig memory matrix method, that does not rely on the existence of long-lived quasiparticles in the system. We find that the thermal conductivity at zero electric field scales as $\bar{\kappa}\sim T^{-n}$ (with $0\lesssim n\lesssim 1)$ at low temperatures, whereas the thermoelectric coefficient has the temperature dependence given by $\alpha\sim T^{p}$ (with $1/2\lesssim p\lesssim 3/2)$. These unconventional properties turn out to be key signatures of this long sought-after non-Fermi liquid state in the Luttinger semimetals, which is expected to emerge in strongly correlated spin-orbit coupled materials like the pyrochlore iridates. Finally, our results indicate that these materials might be good candidates for achieving high figure of merit for thermoelectric applications.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an invariant of a hyperbolic knot which is a map $\alpha\mapsto \boldsymbol{\Phi}_\alpha(h)$ from $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ to matrices with entries in $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}[[h]]$ and with rows and columns indexed by the boundary parabolic ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ representations of the fundamental group of the knot. These matrix invariants have a rich structure: (a) their $(\sigma_0,\sigma_1)$ entry, where $\sigma_0$ is the trivial and $\sigma_1$ the geometric representation, is the power series expansion of the Kashaev invariant of the knot around the root of unity ${\rm e}^{2\pi{\rm i} \alpha}$ as an element of the Habiro ring, and the remaining entries belong to generalized Habiro rings of number fields; (b) the first column is given by the perturbative power series of Dimofte-Garoufalidis; (c) the columns of $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ are fundamental solutions of a linear $q$-difference equation; (d) the matrix defines an ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$-cocycle $W_\gamma$ in matrix-valued functions on $\mathbb{Q}$ that conjecturally extends to a smooth function on $\mathbb{R}$ and even to holomorphic functions on suitable complex cut planes, lifting the factorially divergent series $\boldsymbol{\Phi}(h)$ to actual functions. The two invariants $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ and $W_\gamma$ are related by a refined quantum modularity conjecture which we illustrate in detail for the three simplest hyperbolic knots, the $4_1$, $5_2$ and $(-2,3,7)$ pretzel knots. This paper has two sequels, one giving a different realization of our invariant as a matrix of convergent $q$-series with integer coefficients and the other studying its Habiro-like arithmetic properties in more depth.</description>

Abstract: The reduction of the `master system' of free motion on the cotangent bundle $T^*G$ of a compact, connected and simply connected, semisimple Lie group is considered using the conjugation action of $G$. It is proved that the restriction of the reduced system to the smooth component of the quotient space $T^*G/G$, given by the principal orbit type, inherits the degenerate integrability of the master system. The proof can be generalized easily to other interesting examples of Hamiltonian reduction.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gluon Distribution for Quarkonium Dynamics in Strongly Coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized gluon distribution that governs the dynamics of quarkonium inside a non-Abelian thermal plasma characterizing its dissociation and recombination rates. This gluon distribution can be written in terms of a correlation function of two chromoelectric fields connected by an adjoint Wilson line. We formulate and calculate this object in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at strong coupling using the AdS/CFT correspondence, allowing for a nonzero center-of-mass velocity $v$ of the heavy quark pair relative to the medium. The effect of a moving medium on the dynamics of the heavy quark pair is described by the simple substitution $T \to \sqrt{\gamma} \, T$ in agreement with previous calculations of other observables at strong coupling, where $T$ is the temperature of the plasma in its rest frame, and $\gamma = (1 - v^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz boost factor. Such a velocity dependence can be important when the quarkonium momentum is larger than its mass. Contrary to general expectations for open quantum systems weakly coupled with large thermal environments, the contributions to the transition rates that are usually thought of as the leading ones in Markovian descriptions vanish in this strongly coupled plasma. This calls for new theoretical developments to assess the effects of strongly coupled non-Abelian plasmas on in-medium quarkonium dynamics. Finally, we compare our results with those from weakly coupled QCD, and find that the QCD result moves toward the $\mathcal{N}=4$ strongly coupled result as the coupling constant is increased within the regime of applicability of perturbation theory. This behavior makes it even more pressing to develop a non-Markovian description of quarkonium in-medium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Emergence of unitary symmetry of microcanonically truncated operators in chaotic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20264v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study statistical properties of matrix elements of observables written in the energy eigenbasis and truncated to small microcanonical windows. We present numerical evidence indicating that for all few body operators in chaotic many-body systems, truncated below certain energy scale, collective statistical properties of matrix elements exhibit emergent unitary symmetry. Namely, we show that below certain scale the spectra of the truncated operators exhibit universal behavior, matching our analytic predictions, which are numerically testable for system sizes beyond exact diagonalization. We discuss operator and system-size dependence of the energy scale of emergent unitary symmetry and put our findings in context of previous works exploring emergence of random-matrix behavior at small energy scales.</description>

      <title>New classical integrable systems from generalized $T\bar{T}$-deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a novel class of classical integrable many-body systems obtained by generalized $T\bar{T}$-deformations of free particles. Deformation terms are bilinears in densities and currents for the continuum of charges counting asymptotic particles of different momenta. In these models, which we dub ``semiclassical Bethe systems'' for their link with the dynamics of Bethe ansatz wave packets, many-body scattering processes are factorised, and two-body scattering shifts can be set to an almost arbitrary function of momenta. The dynamics is local but inherently different from that of known classical integrable systems. At short scales, the geometry of the deformation is dynamically resolved: either particles are slowed down (more space available), or accelerated via a novel classical particle-pair creation/annihilation process (less space available). The thermodynamics both at finite and infinite volumes is described by the equations of (or akin to) the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, and at large scales generalized hydrodynamics emerge.</description>

      <title>Emergent Topology in Many-Body Dissipative Quantum Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The identification, description, and classification of topological features is an engine of discovery and innovation in several fields of physics. This research encompasses a broad variety of systems, from the integer and fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter, to protected states in complex photonic lattices in optics, and the structure of the QCD vacuum. Here, we introduce another playground for topology: the dissipative dynamics of pseudo-Hermitian many-body quantum systems. For that purpose, we study two different systems, the dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, and a quantum chaotic dephasing spin chain. For the two different many-body models, we find the same topological features for a wide range of parameters suggesting that they are universal. In the SYK model, we identify four universality classes, related to pseudo-Hermiticity, characterized by a rectangular block representation of the vectorized Liouvillian that is directly related to the existence of an anomalous trace of the unitary operator implementing fermionic exchange. As a consequence of this rectangularization, we identify a topological index $\nu$ that only depends on symmetry. Another distinct consequence of the rectangularization is the observation, for any coupling to the bath, of purely real topological modes in the Liouvillian. The level statistics of these real modes agree with that of the corresponding random matrix ensemble and therefore can be employed to characterize the four topological symmetry classes. In the limit of weak coupling to the bath, topological modes govern the approach to equilibrium, which may enable a direct path for experimental confirmation of topology in dissipative many-body quantum chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Principal Landau Determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reformulate the Landau analysis of Feynman integrals with the aim of advancing the state of the art in modern particle-physics computations. We contribute new algorithms for computing Landau singularities, using tools from polyhedral geometry and symbolic/numerical elimination. Inspired by the work of Gelfand, Kapranov, and Zelevinsky (GKZ) on generalized Euler integrals, we define the principal Landau determinant of a Feynman diagram. We illustrate with a number of examples that this algebraic formalism allows to compute many components of the Landau singular locus. We adapt the GKZ framework by carefully specializing Euler integrals to Feynman integrals. For instance, ultraviolet and infrared singularities are detected as irreducible components of an incidence variety, which project dominantly to the kinematic space. We compute principal Landau determinants for the infinite families of one-loop and banana diagrams with different mass configurations, and for a range of cutting-edge Standard Model processes. Our algorithms build on the Julia package Landau.jl and are implemented in the new open-source package PLD.jl available at https://mathrepo.mis.mpg.de/PLD/.</description>

      <title>A unified scheme for calculating the exclusive semi-leptonic decays of hadrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exclusive semi-leptonic decay stands as a pivotal channel in the exploration of heavy flavor physics, primarily due to its straightforward experimental measurability. In this work, we delve into the hadron matrix element and hadron tensor within the context of exclusive semi-leptonic decays. We challenge the conventional exclusive decay theory by introducing a fresh perspective, revealing that while the baryon sector is consistent, the meson sector warrants revision. Employing a novel form factor derived from the Taylor series expansion in our differential width calculations, we demonstrate that fitting experimental data necessitates a more streamlined and minimal parameter set compared to the standard Light Cone Sun Rul(LCSR) form factors. Furthermore, we propose that our hypothesis can be empirically validated or refuted through the precise measurement of the double differential decay width, offering a tangible path forward for experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Small-scale clustering of Primordial Black Holes: cloud-in-cloud and exclusion effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an excursion-set approach, we revisit the initial spatial clustering of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) originating from the Hubble re-entry of large Gaussian density fluctuations in the early universe. We derive the two-point correlation functions of PBHs, properly accounting for the "cloud-in-cloud" mechanism. Our expressions naturally and intrinsically correlate the formation of pairs of PBHs, which is a key difference with the Poisson model of clustering. Our approach effectively includes short-range exclusion effects and clarifies the clustering behaviors at small scale: PBHs are anti-correlated at short distances. Using a scale-independent collapse threshold, we derive explicit expressions for the excess probability to find pairs of PBHs separated by a distance $r$, as well as the excess probability to find pairs with asymmetric mass ratio. Our framework is model-independent by construction and we discuss possible other applications.</description>

      <title>Entangled multiplets, asymmetry, and quantum Mpemba effect in dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the entanglement asymmetry emerged as an informative tool to understand dynamical symmetry restoration in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems after a quantum quench. For integrable systems the asymmetry can be understood in the space-time scaling limit via the quasiparticle picture, as it was pointed out in Ref. [1]. However, a quasiparticle picture for quantum quenches from generic initial states was still lacking. Here we conjecture a full-fledged quasiparticle picture for the charged moments of the reduced density matrix, which are the main ingredients to construct the asymmetry. Our formula works for quenches producing entangled multiplets of an arbitrary number of excitations. We benchmark our results in the $XX$ spin chain. First, by using an elementary approach based on the multidimensional stationary phase approximation we provide an $\textit{ab initio}$ rigorous derivation of the dynamics of the charged moments for the quench treated in [2]. Then, we show that the same results can be straightforwardly obtained within our quasiparticle picture. As a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain a general criterion ensuring a vanishing entanglement asymmetry at long times. Next, by using the Lindblad master equation, we study the effect of gain and loss dissipation on the entanglement asymmetry. Specifically, we investigate the fate of the so-called quantum Mpemba effect (QME) in the presence of dissipation. We show that dissipation can induce QME even if unitary dynamics does not show it, and we provide a quasiparticle-based interpretation of the condition for the QME.</description>

      <title>Classical Kerr-Schild double copy in bigravity for maximally symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalized Kerr-Schild ansatz for bigravity, already considered in the literature, which leads to linear interactions between the metrics is used to study the bigravity equations in the context of the double copy. By contracting the resulting spin-2 field bigravity equations of motion using Killing vector fields, as is usually carried out in general relativity, we arrive to the single and zeroth copy equations for the mentioned ansatz. For the case of stationary solutions, we obtain two Maxwell and two conformally coupled scalar field equations for the single and zeroth copies respectively, and the linear interactions are absent. In the time-dependent case we obtain equations for the fields which are coupled. By decoupling these equations and at the zeroth copy level, we recover a massless and a massive field whose mass is proportional to the Fierz-Pauli mass and depends on the coefficients of the interaction potential between the metrics. This has been also previously documented in the literature and is now reinterpreted within the context of the double copy proposal.</description>

      <title>Black holes, multiple propagation speeds, and energy extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics predicts the speed of light to be a universal speed of propagation of massless carriers. However, other possibilities exist -- including Lorentz-violating theories -- where different fundamental fields travel at different speeds. Black holes are interesting probes of such physics, as distinct fields would probe different horizons. Here, we build an exact spacetime for two interacting scalar fields which have different propagation speeds. One of these fields is able to probe the black hole interior of the other, giving rise to energy extraction from the black hole and a characteristic late-time relaxation. Our results provide further stimulus to the search for extra degrees of freedom, black hole instability, and extra ringdown modes in gravitational-wave events.</description>
