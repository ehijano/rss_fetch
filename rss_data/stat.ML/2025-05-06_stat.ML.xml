      <title>Fast Likelihood-Free Parameter Estimation for L\'evy Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: L\'evy processes are widely used in financial modeling due to their ability to capture discontinuities and heavy tails, which are common in high-frequency asset return data. However, parameter estimation remains a challenge when associated likelihoods are unavailable or costly to compute. We propose a fast and accurate method for L\'evy parameter estimation using the neural Bayes estimation (NBE) framework -- a simulation-based, likelihood-free approach that leverages permutation-invariant neural networks to approximate Bayes estimators. Through extensive simulations across several L\'evy models, we show that NBE outperforms traditional methods in both accuracy and runtime, while also enabling rapid bootstrap-based uncertainty quantification. We illustrate our approach on a challenging high-frequency cryptocurrency return dataset, where the method captures evolving parameter dynamics and delivers reliable and interpretable inference at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional methods. NBE provides a scalable and practical solution for inference in complex financial models, enabling parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification over an entire year of data in just seconds. We additionally investigate nearly a decade of high-frequency Bitcoin returns, requiring less than one minute to estimate parameters under the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>TV-SurvCaus: Dynamic Representation Balancing for Causal Survival Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the causal effect of time-varying treatments on survival outcomes is a challenging task in many domains, particularly in medicine where treatment protocols adapt over time. While recent advances in representation learning have improved causal inference for static treatments, extending these methods to dynamic treatment regimes with survival outcomes remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce TV-SurvCaus, a novel framework that extends representation balancing techniques to the time-varying treatment setting for survival analysis. We provide theoretical guarantees through (1) a generalized bound for time-varying precision in estimation of heterogeneous effects, (2) variance control via sequential balancing weights, (3) consistency results for dynamic treatment regimes, (4) convergence rates for representation learning with temporal dependencies, and (5) a formal bound on the bias due to treatment-confounder feedback. Our neural architecture incorporates sequence modeling to handle temporal dependencies while balancing time-dependent representations. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that TV-SurvCaus outperforms existing methods in estimating individualized treatment effects with time-varying covariates and treatments. Our framework advances the field of causal inference by enabling more accurate estimation of treatment effects in dynamic, longitudinal settings with survival outcomes.</description>

      <title>Bayesian learning of the optimal action-value function in a Markov decision process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a popular framework for sequential decision-making problems, and uncertainty quantification is an essential component of it to learn optimal decision-making strategies. In particular, a Bayesian framework is used to maintain beliefs about the optimal decisions and the unknown ingredients of the model, which are also to be learned from the data, such as the rewards and state dynamics. However, many existing Bayesian approaches for learning the optimal decision-making strategy are based on unrealistic modelling assumptions and utilise approximate inference techniques. This raises doubts whether the benefits of Bayesian uncertainty quantification are fully realised or can be relied upon.
  We focus on infinite-horizon and undiscounted MDPs, with finite state and action spaces, and a terminal state. We provide a full Bayesian framework, from modelling to inference to decision-making. For modelling, we introduce a likelihood function with minimal assumptions for learning the optimal action-value function based on Bellman's optimality equations, analyse its properties, and clarify connections to existing works. For deterministic rewards, the likelihood is degenerate and we introduce artificial observation noise to relax it, in a controlled manner, to facilitate more efficient Monte Carlo-based inference. For inference, we propose an adaptive sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to both sample from and adjust the sequence of relaxed posterior distributions. For decision-making, we choose actions using samples from the posterior distribution over the optimal strategies. While commonly done, we provide new insight that clearly shows that it is a generalisation of Thompson sampling from multi-arm bandit problems. Finally, we evaluate our framework on the Deep Sea benchmark problem and demonstrate the exploration benefits of posterior sampling in MDPs.</description>

      <title>Extended Fiducial Inference for Individual Treatment Effects via Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual treatment effect estimation has gained significant attention in recent data science literature. This work introduces the Double Neural Network (Double-NN) method to address this problem within the framework of extended fiducial inference (EFI). In the proposed method, deep neural networks are used to model the treatment and control effect functions, while an additional neural network is employed to estimate their parameters. The universal approximation capability of deep neural networks ensures the broad applicability of this method. Numerical results highlight the superior performance of the proposed Double-NN method compared to the conformal quantile regression (CQR) method in individual treatment effect estimation. From the perspective of statistical inference, this work advances the theory and methodology for statistical inference of large models. Specifically, it is theoretically proven that the proposed method permits the model size to increase with the sample size $n$ at a rate of $O(n^{\zeta})$ for some $0 \leq \zeta&lt;1$, while still maintaining proper quantification of uncertainty in the model parameters. This result marks a significant improvement compared to the range $0\leq \zeta &lt; \frac{1}{2}$ required by the classical central limit theorem. Furthermore, this work provides a rigorous framework for quantifying the uncertainty of deep neural networks under the neural scaling law, representing a substantial contribution to the statistical understanding of large-scale neural network models.</description>

      <title>Learning the Simplest Neural ODE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the advent of the ``Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE)'' paper, learning ODEs with deep learning has been applied to system identification, time-series forecasting, and related areas. Exploiting the diffeomorphic nature of ODE solution maps, neural ODEs has also enabled their use in generative modeling. Despite the rich potential to incorporate various kinds of physical information, training Neural ODEs remains challenging in practice. This study demonstrates, through the simplest one-dimensional linear model, why training Neural ODEs is difficult. We then propose a new stabilization method and provide an analytical convergence analysis. The insights and techniques presented here serve as a concise tutorial for researchers beginning work on Neural ODEs.</description>

      <title>Ranked differences Pearson correlation dissimilarity with an application to electricity users time series clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series clustering is an unsupervised learning method for classifying time series data into groups with similar behavior. It is used in applications such as healthcare, finance, economics, energy, and climate science. Several time series clustering methods have been introduced and used for over four decades. Most of them focus on measuring either Euclidean distances or association dissimilarities between time series. In this work, we propose a new dissimilarity measure called ranked Pearson correlation dissimilarity (RDPC), which combines a weighted average of a specified fraction of the largest element-wise differences with the well-known Pearson correlation dissimilarity. It is incorporated into hierarchical clustering. The performance is evaluated and compared with existing clustering algorithms. The results show that the RDPC algorithm outperforms others in complicated cases involving different seasonal patterns, trends, and peaks. Finally, we demonstrate our method by clustering a random sample of customers from a Thai electricity consumption time series dataset into seven groups with unique characteristics.</description>

      <title>Resolving Memorization in Empirical Diffusion Model for Manifold Data in High-Dimensional Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02508v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models is a popular computational tool to generate new data samples. It utilizes a forward diffusion process that add noise to the data distribution and then use a reverse process to remove noises to produce samples from the data distribution. However, when the empirical data distribution consists of $n$ data point, using the empirical diffusion model will necessarily produce one of the existing data points. This is often referred to as the memorization effect, which is usually resolved by sophisticated machine learning procedures in the current literature. This work shows that the memorization problem can be resolved by a simple inertia update step at the end of the empirical diffusion model simulation. Our inertial diffusion model requires only the empirical diffusion model score function and it does not require any further training. We show that choosing the inertia diffusion model sample distribution is an $O\left(n^{-\frac{2}{d+4}}\right)$ Wasserstein-1 approximation of a data distribution lying on a $C^2$ manifold of dimension $d$. Since this estimate is significant smaller the Wasserstein1 distance between population and empirical distributions, it rigorously shows the inertial diffusion model produces new data samples. Remarkably, this upper bound is completely free of the ambient space dimension, since there is no training involved. Our analysis utilizes the fact that the inertial diffusion model samples are approximately distributed as the Gaussian kernel density estimator on the manifold. This reveals an interesting connection between diffusion model and manifold learning.</description>

      <title>Perturbation Analysis of Singular Values in Concatenated Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concatenating matrices is a common technique for uncovering shared structures in data through singular value decomposition (SVD) and low-rank approximations. However, a fundamental question arises: how does the singular value spectrum of the concatenated matrix relate to the spectra of its individual components? In this work, we develop a perturbation framework that extends classical results such as Weyl's inequality to concatenated matrices. We establish analytical bounds that quantify the stability of singular values under small perturbations in the submatrices. Our results show that if the matrices being concatenated are close in norm, the dominant singular values of the concatenated matrix remain stable, enabling controlled trade-offs between accuracy and compression. These insights provide a theoretical foundation for improved matrix clustering and compression strategies, with applications in numerical linear algebra, signal processing, and data-driven modeling.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Approach for Interpolation of Sparse Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of hadron resonances and their properties are limited by the accuracy and consistency of measured datasets, which can originate from many different experiments. We have used Gaussian Processes (GP) to build interpolated datasets, including quantification of uncertainties, so that data from different sources can be used in model fitting without the need for arbitrary weighting. GPs predict values and uncertainties of observables at any kinematic point. Bayesian inference is used to optimise the hyperparameters of the GP model. We demonstrate that the GP successfully interpolates data with quantified uncertainties by comparison with generated pseudodata. We also show that this methodology can be used to investigate the consistency of data from different sources. GPs provide a robust, model-independent method for interpolating typical datasets used in hadron resonance studies, removing the limitations of arbitrary weighting in sparse datasets.</description>

      <title>Contextures: Representations from Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the empirical success of foundation models, we do not have a systematic characterization of the representations that these models learn. In this paper, we establish the contexture theory. It shows that a large class of representation learning methods can be characterized as learning from the association between the input and a context variable. Specifically, we show that many popular methods aim to approximate the top-d singular functions of the expectation operator induced by the context, in which case we say that the representation learns the contexture. We demonstrate the generality of the contexture theory by proving that representation learning within various learning paradigms -- supervised, self-supervised, and manifold learning -- can all be studied from such a perspective. We also prove that the representations that learn the contexture are optimal on those tasks that are compatible with the context. One important implication of the contexture theory is that once the model is large enough to approximate the top singular functions, further scaling up the model size yields diminishing returns. Therefore, scaling is not all we need, and further improvement requires better contexts. To this end, we study how to evaluate the usefulness of a context without knowing the downstream tasks. We propose a metric and show by experiments that it correlates well with the actual performance of the encoder on many real datasets.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Online Conformal Anomaly Detection with Prediction-Powered Data Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online anomaly detection is essential in fields such as cybersecurity, healthcare, and industrial monitoring, where promptly identifying deviations from expected behavior can avert critical failures or security breaches. While numerous anomaly scoring methods based on supervised or unsupervised learning have been proposed, current approaches typically rely on a continuous stream of real-world calibration data to provide assumption-free guarantees on the false discovery rate (FDR). To address the inherent challenges posed by limited real calibration data, we introduce context-aware prediction-powered conformal online anomaly detection (C-PP-COAD). Our framework strategically leverages synthetic calibration data to mitigate data scarcity, while adaptively integrating real data based on contextual cues. C-PP-COAD utilizes conformal p-values, active p-value statistics, and online FDR control mechanisms to maintain rigorous and reliable anomaly detection performance over time. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that C-PP-COAD significantly reduces dependency on real calibration data without compromising guaranteed FDR control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a novel algorithm for solving planning and learning problems of Markov decision processes. The proposed algorithm follows a policy iteration-type update by using a rank-one approximation of the transition probability matrix in the policy evaluation step. This rank-one approximation is closely related to the stationary distribution of the corresponding transition probability matrix, which is approximated using the power method. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the proposed algorithm to optimal (action-)value function with the same rate and computational complexity as the value iteration algorithm in the planning problem and as the Q-learning algorithm in the learning problem. Through our extensive numerical simulations, however, we show that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms first-order algorithms and their accelerated versions for both planning and learning problems.</description>

      <title>Faster logconcave sampling from a cold start in high dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a faster algorithm to generate a warm start for sampling an arbitrary logconcave density specified by an evaluation oracle, leading to the first sub-cubic sampling algorithms for inputs in (near-)isotropic position. A long line of prior work incurred a warm-start penalty of at least linear in the dimension, hitting a cubic barrier, even for the special case of uniform sampling from convex bodies.
  Our improvement relies on two key ingredients of independent interest. (1) We show how to sample given a warm start in weaker notions of distance, in particular $q$-R\'enyi divergence for $q=\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$, whereas previous analyses required stringent $\infty$-R\'enyi divergence (with the exception of Hit-and-Run, whose known mixing time is higher). This marks the first improvement in the required warmness since Lov\'asz and Simonovits (1991). (2) We refine and generalize the log-Sobolev inequality of Lee and Vempala (2018), originally established for isotropic logconcave distributions in terms of the diameter of the support, to logconcave distributions in terms of a geometric average of the support diameter and the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix.</description>

      <title>Restoring Calibration for Aligned Large Language Models: A Calibration-Aware Fine-Tuning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key technologies for the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) is preference alignment. However, a notable side effect of preference alignment is poor calibration: while the pre-trained models are typically well-calibrated, LLMs tend to become poorly calibrated after alignment with human preferences. In this paper, we investigate why preference alignment affects calibration and how to address this issue. For the first question, we observe that the preference collapse issue in alignment undesirably generalizes to the calibration scenario, causing LLMs to exhibit overconfidence and poor calibration. To address this, we demonstrate the importance of fine-tuning with domain-specific knowledge to alleviate the overconfidence issue. To further analyze whether this affects the model's performance, we categorize models into two regimes: calibratable and non-calibratable, defined by bounds of Expected Calibration Error (ECE). In the calibratable regime, we propose a calibration-aware fine-tuning approach to achieve proper calibration without compromising LLMs' performance. However, as models are further fine-tuned for better performance, they enter the non-calibratable regime. For this case, we develop an EM-algorithm-based ECE regularization for the fine-tuning loss to maintain low calibration error. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Wide &amp; Deep Learning for Node Classification</title>

Abstract: Wide &amp; Deep, a simple yet effective learning architecture for recommendation systems developed by Google, has had a significant impact in both academia and industry due to its combination of the memorization ability of generalized linear models and the generalization ability of deep models. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) remain dominant in node classification tasks; however, recent studies have highlighted issues such as heterophily and expressiveness, which focus on graph structure while seemingly neglecting the potential role of node features. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework GCNIII, which leverages the Wide &amp; Deep architecture and incorporates three techniques: Intersect memory, Initial residual and Identity mapping. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that GCNIII can more effectively balance the trade-off between over-fitting and over-generalization on various semi- and full- supervised tasks. Additionally, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for node feature engineering to enhance the performance of GCNIII in cross-domain node classification tasks. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/CYCUCAS/GCNIII.</description>

      <title>Secrets of GFlowNets' Learning Behavior: A Theoretical Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating composite structures, demonstrating considerable promise across diverse applications. While substantial progress has been made in exploring their modeling validity and connections to other generative frameworks, the theoretical understanding of their learning behavior remains largely uncharted. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical investigation of GFlowNets' learning behavior, focusing on four fundamental dimensions: convergence, sample complexity, implicit regularization, and robustness. By analyzing these aspects, we seek to elucidate the intricate mechanisms underlying GFlowNet's learning dynamics, shedding light on its strengths and limitations. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the factors influencing GFlowNet performance and provide insights into principled guidelines for their effective design and deployment. This study not only bridges a critical gap in the theoretical landscape of GFlowNets but also lays the foundation for their evolution as a reliable and interpretable framework for generative modeling. Through this, we aspire to advance the theoretical frontiers of GFlowNets and catalyze their broader adoption in the AI community.</description>

      <title>Neural Logistic Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of neural logistic bandits, where the main task is to learn an unknown reward function within a logistic link function using a neural network. Existing approaches either exhibit unfavorable dependencies on $\kappa$, where $1/\kappa$ represents the minimum variance of reward distributions, or suffer from direct dependence on the feature dimension $d$, which can be huge in neural network-based settings. In this work, we introduce a novel Bernstein-type inequality for self-normalized vector-valued martingales that is designed to bypass a direct dependence on the ambient dimension. This lets us deduce a regret upper bound that grows with the effective dimension $\widetilde{d}$, not the feature dimension, while keeping a minimal dependence on $\kappa$. Based on the concentration inequality, we propose two algorithms, NeuralLog-UCB-1 and NeuralLog-UCB-2, that guarantee regret upper bounds of order $\widetilde{O}(\widetilde{d}\sqrt{\kappa T})$ and $\widetilde{O}(\widetilde{d}\sqrt{T/\kappa})$, respectively, improving on the existing results. Lastly, we report numerical results on both synthetic and real datasets to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Learning Local Causal World Models with State Space Models and Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: World modelling, i.e. building a representation of the rules that govern the world so as to predict its evolution, is an essential ability for any agent interacting with the physical world. Despite their impressive performance, many solutions fail to learn a causal representation of the environment they are trying to model, which would be necessary to gain a deep enough understanding of the world to perform complex tasks. With this work, we aim to broaden the research in the intersection of causality theory and neural world modelling by assessing the potential for causal discovery of the State Space Model (SSM) architecture, which has been shown to have several advantages over the widespread Transformer. We show empirically that, compared to an equivalent Transformer, a SSM can model the dynamics of a simple environment and learn a causal model at the same time with equivalent or better performance, thus paving the way for further experiments that lean into the strength of SSMs and further enhance them with causal awareness.</description>

      <title>Online Functional Principal Component Analysis on a Multidimensional Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multidimensional functional data streams arise in diverse scientific fields, yet their analysis poses significant challenges. We propose a novel online framework for functional principal component analysis that enables efficient and scalable modeling of such data. Our method represents functional principal components using tensor product splines, enforcing smoothness and orthonormality through a penalized framework on a Stiefel manifold. An efficient Riemannian stochastic gradient descent algorithm is developed, with extensions inspired by adaptive moment estimation and averaging techniques to accelerate convergence. Additionally, a dynamic tuning strategy for smoothing parameter selection is developed based on a rolling averaged block validation score that adapts to the streaming nature of the data. Extensive simulations and real-world applications demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework for analyzing multidimensional functional data.</description>

      <title>A Robust Monotonic Single-Index Model for Skewed and Heavy-Tailed Data: A Deep Neural Network Approach Applied to Periodontal Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodontal pocket depth is a widely used biomarker for diagnosing risk of periodontal disease. However, pocket depth typically exhibits skewness and heavy-tailedness, and its relationship with clinical risk factors is often nonlinear. Motivated by periodontal studies, this paper develops a robust single-index modal regression framework for analyzing skewed and heavy-tailed data. Our method has the following novel features: (1) a flexible two-piece scale Student-$t$ error distribution that generalizes both normal and two-piece scale normal distributions; (2) a deep neural network with guaranteed monotonicity constraints to estimate the unknown single-index function; and (3) theoretical guarantees, including model identifiability and a universal approximation theorem. Our single-index model combines the flexibility of neural networks and the two-piece scale Student-$t$ distribution, delivering robust mode-based estimation that is resistant to outliers, while retaining clinical interpretability through parametric index coefficients. We demonstrate the performance of our method through simulation studies and an application to periodontal disease data from the HealthPartners Institute of Minnesota. The proposed methodology is implemented in the \textsf{R} package \href{https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.DNNSIM}{\textsc{DNNSIM}}.</description>

      <title>Latent Variable Estimation in Bayesian Black-Litterman Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Bayesian Black-Litterman (BL) portfolio model and remove its reliance on subjective investor views. Classical BL requires an investor "view": a forecast vector $q$ and its uncertainty matrix $\Omega$ that describe how much a chosen portfolio should outperform the market. Our key idea is to treat $(q,\Omega)$ as latent variables and learn them from market data within a single Bayesian network. Consequently, the resulting posterior estimation admits closed-form expression, enabling fast inference and stable portfolio weights. Building on these, we propose two mechanisms to capture how features interact with returns: shared-latent parametrization and feature-influenced views; both recover classical BL and Markowitz portfolios as special cases. Empirically, on 30-year Dow-Jones and 20-year sector-ETF data, we improve Sharpe ratios by 50% and cut turnover by 55% relative to Markowitz and the index baselines. This work turns BL into a fully data-driven, view-free, and coherent Bayesian framework for portfolio optimization.</description>

      <title>Exogenous Isomorphism for Counterfactual Identifiability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates $\sim_{\mathcal{L}_3}$-identifiability, a form of complete counterfactual identifiability within the Pearl Causal Hierarchy (PCH) framework, ensuring that all Structural Causal Models (SCMs) satisfying the given assumptions provide consistent answers to all causal questions. To simplify this problem, we introduce exogenous isomorphism and propose $\sim_{\mathrm{EI}}$-identifiability, reflecting the strength of model identifiability required for $\sim_{\mathcal{L}_3}$-identifiability. We explore sufficient assumptions for achieving $\sim_{\mathrm{EI}}$-identifiability in two special classes of SCMs: Bijective SCMs (BSCMs), based on counterfactual transport, and Triangular Monotonic SCMs (TM-SCMs), which extend $\sim_{\mathcal{L}_2}$-identifiability. Our results unify and generalize existing theories, providing theoretical guarantees for practical applications. Finally, we leverage neural TM-SCMs to address the consistency problem in counterfactual reasoning, with experiments validating both the effectiveness of our method and the correctness of the theory.</description>

      <title>Practical Efficiency of Muon for Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Muon, the simplest instantiation of a second-order optimizer, explicitly expands the Pareto frontier over AdamW on the compute-time tradeoff. We find that Muon is more effective than AdamW in retaining data efficiency at large batch sizes, far beyond the so-called critical batch size, while remaining computationally efficient, thus enabling more economical training. We study the combination of Muon and the maximal update parameterization (muP) for efficient hyperparameter transfer and present a simple telescoping algorithm that accounts for all sources of error in muP while introducing only a modest overhead in resources. We validate our findings through extensive experiments with model sizes up to four billion parameters and ablations on the data distribution and architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a continuous-time framework for analyzing Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) via stochastic control and Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs). Considering a continuous-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) driven by a square-integrable martingale, we analyze DQN approximation properties. We show that DQNs can approximate the optimal Q-function on compact sets with arbitrary accuracy and high probability, leveraging residual network approximation theorems and large deviation bounds for the state-action process. We then analyze the convergence of a general Q-learning algorithm for training DQNs in this setting, adapting stochastic approximation theorems. Our analysis emphasizes the interplay between DQN layer count, time discretization, and the role of viscosity solutions (primarily for the value function $V^*$) in addressing potential non-smoothness of the optimal Q-function. This work bridges deep reinforcement learning and stochastic control, offering insights into DQNs in continuous-time settings, relevant for applications with physical systems or high-frequency data.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Guided Sampling of Flat Modes in Discrete Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling from flat modes in discrete spaces is a crucial yet underexplored problem. Flat modes represent robust solutions and have broad applications in combinatorial optimization and discrete generative modeling. However, existing sampling algorithms often overlook the mode volume and struggle to capture flat modes effectively. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Entropic Discrete Langevin Proposal} (EDLP), which incorporates local entropy into the sampling process through a continuous auxiliary variable under a joint distribution. The local entropy term guides the discrete sampler toward flat modes with a small overhead. We provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for EDLP in locally log-concave discrete distributions. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms traditional approaches across tasks that require sampling from flat basins, including Bernoulli distribution, restricted Boltzmann machines, combinatorial optimization, and binary neural networks.</description>

      <title>Enabling Local Neural Operators to perform Equation-Free System-Level Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Operators (NOs) provide a powerful framework for computations involving physical laws that can be modelled by (integro-) partial differential equations (PDEs), directly learning maps between infinite-dimensional function spaces that bypass both the explicit equation identification and their subsequent numerical solving. Still, NOs have so far primarily been employed to explore the dynamical behavior as surrogates of brute-force temporal simulations/predictions. Their potential for systematic rigorous numerical system-level tasks, such as fixed-point, stability, and bifurcation analysis - crucial for predicting irreversible transitions in real-world phenomena - remains largely unexplored. Toward this aim, inspired by the Equation-Free multiscale framework, we propose and implement a framework that integrates (local) NOs with advanced iterative numerical methods in the Krylov subspace, so as to perform efficient system-level stability and bifurcation analysis of large-scale dynamical systems. Beyond fixed point, stability, and bifurcation analysis enabled by local in time NOs, we also demonstrate the usefulness of local in space as well as in space-time ("patch") NOs in accelerating the computer-aided analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics. We illustrate our framework via three nonlinear PDE benchmarks: the 1D Allen-Cahn equation, which undergoes multiple concatenated pitchfork bifurcations; the Liouville-Bratu-Gelfand PDE, which features a saddle-node tipping point; and the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, consisting of two coupled PDEs that exhibit both Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to show how different machine learning tools on the Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{P}_d$ of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices can be united under a probabilistic framework. For this, we will need several Gaussian distributions defined on $\mathcal{P}_d$. We will show how popular classifiers on $\mathcal{P}_d$ can be reinterpreted as Bayes Classifiers using these Gaussian distributions. These distributions will also be used for outlier detection and dimension reduction. By showing that those distributions are pervasive in the tools used on $\mathcal{P}_d$, we allow for other machine learning tools to be extended to $\mathcal{P}_d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations enhance interpretability by identifying alternative inputs that produce different outputs, offering localized insights into model decisions. However, traditional methods often neglect causal relationships, leading to unrealistic examples. While newer approaches integrate causality, they are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient method based on backtracking counterfactuals that incorporates causal reasoning to generate actionable explanations. We first examine the limitations of existing methods and then introduce our novel approach and its features. We also explore the relationship between our method and previous techniques, demonstrating that it generalizes them in specific scenarios. Finally, experiments show that our method provides deeper insights into model outputs.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Robust Aggregation for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models on decentralized data. This scheme, however, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, when some of the clients submit corrupted model updates. In real-world scenarios, the total number of compromised clients is typically unknown, with the extent of attacks potentially varying over time. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive approach for robust aggregation of model updates based on Bayesian inference. The mean update is defined by the maximum of the likelihood marginalized over probabilities of each client to be `honest'. As a result, the method shares the simplicity of the classical average estimators (e.g., sample mean or geometric median), being independent of the number of compromised clients. At the same time, it is as effective against attacks as methods specifically tailored to Federated Learning, such as Krum. We compare our approach with other aggregation schemes in federated setting on three benchmark image classification data sets. The proposed method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various attack types with static and varying number of malicious clients.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02537v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional techniques for imposing monotonicity in MLPs by construction involve the use of non-negative weight constraints and bounded activation functions, which pose well-known optimization challenges. In this work, we generalize previous theoretical results, showing that MLPs with non-negative weight constraint and activations that saturate on alternating sides are universal approximators for monotonic functions. Additionally, we show an equivalence between the saturation side in the activations and the sign of the weight constraint. This connection allows us to prove that MLPs with convex monotone activations and non-positive constrained weights also qualify as universal approximators, in contrast to their non-negative constrained counterparts. Our results provide theoretical grounding to the empirical effectiveness observed in previous works while leading to possible architectural simplification. Moreover, to further alleviate the optimization difficulties, we propose an alternative formulation that allows the network to adjust its activations according to the sign of the weights. This eliminates the requirement for weight reparameterization, easing initialization and improving training stability. Experimental evaluation reinforces the validity of the theoretical results, showing that our novel approach compares favourably to traditional monotonic architectures.</description>

      <title>Towards Cross-Modality Modeling for Time Series Analytics: A Survey in the LLM Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of edge devices has generated an unprecedented volume of time series data across different domains, motivating various well-customized methods. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm for time series analytics by leveraging the shared sequential nature of textual data and time series. However, a fundamental cross-modality gap between time series and LLMs exists, as LLMs are pre-trained on textual corpora and are not inherently optimized for time series. Many recent proposals are designed to address this issue. In this survey, we provide an up-to-date overview of LLMs-based cross-modality modeling for time series analytics. We first introduce a taxonomy that classifies existing approaches into four groups based on the type of textual data employed for time series modeling. We then summarize key cross-modality strategies, e.g., alignment and fusion, and discuss their applications across a range of downstream tasks. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on multimodal datasets from different application domains to investigate effective combinations of textual data and cross-modality strategies for enhancing time series analytics. Finally, we suggest several promising directions for future research. This survey is designed for a range of professionals, researchers, and practitioners interested in LLM-based time series modeling.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Kalman filter for uncertainty in human language comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are widely used in modeling sentence processing but often exhibit deterministic behavior, contrasting with human sentence comprehension, which manages uncertainty during ambiguous or unexpected inputs. This is exemplified by reversal anomalies-sentences with unexpected role reversals that challenge syntax and semantics-highlighting the limitations of traditional ANN models, such as the Sentence Gestalt (SG) Model. To address these limitations, we propose a Bayesian framework for sentence comprehension, applying an extension of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for Bayesian inference to quantify uncertainty. By framing language comprehension as a Bayesian inverse problem, this approach enhances the SG model's ability to reflect human sentence processing with respect to the representation of uncertainty. Numerical experiments and comparisons with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) demonstrate that Bayesian methods improve uncertainty representation, enabling the model to better approximate human cognitive processing when dealing with linguistic ambiguities.</description>

      <title>Entropic Mirror Descent for Linear Systems: Polyak's Stepsize and Implicit Bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on applying entropic mirror descent to solve linear systems, where the main challenge for the convergence analysis stems from the unboundedness of the domain. To overcome this without imposing restrictive assumptions, we introduce a variant of Polyak-type stepsizes. Along the way, we strengthen the bound for $\ell_1$-norm implicit bias, obtain sublinear and linear convergence results, and generalize the convergence result to arbitrary convex $L$-smooth functions. We also propose an alternative method that avoids exponentiation, resembling the original Hadamard descent, but with provable convergence.</description>

      <title>Mirror Mean-Field Langevin Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD) minimizes an entropy-regularized nonlinear convex functional on the Wasserstein space over $\mathbb{R}^d$, and has gained attention recently as a model for the gradient descent dynamics of interacting particle systems such as infinite-width two-layer neural networks. However, many problems of interest have constrained domains, which are not solved by existing mean-field algorithms due to the global diffusion term. We study the optimization of probability measures constrained to a convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ by proposing the \emph{mirror mean-field Langevin dynamics} (MMFLD), an extension of MFLD to the mirror Langevin framework. We obtain linear convergence guarantees for the continuous MMFLD via a uniform log-Sobolev inequality, and uniform-in-time propagation of chaos results for its time- and particle-discretized counterpart.</description>

      <title>Mallows-type model averaging: Non-asymptotic analysis and all-subset combination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model averaging (MA) and ensembling play a crucial role in statistical and machine learning practice. When multiple candidate models are considered, MA techniques can be used to weight and combine them, often resulting in improved predictive accuracy and better estimation stability compared to model selection (MS) methods. In this paper, we address two challenges in combining least squares estimators from both theoretical and practical perspectives. We first establish several oracle inequalities for least squares MA via minimizing a Mallows' $C_p$ criterion under an arbitrary candidate model set. Compared to existing studies, these oracle inequalities yield faster excess risk and directly imply the asymptotic optimality of the resulting MA estimators under milder conditions. Moreover, we consider candidate model construction and investigate the problem of optimal all-subset combination for least squares estimators, which is an important yet rarely discussed topic in the existing literature. We show that there exists a fundamental limit to achieving the optimal all-subset MA risk. To attain this limit, we propose a novel Mallows-type MA procedure based on a dimension-adaptive $C_p$ criterion. The implicit ensembling effects of several MS procedures are also revealed and discussed. We conduct several numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Mallows-type MA estimator.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Bayesian and variance networks disentangle aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world data contains aleatoric uncertainty - irreducible noise arising from imperfect measurements or from incomplete knowledge about the data generation process. Mean variance estimation (MVE) networks can learn this type of uncertainty but require ad-hoc regularization strategies to avoid overfitting and are unable to predict epistemic uncertainty (model uncertainty). Conversely, Bayesian neural networks predict epistemic uncertainty but are notoriously difficult to train due to the approximate nature of Bayesian inference. We propose to cooperatively train a variance network with a Bayesian neural network and demonstrate that the resulting model disentangles aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties while improving the mean estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of this method across a diverse range of datasets, including a time-dependent heteroscedastic regression dataset we created where the aleatoric uncertainty is known. The proposed method is straightforward to implement, robust, and adaptable to various model architectures.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantifying the Hessian Structure of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical studies reported that the Hessian matrix of neural networks (NNs) exhibits a near-block-diagonal structure, yet its theoretical foundation remains unclear. In this work, we reveal two forces that shape the Hessian structure: a ``static force'' rooted in the architecture design, and a ``dynamic force'' arisen from training. We then provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of ``static force'' at random initialization. We study linear models and 1-hidden-layer networks with the mean-square (MSE) loss and the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss for classification tasks. By leveraging random matrix theory, we compare the limit distributions of the diagonal and off-diagonal Hessian blocks and find that the block-diagonal structure arises as $C \rightarrow \infty$, where $C$ denotes the number of classes. Our findings reveal that $C$ is a primary driver of the near-block-diagonal structure. These results may shed new light on the Hessian structure of large language models (LLMs), which typically operate with a large $C$ exceeding $10^4$ or $10^5$.</description>

      <title>Overparametrized linear dimensionality reductions: From projection pursuit to two-layer neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a cloud of $n$ data points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, consider all projections onto $m$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^d$ and, for each such projection, the empirical distribution of the projected points. What does this collection of probability distributions look like when $n,d$ grow large?
  We consider this question under the null model in which the points are i.i.d. standard Gaussian vectors, focusing on the asymptotic regime in which $n,d\to\infty$, with $n/d\to\alpha\in (0,\infty)$, while $m$ is fixed. Denoting by $\mathscr{F}_{m, \alpha}$ the set of probability distributions in $\mathbb{R}^m$ that arise as low-dimensional projections in this limit, we establish new inner and outer bounds on $\mathscr{F}_{m, \alpha}$. In particular, we characterize the Wasserstein radius of $\mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ up to constant multiplicative factors, and determine it exactly for $m=1$. We also prove sharp bounds in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence and R\'{e}nyi information dimension.
  The previous question has application to unsupervised learning methods, such as projection pursuit and independent component analysis. We introduce a version of the same problem that is relevant for supervised learning, and prove a sharp Wasserstein radius bound. As an application, we establish an upper bound on the interpolation threshold of two-layers neural networks with $m$ hidden neurons.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Estimation in High Dimensions: Performance Analysis and Optimal Hyperparameter Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has become a powerful framework for estimation under uncertainty, offering strong out-of-sample performance and principled regularization. In this paper, we propose a DRO-based method for linear regression and address a central question: how to optimally choose the robustness radius, which controls the trade-off between robustness and accuracy. Focusing on high-dimensional settings where the dimension and the number of samples are both large and comparable in size, we employ tools from high-dimensional asymptotic statistics to precisely characterize the estimation error of the resulting estimator. Remarkably, this error can be recovered by solving a simple convex-concave optimization problem involving only four scalar variables. This characterization enables efficient selection of the radius that minimizes the estimation error. In doing so, it achieves the same effect as cross-validation, but at a fraction of the computational cost. Numerical experiments confirm that our theoretical predictions closely match empirical performance and that the optimal radius selected through our method aligns with that chosen by cross-validation, highlighting both the accuracy and the practical benefits of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses challenges in robust transfer learning stemming from ambiguity in Bayes classifiers and weak transferable signals between the target and source distribution. We introduce a novel quantity called the ''ambiguity level'' that measures the discrepancy between the target and source regression functions, propose a simple transfer learning procedure, and establish a general theorem that shows how this new quantity is related to the transferability of learning in terms of risk improvements. Our proposed ''Transfer Around Boundary'' (TAB) model, with a threshold balancing the performance of target and source data, is shown to be both efficient and robust, improving classification while avoiding negative transfer. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the TAB model on non-parametric classification and logistic regression tasks, achieving upper bounds which are optimal up to logarithmic factors. Simulation studies lend further support to the effectiveness of TAB. We also provide simple approaches to bound the excess misclassification error without the need for specialized knowledge in transfer learning.</description>

      <title>Structure-agnostic Optimality of Doubly Robust Learning for Treatment Effect Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Average treatment effect estimation is the most central problem in causal inference with application to numerous disciplines. While many estimation strategies have been proposed in the literature, the statistical optimality of these methods has still remained an open area of investigation, especially in regimes where these methods do not achieve parametric rates. In this paper, we adopt the recently introduced structure-agnostic framework of statistical lower bounds, which poses no structural properties on the nuisance functions other than access to black-box estimators that achieve some statistical estimation rate. This framework is particularly appealing when one is only willing to consider estimation strategies that use non-parametric regression and classification oracles as black-box sub-processes. Within this framework, we prove the statistical optimality of the celebrated and widely used doubly robust estimators for both the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT), as well as weighted variants of the former, which arise in policy evaluation.</description>

      <title>SoftCVI: Contrastive variational inference with self-generated soft labels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15687v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating a distribution given access to its unnormalized density is pivotal in Bayesian inference, where the posterior is generally known only up to an unknown normalizing constant. Variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are the predominant tools for this task; however, both are often challenging to apply reliably, particularly when the posterior has complex geometry. Here, we introduce Soft Contrastive Variational Inference (SoftCVI), which allows a family of variational objectives to be derived through a contrastive estimation framework. The approach parameterizes a classifier in terms of a variational distribution, reframing the inference task as a contrastive estimation problem aiming to identify a single true posterior sample among a set of samples. Despite this framing, we do not require positive or negative samples, but rather learn by sampling the variational distribution and computing ground truth soft classification labels from the unnormalized posterior itself. The objectives have zero variance gradient when the variational approximation is exact, without the need for specialized gradient estimators. We empirically investigate the performance on a variety of Bayesian inference tasks, using both simple (e.g. normal) and expressive (normalizing flow) variational distributions. We find that SoftCVI can be used to form objectives which are stable to train and mass-covering, frequently outperforming inference with other variational approaches.</description>

      <title>Balancing Interpretability and Flexibility in Modeling Diagnostic Trajectories with an Embedded Neural Hawkes Process Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hawkes process (HP) is commonly used to model event sequences with self-reinforcing dynamics, including electronic health records (EHRs). Traditional HPs capture self-reinforcement via parametric impact functions that can be inspected to understand how each event modulates the intensity of others. Neural network-based HPs offer greater flexibility, resulting in improved fit and prediction performance, but at the cost of interpretability, which is often critical in healthcare. In this work, we aim to understand and improve upon this tradeoff. We propose a novel HP formulation in which impact functions are modeled by defining a flexible impact kernel, instantiated as a neural network, in event embedding space, which allows us to model large-scale event sequences with many event types. This approach is more flexible than traditional HPs yet more interpretable than other neural network approaches, and allows us to explicitly trade flexibility for interpretability by adding transformer encoder layers to further contextualize the event embeddings. Results show that our method accurately recovers impact functions in simulations, achieves competitive performance on MIMIC-IV procedure dataset, and gains clinically meaningful interpretation on XX-EHR with children diagnosis dataset even without transformer layers. This suggests that our flexible impact kernel is often sufficient to capture self-reinforcing dynamics in EHRs and other data effectively, implying that interpretability can be maintained without loss of performance.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Deep Learning with Multilevel Trace-class Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.12961v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we consider Bayesian inference associated to deep neural networks (DNNs) and in particular, trace-class neural network (TNN) priors which can be preferable to traditional DNNs as (a) they are identifiable and (b) they possess desirable convergence properties. TNN priors are defined on functions with infinitely many hidden units, and have strongly convergent Karhunen-Loeve-type approximations with finitely many hidden units. A practical hurdle is that the Bayesian solution is computationally demanding, requiring simulation methods, so approaches to drive down the complexity are needed. In this paper, we leverage the strong convergence of TNN in order to apply Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) to these models. In particular, an MLMC method that was introduced is used to approximate posterior expectations of Bayesian TNN models with optimal computational complexity, and this is mathematically proved. The results are verified with several numerical experiments on model problems arising in machine learning, including regression, classification, and reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation without dissipation: Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.18221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic sampling algorithms such as Langevin Monte Carlo are inspired by physical systems in a heat bath. Their equilibrium distribution is the canonical ensemble given by a prescribed target distribution, so they must balance fluctuation and dissipation as dictated by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. In contrast to the common belief, we show that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is not required because only the configuration space distribution, and not the full phase space distribution, needs to be canonical. We propose a continuous-time Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo (MCLMC) as a dissipation-free system of stochastic differential equations (SDE). We derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation and show that the stationary distribution is the microcanonical ensemble with the desired canonical distribution on configuration space. We prove that MCLMC is ergodic for any nonzero amount of stochasticity, and for smooth, convex potentials, the expectation values converge exponentially fast. Furthermore, the deterministic drift and the stochastic diffusion separately preserve the stationary distribution. This uncommon property is attractive for practical implementations as it implies that the drift-diffusion discretization schemes are bias-free, so the only source of bias is the discretization of the deterministic dynamics. We applied MCLMC on a lattice $\phi^4$ model, where Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is currently the state-of-the-art integrator. For the same accuracy, MCLMC converges 12 times faster than HMC on an $8\times8$ lattice. On a $64\times64$ lattice, it is already 32 times faster. The trend is expected to persist to larger lattices, which are of particular interest, for example, in lattice quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis for Over-parameterized Linear Model via Effective Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-dimensional Bayesian statistics, various methods have been developed, including prior distributions that induce parameter sparsity to handle many parameters. Yet, these approaches often overlook the rich spectral structure of the covariate matrix, which can be crucial when true signals are not sparse. To address this gap, we introduce a data-adaptive Gaussian prior whose covariance is aligned with the leading eigenvectors of the sample covariance. This prior design targets the data's intrinsic complexity rather than its ambient dimension by concentrating the parameter search along principal data directions. We establish contraction rates of the corresponding posterior distribution, which reveal how the mass in the spectrum affects the prediction error bounds. Furthermore, we derive a truncated Gaussian approximation to the posterior (i.e., a Bernstein-von Mises-type result), which allows for uncertainty quantification with a reduced computational burden. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian methods leveraging spectral information of the data are effective for estimation in non-sparse, high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Conformal Predictive Programming for Chance Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose conformal predictive programming (CPP), a framework to solve chance constrained optimization problems, i.e., optimization problems with constraints that are functions of random variables. CPP utilizes samples from these random variables along with the quantile lemma - central to conformal prediction - to transform the chance constrained optimization problem into a deterministic problem with a quantile reformulation. CPP inherits a priori guarantees on constraint satisfaction from existing sample average approximation approaches for a class of chance constrained optimization problems, and it provides a posteriori guarantees that are of conditional and marginal nature otherwise. The strength of CPP is that it can easily support different variants of conformal prediction which have been (or will be) proposed within the conformal prediction community. To illustrate this, we present robust CPP to deal with distribution shifts in the random variables and Mondrian CPP to deal with class conditional chance constraints. To enable tractable solutions to the quantile reformulation, we present a mixed integer programming method (CPP-MIP) encoding, a bilevel optimization strategy (CPP-Bilevel), and a sampling-and-discarding optimization strategy (CPP-Discarding). We also extend CPP to deal with joint chance constrained optimization (JCCO). In a series of case studies, we show the validity of the aforementioned approaches, empirically compare CPP-MIP, CPP-Bilevel, as well as CPP-Discarding, and illustrate the advantage of CPP as compared to scenario approach.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Gaussian Approximation for Random Forest via Region-based Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09960v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive Gaussian approximation bounds for $k$-Potential Nearest Neighbor ($k$-PNN) based random forest predictions based on a set of training points given by a Poisson process under fairly mild regularity assumptions on the data generating process. Our approach is based on the key observation that $k$-PNN based random forest predictions satisfy a certain geometric property called region-based stabilization. We also compare the rates with those of $k$-nearest neighbor-based random forests, highlighting a form of universality in our result. In the process of developing our results, we also establish a probabilistic result on multivariate Gaussian approximation bounds for general functionals of Poisson process that are region-based stabilizing. This general result makes use of the Malliavin-Stein method, and is potentially applicable to various related statistical problems.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Calibration Point: Mechanism Comparison in Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In differentially private (DP) machine learning, the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms are often reported and compared on the basis of a single $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-pair. This practice overlooks that DP guarantees can vary substantially even between mechanisms sharing a given $(\varepsilon, \delta)$, and potentially introduces privacy vulnerabilities which can remain undetected. This motivates the need for robust, rigorous methods for comparing DP guarantees in such cases. Here, we introduce the $\Delta$-divergence between mechanisms which quantifies the worst-case excess privacy vulnerability of choosing one mechanism over another in terms of $(\varepsilon, \delta)$, $f$-DP and in terms of a newly presented Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, as a generalisation of the Blackwell theorem, it is endowed with strong decision-theoretic foundations. Through application examples, we show that our techniques can facilitate informed decision-making and reveal gaps in the current understanding of privacy risks, as current practices in DP-SGD often result in choosing mechanisms with high excess privacy vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>T-JEPA: Augmentation-Free Self-Supervised Learning for Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervision is often used for pre-training to foster performance on a downstream task by constructing meaningful representations of samples. Self-supervised learning (SSL) generally involves generating different views of the same sample and thus requires data augmentations that are challenging to construct for tabular data. This constitutes one of the main challenges of self-supervision for structured data. In the present work, we propose a novel augmentation-free SSL method for tabular data. Our approach, T-JEPA, relies on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) and is akin to mask reconstruction in the latent space. It involves predicting the latent representation of one subset of features from the latent representation of a different subset within the same sample, thereby learning rich representations without augmentations. We use our method as a pre-training technique and train several deep classifiers on the obtained representation. Our experimental results demonstrate a substantial improvement in both classification and regression tasks, outperforming models trained directly on samples in their original data space. Moreover, T-JEPA enables some methods to consistently outperform or match the performance of traditional methods likes Gradient Boosted Decision Trees. To understand why, we extensively characterize the obtained representations and show that T-JEPA effectively identifies relevant features for downstream tasks without access to the labels. Additionally, we introduce regularization tokens, a novel regularization method critical for training of JEPA-based models on structured data.</description>

      <title>Hard-Constrained Neural Networks with Universal Approximation Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating prior knowledge or specifications of input-output relationships into machine learning models has gained significant attention, as it enhances generalization from limited data and leads to conforming outputs. However, most existing approaches use soft constraints by penalizing violations through regularization, which offers no guarantee of constraint satisfaction--an essential requirement in safety-critical applications. On the other hand, imposing hard constraints on neural networks may hinder their representational power, adversely affecting performance. To address this, we propose HardNet, a practical framework for constructing neural networks that inherently satisfy hard constraints without sacrificing model capacity. Unlike approaches that modify outputs only at inference time, HardNet enables end-to-end training with hard constraint guarantees, leading to improved performance. To the best of our knowledge, HardNet is the first method with an efficient forward pass to enforce more than one input-dependent inequality constraint. It allows unconstrained optimization of the network parameters using standard algorithms by appending a differentiable closed-form enforcement layer to the network's output. Furthermore, we show that HardNet retains the universal approximation capabilities of neural networks. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of HardNet across various applications: learning with piecewise constraints, learning optimization solvers, optimizing control policies in safety-critical systems, and learning safe decision logic for aircraft systems.</description>

      <title>From Gradient Clipping to Normalization for Heavy Tailed SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent empirical evidence indicates that many machine learning applications involve heavy-tailed gradient noise, which challenges the standard assumptions of bounded variance in stochastic optimization. Gradient clipping has emerged as a popular tool to handle this heavy-tailed noise, as it achieves good performance in this setting both theoretically and practically. However, our current theoretical understanding of non-convex gradient clipping has three main shortcomings. First, the theory hinges on large, increasing clipping thresholds, which are in stark contrast to the small constant clipping thresholds employed in practice. Second, clipping thresholds require knowledge of problem-dependent parameters to guarantee convergence. Lastly, even with this knowledge, current sampling complexity upper bounds for the method are sub-optimal in nearly all parameters. To address these issues, we study convergence of Normalized SGD (NSGD). First, we establish a parameter-free sample complexity for NSGD of $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-\frac{2p}{p-1}}\right)$ to find an $\varepsilon$-stationary point. Furthermore, we prove tightness of this result, by providing a matching algorithm-specific lower bound. In the setting where all problem parameters are known, we show this complexity is improved to $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-\frac{3p-2}{p-1}}\right)$, matching the previously known lower bound for all first-order methods in all problem dependent parameters. Finally, we establish high-probability convergence of NSGD with a mild logarithmic dependence on the failure probability. Our work complements the studies of gradient clipping under heavy tailed noise improving the sample complexities of existing algorithms and offering an alternative mechanism to achieve high probability convergence.</description>

      <title>Neural and Time-Series Approaches for Pricing Weather Derivatives: Performance and Regime Adaptation Using Satellite Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies pricing of weather-derivative (WD) contracts on temperature and precipitation. For temperature-linked strangles in Toronto and Chicago, we benchmark a harmonic-regression/ARMA model against a feed-forward neural network (NN), finding that the NN reduces out-of-sample mean-squared error (MSE) and materially shifts December fair values relative to both the time-series model and the industry-standard Historic Burn Approach (HBA).
  For precipitation, we employ a compound Poisson--Gamma framework: shape and scale parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and via a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on 30-day rainfall sequences spanning multiple seasons. The CNN adaptively learns season-specific $(\alpha,\beta)$ mappings, thereby capturing heterogeneity across regimes that static i.i.d.\ fits miss. At valuation, we assume days are i.i.d.\ $\Gamma(\hat{\alpha},\hat{\beta})$ within each regime and apply a mean-count approximation (replacing the Poisson count by its mean ($n\hat{\lambda}$) to derive closed-form strangle prices.
  Exploratory analysis of 1981--2023 NASA POWER data confirms pronounced seasonal heterogeneity in $(\alpha,\beta)$ between summer and winter, demonstrating that static global fits are inadequate. Back-testing on Toronto and Chicago grids shows that our regime-adaptive CNN yields competitive valuations and underscores how model choice can shift strangle prices. Payoffs are evaluated analytically when possible and by simulation elsewhere, enabling a like-for-like comparison of forecasting and valuation methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The successive projection algorithm (SPA) is a workhorse algorithm to learn the $r$ vertices of the convex hull of a set of $(r-1)$-dimensional data points, a.k.a. a latent simplex, which has numerous applications in data science. In this paper, we revisit the robustness to noise of SPA and several of its variants. In particular, when $r \geq 3$, we prove the tightness of the existing error bounds for SPA and for two more robust preconditioned variants of SPA. We also provide significantly improved error bounds for SPA, by a factor proportional to the conditioning of the $r$ vertices, in two special cases: for the first extracted vertex, and when $r \leq 2$. We then provide further improvements for the error bounds of a translated version of SPA proposed by Arora et al. (''A practical algorithm for topic modeling with provable guarantees'', ICML, 2013) in two special cases: for the first two extracted vertices, and when $r \leq 3$. Finally, we propose a new more robust variant of SPA that first shifts and lifts the data points in order to minimize the conditioning of the problem. We illustrate our results on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Stochastic Normalizing Flows in $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium Markov Chain Monte Carlo (NE-MCMC) simulations provide a well-understood framework based on Jarzynski's equality to sample from a target probability distribution. By driving a base probability distribution out of equilibrium, observables are computed without the need to thermalize. If the base distribution is characterized by mild autocorrelations, this approach provides a way to mitigate critical slowing down. Out-of-equilibrium evolutions share the same framework of flow-based approaches and they can be naturally combined into a novel architecture called Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNFs). In this work we present the first implementation of SNFs for $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory in 4 dimensions, defined by introducing gauge-equivariant layers between out-of-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates. The core of our analysis is focused on the promising scaling properties of this architecture with the degrees of freedom of the system, which are directly inherited from NE-MCMC. Finally, we discuss how systematic improvements of this approach can realistically lead to a general and yet efficient sampling strategy at fine lattice spacings for observables affected by long autocorrelation times.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the Bias of Foundation Model under Long-tailed Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its practical significance. Among the various approaches, the fine-tuning paradigm has gained considerable interest with the advent of foundation models. However, most existing methods primarily focus on leveraging knowledge from these models, overlooking the inherent biases introduced by the imbalanced training data they rely on. In this paper, we examine how such imbalances from pre-training affect long-tailed downstream tasks. Specifically, we find the imbalance biases inherited in foundation models on downstream task as parameter imbalance and data imbalance. During fine-tuning, we observe that parameter imbalance plays a more critical role, while data imbalance can be mitigated using existing re-balancing strategies. Moreover, we find that parameter imbalance cannot be effectively addressed by current re-balancing techniques, such as adjusting the logits, during training, unlike data imbalance. To tackle both imbalances simultaneously, we build our method on causal learning and view the incomplete semantic factor as the confounder, which brings spurious correlations between input samples and labels. To resolve the negative effects of this, we propose a novel backdoor adjustment method that learns the true causal effect between input samples and labels, rather than merely fitting the correlations in the data. Notably, we achieve an average performance increase of about $1.67\%$ on each dataset.</description>

Abstract: The main goal of this article is to convince you, the reader, that supervised learning in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) model is closely related to -- of all things -- bipartite matching! En-route from PAC learning to bipartite matching, I will overview a particular transductive model of learning, and associated one-inclusion graphs, which can be viewed as a generalization of some of the hat puzzles that are popular in recreational mathematics. Whereas this transductive model is far from new, it has recently seen a resurgence of interest as a tool for tackling deep questions in learning theory. A secondary purpose of this article could be as a (biased) tutorial on the connections between the PAC and transductive models of learning.</description>

Abstract: A triangular structural panel data model with additive separable individual-specific effects is used to model the causal effect of a covariate on an outcome variable when there are unobservable confounders with some of them time-invariant. In this setup, a linear reduced-form equation might be problematic when the conditional mean of the endogenous covariate and the instrumental variables is nonlinear. The reason is that ignoring the nonlinearity could lead to weak instruments As a solution, we propose a triangular simultaneous equation model for panel data with additive separable individual-specific fixed effects composed of a linear structural equation with a nonlinear reduced form equation. The parameter of interest is the structural parameter of the endogenous variable. The identification of this parameter is obtained under the assumption of available exclusion restrictions and using a control function approach. Estimating the parameter of interest is done using an estimator that we call Super Learner Control Function estimator (SLCFE). The estimation procedure is composed of two main steps and sample splitting. We estimate the control function using a super learner using sample splitting. In the following step, we use the estimated control function to control for endogeneity in the structural equation. Sample splitting is done across the individual dimension. We perform a Monte Carlo simulation to test the performance of the estimators proposed. We conclude that the Super Learner Control Function Estimators significantly outperform Within 2SLS estimators.</description>
