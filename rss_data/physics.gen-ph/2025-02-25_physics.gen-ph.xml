      <title>Reversible Imprinting and Retrieval of Quantum Information: Experimental Verification of the Quantum Memory Matrix Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a series of quantum computing experiments designed to test a central prediction of the Quantum Memory Matrix (QMM) hypothesis - that quantum information can be locally stored in finite-dimensional cells of space-time and later retrieved in a fully unitary and reversible manner. Our work encompasses five distinct experiments: a basic three-qubit imprint-retrieval cycle, an extended five-qubit model implementing two parallel cycles, and variations incorporating dynamic evolution and controlled error injection. In each case, a field qubit is prepared in an arbitrary superposition, and its state is imprinted onto memory qubit(s) via controlled-R_y gates, with subsequent controlled-SWAP operations retrieving the stored information into output qubit(s). Execution on an IBM Quantum Processing Unit using the Qiskit Runtime service yielded significant correlations between the initially prepared field states and the retrieved outputs, with fidelities that, while subject to hardware noise and decoherence, consistently demonstrate the reversible and unitary nature of the process. These results not only confirm the basic imprint-retrieval cycle as predicted by the QMM hypothesis but also establish a scalable experimental methodology that may ultimately contribute to resolving challenges such as the black hole information paradox and advancing our understanding of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Comment on work of Umrigar and Anderson "Energy needed to propel a tiny spacecraft to Proxima Centauri, and, an unstated assumption in Einstein's 1905 paper" (arXiv:2502.04331v1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper by Umrigar and Anderson, the authors make an important statement: it is possible to misunderstand the behavior of physical objects (parts of a spacecraft) if that object has reached a velocity comparable to the speed of light. Achieving such a velocity for a spacecraft is critical for interstellar travel, since only traveling at such speeds makes travel to distant stars possible within a human lifetime. Last years, several ideas have been proposed to achieve relativistic velocities for a spacecraft. The authors of these ideas understand that this task is very difficult due to technological obstacles. However, when describing these projects, the authors omit mentioning possible obstacles of physical origin. The paper by Umrigar and Anderson is the first to consider physical limitations on construction of future spacecraft. In this Comment, it will be shown that, according to Umrigar and Anderson, not only technological obstacles will arise in the project of interstellar flights, but also the physical limitations of a spacecraft moving at relativistic velocities may become more serious problems for the implementation of such a project.</description>

      <title>Vacuum permittivity and gravitational refractive index revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper reanalyzes the problem of the refractive properties of the physical vacuum and their modification under the action of the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field. This problem was studied in our previous works and in the subsequent works of the researchers: Leuchs, Urban, Mainland and their collaborators. By modeling the physical vacuum as a particle-antiparticle system, we can deduce with a certain approximation, in a semiclassical theory, the properties of the free vacuum and the vacuum modified by the interaction with a gravitational field and an electromagnetic field. More precise calculation of permittivities of free vacuum and near a particle can lead to a non-point model of the particle. This modeling can follow both the quantum and the general relativistic path as well as the phenomenological path, the results complementing each other.</description>

      <title>Generalized formulation for ideal light-powered systems through energy and entropy flow analysis Part 2: Beyond the first-order evaluation under realistic conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06797</link>

Abstract: For photosynthetic systems under irradiation not limited to blackbody radiation, this study formulates the ideal efficiency and Boltzmann factor in a general form based on energy-entropy flow analysis, assuming zero entropy generation within the system as the ideal condition. The non-equilibrium contribution between the radiation and system, which increases with the absorption rate and reduces the ideal efficiency, is quantitatively analyzed, first for monochromatic light. Based on these results, a unified formula for the ideal efficiency of a light-powered system with an absorption rate |$\varepsilon$| for non-monochromatic light diluted with a dilution factor d after being emitted by blackbody radiation at temperature T is derived in the most compact form. This formulation is then extended to include cases wherein entropy was discarded from the system via radiation simultaneously with waste heat. This leads to a unified reclassification of several previously proposed ideal efficiencies, such as the Jeter, Spanner, and Petela, as the basis of practical efficiency, based on flow conditions. Furthermore, in this study, previous frameworks on light-powered systems are classified into piston-cylinder (closed photon gas) and flowing radiation (open photon gas) models, demonstrating that the latter better suits microscopic light-powered systems. Finally, two issues related to the ideal efficiency derived from the prior flowing radiation model (Landsberg and Tonge, 1980), often referred to as the Landsberg limit, have been resolved using a simplified mathematical model constructed in this study based on Einstein's absorption and radiation theory. The ideal efficiency obtained is found to be very similar to Carnot efficiency.</description>
