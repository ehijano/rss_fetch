      <title>Some Computational Tools for Solving a Selection of Problems in Control Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates how certified computational tools can be used to address various problems in control theory. In particular, we introduce PACE.jl, a Julia package that implements symbolic elimination techniques, including (among others) discriminant varieties and Rational Univariate Representation, while also supporting multi-precision interval computations. We showcase its applications to key control theory problems, including identification, stability analysis, and optimization, for both parameter-dependent and parameter-free systems.</description>

      <title>A Fully Adaptive Radau Method for the Efficient Solution of Stiff Ordinary Differential Equations at Low Tolerances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radau IIA methods, specifically the adaptive order Radau method in Fortran due to Hairer, are known to be state-of-the-art for the high-accuracy solution of highly stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). However, the traditional implementation was specialized to a specific range of tolerance, in particular only supporting 5th, 9th, and 13th order versions of the tableau and only derived in double precision floating point, thus limiting the ability to be truly general purpose for high fidelity scenarios. To alleviate these constraints, we implement an adaptive-time adaptive-order Radau method which can derive the coefficients for the Radau IIA embedded tableau to any order on the fly to any precision. Additionally, our Julia-based implementation includes many modernizations to improve performance, including improvements to the order adaptation scheme and improved linear algebra integrations. In a head-to-head benchmark against the classic Fortran implementation, we demonstrate our implementation is approximately 2x across a range of stiff ODEs. We benchmark our algorithm against several well-reputed numerical integrators for stiff ODEs and find state-of-the-art performance on several test problems, with a 1.5-times speed-up over common numerical integrators for stiff ODEs when low error tolerance is required. The newly implemented method is distributed in open source software for free usage on stiff ODEs.</description>
