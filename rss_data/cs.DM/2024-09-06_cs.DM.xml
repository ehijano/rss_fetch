      <title>Gathering Information about a Graph by Counting Walks from a Single Vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a vertex $v$ in a connected graph $G$ is decisive if the numbers of walks from $v$ of each length determine the graph $G$ rooted at $v$ up to isomorphism among all connected rooted graphs with the same number of vertices. On the other hand, $v$ is called ambivalent if it has the same walk counts as a vertex in a non-isomorphic connected graph with the same number of vertices as $G$. Using the classical constructions of cospectral trees, we first observe that ambivalent vertices exist in almost all trees. If a graph $G$ is determined by spectrum and its characteristic polynomial is irreducible, then we prove that all vertices of $G$ are decisive. Note that both assumptions are conjectured to be true for almost all graphs. Without using any assumption, we are able to prove that the vertices of a random graph are with high probability distinguishable from each other by the numbers of closed walks of length at most 4. As a consequence, the closed walk counts for lengths 2, 3, and 4 provide a canonical labeling of a random graph. Answering a question posed in chemical graph theory, we finally show that all walk counts for a vertex in an $n$-vertex graph are determined by the counts for the $2n$ shortest lengths, and the bound $2n$ is here asymptotically tight.</description>

      <title>Random sampling of permutations through quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce classical algorithms for random sampling of permutations, drawing inspiration from the Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter algorithm. Our approach takes a comprehensive view of permutation sampling by expressing them as products of adjacent transpositions. Building on this, we develop a quantum analogue of these classical algorithms using a quantum circuit model for random sampling of permutations for $n$-qubit systems. As an application, we present a quantum algorithm for the two-sample randomization test to assess the difference of means in classical data, utilizing a quantum circuit model. Finally, we propose a nested corona product graph generative model for symmetric groups, which facilitates random sampling of permutations from specific sets of permutations through a quantum circuit model.</description>

      <title>Partitioning 2-edge-coloured bipartite graphs into monochromatic cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an $r$-colouring of the edges of a graph $G$, we say that it can be partitioned into $p$ monochromatic cycles when there exists a set of $p$ vertex-disjoint monochromatic cycles covering all the vertices of $G$. In the literature of this problem, an edge and a single vertex both count as a cycle.
  We show that for every $2$-colouring of the edges of a complete balanced bipartite graph, $K_{n,n}$, it can be partitioned into at most 4 monochromatic cycles. This type of question was first studied in 1970 for complete graphs and in 1983, by Gy\'arf\'as and Lehel, for $K_{n,n}$. In 2014, Pokrovskiy, has showed that any $2$-colouring of the edges of $K_{n,n}$ can be partitioned into at most $3$ paths. It turns out that finding monochromatic cycles instead of paths is a natural question that has also being asked for other graphs. In 2015, Schaudt and Stein have showed that at most 14 cycles are necessary.</description>

      <title>A Deceptively Simple Quadratic Recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard techniques for treating linear recurrences no longer apply for quadratic recurrences. It is not hard to determine asymptotics for a specific parametrized model over a wide domain of values (all $p \neq 1/2$ here). The gap between theory and experimentation seems insurmountable, however, at a single outlier ($p = 1/2$).</description>

      <title>Loop corrections for hard spheres in Hamming space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We begin with an exact expression for the entropy of a system of hard spheres within the Hamming space. This entropy relies on probability marginals, which are determined by an extended set of Belief Propagation (BP) equations. The BP probability marginals are functions of auxiliary variables which are introduced to model the effects of loopy interactions on a tree-structured interaction graph. We explore various reasonable and approximate probability distributions, ensuring they align with the exact solutions of the BP equations. Our approach is based on an ansatz of (in)homogeneous cavity marginals respecting the permutation symmetry of the problem. Through thorough analysis, we aim to minimize errors in the BP equations. Our findings support the conjecture that the maximum packing density asymptotically conforms to the lower bound proposed by Gilbert and Varshamov, further validated by the solution of the loopy BP equations.</description>

      <title>Complexity results on the decomposition of a digraph into directed linear forests and out-stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two decomposition problems in directed graphs. We say that a digraph is $k$-bounded for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$ if each of its connected components contains at most $k$ arcs.
  For the first problem, a directed linear forest is a collection of vertex-disjoint directed paths and we consider the problem of decomposing a given digraph into a $k$-bounded and an $\ell$-bounded directed linear forest for some fixed $k,\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}\cup \{\infty\}$. We give a full dichotomy for this problem by showing that it can be solved in polynomial time if $k+\ell \leq 3$ and is NP-complete otherwise. This answers a question of Campbell, H\"orsch, and Moore.
  For the second problem, we say that an out-galaxy is a vertex-disjoint collection of out-stars. Again, we give a full dichotomy of when a given digraph can be edge-decomposed into a $k$-bounded and an $\ell$-bounded out-galaxy for fixed $k,\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}\cup \{\infty\}$. More precisely, we show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time if $\min\{k,\ell\}\in \{1,\infty\}$ and is NP-complete otherwise.</description>

      <title>On z-coloring and ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring of graphs as improved variants of the b-coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph and $c$ a proper vertex coloring of $G$. A vertex $u$ is called b-vertex in $(G,c)$ if all colors except $c(u)$ appear in the neighborhood of $u$. By a ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring of $G$ using colors $\{1, \ldots, k\}$ we define a proper vertex coloring $c$ such that there is a b-vertex $u$ (called nice vertex) such that for each $j\in \{1, \ldots, k\}$ with $j\not=c(u)$, $u$ is adjacent to a b-vertex of color $j$. The ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-chromatic number of $G$ (denoted by ${\rm b}^{\ast}(G)$) is the largest integer $k$ such that $G$ has a ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring using $k$ colors. Every graph $G$ admits a ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring which is an improvement over the famous b-coloring. A z-coloring of $G$ is a coloring $c$ using colors $\{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$ containing a nice vertex of color $k$ such that for each two colors $i&lt;j$, each vertex of color $j$ has a neighbor of color $i$ in the graph (i.e. $c$ is obtained from a greedy coloring of $G$). We prove that ${\rm b}^{\ast}(G)$ cannot be approximated within any constant factor unless $P=NP$. We obtain results for ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring and z-coloring of block graphs, cacti, $P_4$-sparse graphs and graphs with girth greater than $4$. We prove that z-coloring and ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring have a locality property. A linear 0-1 programming model is also presented for z-coloring of graphs. The positive results suggest that researches can be focused on ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring (or z-coloring) instead of b-coloring of graphs.</description>

      <title>Improving the Crossing Lemma by Characterizing Dense 2-Planar and 3-Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Crossing Lemma by Ajtai et al.~and Leighton from 1982 gave an important lower bound of $c \frac{m^3}{n^2}$ for the number of crossings in any drawing of a given graph of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The original value was $c= 1/100$, which then has gradually been improved. Here, the bounds for the density of $k$-planar graphs played a central role. Our new insight is that for $k=2,3$ the $k$-planar graphs have substantially fewer edges if specific local configurations that occur in drawings of $k$-planar graphs of maximum density are forbidden. Therefore, we are able to derive better bounds for the crossing number $\text{cr}(G)$ of a given graph $G$. In particular, we achieve a bound of $\text{cr}(G) \ge \frac{37}{9}m-\frac{155}{9}(n-2)$ for the range of $5n &lt; m \le 6n$, while our second bound $\text{cr}(G) \ge 5m - \frac{203}{9}(n-2)$ is even stronger for larger $m&gt;6n$.
  For $m &gt; 6.77n$, we finally apply the standard probabilistic proof from the BOOK and obtain an improved constant of $c&gt;1/27.48$ in the Crossing Lemma. Note that the previous constant was $1/29$. Although this improvement is not too impressive, we consider our technique as an important new tool, which might be helpful in various other applications.</description>

      <title>On Oriented Diameter of Power Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the oriented diameter of power graphs of groups. We show that a $2$-edge connected power graph of a finite group has oriented diameter at most $4$. We prove that the power graph of a cyclic group of order $n$ has oriented diameter $2$ for all $n\neq 2,4,6$. Until our work, to the best of our knowledge, no infinite family of graphs with oriented diameter 2 had been identified except for subclasses of complete graphs. Finally, we give a complete characterization of the oriented diameter of the power graphs of nilpotent groups. This, in turn, gives an algorithm for computing the oriented diameter of the power graph of a given nilpotent group that runs in time polynomial in the size of the group.</description>
