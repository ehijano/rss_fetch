      <title>Fast Real Evaluation Through Sound Mixed-Precision Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating a real-valued expression to high precision is a key building block in computational mathematics, physics, and numerics. A typical implementation uses a uniform precision for each operation, and doubles that precision until the real result can be bounded to some sufficiently narrow interval. However, this is wasteful: usually only a few operations really need to be performed at high precision, and the bulk of the expression could use much lower precision. Uniform precision can also waste iterations discovering the necessary precision and then still overestimate by up to a factor of two. We propose to instead use mixed-precision interval arithmetic to evaluate real-valued expressions. A key challenge is deriving the mixed-precision assignment both soundly and quickly. To do so, we introduce a sound variation of error Taylor series and condition numbers, specialized to interval arithmetic, that can be evaluated with minimal overhead thanks to an "exponent trick". Our implementation, Reval, achieves a speed-up of 1.25x compared to the state-of-the-art Sollya tool, with the speed-up increasing to 2.99x on the most difficult input points. An examination of the precisions used with and without precision tuning shows that the speed-up results come from quickly assigning lower precisions for the majority of operations.</description>

      <title>Methods for Few-View CT Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is an essential non-destructive three dimensional imaging modality used in medicine, security screening, and inspection of manufactured components. Typical CT data acquisition entails the collection of a thousand or more projections through the object under investigation through a range of angles covering one hundred eighty degrees or more. It may be desirable or required that the number of projections angles be reduced by one or two orders of magnitude for reasons such as acquisition time or dose. Unless specialized reconstruction algorithms are applied, reconstructing with fewer views will result in streak artifacts and failure to resolve object boundaries at certain orientations. These artifacts may substantially diminish the usefulness of the reconstructed CT volumes.
  Here we develop constrained and regularized numerical optimization methods to reconstruct CT volumes from 4-28 projections. These methods entail utilization of novel data fidelity and convex and non-convex regularization terms. In addition, the methods outlined here are usually carried out by a sequence of two or three numerical optimization methods in sequence.
  The efficacy of our methods is demonstrated on four measured and three simulated few-view CT data sets. We show that these methods outperform other state of the art few-view numerical optimization methods.</description>
