      <title>EVECTOR: An orchestrator for analysing attacks in electric vehicles charging system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is critical for the widespread adoption of EVs, ensuring efficient and secure charging processes. Evaluating the security and performance of EV charging systems in real-world infrastructure poses significant challenges due to the diversity of information exchange between vehicles and charging stations/Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE), including complex network protocols, scale of deployment and a variety of potential threats. Existing simulation frameworks are unable to handle complex security scenarios across these differing data exchange protocols. In this paper, we propose a novel EV orchestration framework: EVECTOR, which addresses the limitations of existing simulation systems by enabling both quantitative and qualitative analyses of EV charging scenarios. EVECTOR also provides a flexible attack orchestrator to simulate realistic attack behaviours on EV charging infrastructure. We validate the EVECTOR framework through two case studies: (a) cyber-physical attacks such as broken wire; and (b) cyber-specific attacks such as frame fuzzification. The case studies highlight the effectiveness of EVECTOR in providing deeper insights into the security and performance of EV charging systems.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Temporal Dynamics Modeling for EEG-based Driving Fatigue Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driving fatigue is a major contributor to traffic accidents and poses a serious threat to road safety. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a direct measurement of neural activity, yet EEG-based fatigue recognition is hindered by strong non-stationarity and asymmetric neural dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose DeltaGateNet, a novel framework that explicitly captures Bidirectional temporal dynamics for EEG-based driving fatigue recognition. Our key idea is to introduce a Bidirectional Delta module that decomposes first-order temporal differences into positive and negative components, enabling explicit modeling of asymmetric neural activation and suppression patterns. Furthermore, we design a Gated Temporal Convolution module to capture long-term temporal dependencies for each EEG channel using depthwise temporal convolutions and residual learning, preserving channel-wise specificity while enhancing temporal representation robustness. Extensive experiments conducted under both intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation settings on the public SEED-VIG and SADT driving fatigue datasets demonstrate that DeltaGateNet consistently outperforms existing methods. On SEED-VIG, DeltaGateNet achieves an intra-subject accuracy of 81.89% and an inter-subject accuracy of 55.55%. On the balanced SADT 2022 dataset, it attains intra-subject and inter-subject accuracies of 96.81% and 83.21%, respectively, while on the unbalanced SADT 2952 dataset, it achieves 96.84% intra-subject and 84.49% inter-subject accuracy. These results indicate that explicitly modeling Bidirectional temporal dynamics yields robust and generalizable performance under varying subject and class-distribution conditions.</description>
