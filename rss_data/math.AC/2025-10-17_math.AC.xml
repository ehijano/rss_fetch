      <title>The Homology Groups of Zero Divisor Graphs of Finite Commutative Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the homology groups of the clique complex associated with the zero-divisor graph of a finite commutative ring. Generalizing the construction introduced by F. R. DeMeyer and L. DeMeyer, we establish a Kunneth-type formula for the homology of such complexes and provide explicit computations for products of finite local rings. As a notable application, we obtain a general method to determine the clique homology groups of Z_n and related ring products. Furthermore, we derive explicit formulas for the Betti numbers when all local factors are fields or non-fields. A complete classification of when this clique complex is Cohen-Macaulay is given, with the exception of one borderline case. Finally, our results yield a partial answer to a question posed in earlier literature, showing that certain topological spaces such as the Klein bottle and the real projective plane cannot be realized as zero-divisor complexes of finite commutative rings.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic invariants of symbolic powers of binomial edge ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To a graph $G$ one associates the binomial edge ideal $J_G$ generated by a collection of binomials corresponding to the edges of $G$. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of symbolic powers of $J_G$, its lexicographic initial ideal $\mathrm{in}_&lt;(J_G)$, and its multigraded generic initial ideal $\mathrm{gin}(J_G)$. We focus on the Waldschmidt constant, $\widehat{\alpha}$, and asymptotic regularity, $\widehat{\mathrm{reg}}$, which capture linear growth of minimal generator degrees and Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity. We explicitly compute $\widehat{\alpha}(J_G)$ and $\widehat{\alpha}(\mathrm{in}_&lt;(J_G))$, and compare the Betti numbers of the symbolic powers of $J_G$ and $J_H$, where $H$ is a subgraph of $G$. To analyze $\mathrm{in}_&lt;(J_G)$ and $\mathrm{gin}(J_G)$, we use the symbolic polyhedron, a convex polyhedron that encodes the elements of the symbolic powers of a monomial ideal. We determine its vertices via $G$'s induced connected subgraphs and show that $\widehat{\alpha}(\mathrm{gin}(J_G))=\widehat{\alpha}(I_G)$, where $I_G$ is the edge ideal of $G$. This yields an alternate proof of known bounds for $\widehat{\alpha}(I_G)$ in terms of $G$'s clique number and chromatic number.</description>

      <title>Tor algebra of local rings with decomposable maximal ideal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(R,{\frak{m}}_R)$ be a commutative noetherian local ring. Assuming that ${\frak{m}}_R=$$I\oplus J$ is a direct sum decomposition, where $I$ and $J$ are non-zero ideals of $R$, we describe the structure of the Tor algebra of $R$ in terms of the Tor algebras of the rings $R/I$ and $R/J$.</description>

      <title>Admissible set and squarefree-power-like function with applications to squarefree symbolic powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the abstract notion of squarefree-power-like functions, which unify the sequences of squarefree ordinary and symbolic powers of squarefree monomial ideals. By employing the Tor-vanishing criteria for mixed sums of ideals, we establish sharp lower bounds for their Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity in terms of what we call the admissible set of the associated hypergraph. As an application, we derive the first general combinatorial lower bound for the regularity of squarefree symbolic powers of monomial ideals. In the setting of edge ideals, by exploiting the special combinatorial structures of block graphs and Cohen-Macaulay chordal graphs, we show that this bound turns into an exact formula for all squarefree symbolic powers of block graphs, as well as for the second squarefree symbolic powers of edge ideals of Cohen-Macaulay chordal graphs.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Hilbert and Ehrhart series under translative group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study representations of finite groups on Stanley--Reisner rings of simplicial complexes and on lattice points in lattice polytopes. The framework of translative group actions allows us to use the theory of proper colorings of simplicial complexes without requiring an explicit coloring to be given. We prove that the equivariant Hilbert series of a Cohen--Macaulay simplicial complex under a translative group action admits a rational expression whose numerator is a positive integer combination of irreducible characters. This implies an analogous rational expression for the equivariant Ehrhart series of a lattice polytope with a unimodular triangulation that is invariant under a translative group action. As an application, we study the equivariant Ehrhart series of alcoved polytopes in the sense of Lam and Postnikov and derive explicit results in the case of order polytopes and of Lipschitz poset polytopes.</description>

      <title>Fundamental algebraic sets and locally unit-additive rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra can be thought of as a statement about the real numbers as a space, considered as an algebraic set over the real numbers as a field. This paper introduces what it means for an algebraic set or affine variety over a field to be fundamental, in a way that encompasses the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra as a special case. The related concept of local fundamentality is introduced and its behavior developed. On the algebraic side, the notions of locally, geometrically, and generically unit-additive rings are introduced, thus complementing unit-additivity as previously defined by the author and Jay Shapiro. A number of results are extended from the previous joint paper from unit-additivity to local unit-additivity. It is shown that an affine variety is (locally) fundamental if and only if its coordinate ring is (locally) unit-additive. To do so, a theorem is proved showing that there are many equivalent definitions of local unit-additivity. Illustrative examples are sprinkled throughout.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical filtrations of line bundles and optimal algebraic geometry codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01859v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce \emph{hierarchical depth}, a new invariant of line bundles and divisors, defined via maximal chains of effective sub-line bundles. This notion gives rise to \emph{hierarchical filtrations}, refining the structure of the Picard group and providing new insights into the geometry of algebraic surfaces. We establish fundamental properties of hierarchical depth, derive inequalities through intersection theory and the Hodge index theorem, and characterize filtrations that are Hodge-tight.
  Using this framework, we develop a theory of \emph{hierarchical algebraic geometry codes}, constructed from evaluation spaces along these filtrations. This approach produces nested families of codes with controlled growth of parameters and identifies an optimal intermediate code maximizing a utility function balancing rate and minimum distance. Hierarchical depth thus provides a systematic method to construct AG codes with favorable asymptotic behavior, linking geometric and coding-theoretic perspectives.
  Our results establish new connections between line bundle theory, surface geometry, and coding theory, and suggest applications to generalized Goppa codes and higher-dimensional evaluation codes.</description>
