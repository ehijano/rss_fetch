      <title>Design and Construction of a Test-Stand for the Split and Delay Line at the European XFEL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the design and construction of a test-stand for the Split and Delay Line (SDL) at the European X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) in Hamburg, Germany. The advancements in Free Electron Laser technology have now made it possible to investigate ultra-fast dynamics in materials science, biology, chemistry, etc. In the SDL, an incident free electron laser pulse is split into two parts by a beam splitter: one half travels along the upper branch, and the other half travels along the lower branch. These two pulses can either merge again in the collinear mode or travel along different optical paths toward the sample in the inclined mode. This setup achieves a temporal separation of a few femtoseconds between the X-ray pulse pairs, which is crucial for ultra-fast X-ray pump-probe experiments investigating rapid dynamics. This report provides detailed documentation of the mechanical and electronic configuration of the test-stand, vacuum testing, the manufacturing of supporting cables, and the challenges encountered during the project. Finally, the SDL was successfully assembled and initially validated under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Design Optimization of Permanent-Magnet Based Compact Transport Systems for Laser-Driven Proton Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-driven (LD) ion acceleration has been explored in a newly constructed short focal length beamline at the BELLA petawatt facility (interaction point 2, iP2). For applications utilizing such LD ion beams, a beam transport system is required, which for reasons of compactness be ideally contained within 3 m. The large divergence and energy spread of LD ion beams present a unique challenge to transporting them compared to beams from conventional accelerators. This work gives an overview of proposed compact transport designs that can satisfy different requirements depending on the application for the iP2 proton beamline such as radiation biology, material science, and high energy density science. These designs are optimized for different parameters such as energy spread and peak proton density according to an application's need. The various designs consist solely of permanent magnet elements, which can provide high magnetic field gradients on a small footprint. While the field strengths are fixed, we have shown that the beam size and energy can be tuned effectively by varying the placement of the magnets. The performance of each design was evaluated based on high order particle tracking simulations of typical LD proton beams. A more detailed investigation was carried out for a design to deliver 10 MeV LD accelerated ions for radiation biology applications. With these transport system designs, the iP2 beamline is ready to house various application experiments.</description>

      <title>Simulation studies on compensation for space-charge-induced half-integer and 3rd-order resonance crossing in HIAF-BRing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-charge-induced resonance crossing is one notable limitation of beam intensity in high-intensity synchrotrons. This paper proposes a modification to the Resonance Driving Terms (RDTs) to compensate for the combined effects of space charge and magnetic field imperfections under resonance crossing. The new RDTs are named modified RDTs. The effectiveness of the modified RDTs is demonstrated through simulations of half-integer and 3rd-order resonance crossings using the lattice of the High Intensity Heavy-Ion Accelerator Facility Booster Ring (HIAF-BRing). The simulations illustrate that the compensation provided by the modified RDTs significantly suppresses emittance growth and reduces distortion in the phase space.</description>

      <title>The first superconducting final focus quadrupole prototype of the FCC-ee study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A single aperture Canted-Cosine-Theta (CCT) quadrupole magnet, made of NbTi superconductors, has been developed for the final focus region of the FCC-ee study. The conductor layout is optimised to mitigate edge effects on one of the two sides of the magnet that typically lead to undesired higher-order multipoles. Experimental results of a prototype, including paraffin wax impregnation and cryogenic temperature measurements, are presented. The magnet exhibits no training behaviour, surpassing the nominal current during the initial ramp. Field quality is excellent, with higher-order multipoles below $1\times 10^{-4}$ units, consistent with simulations and room temperature tests. These findings confirm the potential of superconducting CCT magnets to offer compact solutions for applications demanding stringent field quality.</description>

      <title>cDVAE: Multimodal Generative Conditional Diffusion Guided by Variational Autoencoder Latent Embedding for Virtual 6D Phase Space Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20218v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaging the 6D phase space of a beam in a particle accelerator in a single shot is currently impossible. Single shot beam measurements only exist for certain 2D beam projections and these methods are destructive. A virtual diagnostic that can generate an accurate prediction of a beam's 6D phase space would be incredibly useful for precisely controlling the beam. In this work, a generative conditional diffusion-based approach to creating a virtual diagnostic of all 15 unique 2D projections of a beam's 6D phase space is developed. The diffusion process is guided by a combination of scalar parameters and images that are converted to low-dimensional latent vector representation by a variational autoencoder (VAE). We demonstrate that conditional diffusion guided by VAE (cDVAE) can accurately reconstruct all 15 of the unique 2D projections of a charge particle beam's 6 phase space for the HiRES compact accelerator.</description>
