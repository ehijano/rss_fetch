      <title>Nonextensive Thermodynamics of the Morse Oscillator: Signature and Solid State Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a detailed thermodynamic analysis of a bound quantum system: the Morse oscillator within the framework of Tsallis nonextensive statistics. Using the property of the bound spectrum (upper bound) of the Morse potential, limited by the bond dissociation energy, we analytically derive the generalized partition function. We present results for both the high- and low-temperature limits. We propose the effective number of accessible states as a measure of nonextensivity. The calculation shows that the nonextensive framework further restricts the number of accessible states. We also derive the generalized internal energy and entropy and examine their dependence on temperature and the nonextensivity parameter \( q \). Numerical results confirm the strong effect of nonextensive behavior in the low-temperature regime (precisely low to moderate temperature), where the ratio of generalized internal energy and internal energy calculated from the Boltzmann Gibbs (BG) formula develops a nontrivial dip structure for \( q &lt; 1 \). Moreover, the generalized specific heat shows the Schottky-type anomaly. We extend our study by deriving the specific heat of solids with BG and Tsallis statistics using the anharmonic energy levels of the Morse oscillator. This study suggests that the Morse oscillator is a solvable and physically meaningful testing ground for exploring the thermodynamics of quantum systems driven by nonextensive statistics, with implications for the vibrational properties of the non-equilibrium molecular thermodynamics (especially diatomic molecules).</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic and Spin-Glass Finite-Tempeature Order but no Antiferromagetic Order in the d=1 Ising Model with Long-Range Power-Law Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The d=1 Ising ferromagnet and spin glass with long-range power-law interactions J r^-a is studied for all interaction range exponents a by a renormalization-group transformation that simultaneously projects local ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. In the ferromagnetic case, J&gt;0, a finite-temperature ferromagnetic phase occurs for interaction range 0.74&lt;a&lt;2. The second-order phase transition temperature monotonically decreases between these two limits. At a=2, the phase transition becomes first order, as predicted by rigorous results. For a&gt;2, the phase transition temperature discontinuously drops to zero and for a&gt;2 there is no ordered phase above zero temperature, also as predicted by rigorous results. At the other end, on approaching a=0.74 from above, namely increasing the range of the interaction, the phase transition temperature diverges to infinity, meaning that, at all non-infinite temperatures, the system is ferromagnetically ordered. Thus, the equivalent-neighbor interactions regime is entered before (a &gt; 0) the neighbors become equivalent, namely before the interactions become equal for all separations. The critical exponents alpha,beta, gamma,delta,eta,nu are calculated, from a large recursion matrix, varying as function of a. For antiferromagnetic J&lt;0, all triplets of spins at all ranges have competing interactions and this highly frustrated system does not have an ordered phase. In the spin-glass system, where all couplings for all separations are randomly ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic (with probability p), a finite-temperatures spin-glass phase is obtained in the absence of antiferromagnetic phase. In the spin-glass phase, the signature chaotic behavior under scale change occurs in a richer version than previously: In the long-range interaction of this system, the interactions at every separation become chaotic, yielding a piecewise chaotic interaction function.</description>

      <title>Pink noise in Electric Current from Amplitude Modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently proposed that the general origin of 1/f fluctuation, or pink noise, is the amplitude modulation (or beat) of many waves with accumulating frequencies. In this paper, we verify this proposal in the electric current system. We use the classical Langevin equation to describe the electron wave packets flowing in the (semi-)conductor, affected by the back reaction of soft photon emission. If this were amplitude modulation, a demodulation process is needed to extract the fluctuation features. We first square the wave packet, which corresponds to the electric current, and obtain the 1/f fluctuation in this current data. We further speculate that this wave packet, after demodulation by thresholding, triggers the time sequence of the nerve firing. In our model, this also shows 1/f fluctuations, which is quite robust.</description>

      <title>Pairwise correlations of global times in one-dimensional Brownian motion under stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian motion with stochastic resetting-a process combining standard diffusion with random returns to a fixed position-has emerged as a powerful framework with applications spanning statistical physics, chemical kinetics, biology, and finance. In this study, we investigate the mutual correlations among three global characteristic times for one-dimensional resetting Brownian motion $x(\tau)$ over the interval $\tau \in \left[ 0, t\right] $: the occupation time $t_o$ spent on the positive semi-axis, the time $t_m$ at which $x(\tau)$ attains its global maximum, and the last-passage time $t_{\ell}$ when the process crosses the origin. For the process starting from the origin and undergoing Poissonian resetting back to the origin, we analytically compute the pairwise joint distributions of these three times (in the Laplace domain) and derive their pairwise correlation coefficients. Our results reveal that these global times display rich correlations, with a non-trivial dependence on the resetting rate $r$. Specifically, we find that (i) While $t_{o}$ and $t_{\ell}^m$ are uncorrelated for any positive integer $m$, $t_{o}^2$ and $t_{\ell}^m$ display anti-correlation; (ii) A positive correlation exists between $t_{o}$ and $t_{m}$, which decays toward zero following a logarithmically corrected power-law way with an exponent of $-2$ as $r \to \infty$; (iii) The correlation between $t_{m}$ and $t_{\ell}$ shifts from positive to negative as $r$ increases. All analytical predictions are validated by extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically Consistent Coarse-graining: from Interacting Particles to Fields via Second Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically derive an exact coarse-grained description for interacting particles with thermodynamically consistent stochastic dynamics, applicable across different observation scales, the mesoscopic and the macroscopic. We implement the coarse-graining procedure using the Doi-Peliti field theory, which preserves microscopic noise effects on the meso/macro scale. The exact mapping reveals the key role played by Poissonian particle occupancy statistics. We show the implications of the exact coarse-graining method using a prototypical flocking model, namely the active Ising model, which exhibits a mismatch between the microscopic and macroscopic mean-field coarse-grained descriptions. Our analysis shows that the high- and low-density regimes are governed by two different coarse-grained equations. In the low-density regime, noise effects play a prominent role, leading to a first-order phase transition. In contrast, the second-order phase transition occurs in the high-density regime. Due to the exact coarse-graining methods, our framework also opens up applicability to systematically analyze noise-induced phase transitions in other models of reciprocally and non-reciprocally interacting particles.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in Two Dimensional Topological Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions occur when a dynamical free energy becomes non-analytic at critical \emph{times}. They have been shown to exist in, among other systems, topological insulators and superconductors. Additionally in both one dimensional systems and two dimensional higher order topological matter a dynamical analogue of the bulk-boundary correspondence has been observed which is suggestive of a dynamical switching between different phases. If the time evolving Hamiltonian is topologically non-trivial, zeroes of the Loschmidt matrix appear between critical times, leading to significant, periodically occurring contributions to the boundary dynamical free energy. In this article we extend these ideas to two dimensional topological matter by showing that in-gap bands in the spectrum of the Loschmidt matrix between successive critical times exist if the time evolving Hamiltonian is topologically non-trivial. We further show that these in-gap bands are directly responsible for a boundary contribution to the dynamical free energy, thus establishing a dynamical bulk-boundary correspondence in two dimensional topological matter.</description>

      <title>Measuring irreversibility by counting: a random coarse-graining framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic irreversibility is a fundamental concept in statistical physics, yet its experimental measurement remains challenging, especially for complex systems. We introduce a novel random coarse-graining framework to identify model-free measures of irreversibility in complex many-body systems. These measures are constructed from the asymmetry of cross-correlation functions between suitably chosen observables, providing rigorous lower bounds on entropy production. For many-particle systems, we propose a particularly practical implementation that divides real space into virtual boxes and monitors particle number densities within them, requiring only simple counting from video microscopy, without single-particle tracking, trajectory reconstruction, or prior knowledge of interactions. Owing to its generality and minimal data requirements, the random coarse-graining framework offers broad applicability across diverse nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>When higher-order interactions enhance synchronization: the case of the Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in complex systems, observed across a wide range of natural and engineered contexts. The Kuramoto model provides a foundational framework for understanding synchronization among coupled oscillators, traditionally assuming pairwise interactions. However, many real-world systems exhibit group and many-body interactions, which can be effectively modeled through hypergraphs. Previous studies suggest that higher-order interactions shrink the attraction basin of the synchronous state, making it harder to reach and potentially impairing synchronization, despite enriching the dynamics. In this work, we show that this is not always the case. Through extensive numerical analysis of the higher-order Kuramoto model, we find that while strong higher-order interactions do generally work against synchronization, weak higher-order interactions can actually enhance it. This result is further corroborated by a cost-benefit analysis: under a constrained budget of both pairwise and higher-order interactions, a mixed allocation involving both consistently achieves higher synchronization than relying on either interaction type alone. These findings provide new insights into the role of higher-order interactions in shaping collective dynamics and point to design principles for optimizing synchronization in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Circulation Statistics and Migdal Area Rule Beyond the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism in a Newborn Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts that a newly formed superfluid prepared by a finite-time thermal quench is populated with vortices. The universality of vortex number statistics, beyond KZM, enables the characterization of circulation statistics within any region of area $A$ enclosed by a loop $C$. Migdal's minimal area rule of classical turbulence predicts that the probability density function of circulation around a closed contour is independent of the contour's shape. We verify the Migdal area rule for small loops with respect to the distance between the vortex and antivortex pairs and further characterize its universal breakdown for bigger loops. We further uncovered the nonequilibrium universality dictated by the KZM dynamics, which results in power-law scalings of the moments of the circulation statistics as a function of the quench time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and benchmark an improved algorithm for complex Langevin simulations of bosonic coherent state path integrals. Our approach utilizes a Strang splitting of the imaginary-time propagator rather than the conventional linear-order Taylor expansion, allowing us to construct an action that incorporates higher-order terms at negligible computational cost. The resulting algorithm enjoys guaranteed linear stability independent of the imaginary-time discretization, enabling more resource-efficient simulations. We demonstrate this improved performance for single-species bosons and for two-component bosons with Rashba spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Unified Field-integral Thermodynamics of Bose Mixtures: Stability and Critical Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a unified thermodynamic framework for Bose mixtures at finite temperatures based on the functional field integral, within which the decision on whether to discard the anomalous densities, when determining the density configuration and stability matrix, yields distinct theories. Beyond the existing Hartree-Fock approximation and Ota-Giorgini-Stringari theory, retaining the anomalous densities throughout will provide a completely self-consistent thermodynamic description, requiring the combination of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation and the representative statistical ensemble. Comparing three approaches for predicting magnetic susceptibility, we highlight the role of anomalous densities in stabilizing superfluid mixtures. We further unveil that Feshbach coupling can either expand the regime of atomic and molecular superfluids, or induce a phase transition to a pure molecular superfluid, depending on their density ratio. Importantly, we show that thermal fluctuations will trigger a phase transition from stable to unstable mixtures, where anomalous densities can serve as distinct signatures for experimental observation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic thermal devices offer a unique platform for understanding the interplay between motion, quantum fields, and thermodynamics, revealing phenomena inaccessible to stationary systems. We consider a two-qubit SWAP heat engine whose working medium consists of inertially moving Unruh-DeWitt qubit detectors, each coupled to a scalar quantum field in thermal equilibrium at a distinct temperature. Relativistic motion causes the qubits to perceive frequency-dependent effective temperatures that are either hotter or colder than their respective reservoir temperature. We show that the relativistic temperature shift, perhaps the qubit velocity, can be harnessed as a thermodynamic resource to enhance the work output and the efficiency at maximum power of the heat engine. We derive a generalized second law for a heat engine with a moving working medium and demonstrate that it can exceed the standard Carnot bound defined by rest-frame temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a massive tracer particle coupled to an interacting active bath, modeled as a harmonic chain of overdamped active particles analytically, with an aim to understand the impact of bath interactions and activity on the nonequilibrium fluctuations of the tracer. From the microscopic equations, we derive the tracer particle's effective Langevin equation, obtaining the dissipative and stochastic forces from the bath. We analyze the friction kernel, revealing power-law tails in the weak coupling limit and exponential decay in the strong coupling regime. Due to the interplay between bath interactions, probe-bath coupling, and activity, the mean squared displacement, velocity, and stationary velocity correlations exhibit different dynamical regimes, which we characterize analytically. Under harmonic confinement, we find that energy equipartition holds at low activity but breaks down at higher activity, with the kinetic energy exhibiting a non-monotonic dependence on the activity of the bath.</description>

      <title>Identifying nonequilibrium degrees of freedom in high-dimensional stochastic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any coarse-grained description of a nonequilibrium system should faithfully represent its latent irreversible degrees of freedom. However, standard dimensionality reduction methods typically prioritize accurate reconstruction over physical relevance. Here, we introduce a model-free approach to identify irreversible degrees of freedom in stochastic systems that are in a nonequilibrium steady state. Our method leverages the insight that a black-box classifier, trained to differentiate between forward and time-reversed trajectories, implicitly estimates the local entropy production rate. By parameterizing this classifier as a quadratic form of learned state representations, we obtain nonlinear embeddings of high-dimensional state-space dynamics, which we term Latent Embeddings of Nonequilibrium Systems (LENS). LENS effectively identifies low-dimensional irreversible flows and provides a scalable, learning-based strategy for estimating entropy production rates directly from high-dimensional time series data.</description>

This point of view leads us to the grand-canonical framework and the need for a chemical potential. The dynamics is played by the shift acting on the set of sequences $\Omega := \mathcal{A}^\mathbb{N}$, where the alphabet is $\mathcal{A} := \{1,2,...,r\}$. Introducing new variables like the number of particles $N$ and the chemical potential $\mu$, we adapt the concept of grand-canonical partition sum of thermodynamics of gases to a symbolic dynamical setting considering a Lipschitz family of potentials $% (A_N)_{N \in \mathbb{N}_0}$, $A_N:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$. Our main results will be obtained from adapting well-known properties of the Thermodynamic Formalism for IFS with weights to our setting. In this direction, we introduce the grand-canonical-Ruelle operator: $\mathcal{L}_{\beta, \mu}(f)=g$, when, $\beta&gt;0,\mu&lt;0,$ and
  \medskip $\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,g(x)= \mathcal{L}_{\beta, \mu}(f) (x) =\sum_{N \in \mathbb{N}_0} e^{\beta \, \mu\, N }\, \sum_{j \in \mathcal{A}} e^{- \,\beta\, A_N(jx)} f(jx). $ \medskip
  We show the existence of the main eigenvalue, an associated eigenfunction, and an eigenprobability for $\mathcal{L}_{\beta, \mu}^*$. We can show the analytic dependence of the eigenvalue on the grand-canonical potential. Considering the concept of entropy for holonomic probabilities on $\Omega\times \mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{N}_0}$, we relate these items with the variational problem of maximizing grand-canonical pressure. In another direction, in the appendix, we briefly digress on a possible interpretation of the concept of topological pressure as related to the gas pressure of gas thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We use simulation-based supervised machine learning and classical density functional theory to investigate bulk and interfacial phenomena associated with phase coexistence in binary mixtures. For a prototypical symmetrical Lennard-Jones mixture our trained neural density functional yields accurate liquid-liquid and liquid-vapour binodals together with predictions for the variation of the associated interfacial tensions across the entire fluid phase diagram. From the latter we determine the contact angles at fluid-fluid interfaces along the line of triple-phase coexistence and confirm there can be no wetting transition in this symmetrical mixture.</description>
