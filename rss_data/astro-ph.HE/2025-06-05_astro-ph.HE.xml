      <title>$f$-mode oscillations in hot Neutron Stars: Effect of hyperons and neutrino trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an equation of state formalism for hot Neutron Stars (NSs) which consistently includes the effects of finite temperature, hyperons as well as neutrino trapping, relevant for the study of proto-neutron stars, binary neutron star mergers and supernova explosions. Within a non-linear relativistic mean field description, the framework allows for a systematic variation of nuclear parameters within the range allowed by uncertainties in nuclear experimental data, ensuring compatibility with nuclear theory, astrophysical and heavy-ion data. We then investigate the role of nuclear and hypernuclear parameters on NS macroscopic properties and $f$-mode oscillations in hot neutron stars within Cowling approximation. Our results reveal that in hyperonic neutron stars with trapped neutrinos, the saturation nuclear density shows moderate to strong correlation with NS astrophysical observables. We also investigate the $C-Love$ universal relations for this model and provide fit relations for hot NS configurations in the neutrino-trapped regime.</description>

      <title>Do they repeat? Monitoring 36 non-repeating FRBs with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs), highly energetic, millisecond-duration radio pulses originating from beyond our galaxy, remains unknown. Observationally, FRBs are classified as non-repeating or repeating, however, this classification is complicated by limited observing time and sensitivity constraints, which may result in some repeating FRBs being misidentified as non-repeating. To address this issue, we adopt both empirical and machine-learning techniques from previous studies to identify candidates that may have been misclassified. We conducted follow-up observations of 36 such candidates, each observed for 10 minutes using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). No radio bursts exceeding a signal-to-noise ratio of 7 were detected, with a typical 7 sigma fluence limit of ~0.013 Jy ms. We constrain the repetition rates of these sources using two statistical models of FRB occurrence. Combining our FAST non-detections with prior observations, we derive upper limits on the repetition rates of ~$10^{-2.6}$-$10^{-0.22}$ hr$^{-1}$ under a Poisson process, and ~$10^{-2.3}$-$10^{-0.25}$ hr$^{-1}$ under a Weibull process. This work presents one of the most stringent upper limits on FRB repetition rates to date, based on a sample size five times larger than those used in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae with no electromagnetic counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are regularly observed electromagnetically, prompting targetted searches for their gravitational-wave emission. However, there are scenarios where these powerful explosions may not have any observable electromagnetic signal, but would still have strong detectable emission in gravitational waves and neutrinos. A regular CCSN explosion may be obscured by matter in the Galaxy. A star may undergo a failed CCSN explosion, where the stalled shockwave is not revived, and would eventually form a black hole. Higher mass progenitor stars may revive the shock, but form a black hole too quickly for the shockwave to reach the surface of the star and produce an electromagnetic signal. Previous work has shown that we can determine if a black hole forms from the CCSN neutrino emission if there are long duration sinusoidal modulations in the neutrino signal caused by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI). The SASI also produces an observable signature in the gravitational-wave emission. In this paper, we investigate if we can distinguish between different scenarios for electromagnetically dark CCSNe using the gravitational-wave emission alone. We find, using a reconstruction of the SASI mode, abrupt end times of the gravitational-wave emission, and the rate of change of frequency of the dominant mode, that we are able to accurately distinguish between an obscured CCSN, a failed CCSN, and an explosion with fast black hole formation.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15-Year Data Set: A Case Study for Simplified Dispersion Measure Modeling for PSR J1455-3330 and the Impact on Gravitational Wave Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence for a low-frequency gravitational-wave background using pulsar timing arrays has generated recent interest into its underlying contributing sources. However, multiple investigations have seen that the significance of the evidence does not change with choice of pulsar modeling techniques but the resulting parameters from the gravitational wave searches do. PSR J1455-3330 is one of the longest-observed pulsars in the array monitored by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) but showed no evidence for long-timescale red noise, either intrinsic or the common signal found among many pulsars in the array. In this work, we argue that NANOGrav's piecewise-constant function used to model variations in radio-frequency-dependent dispersive delay should not be used for this pulsar, and a much simpler physical model of a fixed solar wind density plus a linear trend in dispersion measure is preferred. When the original model is replaced, (i) the pulsar's timing parallax signal changes from an upper limit to a significant detection, (ii) red noise becomes significant, and (iii) the red noise is consistent with the common signal found for the other pulsars. Neither of these signals are radio-frequency dependent. While the same physical motivation will not apply to many of the pulsars currently used in pulsar timing arrays, we argue for careful physically-motivated timing and noise modeling of pulsars used in precision timing experiments.</description>

      <title>A Multi-wavelength Characterization of the 2023 Outburst of MAXI J1807+132: Manifestations of Disk Instability and Jet Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several phenomenological aspects of low-luminosity neutron star transients, such as atolls, remain poorly understood. One such source, MAXI J1807+132, entered its latest outburst in July 2023. To thoroughly characterize this outburst, we conducted an extensive observational campaign spanning radio to X-ray wavelengths. Here, we present the results of this campaign, which covered the period from before the outburst to the return to quiescence. We detected a delay between the X-ray and optical rise times, which is consistent with the predictions of the disk instability model with a truncated disk. The color evolution and optical/X-ray correlations, along with infrared and radio detections, support the presence of jet synchrotron emission during the gradual decay phase following the peak. We also report for the first time in an X-ray binary a near-orthogonal rotation of the optical polarization just before a small flare, after which the jet is thought to be quenched. The main outburst is followed by several high-amplitude, rapid reflares in the optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray bands, the origin of which remains difficult to constrain.</description>

      <title>Probing the accretion geometry of black hole X-ray binaries: A multi-mission spectro-polarimetric and timing study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive spectro-polarimetric and timing analysis of eleven black hole X-ray binaries, namely Cyg X-1, 4U 1630-47, Cyg X-3, LMC X-1, 4U 1957+115, LMC X-3, Swift J1727.8-1613, GX 339-4, Swift J151857.0-572147, IGR J17091-3624, and MAXI J1744-294, using quasi-simultaneous observations from {\it IXPE}, {\it NICER}, {\it NuSTAR}, and {\it AstroSat}. Timing analyses reveal characteristic type-B and type-C Quasi-periodic Oscillations (QPOs) across different spectral states, often associated with episodic radio ejections. Broadband ($0.7-60$ keV) spectral modelling, employing disc, Comptonization, and reflection components, reveals degeneracies in constraining disc-corona geometries. Polarimetric measurements in 2-8 keV band detect significant polarization degrees (PDs) ranging from $3-20.6\%$ ($1.2-21.4\%$) in harder (softer) states, with moderate to strong energy dependence, except for LMC X-1, Swift J151857.0-572147, and MAXI J1744-294, where no significant polarization is detected. We report the polarization detections of Cyg X-3 (PD $\sim 21.4\%$, SIMS), LMC X-3 (PD $\sim 2.4\%$, HSS) and IGR J17091-3624 (PD $\sim 9\%$, LHS) using the recent {\it IXPE} observations. A positive correlation is found between PD and the Comptonized photon fraction ($cov_{\rm frac}$), while an anti-correlation is observed with the disc-to-Comptonized flux ratio ($F_{\rm ratio}$) across spectral states. The combined timing, spectral, and polarimetric results, together with constraints from radio jet observations, suggest a radially extended corona within a truncated disc for Cyg X-1, Swift J1727.8-1613, IGR J17091-3624, and GX 339-4, whereas the disc-corona geometry remains unconstrained for 4U 1957+115, LMC X-3, and 4U 1630-47. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding accretion geometries and highlight prospects for future X-ray polarimetric studies.</description>

      <title>Probing the sensitivity of CTAO-N LSTs observations at large zenith angles to the multi-TeV gamma-ray emission from the inner 10 parsecs of the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of the Galactic Center using Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), such as H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS, have revealed a very-high-energy (VHE, $\gtrsim 100$ GeV) gamma-ray source, HESS J1745$-$290, aligned with the dynamical center of the Milky Way. This source shows point-like emission ($\lesssim 0.1^\circ$) and a strong suppression in its energy-differential spectrum in the ten TeV energy regime, modeled well by a power-law with an exponential cutoff. The origin of this emission is debated, with candidate emission scenarios including dark matter annihilations, millisecond pulsars in the central stellar clusters, and hadronic interactions in the vicinity of Sagittarius A*. Deriving the sensitivity to these spectral models is key to discriminating the physical processes at work. We show that combining H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS archival data can well described the observed emission by a power-law with an exponential energy cutoff within the present uncertainties. Given the near advent of the array of the Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) at CTAO-N, we timely simulate realistic upcoming observations of the central emission by the CTAO-N four-LST array, to derive the sensitivity to resolve the sharpness of the spectral energy cutoff. We find that 500 hours of four-LST observations taken at large zenith angles, possibly accumulated over several years, can significantly discriminate the dark-matter emission scenario from the leptonic and hadronic ones. Also, a preliminary 3$\sigma$ hint for such discrimination could emerge within the first year. We demonstrate, for the first time, that CTAO-N is able to provide new insights on differentiating among the above-mentioned emission scenarios in the next several years.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Networks Hunting Ultra-Light Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) is a compelling candidate for cosmological dark matter. If ULDM interacts with ordinary matter, it can induce measurable, characteristic signals in pulsar-timing data because it causes the orbits of pulsars in binary systems to osculate. In this work, we investigate the potential of machine learning (ML) techniques to detect such ULDM signals. To this end, we construct three types of neural networks: an autoencoder, a binary classifier, and a multiclass classifier. We apply these methods to four theoretically well-motivated ULDM models: a linearly coupled scalar field, a quadratically coupled scalar field, a vector field and a tensor field. We show that the sensitivity achieved using ML methods is comparable to that of a semi-analytical Bayesian approach, which to date has only been applied to the linear scalar case. The ML approach is readily applicable to all four ULDM models and, in the case of the multiclass classifier, can distinguish between them. Our results, derived from simulated data, lay the foundation for future applications to real pulsar-timing observations.</description>

      <title>The 157-month Swift-BAT All-Sky Hard X-Ray Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) onboard the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory has been serving as a survey instrument for the hard X-ray sky, and has detected thousands of X-ray sources (e.g., AGNs, X-ray binaries, etc). BAT monitors these X-ray sources and follows their light curves on time scales from minutes to years. In addition, BAT discovers hundreds of new X-ray sources in survey images stacked throughout the mission lifetime. We present the updated BAT survey catalog since the last published BAT 105 month survey catalog (Oh et al. 2018) with additional of 4.5 years of data until December 2017. Data since 2007 are reprocessed to include updated instrumental calibration. Analysis in this study shows that additional systematic noise can be seen in the 157-month mosaic images, resulting in decreases in the expected improvement in sensitivity and the number of new detections. The BAT 157-month survey reaches a sensitivity of $8.83 \times 10^{-12} \rm \ erg \ s^{-1} \ cm^{-2}$ for 90\% of the sky and $6.44 \times 10^{-12} \rm \ erg \ s^{-1} \ cm^{-2}$ for 10\% of the sky. This catalog includes spectra, monthly and snapshot light curves in eight energy bands (14-20, 20-24, 24-35, 35-50, 50-75, 75-100, 100-150, and 150-195 keV) for 1888 sources, including 256 new detections above the detection threshold of $4.8\sigma$. The light curves, spectra, and tables that summarize the information of the detected-sources are available in the online journal and in the catalog web page https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/bs157mon/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast magnetosonic waves are one of the two low-frequency plasma modes that can exist in a neutron star magnetosphere. It was recently realized that these waves may become nonlinear within the magnetosphere and steepen into some of the strongest shocks in the universe. These shocks, when in the appropriate parameter regime, may emit GHz radiation in the form of precursor waves. We present the first global Particle-in-Cell simulations of the nonlinear steepening of fast magnetosonic waves in a dipolar magnetosphere, and quantitatively demonstrate the strong plasma acceleration in the upstream of these shocks. In these simulations, we observe the production of precursor waves in a finite angular range. Using analytic scaling relations, we predict the expected frequency, power, and duration of this emission. Within a reasonable range of progenitor wave parameters, these precursor waves can reproduce many aspects of FRB observations.</description>

      <title>Core-collapse supernova parameter estimation with the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to revolutionize time-domain optical astronomy as we know it. With its unprecedented depth, the LSST will survey the southern hemisphere sky, generating nearly 32 trillion observations over its nominal 10-year operation. Among these, approximately 10 million will be supernovae (SNe). These observations will uniquely characterize the SN population, enabling studies of known and rare SN types, detailed parameterization of their light curves, deep searches for new SN progenitor populations, the discovery of strongly lensed SNe, and the compilation of a large, well-characterized sample of superluminous SNe. We analyzed a sample of 22663 simulations of LSST light curves for core collapse SNe (CCSNe), modeled using the radiative transfer code STELLA. We analyzed this dataset with the software CASTOR, which enables the reconstruction of synthetic light curves and spectra via a machine learning technique that allows one to retrieve the complete parameter map of a SN. For each parameter we compared the observed and the true values, determining how LSST light curves alone will contribute to characterize the progenitor and the explosion. Our results indicate that LSST alone will not suffice for a comprehensive and precise characterization of progenitor properties and explosion parameters. The limited spectral coverage of LSST light curves (in most cases) does not allow for the accurate estimation of bolometric luminosity, and consequently, of the explosion energy and nickel yield. Additionally, the redshift-absorption degeneracy is difficult to resolve without supplementary information. These findings suggest that for the most interesting SNe, complementary follow-up observations using spectrographs and optical facilities (particularly in the infrared bands) will be essential for accurate parameter determination.</description>

      <title>Lense-Thirring Precession Modulates Repeated Lensing of Continues Gravitational Wave Source from AGN Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) offers a novel observational channel that complements traditional electromagnetic approaches and provides unique insights into the astrophysical environments of GW sources. In this work, we investigate the repeated lensing of continuous gravitational wave (CW) sources in active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks by central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), focusing on the imprint of SMBH spin via the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect. Although typically weak and challenging to observe, the spin-induced precession of source orbits can accumulate over time, thereby modulating the lensing geometry. Such modulations influence the magnification, duration, and waveform structure of each repeated lensing event, and enhance the overall probability of lensing occurrences. Using matched filtering, we demonstrate that spin-dependent signatures may be detectable, suggesting that lensed CW signals could serve as an indirect probe of SMBH spin in AGNs.</description>

      <title>Interlinking internal and external magnetic fields of relativistically rotating neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a global solution for the internal and the external field of an axisymmetric rotating neutron star. It is shown that the twist of the internal field affects the external field, by increasing the number of open field lines and eventually the spin-down rate of the star. This effect is far more drastic if the toroidal field, and consequently the poloidal current flowing within the star, is allowed to populate the closed field lines of the magnetosphere, rather than if it remains confined in the star. We further remark that the internal field structure depends on the presence of a twisted magnetosphere: if the twist current is not allowed to flow in the magnetosphere it only occupied a narrow toroid at the interior of the star, whereas if the twist currents are allowed to flow in the magnetosphere the internal toroidal field may occupy a significant volume of the stellar interior. Strong magnetospheric currents may also impact the emission mechanisms, and lead to fluctuations in magnetar spin-down rates, moding and nulling of pulsars, a correlation between angular shear and twist, and the general morphology of the pulsar magnetic field leading to various observational manifestations. The magnetospheric toroidal fields may possibly dissipate, thus the system may switch from global twist to internal twist and consequently exhibit transient behavior.</description>

      <title>Studying mirror acceleration via kinetic simulations of relativistic plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient turbulent acceleration of particles is indicated by recent astrophysical observations, but its mechanism is not well understood. Mirror acceleration has recently been proposed as an efficient mechanism for particle energization in turbulence-compressed magnetic fields. We employ a 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of pair plasma in magnetized and relativistic turbulence to study this new mechanism and its acceleration efficiency. By tracking individual particles, we see that reversal of a particle's moving direction and significant energy gain can happen during one mirror interaction and within one gyro-orbit. As expected for mirror acceleration, we statistically find that (1) energy gain is preferentially in the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic field and positively correlated with local magnetic field strengthening, and (2) the particle pitch angle distribution becomes increasingly anisotropic toward higher energies, with a concentration at large pitch angles. Our results demonstrate that the mirror acceleration causes a strong confinement of particles by stochastically increasing their pitch angles. This, in turn, facilitates repeated mirror acceleration with the mirroring condition well satisfied. We conclude that mirror acceleration is a promising mechanism accounting for efficient acceleration in magnetized and turbulent astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Outliers: Low-Spin Halos Explain the Abundance, Compactness, and Redshift Evolution of the Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Little Red Dots (LRDs) are high-redshift galaxies uncovered by JWST, characterized by small effective radii ($R_{\rm eff} \sim 80-300$ pc), number densities intermediate between typical galaxies and quasars, and a redshift distribution peaked at $z \sim 5$. We present a theoretical model in which the LRDs descend from dark matter halos in the extreme low-spin tail of the angular momentum distribution. Within this framework, we explain their three key observational signatures: (i) abundance, (ii) compactness, and (iii) redshift distribution. Our model focuses on observed, not modeled, properties; it is thus independent of whether they are powered primarily by a black hole or stars. We find that the assumption that the prototypical LRD at $z \sim 5$ originates from halos in the lowest $\sim 1\%$ of the spin distribution is sufficient to reproduce both their observed number densities and physical sizes. The redshift evolution of their observability is driven by the interplay between the evolving compact disk fraction and cosmological surface brightness dimming. This effect leads to a well-defined "LRDs Era" at $4&lt;z&lt;8$, during which the LRDs are common and detectable; at $z&lt;4$, they are bright but rare, while at $z&gt;8$, they are common but faint. Finally, we test the predicted redshift trend against observational data, finding excellent agreement. Additional observational support comes from their excess small-scale clustering and spectral signatures of extreme core densities, both of which are expected outcomes of galaxy formation in low-spin halos. These findings suggest that the LRDs are not a fundamentally distinct population but the natural manifestation of galaxies forming in the rarest, lowest angular momentum environments.</description>

      <title>Exploring selection biases in FRB dispersion-galaxy cross-correlations with magnetohydrodynamical simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in conjunction with their redshifts can be used as powerful probes of the distribution of extragalactic plasma, and with a large enough sample, the free-electron--galaxy power spectrum $P_{eg}$ can be measured by cross-correlating FRB dispersions with galaxy positions. However, a precise measurement of $P_{eg}$ requires a careful investigation of the selection effects -- the fact that the probability of both observing the FRB dispersion measure and obtaining a host galaxy redshift depends on observed properties of the FRB and its host. We use ray tracing simulations with IllustrisTNG300-1 to investigate the impact of expected observational selection effects on FRB dispersion-galaxy angular cross-correlations with a sample of 3000 FRBs at redshift range of $0.3 \leq z \leq 0.4$ . Our results show that cross-correlations with such an FRB sample are robust to properties of the FRB host galaxy: this includes DM contributions from the FRB host and optical followup selection effects biased against FRBs with dim galaxy hosts. We also find that such cross-correlations are robust to DM dependent and scattering selection effects specific to the CHIME/FRB survey. However, a DM dependent selection effect that cuts off the 10\% most dispersed FRB at a fixed redshift shell can bias the amplitude of the cross-correlation signal by over 50\% at angular scales of $\sim 0.1^\circ$ (corresponding to Mpc physical scales). Our findings highlight the importance of both measuring and accounting for selection effects present in existing FRB surveys as well as mitigating DM dependent selection effects in the design of upcoming FRB surveys aiming to use FRBs as probes for large-scale structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Miscidynamics describes coarse-grained neutrino transport under the assumption that flavor mixing is in local equilibrium. Here we introduce the concept of turbulent flavor-wave viscosity and develop techniques for including it in miscidynamics. This extension of the theory is necessary when neutrinos develop weak flavor instabilities as a result of astrophysical driving. The flavor-wave dispersion relation is obtained using a new and more general form of linear analysis, which does not require small flavor coherence. Flavor-wave transport is then approximated using wave kinetics and geometric optics. We hypothesize that the dynamical emergence of local oscillation invariants restricts the extent of flavor thermalization. In this view, flavor evolution is sculpted by both entropy-increasing and order-promoting factors.</description>

      <title>Changing Look AGN: A study of Optical/UV and the Highly Ionized Fe K$\alpha$ X-ray Line Flux Variations Using Photo-Ionization Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant variability in broad emission line strengths of active galactic nuclei (AGN) over months to years has been observed, often accompanied by intrinsic continuum changes. Such spectral variability challenges the traditional AGN classification scheme, which attributes differences between Type 1 and Type 2 to geometrical effects, as transitions between these types occur on timescales shorter than viscous ones. In this work, using the {\sc cloudy} photo-ionization simulations, we investigated the response of the major emission line fluxes, in the optical/UV and hard X-ray bands, to changes in the intensity and shape of the continuum emission of the AGN under two scenarios: (i) changes in the X-ray power-law while keeping disc emission fixed, and (ii) broadband continuum variations. We demonstrate that BLR line fluxes are insensitive to X-ray power-law changes alone. Considering a well-studied case of the changing-look (CL) AGN Mrk 1018, which exhibits variations in the intrinsic disc emission, as well as the X-ray power-law, our simulations reproduce observed brightening and dimming trends of the BLR emission. Moreover, we show that the highly ionized Fe K$\alpha$ X-ray flux, primarily produced by the H-like and He-like ions of Fe, strongly depends on the X-ray strength of the intrinsic SED. These findings suggest that the origin of highly ionized Fe K$\alpha$ emission is in the coronal part of the accretion disk and that the CL phenomenon can be triggered by intrinsic changes in the accretion properties of AGN.</description>

      <title>External Attention Transformer: A Robust AI Model for Identifying Initial Eccentricity Signatures in Binary Black Hole Events in Simulated Advanced LIGO Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Initial orbital eccentricities of gravitational wave (GW) events associated with merging binary black holes (BBHs) should provide clues to their formation scenarios, mainly because various BBH formation channels predict distinct eccentricity distributions. However, searching for inspiral GWs from eccentric BBHs is computationally challenging due to sophisticated approaches to model such GW events. This ensures that Bayesian parameter estimation methods to characterize such events are computationally daunting. These considerations influenced us to propose a novel approach to identify and characterize eccentric BBH events in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration data sets that leverages external attention transformer models. Employing simulated data that mimic LIGO O4 run, eccentric inspiral events modeled by an effective-one-body numerical-relativity waveform family, we show the effectiveness of our approach. By integrating this transformer-based framework with a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, we provide efficient way to identify eccentric BBH GW events and accurately characterize their source properties.</description>

      <title>X-ray spectroscopy method of white dwarf mass determination in intermediate polars. External systematic uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The masses of white dwarfs (WDs) in intermediate polars (IPs) can be determined from the shape of their hard X-ray spectra. Here we study the importance of all possible systematic uncertainties in this X-ray spectroscopy method, including finite radii and rotation of magnetospheres, finite accretion column height and accretion-flow inclination relative to the WD surface. We also investigate the importance of accretion-heated envelopes on WD surfaces in IPs which are increasing WD radii. Their presence changes the commonly used mass-radius relation for cold white dwarfs. As a first approximation we use thick ($10^{-4}M_\odot$) hydrogen envelope models with a surface temperature of 30 kK. We present a new model grid of hard X-ray spectra of high-luminous IPs computed among other things with using a new mass-radius relation. This grid is used for fitting Swift/BAT spectra of 47 IPs. The average WD mass in this sample is 0.82 $M_\odot$ and coincides with the average WD mass in cataclysmic variables obtained by optical methods. This means that the calculated hard X-ray spectra and the assumptions made that the magnetospheric radii in IPs are close to the corotation radii, and the relative heights of the accretion columns are small are basically correct, because most IPs have high luminosities. But this universal grid (as well as previous universal grids) cannot give correct results for the low-luminous IPs with probably relatively tall accretion columns on the WD surfaces. Such IPs have to be investigated with individual accretion column models.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray and plasma coupling for isothermal supersonic turbulence in the magnetized interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) are an integral part of the non-thermal pressure budget in the interstellar medium (ISM) and are the leading-order ionization mechanism in cold molecular clouds. We study the impacts that different microphysical CR diffusion coefficients and streaming speeds have on the evolution of isothermal, magnetized, turbulent plasmas, relevant to the cold ISM. We utilized a two-moment CR magnetohydrodynamic (CRMHD) model, allowing us to dynamically evolve both CR energy and flux densities with contributions from Alfv\'enic streaming and anisotropic diffusion. We identify $\textit{coupled}$ and $\textit{decoupled}$ regimes, and define dimensionless Prandtl numbers $\rm{Pm_c}$ and $\rm{Pm_s}$, which quantify whether the plasma falls within these two regimes. In the coupled regime -- characteristic of slow streaming ($\rm{Pm_s} &lt; 1$) and low diffusion ($\rm{Pm_c} &lt; 1$) -- the CR fluid imprints upon the plasma a mixed equation of state between $P_{\rm{c}} \propto \rho^{4/3}$ (relativistic fluid) and $P_{\rm{c}} \propto \rho^{2/3}$ (streaming), where $P_{\rm{c}}$ is the CR pressure, and $\rho$ is the plasma density. By modifying the sound speed, the coupling reduces the turbulent Mach number, and hence the amplitude of the density fluctuations, whilst supporting secular heating of the CR fluid. In contrast, in the decoupled regime ($\rm{Pm_s} &gt; 1$ or $\rm{Pm_c} &gt; 1$) the CR fluid and the plasma have negligible interactions. We further show that CR heating is enabled by coherent structures within the compressible velocity field, with no impact on the turbulence spectrum of incompressible modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic jets from AGN are an important driver of feedback in galaxies. They interact with their environments over a wide range of physical scales during their lifetime, and an understanding of these interactions is crucial for unraveling the role of supermassive blackholes in shaping galaxy evolution. The impact of such jets have been traditionally considered in the context of heating the large-scale environments. However, in the last few decades there has been additional focus on the immediate impact of jet feedback on the host galaxy itself. In this review we outline the development of various numerical simulations since the onset of studies of jets to the present day, where sophisticated numerical techniques have been employed to study jet feedback including a range of physical processes. The jets can act as an important agent of injecting energy in the host's ISM, as confirmed both in observations of multi-phase gas, as well as in simulations. Such interactions have the potential to impact the kinematics of the gas as well as its star formation. We summarize the recent results from simulations of jet feedback on kpc scales, and outline the broader implications for observations and galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>A Relativistic Jet in the Radio Quiet AGN Mrk 110</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a relativistic jet in Mrk~110, a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy historically classified as a radio-quiet active galactic nucleus (AGN). Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations reveal intermittent jet activity during 2015--2016 and 2022--2024, with proper motion measurements yielding superluminal velocities of $\sim3.6\pm0.6\,c$ and $\sim2.1\pm0.2\,c$, respectively. The recent jet component decelerates to $\sim 1.5\pm0.2\,c$ at a projected distance of 1.1 parsec from the core, coinciding with the transition zone between broad-line and narrow-line regions. This deceleration accompanies dramatic spectral evolution from steep (the spectral index $\alpha \approx -0.63 \pm 0.04$) to inverted ($\alpha \approx +0.69 \pm 0.10$) as the 7.6 GHz flux density more than doubled. These episodic jet ejections and their evolutionary pattern match theoretical predictions from magnetically arrested disk (MAD) models for temporary jet formation in systems with Mrk 110's physical parameters on timescales of months to years. The observed jet deceleration distance matches expectations for relativistic outflows interacting with the circumnuclear environment. These findings demonstrate that the traditional radio-loud/quiet AGN dichotomy may reflect time-averaged states rather than intrinsic capabilities, suggesting that jets may form across the AGN population but become observable only during specific accretion phases when MAD conditions are temporarily established. Mrk 110 serves as a critical "missing link" between radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN, providing insight into jet formation mechanisms, environmental interactions, and physical processes that unify various AGN classifications.</description>

      <title>Time domain astrophysics with transient sources. Delay estimate via Cross Correlation Function techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The timing analysis of transient events allows for investigating numerous still open areas of modern astrophysics. The article explores all the mathematical and physical tools required to estimate delays and associated errors between two Times of Arrival (ToA) lists, by exploiting Cross Correlation Function (CCF) techniques. The CCF permits the establishment of the delay between two observed signals and is defined on two continuous functions. A detector does not directly measure the intensity of the electromagnetic signal (interacting with its material) but rather detects each photon ToA through a probabilistic process. Since the CCF is defined on continuous functions, the crucial step is to obtain a continuous rate curve from a list of ToA. This step is treated in the article and the constructed rate functions are light curves that are continuous functions. This allows, in principle, the estimation of delays with any desired resolution. Due to the statistical nature of the measurement process, two independent detections of the same signal yield different photon times. Consequently, light curves derived from these lists differ due to Poisson fluctuations, leading the CCF between them to fluctuate around the true theoretical delay. This article describes a Monte Carlo technique that enables reliable delay estimation by providing a robust measure of the uncertainties induced by Poissonian fluctuations. GRB data are considered as they offer optimal test cases for the proposed techniques. The developed techniques provides a significant computational advantage and are useful analyzing of data characterized by low-count statistics (i.e., low photon count rates in c/s), as they allow overcoming the limitations associated with traditional fixed bin-size methods.</description>

      <title>A Correlation Between FRB Dispersion Measure and Foreground Large-Scale Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of baryons in the Universe remains a fundamental open question in astronomy, and the dispersion measure (DM) of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) serves as a valuable tool for probing this cosmic gas. We investigate the impact of the foreground cosmic web on FRB DMs using 61 localized FRBs and public galaxy catalogs. We test for the large-scale structure's impact on cosmological DM using two methods. First, we searched for a correlation between galaxy number density along the line of sight and extragalactic DM, and found a statistically significant positive correlation ($p$ = $1.76 \times 10^{-5}$). The shape of this correlation contains information about the cosmic baryon distribution, and can also be used to better constrain host galaxy DM by providing an estimate of the cosmic contribution on a per-source basis. We observe similar correlations in a mock FRB survey based on the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation, where the DM is dominated by filaments in the IGM and not by halos. Next, we performed a stacking analysis that measures the average excess DM as a function of impact parameter of foreground galaxies to obtain spatial information about how ionized gas is distributed around galaxy halos. We report excess DM in the stacked signal for impact parameters up to Mpc scales ($\sim$3$\sigma$). Finally, we identified FRBs that do not appear to intersect intervening halos within $r_{vir}$, allowing us to estimate the fraction of baryons that reside in the IGM. We find $f_{\mathrm{IGM}} \geq 0.69$ at 95$\%$ confidence, indicating significant astrophysical feedback.</description>

      <title>Stellar distributions around supermassive black holes in gas-rich nuclear star clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stellar distribution around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in gas-rich nuclear star clusters (NSCs). NSCs could contain vast amounts of gas, which contribute significantly to shaping the stellar distribution, typically altering the stellar density cusp from the usual Bahcall \&amp; Wolf 1976 solution and consequently affecting the dynamics in the NSC. The dense gaseous environment in NSCs gives rise to dynamical phenomena that are otherwise rare in other gas-free environments. Here we extend the derivation introduced in Bahcall \&amp; Wolf 1976 to include an additional energy dissipation term associated with gas drag. We examine the effect of different forms of gas drag on the stellar density distribution. Finally, we discuss implications on the rates of tidal disruption events and other transients triggered by stellar interactions in gas-rich galactic nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic search for astrophysical transients using data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). The data were taken from 2017 to 2022 in three frequency bands spanning 77 GHz to 277 GHz. In this paper we present a pipeline for transient detection using single observation maps where each pixel of a map contains one observation with an integration time of approximately four minutes. We detect 34 transient events at 27 unique locations. All but two of the transients are associated with Galactic stars and exhibit a wide range of properties. We also detect an event coincident with the classical nova YZ Ret and one event consistent with a flaring active galactic nucleus. We notably do not detect any reverse shock emission from gamma ray bursts, a non-detection that may be in tension with current models.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation for the linear theory of relativistic Rayleigh Taylor instability in magnetized medium revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) arises at the interface between two fluids of different densities, notably when a heavier fluid lies above a lighter one in an effective gravitational field. In astrophysical systems with high velocities, relativistic corrections are necessary. We investigate the linear theory of relativistic Rayleigh-Taylor instability (R-RTI) in a magnetized medium, where fluids can move parallel to the interface at relativistic velocities. We chose an "intermediate frame" where fluids on each side of the interface move in opposite directions with identical Lorentz factors gamma_*. This symmetry facilitates analytical derivations and the study of relativistic effects on the instability's dynamics. We derive the correct version of the R-RTI. We find that the instability is activated when the Atwood number A = (rho1 h1 - rho2 h2) / (rho1 h1 + rho2 h2) &gt; 0, where rho1 and rho2 are densities measured in the rest frame of the fluids, and that this criterion does not contain relativistic corrections. The relativistic effect is mostly contained in the Lorentz transformation of the gravitational acceleration g' = g / (gamma_*)^2, which, combined with time dilation, leads to a much slower growth of instability (omega' = omega0 / gamma_*), and a slightly elongated length of the unstable patch, due to weaker g in the intermediate frame. Taking time dilation into account, when viewed in the rest frame of the medium, we expect the instability to grow at a much reduced rate. The analytical results should guide further explorations of instability in systems such as microquasars (muQSOs), active galactic nuclei (AGNs), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and radio pulsars (PSRs), where the apparent stability of the jet can be attributed to either the intrinsic stability (e.g. the Atwood number) or the much prolonged duration through which R-RTI can grow.</description>

      <title>Inferring jet physics from neutron star - black hole mergers with gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron star - black hole (NSBH) mergers that undergo tidal disruption may launch jets that could power a gamma-ray burst. We use a population of simulated NSBH systems to measure jet parameters from the gravitational waves emitted by these systems. The conditions during the tidal disruption and merger phase required to power a gamma-ray burst are uncertain. It is likely that the system must achieve some minimum remnant baryonic mass after the merger before a jet can be launched to power a gamma-ray burst. Assuming a fiducial neutron star equation of state, we show how Bayesian hierarchical inference can be used to infer the minimum remnant mass required to launch a gamma-ray burst jet as well as the maximum gamma-ray burst viewing angle to detect a gamma-ray burst. We find that with 200 NSBH observations, we can measure the minimum disk mass to within 0.01 solar masses at 90% credibility. We simultaneously infer the maximum gamma-ray burst viewing angle to within 13 degrees at 90% credibility. We conclude that upcoming upgrades to the LIGO observatories may provide important new insights into the physics of NSBH jets.</description>

      <title>The main jet axis of the W49B supernova remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify an axis connecting two opposite `ears' in the supernova remnant W49B and morphological signatures of three arcs around this axis that we claim are sections of full circum-jet rings. Based on recent identifications of morphological signatures of jets in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), including ejecta-rich axes, we reexamine images of W49B and identify a heavy element-rich protrusion (ear) as a jet-inflated structure. We identify the opposite ear and a clump at its tip as the signature of the opposite jets. The line connecting the two clumps at the tips of the two opposite ears forms the main jet axis of W49B. We compare the three arcs around the main jet axis in W49B to the circum-jet rings of the jets in the Cygnus A galaxy and deduce that these arcs are sections of full circum-jet rings in W49B. In W49B, the jets are long gone, as in some planetary nebulae with circum-jet rings. Identifying the main jet axis is incompatible with a type Ia supernova. It leaves two possibilities: that jets exploded W49B as a CCSN, i.e. the jittering jets explosion mechanism where the pair of jets we identify is one of many that exploded the star, or that the explosion was a common envelope jet supernova with a thermonuclear outburst, i.e., both the pair of jets and thermonuclear outburst exploded the core of a red supergiant star as a pre-existing neutron star tidally destroyed it.</description>

      <title>Irradiated Pulsar Planets and Companions as 511 keV Positron Annihilation Line Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are prolific GeV $\gamma\text{-ray}$ emitters, and nearly 80\% of Fermi-LAT MSPs reside in compact binaries. We demonstrate that the companions in these compact MSPs binaries are also 511 keV annihilation line emitters using {\tt MEGAlib} simulations (a high energy radiation transport software built with {\tt Geant4}) to compute the particle showers and resulting back splash emission from the pulsar irradiation. The 511 keV signal exhibits strong flux modulation and red/blueshifts associated with a binary orbit, enabling powerful coherent searches. Measuring the 511 keV emission would enable direct $\gamma\text{-ray}$ characterization of unusual pulsar exoplanets and companions, and allow one to identify the unambiguous presence of active pulsars whose beams do not intercept Earth. Intriguingly, the 511 keV flux is brightest for ultra-compact systems, against which pulsar surveys are systematically biased. These ultra-compact systems are also possibly prime LISA galactic sources. This necessitates future joint LISA-MeV $\gamma\text{-ray}$ techniques to characterize MSP binaries. These MSP binaries may also contribute to the puzzling source of the excess 511 keV photons near the galactic bulge and center.</description>

      <title>SRGAJ230631.0+155633: an extremely X-ray luminous, heavily obscured, radio-loud quasar at z=0.44 discovered by SRG/ART-XC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a detailed study of a luminous, heavily obscured ($N_{\rm H} \sim 2 \times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$), radio-loud quasar SRGAJ230631.0+155633, discovered in the 4--12 keV energy band by the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope aboard the SRG observatory during the first two years of its all-sky X-ray survey in 2020--2021. The object is located at $z=0.4389$ and is a type 2 AGN according to optical spectroscopy (SDSS, confirmed by DESI). We combine radio-to-X-ray data, including near-simultaneous ART-XC and Swift/XRT observations conducted in June 2023. During these follow-up observations, the source was found in a significantly fainter but still very luminous state ($L_{\rm X}=1.0^{+0.8}_{-0.3} \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, absorption corrected, 2--10 keV) compared to its discovery during the all-sky survey ($L_{\rm X}=6^{+6}_{-3}\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$), which indicates significant intrinsic variability on a rest-frame time scale of $\sim 1$ year. The radio data show a complex morphology with a core and two extended radio lobes, indicating a giant FRII radio galaxy. From multi-wavelength photometry and the black hole-bulge relation we infer a bolometric luminosity of $\sim 6\times10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and a black hole mass of $\sim1.4\times10^{9}\,M_\odot$, implying accretion at $\sim30$\% of the Eddington limit. SRGAJ230631.0+155633 proves to be one of the most luminous obscured quasars out to $z=0.5$. As such, it can serve as a valuable testbed for in-depth exploration of the physics of such objects, which were much more abundant in the younger Universe.</description>

      <title>Large Cold Dust Reservoir Revealed in Transitional SN Ib 2014C by James Webb Space Telescope Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) 2014C is a rare transitional event that exploded as a hydrogen-poor, helium-rich Type Ib SN and subsequently interacted with a hydrogen-rich circumstellar medium (CSM) a few months post-explosion. This unique interacting object provides an opportunity to probe the mass-loss history of a stripped-envelope SN progenitor. Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we observed SN 2014C with the Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer at 3477 days post-explosion (rest frame), and the Near-Infrared Spectrograph Integral Field Unit at 3568 days post-explosion, covering 1.7 to 25 $\mu$m. The bolometric luminosity indicates that the SN is still interacting with the same CSM that was observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope 40--1920 days post-explosion. JWST spectra and near-contemporaneous optical and near-infrared spectra show strong [Ne II] 12.831 $\mu$m, He 1.083 $\mu$m, H$\alpha$, and forbidden oxygen ([O I] $\lambda$$\lambda$6300, 6364, [O II] $\lambda$$\lambda$7319, 7330, and [O III] $\lambda$$\lambda$4959, 5007) emission lines with asymmetric profiles, suggesting a highly asymmetric CSM. The mid-IR continuum can be explained by ~$0.036 \ M_\odot$ of carbonaceous dust at ~300 K and ~0.043 $M_\odot$ of silicate dust at ~200 K. The observed dust mass has increased tenfold since the last Spitzer observation 4 yr ago, with evidence suggesting that new grains have condensed in the cold dense shell between the forward and reverse shocks. This dust mass places SN 2014C among the dustiest SNe in the mid-IR and supports the emerging observational trend that SN explosions produce enough dust to explain the observed dust mass at high redshifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first X-ray and radio polarimetric results of the neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) atoll-source 4U 1728-34 using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). We discovered that the X-ray source was polarized at PD = 1.9 +/- 1.0% with a polarization angle of PA = -41 +/- 16 degree. Simultaneous Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations show that the source was in a relatively hard state, marking it as the first IXPE observation of an NS atoll source in the hard state. We do not detect any significant linear polarization (LP) in the radio band, with a 3-sigma upper limit of 2% at 5.5 GHz and 1.8% at 9 GHz. Combining the radio datasets provides the deepest upper limits on the radio polarization at &lt; 1.5% on the linear and circular polarization (measured at 7.25 GHz). The X-ray polarimetric results suggest a source geometry with a Comptonization component possibly attributed to a boundary layer (BL) emission or BL emission reflected off the disk, consistent with the other NS atoll sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent report of a period in the active repeating Fast Radio Burster 20201124A and of its spindown rate place bounds on the solid angle of its emission on the basis of energetics. The bound depends on the (unknown) efficiency of conversion of rotational energy to coherent radio emission and implies a lower bound on the Lorentz factor of the radiating charges. Bursts may be emitted along the magnetic dipole axis, in repeaters aligned with the rotational axis and the line of sight but misaligned in apparent non-repeaters. This may explain the difficulty of finding periodicity in repeaters and the low duty cycle of apparent non-repeaters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05637v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I explore various scenarios for the phase transition within neutron-star matter. I do so by generating large model-agnostic ensemble using Gaussian processes, both with and without explicit inclusion of first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). The ensemble is conditioned with state-of-the-art astrophysical and theoretical inputs in a fully Bayesian approach. I study how the current data affect the posterior probability of the location and the strength of FOPT. I find that the previously observed peak structure of the sound speed remains stable against inclusion of FOPTs. While the current data cannot differentiate between a smooth crossover and a first-order phase transition, 91% of the total evidence consists of equations of state with some form of phase changes, such as FOPT occurring within or terminating the stable branch of neutron stars, or an indication of a crossover to quark matter.</description>

      <title>Investigating Turbulence Effects on Magnetic Reconnection Rates Through Three-Dimensional Resistive Magnetohydrodynamical Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of turbulence on magnetic reconnection through high-resolution 3D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations, spanning Lundquist numbers from $S=10^3$ to $10^6$. Building on Lazarian and Vishniac's (1999) theory, which asserts reconnection rate independence from Ohmic resistivity, we introduce small-scale perturbations until $t=0.1\, t_A$. Even after the perturbations cease, turbulence persists, resulting in sustained high reconnection rates of $V_\text{rec}/V_A \sim 0.03-0.08$. These rates exceed those generated by resistive tearing modes (plasmoid chain) in 2D and 3D MHD simulations by factors of 5 to 6. Our findings match observations in solar phenomena and previous 3D MHD global simulations of solar flares, accretion flows, and relativistic jets. The simulations show a steady-state fast reconnection rate compatible with the full development of turbulence in the system, demonstrating the robustness of the process in turbulent environments. We confirm reconnection rate independence from the Lundquist number, supporting Lazarian and Vishniac's theory of fast turbulent reconnection. Additionally, we find a mild dependence of $V_\text{rec}$ on the plasma-$\beta$ parameter, decreasing from 0.036 to 0.028 (in Alfv\'en units) as $\beta$ increases from 2.0 to 64.0 for simulations with a Lundquist number of $10^5$. Lastly, we explore the magnetic Prandtl number's ($\text{Pr}_m=\nu/\eta$) influence on the reconnection rate and find it negligible during the turbulent regime across the range tested, from $\text{Pr}_m=1$ to $60$.</description>

      <title>YSO Jets Magnetocentrifugally Driven by Reconnecting Atmospheric Avalanche Accretion Streams Above Inner Circumstellar Disks</title>

Abstract: Fast, collimated jets are ubiquitous features of young stellar objects (YSOs). They are generally thought to be powered by disk accretion, but the details are debated. Through 2D (axisymmetric) MHD simulations, we find that a fast ($&gt;100$~km/s) collimated bipolar jet is continuously driven along the north and south poles of the circumstellar disk that is initially magnetized by a large-scale open poloidal field and contains a thermally ionized inner magnetically active zone surrounded by a dead zone. The fast jet is primarily driven magneto-centrifugally by the release of the gravitational binding energy of the so-called ``avalanche accretion streams" near the boundary of an evacuated poloidal field-dominated polar region and a thick disk atmosphere raised by a toroidal magnetic field. Specifically, the fast outflow is driven along the upper (open) branch of the highly pinched poloidal field lines threading the (strongly magnetically braked) accretion streams where the density is relatively low so that the lightly loaded material can be accelerated magneto-centrifugally along the open field line to a high speed. The highly pinched poloidal magnetic fields threading the avalanche accretion streams tend to reconnect, enabling mass to accrete to the center without dragging along the poloidal magnetic flux with it. The reconnection provides a potential heating source for producing chondrules and calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs).</description>

      <title>Stiffening of matter in quark-hadron continuity: a mini-review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of neutron stars, combined with causality, thermodynamic stability, and nuclear constraints, indicate a rapid stiffening of QCD matter at densities slightly above nuclear saturation density ($n_0 \simeq 0.16\,{\rm fm}^{-3}$). The evolution of the stiffening is faster than expected from purely nucleonic models with many-body repulsion. Taking into account the quark substructure of baryons, we argue that the saturation of quark states occurs at $\sim$ 2-3$n_0$, driving quark matter formation even before baryonic cores of radius $\sim$0.5 fm spatially overlap. We describe the continuous transitions from hadronic to quark matter within a quarkyonic matter model in which gluons are assumed to remain confining at densities of interest. To obtain analytic insight into the transient regime, we construct an ideal model of quarkyonic matter, the {\it IdylliQ} model, in which one can freely switch from baryonic to quark descriptions and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Highly Variable Magnetic Pressure-Driven YSO Jets in the Polar Cavity from Toroidal Fields Generated by Inner Disk Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jets and outflows are commonly observed in young stellar objects (YSOs), yet their origins remain debated. Using 3D non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a circumstellar disk threaded by a large-scale open poloidal magnetic field, we identify three components in the disk-driven outflow: (1) a fast, collimated jet, (2) a less collimated, slower laminar disk wind, and (3) a magneto-rotational instability (MRI)-active turbulent disk wind that separates the former two. At high altitudes, the MRI-active wind merges with the laminar disk wind, leaving only the jet and disk wind as distinct components. The jet is powered by a novel mechanism in the star formation context: a lightly mass-loaded outflow driven by toroidal magnetic pressure in the low-density polar funnel near the system's rotation axis. A geometric analysis of the magnetic field structure confirms that magnetic tension does not contribute to the outflow acceleration, with magnetic pressure acting as the dominant driver. While the outflow in our model shares similarities with the magneto-centrifugal model-such as angular momentum extraction from the accreting disk-centrifugal forces play a negligible role in jet acceleration. In particular, the flow near the jet base does not satisfy the conditions for magneto-centrifugal wind launching. Additionally, the jet in our simulation exhibits strong spatial and temporal variability. These differences challenge the applicability of rotation-outflow velocity relations derived from steady-state, axisymmetric magneto-centrifugal jet models for estimating the jet's launching radius. For the slower disk wind, vertical motion is driven by toroidal magnetic pressure, while centrifugal forces widen the wind's opening angle.</description>

      <title>Inverting no-hair theorems: How requiring General Relativity solutions restricts scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole solutions in general scalar-tensor theories are known to permit hair, i.e. non-trivial scalar profiles and/or metric solutions different from the ones of General Relativity (GR). Imposing that some such solutions$\unicode{x2013}$e.g. Schwarzschild or de Sitter solutions motivated in the context of black hole physics or cosmology$\unicode{x2013}$should exist, the space of scalar-tensor theories is strongly restricted. Here we investigate precisely what these restrictions are within general quadratic/cubic higher-order scalar-tensor theories for stealth solutions, whose metric is given by that in GR, supporting time-dependent scalar hair with a constant kinetic term. We derive, in a fully covariant approach, the conditions under which the Euler-Lagrange equations admit all (or a specific set of) exact GR solutions, as the first step toward our understanding of a wider class of theories that admit approximately stealth solutions. Focusing on static and spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes, we study the dynamics of linear odd-parity perturbations and discuss possible deviations from GR. Importantly, we find that requiring the existence of all stealth solutions prevents any deviations from GR in the odd-parity sector. In less restrictive scenarios, in particular for theories only requiring the existence of Schwarzschild(-de Sitter) black holes, we identify allowed deviations from GR, derive the stability conditions for the odd modes, and investigate the generic deviation of a non-trivial speed of gravitational waves. All calculations performed in this paper are reproducible via companion $\texttt {Mathematica}$ notebooks.</description>

      <title>Impact of convective overshooting on the single-degenerate model of Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The single-degenerate (SD) model is one of the principal models for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). However, it faces some challenges, the primary being its inability to account for the observed SN Ia birth rate. Many studies have attempted to address this issue by expanding the parameter space, defined by the initial donor star mass and orbital period, that can lead to SNe Ia, as well as by improving binary population synthesis. While these efforts have led to significant progress, many uncertainties in stellar physics persist, which influences the outcomes of such studies. Convective overshooting, which can significantly affect the internal structure of a star and subsequently its evolution within a binary system, is one of the most significant sources of uncertainty in stellar physics. We investigate the effect of convective overshooting on the parameter space and birth rate of SNe Ia within the SD model. We employed the common-envelope wind (CEW) model, a new version of the SD model, as our progenitor model. Using MESA, we obtained the parameter space that leads to SNe Ia for three different convective overshooting parameters and calculated the corresponding SN Ia birth rate. Convective overshooting expands the upper boundaries (corresponding to a larger initial donor mass) and right boundaries (corresponding to a longer initial orbital period) of the parameter space for systems with massive white dwarfs (WDs; &gt;= 0.75Msun). However, the minimum WD mass and the parameter space for low-mass WDs - and, consequently, the calculated SN Ia birth rate - vary non-monotonically with convective overshooting parameters. The CEW model may explain the SNe Ia that interact with the circumstellar medium (CSM), i.e., SNe Ia-CSM. We find that the parameter space for SNe Ia-CSM increases with convective overshooting parameters, as does their birth rate.</description>
