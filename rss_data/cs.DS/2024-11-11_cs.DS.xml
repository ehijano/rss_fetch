      <title>Average-Distortion Sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce average-distortion sketching for metric spaces. As in (worst-case) sketching, these algorithms compress points in a metric space while approximately recovering pairwise distances. The novelty is studying average-distortion: for any fixed (yet, arbitrary) distribution $\mu$ over the metric, the sketch should not over-estimate distances, and it should (approximately) preserve the average distance with respect to draws from $\mu$. The notion generalizes average-distortion embeddings into $\ell_1$ [Rabinovich '03, Kush-Nikolov-Tang '21] as well as data-dependent locality-sensitive hashing [Andoni-Razenshteyn '15, Andoni-Naor-Nikolov-et-al. '18], which have been recently studied in the context of nearest neighbor search.
  $\bullet$ For all $p \in [1, \infty)$ and any $c$ larger than a fixed constant, we give an average-distortion sketch for $([\Delta]^d, \ell_p)$ with approximation $c$ and bit-complexity $\text{poly}(cp \cdot 2^{p/c} \cdot \log(d\Delta))$, which is provably impossible in (worst-case) sketching.
  $\bullet$ As an application, we improve on the approximation of sublinear-time data structures for nearest neighbor search over $\ell_p$ (for large $p &gt; 2$). The prior best approximation was $O(p)$ [Andoni-Naor-Nikolov-et.al '18, Kush-Nikolov-Tang '21], and we show it can be any $c$ larger than a fixed constant (irrespective of $p$) by using $n^{\text{poly}(cp \cdot 2^{p/c})}$ space.
  We give some evidence that $2^{\Omega(p/c)}$ space may be necessary by giving a lower bound on average-distortion sketches which produce a certain probabilistic certificate of farness (which our sketches crucially rely on).</description>

      <title>Monotone Submodular Multiway Partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In submodular multiway partition (SUB-MP), the input is a non-negative submodular function $f:2^V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ given by an evaluation oracle along with $k$ terminals $t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k\in V$. The goal is to find a partition $V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k$ of $V$ with $t_i\in V_i$ for every $i\in [k]$ in order to minimize $\sum_{i=1}^k f(V_i)$. In this work, we focus on SUB-MP when the input function is monotone (termed MONO-SUB-MP). MONO-SUB-MP formulates partitioning problems over several interesting structures -- e.g., matrices, matroids, graphs, and hypergraphs. MONO-SUB-MP is NP-hard since the graph multiway cut problem can be cast as a special case. We investigate the approximability of MONO-SUB-MP: we show that it admits a $4/3$-approximation and does not admit a $(10/9-\epsilon)$-approximation for every constant $\epsilon&gt;0$. Next, we study a special case of MONO-SUB-MP where the monotone submodular function of interest is the coverage function of an input graph, termed GRAPH-COVERAGE-MP. GRAPH-COVERAGE-MP is equivalent to the classic multiway cut problem for the purposes of exact optimization. We show that GRAPH-COVERAGE-MP admits a $1.125$-approximation and does not admit a $(1.00074-\epsilon)$-approximation for every constant $\epsilon&gt;0$ assuming the Unique Games Conjecture. These results separate GRAPH-COVERAGE-MP from graph multiway cut in terms of approximability.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Dimension Reduction for Facility Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oblivious dimension reduction, \`{a} la the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) Lemma, is a fundamental approach for processing high-dimensional data. We study this approach for Uniform Facility Location (UFL) on a Euclidean input $X\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, where facilities can lie in the ambient space (not restricted to $X$). Our main result is that target dimension $m=\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2}\mathrm{ddim})$ suffices to $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate the optimal value of UFL on inputs whose doubling dimension is bounded by $\mathrm{ddim}$. It significantly improves over previous results, that could only achieve $O(1)$-approximation [Narayanan, Silwal, Indyk, and Zamir, ICML 2021] or dimension $m=O(\epsilon^{-2}\log n)$ for $n=|X|$, which follows from [Makarychev, Makarychev, and Razenshteyn, STOC 2019].
  Our oblivious dimension reduction has immediate implications to streaming and offline algorithms, by employing known algorithms for low dimension. In dynamic geometric streams, it implies a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm that uses $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log n)^{\tilde{O}(\mathrm{ddim}/\epsilon^{2})}$ bits of space, which is the first streaming algorithm for UFL to utilize the doubling dimension. In the offline setting, it implies a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, which we further refine to run in time $( (1/\epsilon)^{\tilde{O}(\mathrm{ddim})} d + 2^{(1/\epsilon)^{\tilde{O}(\mathrm{ddim})}}) \cdot \tilde{O}(n) $. Prior work has a similar running time but requires some restriction on the facilities [Cohen-Addad, Feldmann and Saulpic, JACM 2021].
  Our main technical contribution is a fast procedure to decompose an input $X$ into several $k$-median instances for small $k$. This decomposition is inspired by, but has several significant differences from [Czumaj, Lammersen, Monemizadeh and Sohler, SODA 2013], and is key to both our dimension reduction and our PTAS.</description>

      <title>Recursive and iterative approaches to generate rotation Gray codes for stamp foldings and semi-meanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first present a simple recursive algorithm that generates cyclic rotation Gray codes for stamp foldings and semi-meanders, where consecutive strings differ by a stamp rotation. These are the first known Gray codes for stamp foldings and semi-meanders, and we thus solve an open problem posted by Sawada and Li in [Electron. J. Comb. 19(2), 2012]. We then introduce an iterative algorithm that generates the same rotation Gray codes for stamp foldings and semi-meanders. Both the recursive and iterative algorithms generate stamp foldings and semi-meanders in constant amortized time and $O(n)$-amortized time per string respectively, using a linear amount of memory.</description>

      <title>Separating Coverage and Submodular: Maximization Subject to a Cardinality Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two classic problems: maximum coverage and monotone submodular maximization subject to a cardinality constraint. [Nemhauser--Wolsey--Fisher '78] proved that the greedy algorithm provides an approximation of $1-1/e$ for both problems, and it is known that this guarantee is tight ([Nemhauser--Wolsey '78; Feige '98]). Thus, one would naturally assume that everything is resolved when considering the approximation guarantees of these two problems, as both exhibit the same tight approximation and hardness.
  In this work we show that this is not the case, and study both problems when the cardinality constraint is a constant fraction $c \in (0,1]$ of the ground set. We prove that monotone submodular maximization subject to a cardinality constraint admits an approximation of $1-(1-c)^{1/c}$; This approximation equals $1$ when $c=1$ and it gracefully degrades to $1-1/e$ when $c$ approaches $0$. Moreover, for every $c=1/s$ (for any integer $s \in \mathbb{N}$) we present a matching hardness.
  Surprisingly, for $c=1/2$ we prove that Maximum Coverage admits an approximation of $0.7533$, thus separating the two problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first known example of a well-studied maximization problem for which coverage and monotone submodular objectives exhibit a different best possible approximation.</description>

      <title>On Differentially Private String Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a database of bit strings $A_1,\ldots,A_m\in \{0,1\}^n$, a fundamental data structure task is to estimate the distances between a given query $B\in \{0,1\}^n$ with all the strings in the database. In addition, one might further want to ensure the integrity of the database by releasing these distance statistics in a secure manner. In this work, we propose differentially private (DP) data structures for this type of tasks, with a focus on Hamming and edit distance. On top of the strong privacy guarantees, our data structures are also time- and space-efficient. In particular, our data structure is $\epsilon$-DP against any sequence of queries of arbitrary length, and for any query $B$ such that the maximum distance to any string in the database is at most $k$, we output $m$ distance estimates. Moreover,
  - For Hamming distance, our data structure answers any query in $\widetilde O(mk+n)$ time and each estimate deviates from the true distance by at most $\widetilde O(k/e^{\epsilon/\log k})$;
  - For edit distance, our data structure answers any query in $\widetilde O(mk^2+n)$ time and each estimate deviates from the true distance by at most $\widetilde O(k/e^{\epsilon/(\log k \log n)})$.
  For moderate $k$, both data structures support sublinear query operations. We obtain these results via a novel adaptation of the randomized response technique as a bit flipping procedure, applied to the sketched strings.</description>

      <title>On the cohesion and separability of average-link for hierarchical agglomerative clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Average-link is widely recognized as one of the most popular and effective methods for building hierarchical agglomerative clustering. The available theoretical analyses show that this method has a much better approximation than other popular heuristics, as single-linkage and complete-linkage, regarding variants of Dasgupta's cost function [STOC 2016]. However, these analyses do not separate average-link from a random hierarchy and they are not appealing for metric spaces since every hierarchical clustering has a 1/2 approximation with regard to the variant of Dasgupta's function that is employed for dissimilarity measures [Moseley and Yang 2020]. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the performance of average-link in metric spaces, regarding several natural criteria that capture separability and cohesion and are more interpretable than Dasgupta's cost function and its variants. We also present experimental results with real datasets that, together with our theoretical analyses, suggest that average-link is a better choice than other related methods when both cohesion and separability are important goals.</description>

      <title>Fairness in Monotone $k$-submodular Maximization: Algorithms and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Submodular optimization has become increasingly prominent in machine learning and fairness has drawn much attention. In this paper, we propose to study the fair $k$-submodular maximization problem and develop a $\frac{1}{3}$-approximation greedy algorithm with a running time of $\mathcal{O}(knB)$. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to incorporate fairness in the context of $k$-submodular maximization, and our theoretical guarantee matches the best-known $k$-submodular maximization results without fairness constraints. In addition, we have developed a faster threshold-based algorithm that achieves a $(\frac{1}{3} - \epsilon)$ approximation with $\mathcal{O}(\frac{kn}{\epsilon} \log \frac{B}{\epsilon})$ evaluations of the function $f$. Furthermore, for both algorithms, we provide approximation guarantees when the $k$-submodular function is not accessible but only can be approximately accessed. We have extensively validated our theoretical findings through empirical research and examined the practical implications of fairness. Specifically, we have addressed the question: ``What is the price of fairness?" through case studies on influence maximization with $k$ topics and sensor placement with $k$ types. The experimental results show that the fairness constraints do not significantly undermine the quality of solutions.</description>

      <title>Unstructured Adiabatic Quantum Optimization: Optimality with Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the circuit model of quantum computing, amplitude amplification techniques can be used to find solutions to NP-hard problems defined on $n$-bits in time $\text{poly}(n) 2^{n/2}$. In this work, we investigate whether such general statements can be made for adiabatic quantum optimization, as provable results regarding its performance are mostly unknown. Although a lower bound of $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ has existed in such a setting for over a decade, a purely adiabatic algorithm with this running time has been absent. We show that adiabatic quantum optimization using an unstructured search approach results in a running time that matches this lower bound (up to a polylogarithmic factor) for a broad class of classical local spin Hamiltonians. For this, it is necessary to bound the spectral gap throughout the adiabatic evolution and compute beforehand the position of the avoided crossing with sufficient precision so as to adapt the adiabatic schedule accordingly. However, we show that the position of the avoided crossing is approximately given by a quantity that depends on the degeneracies and inverse gaps of the problem Hamiltonian and is NP-hard to compute even within a low additive precision. Furthermore, computing it exactly (or nearly exactly) is \#P-hard. Our work indicates a possible limitation of adiabatic quantum optimization algorithms, leaving open the question of whether provable Grover-like speed-ups can be obtained for any optimization problem using this approach.</description>

      <title>Polynomial kernels for edge modification problems towards block and strictly chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.13140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider edge modification problems towards block and strictly chordal graphs, where one is given an undirected graph $G = (V,E)$ and an integer $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and seeks to edit (add or delete) at most $k$ edges from $G$ to obtain a block graph or a strictly chordal graph. The completion and deletion variants of these problems are defined similarly by only allowing edge additions for the former and only edge deletions for the latter. Block graphs are a well-studied class of graphs and admit several characterizations, e.g. they are diamond-free chordal graphs. Strictly chordal graphs, also referred to as block duplicate graphs, are a natural generalization of block graphs where one can add true twins of cut-vertices. Strictly chordal graphs are exactly dart and gem-free chordal graphs. We prove the NP-completeness for most variants of these problems and provide $O(k^2)$ vertex-kernels for Block Graph Edition and Block Graph Deletion, $O(k^3)$ vertex-kernels for Strictly Chordal Completion and Strictly Chordal Deletion and a $O(k^4)$ vertex-kernel for Strictly Chordal Edition.</description>

      <title>Query Complexity of the Metric Steiner Tree Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the query complexity of the metric Steiner Tree problem, where we are given an $n \times n$ metric on a set $V$ of vertices along with a set $T \subseteq V$ of $k$ terminals, and the goal is to find a tree of minimum cost that contains all terminals in $T$. The query complexity for the related minimum spanning tree (MST) problem is well-understood: for any fixed $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, one can estimate the MST cost to within a $(1+\varepsilon)$-factor using only $\tilde{O}(n)$ queries, and this is known to be tight. This implies that a $(2 + \varepsilon)$-approximate estimate of Steiner Tree cost can be obtained with $\tilde{O}(k)$ queries by simply applying the MST cost estimation algorithm on the metric induced by the terminals.
  Our first result shows that any (randomized) algorithm that estimates the Steiner Tree cost to within a $(5/3 - \varepsilon)$-factor requires $\Omega(n^2)$ queries, even if $k$ is a constant. This lower bound is in sharp contrast to an upper bound of $O(nk)$ queries for computing a $(5/3)$-approximate Steiner Tree, which follows from previous work by Du and Zelikovsky.
  Our second main result, and the main technical contribution of this work, is a sublinear query algorithm for estimating the Steiner Tree cost to within a strictly better-than-$2$ factor, with query complexity $\tilde{O}(n^{12/7} + n^{6/7}\cdot k)=\tilde{O}(n^{13/7})=o(n^2)$. We complement this result by showing an $\tilde{\Omega}(n + k^{6/5})$ query lower bound for any algorithm that estimates Steiner Tree cost to a strictly better than $2$ factor. Thus $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{6/5})$ queries are needed to just beat $2$-approximation when $k = \Omega(n)$; a sharp contrast to MST cost estimation where a $(1+o(1))$-approximate estimate of cost is achievable with only $\tilde{O}(n)$ queries.</description>

      <title>Online Conversion with Switching Costs: Robust and Learning-Augmented Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study online conversion with switching costs, a family of online problems that capture emerging problems at the intersection of energy and sustainability. In this problem, an online player attempts to purchase (alternatively, sell) fractional shares of an asset during a fixed time horizon with length $T$. At each time step, a cost function (alternatively, price function) is revealed, and the player must irrevocably decide an amount of asset to convert. The player also incurs a switching cost whenever their decision changes in consecutive time steps, i.e., when they increase or decrease their purchasing amount. We introduce competitive (robust) threshold-based algorithms for both the minimization and maximization variants of this problem, and show they are optimal among deterministic online algorithms. We then propose learning-augmented algorithms that take advantage of untrusted black-box advice (such as predictions from a machine learning model) to achieve significantly better average-case performance without sacrificing worst-case competitive guarantees. Finally, we empirically evaluate our proposed algorithms using a carbon-aware EV charging case study, showing that our algorithms substantially improve on baseline methods for this problem.</description>

Abstract: Big data, encompassing extensive datasets, has seen rapid expansion, notably with a considerable portion being textual data, including strings and texts. Simple compression methods and standard data structures prove inadequate for processing these datasets, as they require decompression for usage or consume extensive memory resources. Consequently, this motivation has led to the development of compressed data structures that support various queries for a given string, typically operating in polylogarithmic time and utilizing compressed space proportional to the string's length. Notably, the suffix array (SA) query is a critical component in implementing a suffix tree, which has a broad spectrum of applications.
  A line of research has been conducted on (especially, static) compressed data structures that support the SA query. A common finding from most of the studies is the suboptimal space efficiency of existing compressed data structures. Kociumaka, Navarro, and Prezza [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2023] have made a significant contribution by introducing an asymptotically minimal space requirement, $O\left(\delta \log\frac{n\log\sigma}{\delta\log n} \log n \right)$ bits ($\delta$-optimal space), sufficient to represent any string of length $n$, with an alphabet size of $\sigma$, and substring complexity $\delta$, serving as a measure of repetitiveness. More recently, Kempa and Kociumaka [FOCS 2023] presented $\delta$-SA, a compressed data structure supporting SA queries in $\delta$-optimal space. However, the data structures introduced thus far are static.
  We present the first dynamic compressed data structure that supports the SA query and update in polylogarithmic time and $\delta$-optimal space. More precisely, it can answer SA queries and perform updates in $O(\log^7 n)$ and expected $O(\log^8 n)$ time, respectively, using an expected $\delta$-optimal space.</description>

      <title>Learning in Stackelberg Games with Non-myopic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Stackelberg games where a principal repeatedly interacts with a non-myopic long-lived agent, without knowing the agent's payoff function. Although learning in Stackelberg games is well-understood when the agent is myopic, dealing with non-myopic agents poses additional complications. In particular, non-myopic agents may strategize and select actions that are inferior in the present in order to mislead the principal's learning algorithm and obtain better outcomes in the future.
  We provide a general framework that reduces learning in presence of non-myopic agents to robust bandit optimization in the presence of myopic agents. Through the design and analysis of minimally reactive bandit algorithms, our reduction trades off the statistical efficiency of the principal's learning algorithm against its effectiveness in inducing near-best-responses. We apply this framework to Stackelberg security games (SSGs), pricing with unknown demand curve, general finite Stackelberg games, and strategic classification. In each setting, we characterize the type and impact of misspecifications present in near-best responses and develop a learning algorithm robust to such misspecifications.
  On the way, we improve the state-of-the-art query complexity of learning in SSGs with $n$ targets from $O(n^3)$ to a near-optimal $\widetilde{O}(n)$ by uncovering a fundamental structural property of these games. The latter result is of independent interest beyond learning with non-myopic agents.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Algorithms for Graph Cuts: A Shifting Mechanism Approach and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06911v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of differential privacy in the context of graph cuts, specifically focusing on the multiway cut and the minimum $k$-cut. We introduce edge-differentially private algorithms that achieve nearly optimal performance for these problems. Motivated by multiway cut, we propose the shifting mechanism, a general framework for private combinatorial optimization problems. This framework allows us to develop an efficient private algorithm with a multiplicative approximation ratio that matches the state-of-the-art non-private algorithm, improving over previous private algorithms that have provably worse multiplicative loss. We then provide a tight information-theoretic lower bound on the additive error, demonstrating that for constant $k$, our algorithm is optimal in terms of the privacy cost. The shifting mechanism also allows us to design private algorithm for the multicut and max-cut problems, with runtimes determined by the best non-private algorithms for these tasks. For the minimum $k$-cut problem we use a different approach, combining the exponential mechanism with bounds on the number of approximate $k$-cuts to get the first private algorithm with optimal additive error of $O(k\log n)$ (for a fixed privacy parameter). We also establish an information-theoretic lower bound that matches this additive error. Furthermore, we provide an efficient private algorithm even for non-constant $k$, including a polynomial-time 2-approximation with an additive error of $\tilde{O}(k^{1.5})$.</description>

      <title>Error Interference in Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding algorithmic error accumulation in quantum simulation is crucial due to its fundamental significance and practical applications in simulating quantum many-body system dynamics. Conventional theories typically apply the triangle inequality to provide an upper bound for the error. However, these often yield overly conservative and inaccurate estimates as they neglect error interference -- a phenomenon where errors in different segments can destructively interfere. Here, we introduce a novel method that directly estimates the long-time algorithmic errors with multiple segments, thereby establishing a comprehensive framework for characterizing algorithmic error interference. We identify the sufficient and necessary condition for strict error interference and introduce the concept of approximate error interference, which is more broadly applicable to scenarios such as power-law interaction models, the Fermi-Hubbard model, and higher-order Trotter formulas. Our work demonstrates significant improvements over prior ones and opens new avenues for error analysis in quantum simulation, offering potential advancements in both theoretical algorithm design and experimental implementation of Hamiltonian simulation.</description>

      <title>Six Candidates Suffice to Win a Voter Majority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cornerstone of social choice theory is Condorcet's paradox which says that in an election where $n$ voters rank $m$ candidates it is possible that, no matter which candidate is declared the winner, a majority of voters would have preferred an alternative candidate. Instead, can we always choose a small committee of winning candidates that is preferred to any alternative candidate by a majority of voters?
  Elkind, Lang, and Saffidine raised this question and called such a committee a Condorcet winning set. They showed that winning sets of size $2$ may not exist, but sets of size logarithmic in the number of candidates always do. In this work, we show that Condorcet winning sets of size $6$ always exist, regardless of the number of candidates or the number of voters. More generally, we show that if $\frac{\alpha}{1 - \ln \alpha} \geq \frac{2}{k + 1}$, then there always exists a committee of size $k$ such that less than an $\alpha$ fraction of the voters prefer an alternate candidate. These are the first nontrivial positive results that apply for all $k \geq 2$.
  Our proof uses the probabilistic method and the minimax theorem, inspired by recent work on approximately stable committee selection. We construct a distribution over committees that performs sufficiently well (when compared against any candidate on any small subset of the voters) so that this distribution must contain a committee with the desired property in its support.</description>

      <title>$k$NN Attention Demystified: A Theoretical Exploration for Scalable Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their power, Transformers face challenges with long sequences due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address this limitation, methods like $k$-Nearest-Neighbor ($k$NN) attention have been introduced [Roy, Saffar, Vaswani, Grangier, 2021] enabling each token to attend to only its $k$ closest tokens. While $k$NN attention has shown empirical success in making Transformers more efficient, its exact approximation guarantees have not been theoretically analyzed. In this work, we establish a theoretical framework for $k$NN attention, reformulating self-attention as expectations over softmax distributions and leveraging lazy Gumbel sampling [Mussmann, Levy, Ermon, 2017] with $k$NN indices for efficient approximation. Building on this framework, we also propose novel sub-quadratic algorithms that approximate self-attention gradients by leveraging efficient sampling techniques, such as Markov Chain-based estimation. Finally, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of these algorithms through empirical experiments, showcasing their benefits in both training and inference.</description>
