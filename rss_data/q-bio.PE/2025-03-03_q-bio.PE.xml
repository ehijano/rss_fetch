      <title>Innovation-exnovation dynamics on trees and trusses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Innovation and its complement exnovation describe the progression of realized possibilities from the past to the future, and the process depends on the structure of the underlying graph. For example, the phylogenetic tree represents the unique path of mutations to a single species. To a technology, paths are manifold, like a "truss." We solve for the phase diagram of a model, where a population innovates while outrunning exnovation. The dynamics progress on random graphs that capture the degree of historical contingency. Higher connectivity speeds innovation but also increases the risk of system collapse. We show how dynamics and structural connectivity conspire to unleash innovative diversity or to drive it extinct.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamics at the back of a gene drive propagation wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene drive alleles bias their own inheritance to offspring. They can fix in a wild-type population in spite of a fitness cost, and even lead to the eradication of the target population if the fitness cost is high. However, this outcome may be prevented or delayed if areas previously cleared by the drive are recolonised by wild-type individuals. Here, we investigate the conditions under which these stochastic wild-type recolonisation events are likely and when they are unlikely to occur in one spatial dimension. More precisely, we examine the conditions ensuring that the last individual carrying a wild-type allele is surrounded by a large enough number of drive homozygous individuals, resulting in a very low chance of wild-type recolonisation. To do so, we make a deterministic approximation of the distribution of drive alleles within the wave, and we split the distribution of wild-type alleles into a deterministic part and a stochastic part. Our analytical and numerical results suggest that the probability of wild-type recolonisation events increases with lower fitness of drive individuals, with smaller migration rate, and also with smaller local carrying capacity. Numerical simulations show that these results extend to two spatial dimensions. We also demonstrate that, if a wild-type recolonisation event were to occur, the probability of a following drive reinvasion event decreases with smaller values of the intrinsic growth rate of the population. Overall, our study paves the way for further analysis of wild-type recolonisation at the back of eradication traveling waves.</description>

      <title>Response of social norms to individual differences in error-proneness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indirect reciprocity explains the evolution of cooperation by considering how our cooperative behavior toward someone is reciprocated by someone else who has observed us. A cohesive society has a shared norm that prescribes how to assess observed behavior as well as how to behave toward others based on the assessments, and the eight social norms that are evolutionarily stable against the invasion of mutants with different behavioral rules are referred to as the leading eight, whose member norms are called L1 to L8, respectively. Among the leading eight, L8 (also known as `Judging') has been deemed mostly irrelevant due to its poor performance in maintaining cooperation when each person may have a different opinion about someone instead of forming a public consensus. In this work, we propose that L8 can nevertheless be best protected from assessment errors among the leading eight if we take into account the intrinsic heterogeneity of error proneness among individuals because this norm heavily punishes those who are prone to errors in following its assessment rule. This finding suggests that individual differences should be explicitly taken into account as quenched randomness to obtain a thorough understanding of a social norm working in a heterogeneous environment.</description>

      <title>A data augmentation strategy for deep neural networks with application to epidemic modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we integrate the predictive capabilities of compartmental disease dynamics models with machine learning ability to analyze complex, high-dimensional data and uncover patterns that conventional models may overlook. Specifically, we present a proof of concept demonstrating the application of data-driven methods and deep neural networks to a recently introduced SIR-type model with social features, including a saturated incidence rate, to improve epidemic prediction and forecasting. Our results show that a robust data augmentation strategy trough suitable data-driven models can improve the reliability of Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNNs) and Nonlinear Autoregressive Networks (NARs), making them viable alternatives to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This approach enhances the ability to handle nonlinear dynamics and offers scalable, data-driven solutions for epidemic forecasting, prioritizing predictive accuracy over the constraints of physics-based models. Numerical simulations of the post-lockdown phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy and Spain validate our methodology.</description>

      <title>An introduction to statistical models used to characterize species-habitat associations with animal movement data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding species-habitat associations is fundamental to ecological sciences and for species conservation. Consequently, various statistical approaches have been designed to infer species-habitat associations. Due to their conceptual and mathematical differences, these methods can yield contrasting results. We describe and compare commonly used statistical models that relate animal movement data to environmental data, including resource selection functions (RSF), step-selection functions (SSF), and hidden Markov models (HMMs). We demonstrate differences in assumptions and highlighting advantages and limitations of each method. Additionally, we provide guidance on selecting the most appropriate statistical method based on the scale of the data and intended inference. To illustrate the varying ecological insights derived from each model, we apply them to the movement track of a single ringed seal in a case study. We demonstrate that each model yields varying ecological insights. For example, while the selection coefficient values from RSFs appear to show a stronger positive relationship with prey diversity than those of the SSFs, when we accounted for the autocorrelation in the data none of these relationships with prey diversity were statistically significant. The HMM reveals variable associations with prey diversity across different behaviors. Notably, the three models identified different important areas. This case study highlights the critical significance of selecting the appropriate model as an essential step in the process of identifying species-habitat relationships and specific areas of importance. Our review provides the foundational information required for making informed decisions when choosing the most suitable statistical methods to address specific questions, such as identifying protected zones, understanding movement patterns, or studying behaviours.</description>
