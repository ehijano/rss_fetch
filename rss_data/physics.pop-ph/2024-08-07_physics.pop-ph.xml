      <title>Could a gravity inversion exist within the Hollow Earth of Legendary's Monsterverse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most popular movie franchises of late is Legendary's Monsterverse as is evidenced by the gross earnings of the series recently surpassing the two and a half billion dollar mark with the release of $\it{Godzilla X Kong}$. As is typical with many movies of this genre, in order to enjoy them one must suspend their disbelief when it comes to the laws of physics. While there are a plethora of examples of violations of basic principles (the square-cube law being the prime example) the idea of a "gravity inversion" occurring inside of the "Hollow Earth" is among the most debated as well as the most relevant to the storylines of the recent movies. The intent of this paper is to show that, while typical scientific arguments refuting the possibility of such an inversion are definitely completely correct, a slight modification of the conditions assumed to exist inside the planet in these arguments may allow for the inversion to actually occur.</description>

      <title>On the links between Astronomy, Astronomers, and Science Fiction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Science Fiction is using astronomy to offer to the public blockbusters at the movies (e.g. Interstellar), series or movies in streaming media (Don't Look Up, The Expanse), many books from classic authors (I. Asimov, A.C. Clarke) or more modern ones (K.S. Robinson), comics (the adventures of Valerian and Laureline), or video games (Mass Effect, No Man's sky) that have a very large cumulated audience. Astronomers can use Science Fiction to illustrate physics or astronomical facts. It might be a good way to talk about our work, our methods, by comparing them to examples with which a large audience is familiar. A few examples are provided in this contribution. In a recent study (Stanwey, 2022), it was shown that 93 percent of British professional astronomers have an interest for Science Fiction, and 69 percent consider that Science Fiction influenced their career or life choice. I am presenting a similar study made for French astronomers, performed during and just after the 2024 French astronomer meeting (Journees de la SF2A).</description>

      <title>The possibility of panspermia in the deep cosmos by means of the planetary dust grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By obtaining the assumption that planetary dust particles can escape from the gravitational attraction of a planet, we consider the possibility for the dust grains to leave the star's system by means of the radiation pressure. By taking the typical dust parameters into account, we consider their dynamics and show that they can reach the deep cosmos, taking part in panspermia. It has been shown that, during $5$ billion years, the dust grains will reach $10^5$ stellar systems, and by taking the Drake equation into account, it has been shown that the whole galaxy will be full of planetary dust particles.</description>
