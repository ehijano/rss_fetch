      <title>Parameterized Algorithms for Matching Integer Programs with Additional Rows and Columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study integer linear programs (ILP) of the form $\min\{c^\top x\ \vert\ Ax=b,l\le x\le u,x\in\mathbb Z^n\}$ and analyze their parameterized complexity with respect to their distance to the generalized matching problem--following the well-established approach of capturing the hardness of a problem by the distance to triviality. The generalized matching problem is an ILP where each column of the constraint matrix has $1$-norm of at most $2$. It captures several well-known polynomial time solvable problems such as matching and flow problems. We parameterize by the size of variable and constraint backdoors, which measure the least number of columns or rows that must be deleted to obtain a generalized matching ILP.
  We present the following results: (i) a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm for ILPs parameterized by the size $p$ of a minimum variable backdoor to generalized matching; (ii) a randomized slice-wise polynomial (XP) time algorithm for ILPs parameterized by the size $h$ of a minimum constraint backdoor to generalized matching as long as $c$ and $A$ are encoded in unary; (iii) we complement (ii) by proving that solving an ILP is W[1]-hard when parameterized by $h$ even when $c,A,l,u$ have coefficients of constant size. To obtain (i), we prove a variant of lattice-convexity of the degree sequences of weighted $b$-matchings, which we study in the light of SBO jump M-convex functions. This allows us to model the matching part as a polyhedral constraint on the integer backdoor variables. The resulting ILP is solved in FPT time using an integer programming algorithm. For (ii), the randomized XP time algorithm is obtained by pseudo-polynomially reducing the problem to the exact matching problem. To prevent an exponential blowup in terms of the encoding length of $b$, we bound the Graver complexity of the constraint matrix and employ a Graver augmentation local search framework.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Logic Programs: Non-Ground and Counting Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a prominent problem-modeling and solving framework, whose solutions are called answer sets. Epistemic logic programs (ELP) extend ASP to reason about all or some answer sets. Solutions to an ELP can be seen as consequences over multiple collections of answer sets, known as world views. While the complexity of propositional programs is well studied, the non-ground case remains open. This paper establishes the complexity of non-ground ELPs. We provide a comprehensive picture for well-known program fragments, which turns out to be complete for the class NEXPTIME with access to oracles up to \Sigma^P_2. In the quantitative setting, we establish complexity results for counting complexity beyond #EXP. To mitigate high complexity, we establish results in case of bounded predicate arity, reaching up to the fourth level of the polynomial hierarchy. Finally, we provide ETH-tight runtime results for the parameter treewidth, which has applications in quantitative reasoning, where we reason on (marginal) probabilities of epistemic literals.</description>

      <title>Quasi-linear time decoding of RS and AG codes for burst errors up to the Singleton bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite of tremendous research on decoding Reed-Solomon (RS) and algebraic geometry (AG) codes under the random and adversary substitution error models, few studies have explored these codes under the burst substitution error model. Burst errors are prevalent in many communication channels, such as wireless networks, magnetic recording systems, and flash memory. Compared to random and adversarial errors, burst errors often allow for the design of more efficient decoding algorithms. However, achieving both an optimal decoding radius and quasi-linear time complexity for burst error correction remains a significant challenge. The goal of this paper is to design (both list and probabilistic unique) decoding algorithms for RS and AG codes that achieve the Singleton bound for decoding radius while maintaining quasi-linear time complexity.
  Our idea is to build a one-to-one correspondence between AG codes (including RS codes) and interleaved RS codes with shorter code lengths (or even constant lengths). By decoding the interleaved RS codes with burst errors, we derive efficient decoding algorithms for RS and AG codes. For decoding interleaved RS codes with shorter code lengths, we can employ either the naive methods or existing algorithms. This one-to-one correspondence is constructed using the generalized fast Fourier transform (G-FFT) proposed by Li and Xing (SODA 2024). The G-FFT generalizes the divide-and-conquer technique from polynomials to algebraic function fields. More precisely speaking, assume that our AG code is defined over a function field $E$ which has a sequence of subfields $\mathbb{F}_q(x)=E_r\subseteq E_{r-1}\subseteq \cdots\subset E_1\subseteq E_0=E$ such that $E_{i-1}/E_i$ are Galois extensions for $1\le i\le r$. Then the AG code based on $E$ can be transformed into an interleaved RS code over the rational function field $\mathbb{F}_q(x)$.</description>

      <title>On the Parameterized Complexity of Odd Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A proper vertex coloring of a connected graph $G$ is called an odd coloring if, for every vertex $v$ in $G$, there exists a color that appears odd number of times in the open neighborhood of $v$. The minimum number of colors required to obtain an odd coloring of $G$ is called the \emph{odd chromatic number} of $G$, denoted by $\chi_{o}(G)$. Determining $\chi_o(G)$ known to be ${\sf NP}$-hard. Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, the \odc{} problem is to decide whether $\chi_o(G)$ is at most $k$. In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of the problem, particularly with respect to structural graph parameters. We obtain the following results: \begin{itemize}
  \item We prove that the problem admits a polynomial kernel when parameterized by the distance to clique.
  \item We show that the problem cannot have a polynomial kernel when parameterized by the vertex cover number unless ${\sf NP} \subseteq {\sf Co {\text -} NP/poly}$.
  \item We show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by distance to cluster, distance to co-cluster, or neighborhood diversity.
  \item We show that the problem is ${\sf W[1]}$-hard parameterized by clique-width. \end{itemize}
  Finally, we study the complexity of the problem on restricted graph classes. We show that it can be solved in polynomial time on cographs and split graphs but remains NP-complete on certain subclasses of bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Word problems and embedding-obstructions in cellular automata groups on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study groups of reversible cellular automata, or CA groups, on groups. More generally, we consider automorphism groups of subshifts of finite type on groups. It is known that word problems of CA groups on virtually nilpotent groups are in co-NP, and can be co-NP-hard. We show that under the Gap Conjecture of Grigorchuk, their word problems are PSPACE-hard on all other groups. On free and surface groups, we show that they are indeed always in PSPACE. On a group with co-NEXPTIME word problem, CA groups themselves have co-NEXPTIME word problem, and on the lamplighter group (which itself has polynomial-time word problem) we show they can be co-NEXPTIME-hard. We show also two nonembeddability results: the group of cellular automata on a non-cyclic free group does not embed in the group of cellular automata on the integers (this solves a question of Barbieri, Carrasco-Vargas and Rivera-Burgos); and the group of cellular automata in dimension $D$ does not embed in a group of cellular automata in dimension $d$ if $D \geq 3d+2$ (this solves a question of Hochman).</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant compiling of classically hard IQP circuits on hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing computationally complex quantum circuits in the presence of noise and imperfections is a challenging task. While fault-tolerant quantum computing provides a route to reducing noise, it requires a large overhead for generic algorithms. Here, we develop and analyze a hardware-efficient, fault-tolerant approach to realizing complex sampling circuits. We co-design the circuits with the appropriate quantum error correcting codes for efficient implementation in a reconfigurable neutral atom array architecture, constituting what we call a fault-tolerant compilation of the sampling algorithm. Specifically, we consider a family of $[[2^D , D, 2]]$ quantum error detecting codes whose transversal and permutation gate set can realize arbitrary degree-$D$ instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits. Using native operations of the code and the atom array hardware, we compile a fault-tolerant and fast-scrambling family of such IQP circuits in a hypercube geometry, realized recently in the experiments by Bluvstein et al. [Nature 626, 7997 (2024)]. We develop a theory of second-moment properties of degree-$D$ IQP circuits for analyzing hardness and verification of random sampling by mapping to a statistical mechanics model. We provide evidence that sampling from hypercube IQP circuits is classically hard to simulate and analyze the linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB) in comparison to the average fidelity. To realize a fully scalable approach, we first show that Bell sampling from degree-$4$ IQP circuits is classically intractable and can be efficiently validated. We further devise new families of $[[O(d^D),D,d]]$ color codes of increasing distance $d$, permitting exponential error suppression for transversal IQP sampling. Our results highlight fault-tolerant compiling as a powerful tool in co-designing algorithms with specific error-correcting codes and realistic hardware.</description>

      <title>The Structural Complexity of Matrix-Vector Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of preprocessing an $n\times n$ matrix M, and supporting queries that, for any vector v, returns the matrix-vector product Mv. This problem has been extensively studied in both theory and practice: on one side, practitioners have developed algorithms that are highly efficient in practice, whereas theoreticians have proven that the problem cannot be solved faster than naive multiplication in the worst-case. This lower bound holds even in the average-case, implying that existing average-case analyses cannot explain this gap between theory and practice. Therefore, we study the problem for structured matrices. We show that for $n\times n$ matrices of VC-dimension d, the matrix-vector multiplication problem can be solved with $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ preprocessing and $\tilde O(n^{2-1/d})$ query time. Given the low constant VC-dimensions observed in most real-world data, our results posit an explanation for why the problem can be solved so much faster in practice. Moreover, our bounds hold even if the matrix does not have a low VC-dimension, but is obtained by (possibly adversarially) corrupting at most a subquadratic number of entries of any unknown low VC-dimension matrix. Our results yield the first non-trivial upper bounds for many applications. In previous works, the online matrix-vector hypothesis (conjecturing that quadratic time is needed per query) was used to prove many conditional lower bounds, showing that it is impossible to compute and maintain high-accuracy estimates for shortest paths, Laplacian solvers, effective resistance, and triangle detection in graphs subject to node insertions and deletions in subquadratic time. Yet, via a reduction to our matrix-vector-multiplication result, we show we can maintain the aforementioned problems efficiently if the input is structured, providing the first subquadratic upper bounds in the high-accuracy regime.</description>
