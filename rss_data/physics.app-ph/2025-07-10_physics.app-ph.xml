      <title>Toward All 2D-based Printed Raindrop Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The raindrop triboelectric nanogenerator (RD-TENG) is an emerging technology that is designed to harvest energy from raindrops. This application requires materials with negative triboelectric effect, high surface charge density, mechanical flexibility, and a large surface area, which are key characteristics of 2D materials. However, fundamental research is necessary to understand the potential of 2D materials in this context. This study introduces all-2D-based RD-TENG devices using graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanosheets. Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) and liquid cascade centrifugation are used for nanosheet preparation and size selection. The TENGs are fabricated through a rapid, low-cost solution deposition technique based on liquid-liquid interface deposition, which allows screening of different active films and device geometries. Among the tested layered materials, medium-sized molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets (average lateral size~160 nm, volume-fraction weighted average layer number ~9) exhibit the highest short-circuit current (microampere per drop) and voltage (mV per drop) output due to their most suited electron affinity, capacitance, and surface charge exchange properties. The variations in the performance of the TMD films were further evaluated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), showing the influence of oxidation differences on charge transfer and charge decay time.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of TFTs 3D Monolithically Integrated on GaN HEMTs using Cascode Configuration with High Breakdown Voltage (&gt;1900V)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates 3D monolithic integration of amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) on Gallium Nitride (GaN) high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) in a cascode configuration, achieving high breakdown voltage capabilities exceeding 1900 V. Two device configurations, differing in a-IGZO channel thickness (30 nm / 10 nm), are fabricated and evaluated. Sample B, with a 10 nm a-IGZO channel, demonstrates superior electrical performance, including a high ON/OFF current ratio (~10^7), low subthreshold swing (SS), and a high breakdown voltage exceeding 1900 V comparable to standalone GaN power HEMTs. The results highlight the feasibility and potential of 3D integrated TFT on GaN power HEMTs, paving the way for new opportunities for the TFTs for high voltage applications.</description>

      <title>3D Atomic-Scale Metrology of Strain Relaxation and Roughness in Gate-All-Around (GAA) Transistors via Electron Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To improve transistor density and electronic performance, next-generation semiconductor devices are adopting three-dimensional architectures and feature sizes down to the few-nm regime, which require atomic-scale metrology to identify and resolve performance-limiting fabrication challenges. X-ray methods deliver three-dimensional imaging of integrated circuits but lack the spatial resolution to characterize atomic-scale features, while conventional electron microscopy offers atomic-scale imaging but limited depth information. We demonstrate how multislice electron ptychography (MEP), a computational electron microscopy technique with sub-\r{A}ngstr\"om lateral and nanometer-scale depth resolution, enables 3D imaging of buried features in devices. By performing MEP on prototype gate-all-around transistors we uncover and quantify distortions and defects at the interface of the 3D gate oxide wrapped around the channel. We find that the silicon in the 5-nm-thick channel gradually relaxes away from the interfaces, leaving only 60% of the atoms in a bulk-like structure. Quantifying the interface roughness, which was not previously possible for such small 3D structures but strongly impacts carrier mobility, we find that the top and bottom interfaces show different atomic-scale roughness profiles, reflecting their different processing conditions. By measuring 3D interface roughness simultaneously with strain relaxation and atomic-scale defects, from a single MEP dataset, we provide direct experimental values of these performance-limiting parameters needed for modeling and early fabrication optimization.</description>

      <title>Stability of rotating magnetic levitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical magnetic levitation has attracted broad interest in the realm of physics and engineering. The stability analysis of such system is of great significance for practical applications. In this work, we investigate the stable magnetic levitation of a floater magnet above a rotating magnet and copper board system. The conditions for stable levitation are analyzed through both theoretical modeling and experimental observation. This study focuses on the interplay between magnetic forces, damping effects from the copper board, and rotational dynamics. We derive the equilibrium conditions, perform stability analysis, and present phase diagrams in parametric spaces of rotation speed and damping coefficients. The theoretical predictions show qualitative agreement with experimental results, particularly in demonstrating how damping is essential for stable levitation and how the stability region depends on the geometric and magnetic parameters of the system.</description>

      <title>Monolithic interferometric modules for multi-axis coordinate positioning with sub-nanometre precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on developing, characterizing, and verifying a compact, monolithic laser interferometric assembly designed for high-precision two- and three-axis displacement measurements in coordinate positioning systems. The design targets OEM integration into advanced precision motion platforms, including nanometrology instruments, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. Using a single laser source, the assembly integrates multiple interferometers into a monolithic L-shaped base frame, enabling sub-nanometer periodic error in X-Y motion systems while minimizing geometric and thermal instabilities. The pre-aligned and pre-adjusted architecture simplifies integration, enhances long-term stability, and ensures consistent metrological performance. The system's verification protocol employs quadrature phase analysis and systematic error metrics to characterize performance and optimise assembly. The results indicate sub-nanometer measurement capability and suggest the system's suitability for scalable implementation in advanced coordinate metrology applications.</description>

      <title>Measuring vacancy-type defect density in monolayer MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are being widely researched for their interesting electronic properties. Their optoelectronic, mechanical and thermal properties can be finely modulated using a variety of methods, including strain, passivation, doping, and tuning of defect density. However, measuring defect densities, such as those associated with vacancy-type point defects, is inherently very difficult in atomically thin materials. Here we show that helium atom micro-diffraction can be used to measure defect density in ~15x20$\mu$m monolayer MoS$_2$, a prototypical 2D semiconductor, quickly and easily compared to standard methods. We present a simple analytic model, the lattice gas equation, that fully captures the relationship between atomic Bragg diffraction intensity and defect density. The model, combined with ab initio scattering calculations, shows that our technique can immediately be applied to a wide range of 2D materials, independent of sample chemistry or structure. Additionally, favourable signal scaling with lateral resolution makes wafer-scale characterisation immediately possible.</description>

      <title>Acoustic resonators above 100 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Piezoelectric resonators are a common building block for signal processing because of their miniature size, low insertion loss, and high quality factor. As consumer electronics push to millimeter waves frequencies, designers must increase the operating frequency of the resonator. The current state-of-the-art approach to increase the operating frequency is to decrease the thickness of the piezoelectric film to shorten the acoustic wavelength or to use higher order modes. Unfortunately, maintaining high crystal quality typically requires thicker piezoelectric layers. Thinner layers suffer from higher defect densities and increased surface damping, which degrade the electromechanical coupling and quality factor. While acoustic high order modes can also increase operating frequency, the electromechanical coupling rapidly decreases with increasing mode number. Here, we overcome these limitations by utilizing a piezoelectric stack of three layers of lithium niobate with alternating crystallographic orientations to preferentially support higher order modes and thereby enhance the electromechanical coupling without degrading the quality factor. Our approach improves the figure of merit of millimeter-wave acoustic resonators by roughly an order of magnitude greater compared to state-of-the-art piezoelectric resonators above 60 GHz. This concept of alternating crystallographic orientations facilitates a new path to develop millimeter wave resonators with high figures of merit, low insertion loss, and miniature footprints, enabling new applications in millimeter wave signal processing and computing.</description>

      <title>Beyond-Diagonal Dynamic Metasurface Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are an emerging technology for next-generation wireless base stations, distinguished by hybrid analog/digital beamforming capabilities with low hardware complexity. However, the intrinsic coupling between meta-atoms is fixed by static waveguide or cavity structures in existing DMAs, which fundamentally constrains the achievable performance. Here, we introduce reconfigurable intrinsic coupling mechanisms between meta-atoms, yielding finer control over the DMA's analog signal processing capabilities. This novel hardware is coined "beyond-diagonal DMA" (BD-DMA), in line with established BD-RIS terminology. Considering realistic hardware constraints, we derive a physics-consistent system model revealing (correlated) "beyond-diagonal" programmability. We also present an equivalent formulation with (uncorrelated) "diagonal" programmability. Based on the latter, we propose a general and efficient mutual-coupling-aware optimization algorithm. Physics-consistent simulations validate the performance enhancement enabled by reconfigurable intrinsic coupling mechanisms in BD-DMAs. The BD-DMA benefits grow with the mutual coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Tri-band Aperture-shared Antenna Array Using Scalable FSS-based Electromagnetic Transparent Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a tri-band aperture-shared array (TBA), the low-band (LB) dipole often deteriorates the radiation patterns of the middle-band (MB) and high-band (HB) antennas due to shielding effects. To address this issue, a novel dual-band electromagnetic transparent structure (DBTS) is firstly proposed and used to realize a TBA. The DBTS achieves two tunable electromagnetic transparent frequency bands by periodically loading capacitive patches and meander lines to an inductive strip. Meanwhile, the DBTS features flexible frequency band scalability by loading additional serial L-C tanks. Then the DBTS is utilized to construct the LB dipole of a TBA, with its electromagnetic transparent bands allocated at MB and HB simultaneously. The proposed array realizes an aperture-shared operation within the frequency ranges covering 0.65-0.88 GHz (LB), 1.92-2.18 GHz (MB) and 3.3-3.8 GHz (HB). The LB dipole induces minimal shielding to the MB and HB antennas, resulting in their restored radiation performance with broadside gain deviation of less than 0.6 dB.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity Predictions with Foundation Atomistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00755v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in machine learning have led to the development of foundation models for atomistic materials chemistry, enabling quantum-accurate descriptions of interatomic forces across chemically diverse compounds at reduced computational cost. Hitherto, the accuracy and utility of these models have been assessed relying on descriptors based on formation energies or idealized harmonic atomic vibrations. Yet, the rigorous and physically interpretable quantification of their capability to describe both realistic anharmonic atomic dynamics and technologically relevant observables remains a pressing problem. Here, we address this problem, leveraging the Wigner formulation of heat transport and the Gr\"uneisen approach to thermal expansion to connect the atomic-physics awareness of foundation models to their utility in predicting experimentally observable thermomechanical properties, presenting standards and fine-tuning protocols needed to achieve first-principles accuracy. We apply our framework to a database of 103 solids with diverse compositions and structures, demonstrating that it overcomes the major bottlenecks of current methods for designing heat-management materials -- high cost, limited transferability, or lack of physics awareness -- and its potential to discover materials for next-gen technologies ranging from thermal insulation to neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Path entanglement is an essential resource for photonic quantum information processing, including in quantum computing, quantum communication and quantum sensing. In this work, we experimentally study the generation and verification of bipartite path-entangled states using single photons produced by a nitrogen-vacancy center within a nanodiamond. We perform a range of measurements to characterize the photons being generated and verify the presence of path entanglement. The experiment is performed using continuous-wave laser excitation and a novel state generation 'time-window' method. This approach to path entanglement verification is different to previous work as it does not make use of a pulsed laser excitation source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A viscosity-sensitive monomer consisting of a methacrylate-functionalized julolidone-based molecular rotor (MECVJ) was synthesized and used to obtain viscosity-sensitive polymers (poly(DMA-\textit{s}-MECVJ)). The qualitative properties of the molecular rotor were preserved after its inclusion in the new polymer, in particular the effect of the viscosity of the surrounding medium on the fluorescence lifetime of the rotor. By grafting these polymers onto glass slides, viscosity-sensitive surfaces were obtained, showing good robustness in time after successive use and washing. As proof of concept, these surfaces were used to assemble a microfluidic chip capable of mapping viscosity of fluids flowing inside the channel.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear skin effect regime when a radio frequency electromagnetic field penetrates into a background plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03508v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional, electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations are employed to study particle kinetics and power deposition in the skin layer when a Radio Frequency (RF) electromagnetic field penetrates into a background plasma. We identify a new regime at low frequency ($\sim\mathrm{MHz}$) and low pressure, where the motion of electrons can be highly nonlinear in the skin region. Through most of the RF cycle, the electrons are trapped in the effective potential formed by the vector and electrostatic potentials, with energy deposition being small and magnetic moment $\mu$ no longer being an adiabatic invariant. However, for a brief period around the null of the oscillating magnetic field, the electrons get detrapped, causing a jet-like current penetrating into the bulk plasma. During these brief periods, the power deposition becomes high, exhibiting a periodic burst nature. Based on kinetic theory, we provide analytical expressions for the plasma current and energy deposition in the new regime. A criterion for transition between the newly identified low-frequency, periodic-burst regime and the usual anomalous non-local skin effect regime is proposed and verified.</description>

      <title>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11541v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures provide electric field localization to be used as a fluorescence enhancement tool for the closely located fluorophores. However, metallic structures exhibit non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which suppresses the boost in the photoluminescence spectrum due to inhomogeneous medium. Compensation to non-radiative losses is fundamentally restricted, therefore defining the critical interparticle distances, where the fluorescence enhancement is detectable hold utmost importance for device applications. In this work, we numerically identified the critical interparticle distances of a metal nanoparticle (MNP) and quantum emitters (QEs) with angstrom resolution by analyzing the interplay between quantum yield and non-radiative decay. By engaging a collimated light application on silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance, we simulated an active fluorescence enhancement switch yielding observable 7-fold increase in fluorescence intensity. The provided free space simulation includes the complete response of AgNP with retardation and higher order multi-polar effects for which the previous analytical works fall short. While the model bridges the absorption and emission spectra via corresponding Stokes shift values and presents a general approach for the interaction of QEs and MNPs in Rayleigh regime, it can be extended to Mie regime for larger QEs and can be modified for dielectric device environment.</description>

      <title>Open quantum systems with particle and bath driven by time-dependent fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a generalized quantum Langevin equation and its fluctuation-dissipation relation describing the quantum dynamics of a tagged particle interacting with a medium (environment), where both the particle and the environment are driven by an external time-dependent (e.g. oscillating) field. We specialize on the case of a charged tagged particle interacting with a bath of charged oscillators, under an external AC electric field, although the results are much more general and can be applied to any type of external time-dependent fields. We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation, which obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) where the AC field plays an explicit role. The modified FDR is non-Markovian even if the undriven particle-bath system is Markovian without the external field. We provide an illustration of the usefulness of these results and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the voltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite frequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response of the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the GHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies. This generalized quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation for driven systems can also find other applications ranging from quantum noise in quantum optics to quantum computing with trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of charge states at the surface of a ferroelectric nanoparticle in a liquid crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The liquid crystal with suspended ferroelectric nanoparticles is an interesting object for fundamental research of the long-range dipole-dipole interactions; as well as it is promising for optical, optoelectronic and electrochemical applications. Such suspensions can serve as basic elements for advanced nonvolatile memory cells and energy storage devices. The work studies the cells filled with a nematic liquid crystal 5CB and the cells containing 5CB with 0.5 wt.% and 1 wt.% of BaTiO3 nanoparticles with an average size of 24 nm. We analyzed the time dependences of the current flowing through the cells at constant applied voltage and the voltage dynamics in the no-load mode. The time dependences of the current and voltage show a slowing down decay rate. For the cells with BaTiO3 nanoparticles, the decrease in the decay time is characteristic. A possible physical reason for the retarding decay time rate is the indirect effect of screening charges, which cover ferroelectric nanoparticles, and slow ionic transport in the liquid crystal. To explain the dynamics of current and voltage, the finite element modeling of the polarization distribution, domain structure dynamics, and charge state of nanoparticles in a liquid crystal is performed using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach. Theoretical results confirmed the leading role of screening charges, because the surface of a ferroelectric nanoparticle adsorbs an ionic-electronic charge that partially screens its spontaneous polarization in single-domain and/or poly-domain states. When an electric field is applied to the liquid crystal with nanoparticles, it can release part of the screening charge (mainly due to the change in the polarization of the nanoparticle), which will lead to a decrease in decay time rate of the current and voltage dependences.</description>
