      <title>Most Hot Jupiters Were Cool Giant Planets for More Than 1 Gyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of hot Jupiters is the oldest problem in exoplanet astrophysics. Hot Jupiters formed in situ or via disk migration should be in place just a few Myr after the formation of their host stars. On the other hand, hot Jupiters formed via eccentricity excitation and tidal damping as a result of planet--planet scattering or Kozai-Lidov oscillations may take 1 Gyr or more to arrive at their observed locations. We propose that the relative ages of hot Jupiters inside, near, and outside the bias-corrected peak of the observed hot Jupiter period distribution can be used to distinguish between these possibilities. Though the lack of precise and accurate age inferences for isolated hot Jupiter host stars makes this test difficult to implement, comparisons between the Galactic velocity dispersions of the hot Jupiter subpopulations enable this investigation. To transform relative age offsets into absolute age offsets, we calibrate the monotonically increasing solar neighborhood age--velocity dispersion relation using an all-sky sample of subgiants with precise ages and a metallicity distribution matched to that of hot Jupiter hosts. We find that the inside-peak and near-peak subpopulations are older than the outside-peak subpopulation, with the inside-peak subpopulation slightly older than the near-peak subpopulation. We conclude that at least 40\% but not more than 70\% of the hot Jupiter population must have formed via a late-time, peak-populating process like high-eccentricity migration that typically occurs more than 1.5 Gyr after system formation.</description>

      <title>Decameter-sized Earth Impactors -- II: A Bayesian Inference Approach to Meteoroid Ablation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small asteroids and large meteoroids frequently impact the Earth, though their physical and material properties remain poorly understood. When observed as fireballs in Earth's atmosphere, these properties can be inferred from their ablation and fragmentation behavior. The 2022 release of previously classified United States Government (USG) satellite sensor data has provided hundreds of new fireball light curves, allowing for more detailed analysis. Here we present a new Bayesian inference method based on dynamic nested sampling that can robustly estimate these objects' physical parameters from their observed light curves, starting from relatively uninformative, flat priors. We validate our method against seven USG sensor-observed fireballs with independent ground-based observations and demonstrate that our results are consistent with previous estimates. We then apply our technique to $13$ decameter-size Earth impactors to conduct the most detailed population-level study of their structure and material strength to date. We identify three structurally distinct groups within the decameter impactors. The first group are primarily structurally homogeneous, weak objects which catastrophically disrupt below $\sim1.5$ MPa. The second group are heterogeneous objects which progressively fragment starting from $\sim1$ MPa typically up to $\sim3-8$ MPa. The third group are strong aggregates which remain mostly intact until $9-10$ MPa. Our results also suggest that decameter-size asteroids fragment in two distinct phases: an initial phase at $\sim0.04-0.09$ MPa and a second at $\sim1-4$ MPa. While decimeter- to meter-size objects typically lose most of their mass in the initial phase, larger decameter-size objects instead lose most of their mass in the second phase.</description>

      <title>Inferring Meteoroid Properties with Dynamic Nested Sampling: A Case Study of Orionid and Capricornid Shower Meteors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of meteoroid bulk density is crucial for assessing spacecraft impact hazards from sub-millimeter to millimeter-sized meteoroids. Previous studies often used manual tuning or optimization methods to fit ablation and fragmentation models to optical meteor data, but subjective choices made physical properties and uncertainties difficult to compare. We develop a global, statistically robust method that uses Dynamic Nested Sampling to fit an erosion-fragmentation model to meteor light curves and deceleration measured by the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory (CAMO) mirror tracking system and Electron-Multiplied CCD (EMCCD) cameras. Applied to 15 shower meteors, the method returns posterior distributions and Bayesian evidences for single- and double-fragmentation scenarios. Tests on four synthetic cases recover the known inputs, with best-guess solutions matching the true parameters. For 9 Orionids and 6 Alpha Capricornids with masses 1e-6 to 1e-5 kg, the median bulk density is 159 (+558/-57) kg/m3 for Orionids and 333 (+1089/-114) kg/m3 for Alpha Capricornids. Orionids are consistent with low-density cometary material, while Alpha Capricornids are systematically denser and show a second density cluster near 1300 kg/m3, consistent with higher-density asteroidal material. This framework enables automated, statistically rigorous characterization of meteoroid properties and will be extended to larger samples of shower and sporadic meteors across orbital classes.</description>

      <title>ExoMiner++ 2.0: Vetting TESS Full-Frame Image Transit Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Full-Frame Images (FFIs) provide photometric time series for millions of stars, enabling transit searches beyond the limited set of pre-selected 2-minute targets. However, FFIs present additional challenges for transit identification and vetting. In this work, we apply ExoMiner++ 2.0, an adaptation of the ExoMiner++ framework originally developed for TESS 2-minute data, to FFI light curves. The model is used to perform large-scale planet versus non-planet classification of Threshold Crossing Events across the sectors analyzed in this study. We construct a uniform vetting catalog of all evaluated signals and assess model performance under different observing conditions. We find that ExoMiner++ 2.0 generalizes effectively to the FFI domain, providing robust discrimination between planetary signals, astrophysical false positives, and instrumental artifacts despite the limitations inherent to longer cadence data. This work extends the applicability of ExoMiner++ to the full TESS dataset and supports future population studies and follow-up prioritization.</description>

      <title>How a Close-in Planet Protects its White Dwarf Host from Pollution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximately 25-50% of white dwarfs (WDs) exhibit metal absorption lines in their photospheres, which are attributed to accretion from their remnant planetary systems. Although white dwarfs with detected planetary systems are more likely to show photospheric pollution, one notable exception - WD 1856+534 - hosts a close-in giant planet yet exhibits no detectable photospheric metal pollution. Previous studies have proposed that massive, close-in planets can block inward transport of small particles driven by radiative forces (e.g., Poynting-Robertson drag and the Yarkovsky effect). However, it remains unclear whether the close-in planet can similarly prevent delivery of larger bodies via dynamical interactions. We aim to quantify the protective influence of close-in planets on white-dwarf pollution by asteroids approaching on near-parabolic orbits, and to explore the planetary masses and orbital separations required to provide effective protection. We perform ensembles of short-term N-body integrations, sampling a range of planet masses and orbital separations and initializing asteroids on highly eccentric orbits with periapses near the WD Roche radius, in order to measure scattering, capture, and ejection outcomes and quantify the planet's shielding efficiency. For WD1856+534b-like configurations (a_p = 0.02 au), giant planets with masses greater than 0.5 Jupiter masses are sufficient to clear over 80% of highly eccentric small-body contaminants. The effectiveness of the protective effect diminishes with decreasing planetary mass and increasing semi-major axis. These findings help explain why some white dwarfs that host close-in giant planets do not show the photospheric metal pollution commonly observed in other systems.</description>

      <title>A study of the high-inclination population in the Kuiper belt -- V. Mean motion resonances beyond 50 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the most comprehensive study to date on Neptune's mean-motion resonances (MMRs) in the distant Kuiper belt from 50 to 100 AU. Over 200 resonant Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) have been identified in this region, spanning resonances from the 2nd-order 1:3 MMR to the 22nd-order 7:29 MMR, with inclinations $i&lt;40^\circ$. Building on these diverse distributions, we first analyse the dynamical features of numerous $m$:$n$ MMRs, providing an informative database that includes the possible eccentricity ($e$) range, resonance widths, resonance centres, and permissible $(e,i)$ distributions. We then conduct numerical simulations to explore the long-term stability of these MMRs. Our results show that: (1) resonators can occupy all 1:$n$ to 7:$n$ MMRs, with nearly any $n$ corresponding to the 50-100 AU region, including the farthest-out MMRs of 5:29 (24th-order), 6:35 (29th-order), and 7:40 (33rd-order). This suggests that KBOs could potentially exist in even higher-order MMRs than those currently observed. (2) For each set of $m$:$n$ resonances with the same $m$, resonators consistently exhibit inclinations up to $40^\circ$, while eccentricities remain strictly restricted below 0.7. (3) For the 1:3 and 1:4 MMRs, the leading population is less stable than the trailing population. Most interestingly, we discover a novel phenomenon of number reversal, where the higher-order, weaker 3:8 MMR (at semimajor axis $a\approx57.9$ AU) hosts more resonators, rather than fewer as expected, compared to the lower-order, stronger 3:7 MMR (at $a\approx53.0$ AU). Future observations, whether confirming or challenging this phenomenon, will offer valuable insight into the eccentricity and inclination distributions of primordial KBOs.</description>

      <title>A Theory of transmission spectroscopy of planetary winds: Spectral-line saturation and limits on mass-loss inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy is a key technique in the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres and has been widely applied to planets undergoing hydrodynamic escape. While a robust analytic theory exists for transmission spectra of hydrostatic atmospheres, the corresponding interpretation for escaping atmospheres has so far relied on numerical modeling. In this work, we develop a theory of transmission spectroscopy in hydrodynamically escaping atmospheres by coupling the standard transmission geometry to a steady-state, spherically symmetric, isothermal outflow. This approach yields closed-form expressions and allows the optical depth inversion problem to be examined. The analytic solution reveals that transmission spectroscopy of planetary winds naturally separates into two regimes. In an opacity-limited regime, transmission depths retain sensitivity to the atmospheric mass-loss rate. Beyond a critical threshold, however, spectral-line cores become saturated and no longer provide a unique constraint on the mass flux. This transition is marked by a sharp analytic boundary of the form $\sigma(\lambda)\times \dot M \le C_{sat}$, where $C_{sat}$ is a constant set by the thermodynamic and geometric properties of the wind. This condition specifies when the inversion between transmission depth and mass-loss rate admits a real solution. Once it is violated, the effective transit radius is no longer controlled by opacity or mass loss, but by the geometric extent of the absorbing wind. These results demonstrate that spectral-line saturation in transmission spectroscopy corresponds to a fundamental loss of invertibility between absorption and atmospheric mass loss, rather than a gradual weakening of sensitivity. The theory provides a physically transparent explanation for why strong transmission line cores often fail to constrain mass-loss rates, while weaker lines and line wings remain diagnostic.</description>

      <title>A nomenclature for individual exocomets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With recent observational advancements, exocomet studies have entered a new era: we have moved from an epoch where exocomets' signatures were analysed to identify their true nature to a new epoch where individual exocomets' detections are studied in detail to characterise the observed bodies. In this context, as with other astronomical objects such as exoplanets and minor bodies in the solar system, a nomenclature system is needed to uniquely identify any observed exocometary body. Here, after outlining the purpose of a nomenclature and its required characteristics, we review the information on exocomets that can be included in the nomenclature. Finally, we propose an exocomet nomenclature scheme to identify the individual exocomets that have been discovered or yet to be discovered. Examples of nomenclature names of a few archetypal exocomets are provided.</description>

      <title>Alkali recondensation into chondrules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While sub-mm melt droplets should rapidly lose alkali elements in a vacuum at liquidus temperatures, chondrules are only modestly depleted in them (by less than one order of magnitude). The detection of sodium in olivine cores has previously suggested very high saturating partial pressures of gaseous sodium, but we show that alkalis were lost during heating and recondensed at lower temperatures, essentially in the present-day chondrule mesostases. This recondensation was accompanied by mass-dependent enrichment in light isotopes (for multi-isotope alkalis such as K and Rb), but its limited extent indicates a cooling acceleration (or "quenching"). The isotopic fractionation also constrains the ratio of the chondrule density and the cooling rate prior to the quench around $10^{-6}\:\mathrm{kg.m^{-3}.K^{-1}.h}$ suggesting densities above $\sim 10^{-6}\:\mathrm{kg/m^3}$. In a nebular context, this is achievable by radial and vertical concentrations near pressure bumps.</description>

      <title>Transit distances and composition of low-velocity exocomets in the $\beta$ Pic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\beta$ Pictoris is a young nearby A5V star, about 20 Myr old, embedded in a prominent debris disc. For the past 40 years, variable absorption features have been observed in the stellar spectrum, produced by the gaseous tails of exocomets transiting the star. Yet, despite the large number of observations available, the origin and dynamical evolution of the exocomets remain poorly understood. Here we present new spectroscopic observations of $\beta$ Pic, obtained on April 29, 2025, with the Hubble Space Telescope and the HARPS spectrograph. We report the detection of three strong exocomet signatures at low radial velocities (-7.5, +2.5 and +10 km/s), in a large set of lines from various species and excitation levels. We show that the three exocometary tails have different excitation states, indicating that they are located at different distances from the star. Using a detailed modelling of the excitation state of the transiting gas, which includes both radiative and collisional excitation, we derive the transit distance of the three exocometary gaseous tails to be $0.88 \pm 0.08$, $4.7 \pm 0.3$, and $1.52 \pm 0.15$ au. These values are much larger than previous estimates, which generally placed the transient features within 0.2 au. This reveals that gaseous tails produced by exocomets sublimating close to the star can expand and migrate over large distances, while still remaining detectable in absorption spectroscopy. Our study provides a new method to measure the transit distance of exocomets, based on excitation modelling, complementing the acceleration method only applicable for high-velocity objects.</description>

      <title>The Circumbinary Disk of HD 34700A: I. CO gas kinematics indicate spirals, infall, and vortex motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first high-resolution ($\sim$ 0.14") Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 dust continuum and CO molecular line emission observations of the quadruple system HD 34700. In particular, HD 34700AaAb is a spectroscopic binary ($M_{\rm{bin}}=4\,M_\odot$) surrounded by two low-mass companions at large separations. Its circumbinary disk is highly substructured, featuring numerous spiral arms and a large cavity observed in infrared (IR) scattered light. We analyzed the CO line channel and intensity moment maps. By fitting a Keplerian model to the line channel emission, we identified the residual motions and conducted a line spectra analysis. We resolved an asymmetric continuum crescent on top of a dust ring at 0.39" (138 au), colocated with the IR ring. The CO molecule line emissions trace a smaller cavity in gas, whose edge aligns with the inner rim of the ring detected in H$\alpha$ emission at 0.20" (65 au). The $^{12}$CO line emission and kinematics trace highly non-Keplerian motions ($\sim0.1\Delta\upsilon_{\rm kep}$), and these CO spiral features align well with the spiral structures in scattered light. The $^{12}$CO line spectra analysis reveals a streamer above the southeastern disk plane, likely falling onto the disk. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O kinematics largely follow the disk's underlying Keplerian rotation, while $^{13}$CO exhibits tentative signs of anticyclonic vortex flows at the continuum crescent location. Our multimolecular line study suggests that the circumbinary disk of HD 34700A is highly perturbed in its upper layers, possibly warped and influenced by infalling material. While late-stage infall may account for the IR spirals and the formation of the vortex through Rossby wave instability, an embedded massive companion within the cavity may also contribute to these features.</description>

      <title>A radially broad collisional cascade in the debris disk of $\gamma$ Ophiuchi observed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The A1V star $\gamma$ Oph, at a distance of 29.7 pc, is known from Spitzer imaging to host a debris disk with a large radial extent and from its spectral energy distribution to host inner warm dust. We imaged $\gamma$ Oph with JWST/MIRI at 15 and 25.5 microns, which reveal smooth and radially broad emission that extends to a radius of at least 250 au at 25.5 microns. In contrast to JWST findings of an inner small-grain component with distinct ringed substructures in Fomalhaut and Vega, the mid-infrared radial profile combined with prior ALMA imaging suggests a radially broad steady-state collisional cascade with the same grain size distribution throughout the disk. This further suggests that the system is populated by a radially broad planetesimal belt from tens of au or less to well over 200 au, rather than a narrow planetesimal belt from which the observed dust is displaced to appear broad. The disk is also found to be asymmetric, which could be modelled by a stellocentric offset corresponding to a small eccentricity of $\sim$0.02. Such a disk eccentricity could be induced by a mildly eccentric $&lt;$$10\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$ giant planet outside 10 au, or a more eccentric companion up to stellar mass at a few au, without producing a resolvable radial gap in the disk.</description>

Abstract: Ten high resolution Fourier transform spectra of the pentad region near 3.3 {\mu}m of methane diluted in carbon dioxide at total pressures up to 800 hPa have been recorded at 296.5(5) K. Including a high resolution spectrum of pure methane at low pressure, these spectra have been analyzed using multi-spectrum fitting techniques. The methane lines were modeled using hard-collision speed-dependent line profiles and line mixing was included in the strongest absorption regions, considering the first order Rosenkranz approximation and the relaxation matrix formalism. CO$_2$ broadening and shift coefficients have been measured, together with the speed dependence of broadening. Results obtained using the two line mixing models are intercompared and compared with previous work.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Radial Velocities from the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations and Implications for Astrometric Acceleration Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometry from the Gaia satellite and from the long-term combination of Hipparcos and Gaia are now sensitive to sky-plane accelerations as low as $\approx$1 m/s/yr. This paper quantifies and explores an important caveat: apparent nonlinear motion due to a star's nonzero radial velocity can be indistinguishable from real astrometric acceleration. This nonlinear motion is parallel to the proper motion, so it can be both quantified and avoided by projecting apparent astrometric accelerations into components parallel and perpendicular to the proper motion. We illustrate this distinction for a sample of very nearby, fast-moving stars from the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations (HGCA). We then generalize the effect of stellar radial velocity and projections of the astrometric acceleration to binary stars in which we observe the acceleration of both components. Finally, we demonstrate that the proper motion differences in the HGCA are statistically well-behaved even for the nearest and fastest-moving stars, at least in the component perpendicular to the proper motion. This distinction -- between astrometric acceleration parallel and perpendicular to proper motion -- could have important consequences for future missions reaching extreme astrometric sensitivities around nearby stars.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Statistical Relations Between Projected Separation, Semimajor Axis, Companion Mass, and Host Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I derive the statistical relationship between a radial velocity or astrometric acceleration (a trend), a companion's mass, and the projected separation of the companion. These relationships, expressed as probability density functions, are analytic and independent of all Keplerian orbital elements so long as orbits are randomly oriented in space. I also derive a closed-form expression for the probability distribution of the ratio of the projected separation to the semimajor axis at fixed eccentricity. This expression can be numerically integrated over eccentricity for an arbitrary distribution of eccentricities. I verify my results with empirical comparisons to equivalent but more complex expressions in the literature based on the equations of Keplerian orbits. The closed-formed expressions derived here would be especially useful for any calculation that requires derivatives, e.g., Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. I also provide a Jupyter notebook including all figures and calculations.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of multiple solar flare induced modulation of Very Low Frequency (VLF) diurnal profile</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth's ionosphere is a perpetual detector of ionizing radiation received from celestial objects, particularly the Sun. Solar ionizing radiation in the form of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-rays during both quiet and active phase of the Sun, and charged particles associated with a solar wind imprint their ionization signatures on the ionosphere. Although due to the bipolar nature of the geomagnetic field, the events, such as the solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and associated solar wind enhancement, usually disturb the polar ionosphere only, the UV and X-rays from the solar flares produce sudden ionospheric disturbances (SIDs) in low-mid-latitude part of the earth's ionosphere. Such ionospheric disturbances are studied with the help of the influence they exert on radio waves propagating through earth-ionosphere waveguide. For the lower part of the ionosphere, called the D region, prominent modification in electron-ion density during solar flares can be observed via deviation in earth bound Very Low Frequency (VLF) wave signal from its ambient diurnal profile. In earlier work, successful model of the deviation in VLF amplitude due to different classes of solar flares was formulated. There, calculation of rate of ionization with Monte Carlo simulation and ion-chemistry evaluation of plasma density enhancement followed by a radio propagation simulation was used. Presently, we attempt to numerically reconstruct the modulation in VLF signal from its diurnal pattern produced by multiple solar flares occurring over a single day. Successful reconstruction of the VLF signal modulation for such a complex flaring scenario points to the accuracy of our understanding of the ionization effect due to solar activity on the lower ionosphere, and strengthen our claim to use earth's ionosphere as a high energy space transient event detector.</description>

      <title>Comparative biosignatures with systemic retrievals</title>

Abstract: The discovery of inhabited exoplanets hinges on identifying biosignature gases. JWST can reveal biosignature gases, though current discoveries have yet to evidence life. The central challenge is attribution: how can we confidently identify biogenic sources while ruling out, or deeming unlikely, abiotic explanations? Attribution is particularly difficult for individual planets, especially given the stochastic abiotic processes that can set atmospheric conditions. To address this, we propose a comparative multi-planet approach centred on systemic retrievals: the analysis of multiple planets within a system to empirically define the `abiotic baseline'. This baseline, constructed from obligate uninhabited planets, serves as a local reference point. Systemic retrievals enable marginalisation over inaccessible, latent, shared abiotic parameters within planet evolution models. This is possible because planets within a system are linked by their birth in the same natal disk, have been irradiated by the same evolving star, and have a linked dynamical history. Observations aligning with the abiotic baseline, where the locally-informed abiotic planet evolution models demonstrate high out-of-sample predictive accuracy, are likely non-biological. Potentially biological anomalies are identified as statistical outliers from the abiotic baseline using Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation. A comparative biosignature is thus defined: an anomaly where a biotic planetary evolution model provides a superior fit than its abiotic counterpart. Where both abiotic and biotic models yield poor predictive accuracy, the anomaly is flagged as an ``unknown unknown"; a signature of either unconstrained abiotic processes, or life as we don't yet know it.</description>

      <title>Silane-Methane Competition in Sub-Neptune Atmospheres as a Diagnostic of Metallicity and Magma Oceans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope is characterising the atmospheres of sub-Neptunes. The presence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes is expected to strongly alter the chemistry of their envelopes and observable atmospheres. At the magma ocean-envelope boundary (MEB, $&gt;$10 kbar), gas properties deviate from ideality, yet the effects of real gas behaviour on chemical equilibria remain underexplored. Here, we compute equilibrium between magma-gas and gas-gas reactions using real gas equations of state in the H-He-C-N-O-Si system for TOI-421b, a canonical hot sub-Neptune potentially hosting a magma ocean. We find that H and N are the most soluble in magma, followed by He and C. We fit real gas equations of state to experimental data on SiH$_4$, and show that, for a fully molten mantle, SiH$_4$ dominates at the MEB under accreted gas metallicity of 1$\times$ solar, but is supplanted by CH$_4$ at 100$\times$ solar. Lower mantle melt fractions lower both magma-derived Si abundances in the envelope and the solubility of H and He in magma, yielding H$_2$- and He-rich envelopes. Projecting equilibrium chemistry through the observable atmosphere (1 mbar-100 bar), we find that `clouds' of Si-bearing condensates strongly deplete Si-bearing gases, although SiH$_4$ remains key, especially when a solar gas is accreted. SiH$_4$/CH$_4$ and Si/C ratios increase with mantle melt fraction and decrease with accreted gas metallicity. The competition between SiH$_4$ and CH$_4$ is therefore diagnostic of metallicity and presence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes with equilibrium temperatures below 1000 K. The corollary is that H$_2$- and He-rich, SiH$_4$-deficient and CH$_4$-bearing observable atmospheres may indicate a limited role or absence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical tide modified Roche limit in eccentric, asynchronous binaries</title>

Abstract: The Roche limit, or the threshold separation within which a celestial object (the donor) M cannot remain in a stable configuration due to a companion's tidal field, has been well established when M is in hydrostatic equilibrium and has synchronous rotation in a circular orbit. However, limited analyses exist considering corrections to the Roche limit due to hydrodynamical effects. We fill in the gap by providing a general theoretical framework involving nonlinear hydrodynamics. We consider both exact nonlinear equations derived from an affine model describing incompressible ellipsoids and series-expanded ones that can be calculated for realistic stars and planets. Our formulation addresses the Roche problem in generic orbits and synchronization levels of M, and fully accounts for the history-dependent hydrodynamical effects. We show that as the orbital eccentricity increases, fluid instability is more likely to develop at the pericenter due to the increased dynamical tide that accumulates over multiple orbits. When M moves in a highly eccentric orbit (with eccentricity around 0.9) and the damping of the fluid is small, the threshold pericenter separation at which mass loss from M can occur can be at least 30% higher than the value predicted for a circular orbit with hydrostatic equilibrium. If only a single passage is considered, however, the threshold separation is 20% smaller than the static limit. The nonlinear interaction at each pericenter passage can also trigger a chaotic fluid evolution inside M even with moderate eccentricities, complementing previous studies of chaotic tides caused by random propagation phases. Our work has broad implications for interacting binaries in eccentric orbits, including migrating gaseous exoplanets, repeated partial tidal disruption events, and more.</description>

      <title>Observation of an Accreting Planetary-Mass Companion with Signs of Disk-Disk Interaction in Orion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Young ($\lesssim 10$ Myr) planetary-mass companions (PMCs) provide valuable insights into the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. To date, only a dozen such objects have been identified through direct imaging. Using JWST/NIRCam observations towards the Orion Nebula, obtained as part of the \textit{PDRs4All} Early Release Science program, we have identified a faint point source near the M-type star V2376 Ori. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the MUSE instrument on the VLT confirm that the source, V2376 Ori b, is indeed a young planetary-mass companion. It is a member of Orion D, around 80\,pc in the foreground of the Trapezium cluster of Orion and with an age of approximately $7 \pm 3$ Myr. We fit the SED of V2376 Ori b to infer a mass of $ \sim 20~M_{\rm Jup}$. The MUSE spectrum reveals several accretion tracers. Based on the H$\alpha$ line intensity, we estimate an accretion rate of $\sim$10$^{-6.5 \pm 0.7}~\rm M_{Jup}\,yr^{-1}$, which is comparable to that of young PMCs such as PDS~70b. In addition, the MUSE data cube reveals extended emission in the [O\,\textsc{ii}] doublet at 7320 and 7330~\AA, which is interpreted as evidence of a dynamical interaction between the two sources that, potentially, involves mass transfer between their individual accretion disks. These results demonstrate that JWST/NIRCam imaging surveys of young stellar associations can uncover new PMCs, which can then be confirmed and characterized through ground-based spectroscopic follow-up.</description>

      <title>Potential Thermal Profiles of The Third Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal evolution of 3I/ATLAS, the third macroscopic interstellar object discovered on 2025 July 1. By comparing modeled thermal profiles with observations of volatile activity, it is possible to constrain bulk physical properties of a cometary nucleus. 3I/ATLAS is actively producing a variety of cometary volatiles. In this paper, we calculate one-dimensional thermal profiles of the third interstellar object 3I/ATLAS throughout its trajectory in an attempt to gain insight into its bulk properties based on measurements of its volatiles. Assuming a variety of typical comet and asteroid bulk geophysical properties such as heat capacities, densities, and conductivities, we calculate the radial thermal profile as a function of depth throughout the hyperbolic trajectory. The methods and code to generate the thermal profile are flexible for any hyperbolic or bound orbit. The thermal profiles are benchmarked to the nominal sublimation temperatures of H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CO, but are still applicable to any volatile. Comparison between the modeled surface temperatures and the observed onset of H$_2$O activity near 3 au indicates that surface temperatures exceeding $\sim$150 K can only be achieved if the albedo is below 0.2. We therefore set the upper limit on the albedo of 3I/ATLAS to be 0.2.</description>

      <title>Multi-bandpass Photometry for Exoplanet Atmosphere Reconnaissance (MPEAR) with the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) -- I. Differentiating Earth from Neptunes During Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the architecture for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is being developed, it is crucial to optimize the observing strategies for a survey to detect and characterize Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars. Efficient target identification and characterization will help drive mission requirements that can be matched to the planned observations. Current HWO concepts allow simultaneous multi-bandpass observations with the coronagraph instrument, critical for performing a qualitative planetary reconnaissance to optimize observing time for deriving orbital constraints and prioritize characterization of promising targets.
  We describe a new algorithm designed to determine the best combination of broadband photometric observations for extracting maximum information from the first visit. It identifies degeneracies in the orbital configurations, fluxes, and noise, and determines optimal secondary photometry bands to reduce these. We demonstrate its application by comparing an Earth seen at quadrature with a cold and a warm Neptune at inclined orbits and varying phases, with comparable flux in the discovery bandpass centered at 500 nm (20\% bandwidth). Using the noise and exposure time calculator that we developed for the HWO coronagraph instrument, we find that the baseline $S/N=7$ (corresponding to 3.2 hours observing time for a planet at 10pc) is only sufficient to marginally differentiate the Earth from a cold Neptune-like planet assuming two parallel bandpasses (550 nm + 850 nm). However, increasing to $S/N=15$ (7 hours observing time) and using three parallel bandpasses (360 nm + 500 nm + 1.11 micron) would differentiate the Earth from either a warm or cold Neptune.</description>

      <title>Understanding the chemistry of temperate exoplanets atmospheres through experimental and numerical simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing temperate exoplanet atmospheres remains challenging due to their small size and low temperatures. Recent JWST observations provide valuable data, but their interpretation has led to diverging conclusions. Complementary approaches combining laboratory experiments and photochemical modeling are essential for constraining atmospheric chemistry and interpreting observations. We aim to identify chemical pathways governing the formation and evolution of neutral species and to assess their sensitivity to key parameters such as C/O ratio and metallicity. Our approach combines experimental and numerical simulations on H2-rich gas mixtures representative of sub-Neptune atmospheres, spanning a wide range of CH4, CO, and CO2 mixing ratios. A cold plasma reactor simulates out-of-equilibrium upper-atmospheric chemistry. A 0D photochemical model reproduces reactor conditions, guiding interpretation of key pathways and abundance trends. We observe the formation of both reduced and oxidized organic compounds. In CH4-rich mixtures, hydrocarbons form efficiently through methane chemistry, correlating with CH4 concentration and agreeing with models. In more oxidizing environments, particularly CO2-rich mixtures, hydrocarbon formation is inhibited by complex reaction networks and oxidative losses. Oxygen incorporation enhances chemical diversity and promotes formation of oxidized organic compounds of prebiotic interest (H2CO, CH3OH, CH3CHO), especially in atmospheres containing both CH4 and CO2. Atmospheres containing CH4 and CO, which balance carbon and oxygen supply without excessive oxidative destruction, favor efficient production of hydrocarbons and oxidized compounds. Out-of-equilibrium chemistry plays a key role in the diversification and organic complexification of temperate exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Catching 3I/ATLAS Using a Solar Oberth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The third interstellar object to be discovered, 3I/ATLAS, has a unique and continually unfolding story to tell about its nature and origin as it is monitored by telescopes on Earth, orbiting Earth and around the Solar System. Previous research into missions using chemical propulsion have only really addressed the direct case, where the opportunity to launch already expired before 3I/ATLAS's discovery. In contrast, investigations herein exploit 'Optimum Interplanetary Trajectory Software' to simulate an alternative indirect option for chemical propulsion, namely the Solar Oberth Manoeuvre (SOM). For a SOM, a low perihelion burn provides maximum benefit from the Oberth Effect, and accelerates the spacecraft rapidly towards the receding 3I/ATLAS. Though in principle feasible, results indicate this option presents significant challenges. For possible launch years between 2031 and 2037 inclusive, a 2035 launch permits the most efficient transfer to 3I/ATLAS. The reference mission requires a SOM at 3.2 Solar Radii from the Sun's centre, with an intercept after 35-50 years. It is found the SOM can leverage spacecraft masses up to $\sim{500}$ kg. Two or three solid propellant boosters could deliver the required SOM $\Delta$V, and furthermore a refuelled Starship Block 3 in LEO has sufficient performance for such a mission. As inevitable with a SOM, some of the payload mass would be needed for a heat shield to protect against the high solar flux at low perihelion.</description>

Abstract: The tidal disruption of planets by their host stars represents a growing area of interest in transient astronomy, offering insights into the final stages of planetary system evolution. We model the hydrodynamic evolution and predict the multi-wavelength observational signatures of planetary TDEs around a solar-mass host, focusing on Jupiter-like and Neptune-like progenitors and examining how different eccentricities of the planet's pre-disruption orbit shape the morphology and emission of the tidal debris. We perform 2D hydrodynamic simulations using the FARGO3D code to model the formation and viscous evolution of the resulting debris disk. We employ a viscous alpha-disk prescription and include a time-dependent energy equation to compute the disk's effective temperature and subsequently derive the bolometric and multi-band photometric light curves. Our simulations show that planetary TDEs produce a diverse range of luminous transients. A Jupiter-like planet disrupted from a circular orbit at the Roche limit generates a transient peaking at $L_{bol} \approx 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ after a 12-day rise. In contrast, the same planet on an eccentric orbit (e=0.5) produces a transient of comparable peak luminosity but on a much shorter timescale, peaking in only 1 day and followed by a highly volatile light curve. We find that the effect of eccentricity is not universal, as it accelerates the event for Jupiter but delays it for Neptune. A robust "bluer-when-brighter" colour evolution is a common feature as the disk cools over its multi-year lifetime. The strong dependence of light curve morphology on the initial orbit and progenitor mass makes these events powerful diagnostics. This framework is crucial for identifying planetary TDEs in time-domain surveys.</description>

      <title>Studying Ionospheric Phase Structure Functions Using Wide-Band uGMRT (Band-4) Interferometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08823</link>

Abstract: Interferometric observations of the low-frequency radio sky ($&lt;$ 1~GHz) are largely limited by systematic effects introduced by the ionosphere. In this study, we use a ten-hour nighttime observation of the bright radio source 3C48, carried out with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), to examine how ionospheric conditions affect radio signals. We focus on measuring phase fluctuations caused by the ionosphere and analyse how these variations change with antenna separation using the spatial phase structure function. Our results, based on data from three sub-bands between 575 and 725~MHz, show a clear power-law trend consistent with turbulent behaviour. We introduce the diffractive scale as a scalar measure of ionospheric conditions, which could guide future calibration strategies. Furthermore, we find that the turbulence is anisotropic, with properties that vary by direction. The smallest diffractive scales do not always align with Earth's magnetic field, suggesting the influence of medium-scale Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (MSTIDs). The contribution of these wave-like MSTIDs to the structure function follows a power-law with a slope close to 2.0, indicating their dominant role in shaping the observed anisotropic phase fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Islands of Electromagnetic Tranquility in Our Galactic core and Little Red Dots that Shelter Molecules and Prebiotic Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Both the Galactic Center and little red dots (LRDs) host million-solar-mass black holes within dense, cold reservoirs of molecules associated with dust grains, and are electromagnetically tranquil. These conditions enable complex molecular chemistry and may serve as natural laboratories for prebiotic genetic evolution by allowing the synthesis of organic molecules essential for life.</description>

      <title>Enhanced detection limits in the SHINE F150 survey through the Regime Switching Model. Optimizing thresholds and investigating environmental noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-contrast imaging, a novel detection algorithm for angular differential imaging (ADI) sequences has recently been introduced: the Regime Switching Model (RSM). In this study, we apply the RSM algorithm to analyze the F150 sample from the SHINE high-contrast imaging survey carried out with VLT/SPHERE, aiming to enhance detection limits and identify new exoplanet candidates. Additionally, we investigate how environmental conditions influence post-processed noise distributions and detection thresholds. We generate detection maps and contrast curves for 213 observations in the F150 SHINE sample using the RSM algorithm. A clustering approach based on environmental parameters is used to group observations with similar noise characteristics. We propose two methods for defining radial detection thresholds in the RSM maps: fitting a log-normal distribution to the post-processed noise and maximizing the F1 score. We also assess the performance of various combinations of post-processing techniques within the RSM framework to identify optimal configurations. This study demonstrates the utility of clustering based on observational parameters, effectively distinguishing features like wind-driven halos and low-wind effects. Detection thresholds vary significantly across clusters, differing by up to a factor of 10, highlighting the importance of considering observational environments. Log-normal thresholds provide conservative, noise-aware limits, while F1 score-based thresholds offer observation-specific results, both showing compatibility overall. RSM improves detection limits by an average factor of two at 1arcsec and five at inner working angles compared to standard PCA processing. This study reports more than 30 newly detected signals, including one promising candidate awaiting second-epoch confirmation.</description>
